A spokesman for President Karzai said he was " very upset about what happened " and has been " very seriously conveying his message " to Afghan and Nato commanders of the need for restraint " again and again . "
The Sukhothai kingdom was an early kingdom in the area around the city Sukhothai , in north central Thailand .
The Kingdom existed from 1238 till 1438 .
The old capital , now 12 km outside of New Sukhothai in Tambon Mueang Kao , is in ruins and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage historical park .
The history of Sukhothai as a kingdom lasted for about two centuries .
Interestingly , there were only 9 Kings in that period , suggesting some stability .
Theravada Buddhism became the common religion .
At the peak of its power , the Kingdom of Sukhothai exerted control and / or influence over an area that is actually greater than present day Thailand .
Control supposedly stretched to Martaban ( now in Myanmar ) , Luang Prabang ( Laos ) and down the Malay Peninsula .
Sukhothai ’s prosperity was greatest at the time of its third King , Ramkhamhaeng the Great .
King Ramkhamhaeng is also credited with the design of the Thai alphabet , although there is continuing debate about this issue .
The Sukhothai Historical Park covers the ruins of Sukhothai , capital of the Sukhothai kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries in what is now the north of Thailand .
It is located near the modern city of Sukhothai , capital of the province with the same name .
The city walls form a rectangle about 2 km east - west by 1.6 km north - south .
There are 193 ruins on 70 square kilometers of land .
There is a gate in the centre of each wall .
Inside are the remains of the royal palace and twenty - six temples , the largest being Wat Mahathat .
The park is maintained by the Fine Arts Department of Thailand with help from UNESCO , which has declared it a World Heritage Site .
The park sees thousands of visitors each year , who marvel at the ancient Buddha figures , palace buildings and ruined temples .
The park is easily toured by bicycle or even on foot .
The protection of the area was first announced in the Royal Gazette on June 6 , 1962 .
In 1976 the restoration project was approved , and in July 1988 the park was officially opened .
On December 12 , 1991 , it was declared a World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Town of Sukhothai and Associated Historic Towns together with the associated historic parks in Kamphaeng Phet and Si Satchanalai .

Sarah Palin ’s turn before the teabaggers was an exercise in emptying the US Constitution of meaning while seeming to exalt it .
She praised US military personnel for defending the constitution .
But she complained that constitutional protections were offered to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the underpants bomber .
She said it is ‘ our ’ constitution , reducing it from a universal document ( the Declaration of Independence says ‘ all men ’ are endowed with inalienable rights ) to a tribal one .
She said Abdulmutallab could otherwise have been questioned .
But why should he have answered , rights or no ?
Holder ’s methods got him talking .
( Nor is it likely constitutional to arrest a lawbreaker on US soil and whisk him off to military detention . )
Then she said we need a commander in chief , not a professor of constitutional law .
But Obama is designated by the constitution as commander in chief .
Is she denying that status to him ?
And if the constitution is so great and worth dying for , why is it bad to study it systematically ?
So at every turn she invoked the constitution to undermine the constitution .
She is not about law , but is about power .
We ’ve had enough narcissistic sociopaths in politics .
And note that Jerry Brown , e.g .
Would not be put on CNN addressing 600 leftwing democrats in prime time .
I ’m afraid of Time Warner now .

Some of the Greek deals were named after figures in Greek mythology .
One of them , for instance , was called Aeolos , after the god of the winds .
The crisis in Greece poses the most significant challenge yet to Europe ’s common currency , the euro , and the Continent ’s goal of economic unity .
The country is , in the argot of banking , too big to be allowed to fail .
Greece owes the world $ 300 billion , and major banks are on the hook for much of that debt .
A default would reverberate around the globe .
A spokeswoman for the Greek finance ministry said the government had met with many banks in recent months and had not committed to any bank ’s offers .
All debt financings “ are conducted in an effort of transparency , ” she said .
Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment .
While Wall Street ’s handiwork in Europe has received little attention on this side of the Atlantic , it has been sharply criticized in Greece and in magazines like Der Spiegel in Germany .
“ Politicians want to pass the ball forward , and if a banker can show them a way to pass a problem to the future , they will fall for it , ” said Gikas A. Hardouvelis , an economist and former government official who helped write a recent report on Greece ’s accounting policies .
Wall Street did not create Europe ’s debt problem .
But bankers enabled Greece and others to borrow beyond their means , in deals that were perfectly legal .
Few rules govern how nations can borrow the money they need for expenses like the military and health care .
The market for sovereign debt  the Wall Street term for loans to governments  is as unfettered as it is vast .
“ If a government wants to cheat , it can cheat , ” said Garry Schinasi , a veteran of the International Monetary Fund ’s capital markets surveillance unit , which monitors vulnerability in global capital markets .
Nigeria ’s minister for foreign affairs has angrily responded to a question asked by his counterparts from Uganda and Ethiopia at the AU summit regarding the deployment of troops in Somalia previously pledged by his country and when that was likely to happen .
The minister said there is no peace to keep in Somalia and that any claims by some countries that they are going to restore peace and security in Somalia are insincere .
The Nigerian minister of foreign affairs said they were not going to deploy their troops in Somalia .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Getting students to exercise more might not just address obesity issues but also improve their grades with a U.S. study finding physically fit students tend to score higher in tests than their less fit peers .
Joggers are seen along a waterfront in a file photo .

Test scores dropped more than one point for each extra minute it took middle and high school students to complete a one mile run / walk fitness test , according to Dr. William J. McCarthy and colleagues at the University of California in Los Angeles .
Schools and parents seeking to optimize their students ’ academic performance should take heed , McCarthy noted in an email to Reuters Health .
For optimal brain function “ it ’s good to be both aerobically fit and to have a healthy body shape . ”
McCarthy and colleagues compared physical fitness and body weight measures with scores on California ’s standardized math , reading , and language tests among 749 fifth - graders , 761 seventh - graders , and 479 ninth - graders who attended schools in Southern California between 2002 and 2003 .
About half of the students were girls , 60 percent were white , 26 percent were of Hispanic ethnicity , and about 7 percent each were African American and Asian / Pacific Islander .
Almost 32 percent of the students were overweight and about 28 percent were obese , the researchers report in The Journal of Pediatrics .
The researchers estimated students ’ aerobic fitness according to their one - mile run / walk time on a flat track .
With a 15 - minute maximum allowed time to complete the test , the boys averaged slightly less than 10 minutes , while the girls averaged a little less than 11 minutes .
McCarthy ’s team found that nearly two thirds of the students ( 65 percent ) fell below the state fitness standard for their age and gender .
Compared with these students , students who met or exceeded fitness standards had higher average test scores .
Allowing for age , social and economic status , gender , ethnicity , and body size did not significantly alter this association .
Compared with students of desirable weight , overweight and obese students also scored significantly lower on tests , the researchers found .
These findings , McCarthy ’s team notes , confirm and extend those of previous investigations .
They say further studies are needed to figure out why aerobic fitness may play a role in academic performance .
If future studies confirm a cause - and - effect link between lower fitness and reduced academic performance , “ schools will have to reverse their recent disinvestment in physical education ostensibly for the purposes of boosting student achievement , ” they concluded .
Ian Harebottle , chief executive of Gemfields , said : " This is a unique find .
The Insofu displays wonderful colour and good translucency .
Its sheer size , rich colour and fine protective biotite shell make it difficult to see deep into the gem .
However , all indications suggest that the core of the emerald is competent and that it should yield a number of cut gems of significant size . "
" Gaza is the only gulag in the Western hemisphere ; maintained by democracies ; closed - off from food , water , air " says Colonel Desmond Travers , co-author of the Goldstone report , in an exclusive MEMO interview .
February 4 , 2010
One year after the horrendous Israeli military assault on Gaza during Operation Cast Lead , in which over 1400 men , women and children were viciously and brutally slaughtered by invading Israeli troops , MEMO sat down with Colonel Desmond Travers , one of the four co-authors of the Goldstone Report and the only military expert on the team , and discussed his views on Israel , Hamas and the incredibly mixed reception of his groundbreaking and now iconic report .
The UN appointed fact - finding mission , of which Colonel Travers was an integral part , set out to investigate the claims that war crimes had been committed by both Israel and Hamas during the 22 day attack on the people of Gaza between 27th December 2008 and 18th January 2009 .
After the most extensive and rigorous investigation of its kind to ever be carried out on the region , the Goldstone Report concluded that war crimes and possible crimes against humanity had been committed by both sides but by far and away the most blame was apportioned to Israel whose military tactics included , according to Colonel Travers , " hostage taking , felling of houses , destruction of the judicial police infrastructure , destruction of hospitals and the medical infrastructure , destruction of the agricultural , water and sewage infrastructure . "
The mission investigated 36 separate incidents of alleged Israeli offences , ( although there were countless more that Colonel Travers wishes they had time to investigate ) and " in all of the 36 cases we found against the perpetrators " ( Israel ) .
This included such incidents as the Israeli F - 16 missile strike of a home which resulted in the deaths of 22 members of the same family , the al - Daya family ; a massacre Israel claims was an " error " but of which Travers says " we did n't accept their explanation . "
It also included a " horrific " missile attack on al - Maqadmah mosque while people were at prayer , killing 15 civilians and wounding 40 .
When asked if there may have been grounds for Israel to target the mosque given claims by people such as Colonel Tim Collins in a recent BBC Newsnight programme that mosques had been used to store weapons , he completely rejected such " spurious " and unfounded allegations .
He stands resolutely by the Goldstone Report 's findings which stated clearly that there was no evidence of any kind that weapons were stored in the mosque that they investigated .
Although the Report 's authors made it clear that they could not generalise as they could not investigate all the mosques that were attacked by Israel , and there were many dozens attacked , they chose to investigate the al - Maqadmah Mosque because that was the most serious of all the Israeli attacks on a Muslim place of worship .
However , the report concluded that : " The Mission found no evidence that this mosque was used for the storage of weapons or any military activity by Palestinian armed groups .
As far as this mosque is concerned , therefore , the Mission found no basis for such an allegation . "
Colonel Travers therefore puts such allegations down to " negative stereotyping inferences " about Muslims and as he said , this sort of blas� acceptance of facts without proof " could n't be applied elsewhere .
During the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland if a British public figure or a military figure had said , ' Catholic Churches are warehouses for Semtex ' there would have been an international outcry , especially in the Catholic world over such a slur . "
As such , in reference to Tim Collins assertions , after commending him for his military achievements , Colonel Travers says , however " his comments are so much in breach of good evidentiary procedures that I 'm sure he knows he lapsed .
To serve the propaganda interests of one belligerent over another ill serves his otherwise fine reputation ...
Collins made statements he knows to be unsound ... he has to know this is drivel . "
The impact of the Goldstone Report has resonated around the globe and has already affected international relations as well as international law .
Asked how he felt about the impact the report is having in terms of Universal Jurisdiction , which is the body of law which allowed for a British arrest warrant to be issued recently against former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , he responded , " I think it 's fantastic .
Let militaries all over the world take heed and politicians take heed of this fact , that their holiday travel arrangements might be severely curtailed if they do naughty things ! "
Furthermore , as he pointed out , even before the military action had begun , " there were extremely aggressive statements made about what the Israelis would do when they went into Gaza made by Tzipi Livni and by the Minster of Defence and by several generals and some academics .
Those statements are incitements of war crimes in their own right . "
He also spoke about the rather worrying developments of a " very fervid Rabbinate in the military " .
The effect of the Goldstone Report has certainly also caused much consternation in Israel and Colonel Travers observed , " Israel has been severely frightened by this .
It wandered around Europe begging Europe not to impose sanctions on it .
It 's jet - setting around the place . "
Colonel Travers was clearly pleased with the impact that the report was having and stated that in the evolution of international humanitarian and human rights law " I think the Goldstone report will probably be a mile in that evolutionary process in the right direction . "
However , if Colonel Travers ' goal of seeking " an end to impunity " in the region is to be achieved we must acknowledge that this is only the beginning and there is still much work to be done .
When MEMO pointed out to him the apparent anomaly that while the name of the soldier Gilad Shalit was mentioned as the only Israeli prisoner being held on the Palestinian side , no mention was made in the report of even one name from the 8 to 9000 Palestinian men , women and children being held in Israeli jails in blatant contravention of international law .
He conceded that the authors of the report were aware of this fact and that following presentations from human rights organisations on this subject they were all " extremely disturbed by the treatment , illegal detention , torture and abuse of women and children and men . "
He further stated that , particularly " the treatment of children in this fashion is unacceptable " � " it is unspeakable , outrageous .
Some of the items described about the ( Israeli ) detention of ( Palestinian ) children is very , very , very troubling . "
The Goldstone report therefore only seems to scratch the surface in terms of Israeli offences and abuses of the Palestinian people , but it is an excellent start .
Colonel Travers described how , from the outset , Israel stubbornly refused to assist the UN fact - finding mission every step of the way , whereas Hamas co-operated " one- hundred percent " .
In discussing the root cause of the war I put to him Israel 's standard lament that they could not live with the barrage of Hamas rockets that constantly reigned down on Israeli citizens in places such as Sderot , but Colonel Travers scoffed at the suggestion that there was any legitimate argument of self - defence and stated quite clearly " there is n't one . "
This is because , Colonel Travers explained , there had been a ceasefire since June that year and that for months " Hamas rockets had ceased being fired into Israel and not only that but Hamas sought a continuation of the ceasefire ... and Israel said no . "
On the contrary he felt that " the subtext in the raison d'etre for going into Gaza by the ( Israeli ) army " was to find and release Gilad Shalit .
Following what was clearly therefore an unjustifiable attack on a besieged civilian population , wreaking the most devastating havoc on their lives , liberty and civilian infrastructure Colonel Travers says : Israel is now " on notice as far as I am concerned � they want to think twice before they try on another similar act again . "
The Goldstone report is a vital document , a unique attempt to bring the perpetrators of war crimes to justice for the brutality they have exercised against the people of Gaza .
People who still , one year later , have been unable to rebuild their lives because of the illegal siege , ( which is almost in its fourth year now ) that Israel continues to impose on them , ( with the direct complicity of Egypt ) and the war crimes thus continue .
Israel must be brought to account for its actions .
As Colonel Travers said , " Gaza is occupied territory .
I would go further and say that the land , sea and air that they breathe is more or less determined by the occupier and the quality of it and it's deteriorating . "
" Gaza has now come into the history books in the same way as Guernica , Dresden , Stalingrad .
Gaza is a gulag , the only gulag in the Western hemisphere ; maintained by democracies ; closed - off from food , water , air . "
But Gaza cannot be relegated to the history books yet .
The atrocities are happening now , every day , and the world community must sit up and do something before it is too late .
Colonel Desmond Travers has a distinguished military carer that spans over 40 years .
Before retiring from the Irish forces in 2001 he had worked in key EU and UN roles including commanding peacekeeping troops in Cyprus and Lebanon and he served in the Balkans twice .
He has been the Commandant of the Irish Army 's Military College , The Curragh , and currently teaches a module on war crime investigations at the Institute of International Criminal Investigation in The Hague where he also sits on the Board of Directors .

Interview With Colonel Desmond Travers [ 1 ]
An inquest into a prisoner 's death has been told video footage suggests it took 13 minutes for staff to start efforts to resuscitate the woman .
The inquest heard Laura Parker , 40 , had never been in trouble with police until a few minor incidents in the lead - up to her death in early 2008 .
She was being treated for a borderline personality disorder when she was arrested in late February 2008 .
Counsel assisting the Deputy Coroner , Naomi Kereru , said Ms Parker was detained at the Adelaide Women 's Prison for more than two weeks on a minor charge because she refused to accept a good behaviour bond .
The court heard that on March 15 , Ms Parker was seen suffering a fit , on closed circuit television .
Ms Kereru said the video showed that 13 minutes elapsed before resuscitation efforts started .
Ms Parker died in hospital a day later .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire near their disputed sea border on Wednesday , the second time in three months the rivals have clashed and briefly sending prices down on jittery Seoul financial markets .
Analysts doubted the latest clash would escalate and saw it more as an attempt by Pyongyang to stress the instability on the Korean peninsula and press home its demand for a peace deal that would open the way to international aid for its ruined economy .
South Korea ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North fired artillery shots from land toward the South but landing on its side of the disputed sea border off the west coast .
South Korea returned fire from its coastal artillery .
The presidential Blue House said both sides fired into the air and there were no casualties , according to Yonhap , adding it had called a meeting of top national security officials .
North Korean state media made no comment on the incident .
Earlier this week it accused the South of declaring war by saying it would launch a pre-emptive strike if it had clear signs the North was preparing a nuclear attack .
The latest clash also comes amid signals from Pyongyang it was ready to return after a year - long boycott to six - country talks -- between the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States -- on ending its atomic arms program .
“ North Korea may want to return to the six - party talks , but only to ease pressure on itself and gain more economic assistance , which it really needs now , ” said Zhang Liangui , who is an expert on North Korea at the Central Party School , a prominent institute in Beijing .
“ So North Korea wants to control the pace of contacts with South Korea and the United States .
Incidents such as this are a way for it to show that it can control how and when there is any progress , ” Zhang said .
In return for resuming disarmament negotiations , North Korea has demanded talks on a peace treaty with the United States to finally end the 1950 - 53 Korean War and the lifting of U.N. sanctions over its two nuclear tests .
Analysts say tightened sanctions since last year have badly hit the failing economy , especially its main export -- weapons .
There have also been overtures for dialogue with Seoul after two years of increasingly tense ties with the government of President Lee Myung - bak who has linked improved relations to action by the North to disarm and end the security risk affecting the peninsula and the rest of prosperous North Asia .
MARKETS RATTLED
News of the firing rattled markets , with Seoul ’s main stock exchange briefly extending losses and the won wiping out early gains against the dollar .
Both later recovered and analysts saw little long - term impact from the standoff .
“ Investors know that North Korea is in dire need of material support , and the country will not likely take drastic action , ” said Shim Jae - youb , a market analyst at Meritz Securities .
North Korea has declared a no-sail zone in the Yellow Sea waters for two months ending in late March , South Korea ’s Unification Ministry said , a sign it might be preparing to test fire missiles .
The area is near a contested sea border between the rival Koreas that was the site of a brief naval clash in November as well as deadly confrontations in previous years between the states which are technically still at war .
About a month before that clash , North Korea raised regional security concerns by firing short - range missiles off its east coast .
Beijing , China ( CNN ) --
A celebration of China 's lunar new year turned deadly as a firecracker explosion killed 19 and wounded dozens , state media reported Saturday .
The incident occurred in southern China 's Guangdong Province on Friday night , Xinhua news agency reported .
A family was setting off firecrackers in front of their home when a flame lit several firecrackers that were on the ground , the agency reported .
This caused a huge explosion , a witness told the agency .
Bodies of 13 people were discovered at the scene Friday night and six others died at a hospital .
About 50 people were also injured in the blast , Xinhua reported .
Firecrackers are a big part of the celebration of the lunar new year .
The holiday ends Sunday .
Winning the 1968 Hugo Award for best novel is n't the only claim to fame of Robert Zelazny 's Lord of Light : it also played a bizarre part in the Iran hostage crisis .
As student revolutionaries stormed the walls of the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979 , a handful of staff escaped through a back door .
They managed to make their way to the Canadian embassy , but were unable to escape from Iran using their own passports .
The Canadians and the CIA eventually came up with a cover to get them out of the country – issuing them with new identities and dressing them up as location scouts working on a science fiction film with a middle - eastern theme .
This film was supposedly called Argo , and the CIA developed an elaborate back - story to make it appear real .
They set up a production office , took out ads in Variety and bought up already - made set designs and script treatments for a film that neatly fitted into the remit of middle - eastern SF – Lord Of Light .
The attempt to make the actual film had stalled in early production when it emerged that one of the crew had been embezzling most of its budget , but the hostage escape operation it enabled was a resounding success ( and earned itself the fond nickname the Canadian Caper ) .
That success seems all the sweeter thanks to the delicious irony that the religious revolutionaries in Iran had been duped using the story of a revolution against religion .
The religion in question in Lord Of Light is Hinduism – or , at least , a version of Hinduism that has been operating on an Earth - like planet with the aim of keeping its population enslaved .
Yama , Brahma , Khali and co are actually the crew of a spaceship that crash - landed on the planet thousands of years ago .
They have used their advanced technology to provide themselves with weaponry that gives them godlike powers , and to transfer their minds to new bodies when the ones they 're occupying wear out .
They 've kept the rest of the human population ( largely made up of the descendants of their old bodies ) in a state of medieval ignorance and cowed those who do n't immediately do their bidding with the threat that they 'll be reincarnated as animals – or not at all .
Not that you 'd know any of that if you stopped reading before the halfway point .
At first it seems as if the gods really are gods – even though they 're all fond of smoking cigarettes and slipping in American slang and western cultural references ( generally in the form of groansome puns ) to deflate the high epic prose in which Zelazny has chosen to present most of his story .
The author only slowly reveals the gods ' true nature , and the nature of the struggle against them .
Even the central character is a mystery – an enigma summed up , but not fully explained , by the novel 's typically slippery first paragraph :
" His followers called him Mahasamamatman and said he was a god .
He preferred to drop the Maha - and the - atman , however , and called himself Sam .
He never claimed to be a god .
But then , he never claimed not to be a god .
Circumstances being what they were , neither admission could be of any benefit . "
And the complications do n't end there .
The novel 's dozens of characters have a habit of changing name as well as shape .
The chapters do not fit into regular chronology .
Many episodes only make sense in the light of things that happen later in the book ; some never really do .
It 's nearly impossible to tell whether Sam is serious or joking – or whether Zelazny is , for that matter .
Did he really write an entire dramatic episode in which an unfortunate character called Shan is given the body of an epileptic just to enable him to land the pun : " then the fit hit the Shan " ?
What 's with the Christian zombies ?
Is a long episode in which Sam hacks the planet 's oppressive Hinduism with Buddhism a giant mickey - take , another example of the absurdity of religious thought , a touching demonstration of the beauty of true spiritual enlightenment or a heady combination of all three ?
Is this book profound , or daft – or both ?
The obscurity and ambiguity are sometimes irksome but generally add to Lord Of Light 's considerable appeal .
Reading it is a strange and exhilarating experience .
I did n't have much of a clue about what was going on for the first 100 pages , but did n't really mind because I was enjoying the dappy dialogue , eastern - tinged scene - setting and epic battles ( there are fight scenes in here as beautifully constructed and carefully brutal as Hemingway 's boxing descriptions ) .
From the point of view of six American hostages , it 's probably a good job it was never made into a film , but the visual appeal is obvious .
Sometimes the epic prose is heavy and overwrought ( there are a lot of flames issuing forth and a few too many ponderous constructions : " They sat in the room called Heartbreak and they drank of the soma , but they were never drunken . " )
Sometimes , too , the more philosophical passages tend towards the windy .
But all that 's easily forgiven when enlightenment kicks in and you realise how cleverly Zelazny has been spinning the wheels of his story .
This intriguing game of bluff would deserve to be remembered even if it had n't played such a curiously apt part in the hostage crisis .

Fox News yesterday took a copy of Al Gore ’s “ An Inconvenient Truth ” and stuck it in the snow outside company headquarters for all the world to see .
Taking Fox ’s lead , Stephen Colbert observed on his show last night : “ It is dark outside … we can only assume the sun has been destroyed . ” Jon Stewart also joined in on the fun .
Watch .
THE destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 showed the importance of keeping levees — the artificial banks that contain the flow of partly canalised rivers — in tip - top condition .
In practice , though , that is hard .
Levees fail for many reasons , not all of them associated with violent storms , and there are so many of them ( 100,000 miles - worth in America alone ) that keeping an eye on all of them is an almost impossible task .
It is good , therefore , to have a backup plan to block up unexpected holes before they can cause too much damage .
The traditional approach is to throw bags filled with sand or rocks into a breach .
Such bags , though , are heavy and unwieldy — particularly if they have to be filled far from the breach and then carried there .
William Laska of the Science and Technology Directorate at America 's Department of Homeland Security has therefore sought out alternatives .
He has found several technologies that have a common theme : they all use water itself to help stem the flood .
The largest of the new devices is designed to block deep breaches .
The Portable Lightweight Ubiquitous Gasket ( PLUG ) is a sausage - shaped balloon made of polyester and PVC , and fitted with motorised pumps .
When dropped into a river ( usually by helicopter ) , PLUG 's pumps switch on automatically and begin forcing water into the balloon through a valve .
The air thus displaced is expelled through a second valve until the device is 80 % full , at which point the pumps shut themselves down .
Filled thus far , PLUG is still buoyant and will float wherever the current carries it .
If it has been dropped in the right place , that will be towards the breach it is designed to fill .
And there , if all goes well , it will stick — blocking the hole in a manner suitable to its rather contrived acronym .
Prevention , however , is always better than cure , and the second of Mr Laska 's devices is designed to stop levees being breached in the first place .
In this case the acronym of choice is REPEL ( Rapidly Emplaced Protection for Earthen Levees ) .
REPEL is made of the same material as PLUG , but instead of being thrown into the water and carried to its destination by the current , it is laid out flat on a levee that is in danger of being overtopped and thus eroded by the river it is supposed to contain .
In normal circumstances merely placing a layer of protective material on top of a levee in this way would not do much good .
The force of the water would quickly wash it away .
However , REPEL has a series of tubes that sit on top of it and can be pumped full of water in a manner similar to that employed by PLUG .
The weight of these tubes holds the protective layer in place , while the gaps between the tubes permit the overspill to escape .
Some flooding from that overspill results — but not as much as if the spill were allowed to erode and destroy the levee itself .
Yet simply halting floodwaters and preventing short - term damage is not enough .
Neither PLUG nor REPEL can be used permanently .
It is the third of Mr Laska 's acronyms , REHAB , that allows engineers to make permanent repairs .
The Rapidly Emplaced Hydraulic Arch Barrier , made of the same material as the other two devices , can be put in place around a plugged breach to keep it sealed and dry once the PLUG has been removed .
First , the arch is filled with air and floated to the desired location .
Then , once it is in place , it is partly flooded and allowed to sink to the riverbed around the breach , making a tight seal .
That done , a second set of pumps evacuates the gap between the arch and the PLUG , allowing workers access to the site .
Not only is installing REHAB easier and faster than building a conventional temporary dam , it is also less wasteful .
A conventional temporary structure is demolished after use .
REHAB can simply be floated away and reused — it will have rehabilitated itself , in other words .
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan has renewed calls for an end to U.S. drone aircraft strikes , an issue that could strain ties as the CIA hunts down Muslim militants after one of the deadliest attacks in its history in neighboring Afghanistan .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani ( R ) meets with U.S. Senator John McCain , ( 3rd L ) , Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson , ( 2nd L ) and U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman , ( L ) at the prime minister 's residence in Islamabad January 8 , 2010 .
U.S. senators on Friday defended American drone aircraft strikes in ally Pakistan , an issue likely to become more volatile if Washington intensifies the attacks to hunt down enemies after the bombing of CIA agents in Afghanistan .
Pakistan officially objects to the attacks on suspected al Qaeda and Taliban militants along its border with Afghanistan , saying they violate its sovereignty .
And it has pushed Washington to provide it with the drones to allow it to carry out its own attacks .

Pakistan officially objects to the operations against suspected al Qaeda and Taliban militants along its border with Afghanistan , saying they violate its sovereignty .
And Islamabad has pushed Washington to provide it with the drones to allow it to carry out its own attacks on Taliban insurgents , a move that could ease widespread anti-American sentiment in Pakistan .
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani reiterated Pakistan ’s concerns over the drone strikes in talks with a delegation of visiting U.S. senators headed by John McCain .
“ He reiterated his government ’s disappointment over the continuing drone attacks and persisting reluctance of the U.S. to share drone technology with Pakistan to enable it to take on the terror centers in its border areas itself , ” said Pakistan ’s official APP news agency .
The senators met Gilani on Friday and also held talks with President Asif Ali Zardari and army chief Ashfaq Kiyani after visiting Afghanistan , where U.S. and other Western troops face a raging Afghan Taliban insurgency .
Speaking to reporters on Friday , McCain defended the drone strikes , saying they are “ one of many tools that we must use to try to defeat a very determined and terrible enemy ” .
The United States has stepped up its attacks with the pilotless drone aircraft attacks in Pakistan since a double agent blew himself up at a U.S. base in Afghanistan on December 30 , killing seven CIA agents .
U.S. officials say the strikes are carried out under an agreement with Islamabad that allows Pakistani leaders to criticizes them in public .
Pakistan denies any such agreement .
U.S. PRESSURE
Pakistan has captured hundreds of al Qaeda militants and handed many of them over to the United States , including some of the most wanted men in the U.S. war on terror .
Pakistan is likely to come under more intense American pressure to help fight militant groups after the suicide bombing that killed the CIA agents .
Pakistan is struggling against homegrown Taliban insurgents and is reluctant to go after some groups in border enclaves it sees as assets in Afghanistan that Washington wants eliminated .
Al Qaeda ’s Afghan wing claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing , saying it was revenge for the deaths of militant leaders , including Pakistan Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud , who was killed in a drone attack .
Pakistan and the United States are long - time allies .
But the drone attacks and other issues have caused friction .
Gilani told the senators tighter security measures against Pakistanis in U.S. airports following a botched bombing attempt on an American airliner could hurt relations .
Travelers from Nigeria , Yemen , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia and nine other countries face full - body pat downs before boarding airliners under new security screening procedures targeting foreign passengers in the United States .
In his talks with the senators , Gilani expressed his reservations about the move , said a statement from his office cited by APP .
“ Gilani said such policies cause consternation and anxiety among the people of Pakistan and said their continuity could negatively impact the bilateral ties , ” said APP , adding that Gilani said Pakistan should be removed from the list .
The U.S. embassy has accused Pakistan of taking provocative action and making false allegations against U.S. personnel .
U.S. officials say Pakistan is also stalling their visa applications .

White House Mocks Palin : Robert Gibbs Hand Note VIDEO
The White House could n't resist poking some fun at former Alaska governor Sarah Palin .
During his morning briefing , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs showed reporters that he had a cheat sheet of his own on the palm of his hand .
He playfully revealed that it was a grocery list .
He said , " I wrote eggs , milk and bread .
I crossed out bread so that I could make pancakes for Ethan if it snows .
Then I wrote down hope and change just in case I forgot . "
Stephen Colbert also got in some seriously controversial digs on the same subject .
Another interesting political tidbit is the George Bush billboard along a Twin Cities freeway that begs the question : Miss Me Yet ?
Check out Robert Gibbs ' comedic Palin jab on the video below .

A SWARM of “ smart dust ” spacecraft , positioned at a sweet spot between the Earth and the sun , could alert us to the approach of dangerous space storms well before a conventional craft can .
The first prototypes are due for launch into low - Earth orbit this year , perhaps as early as May .
Mason Peck , a mechanical engineer at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , and his colleague Justin Atchison have designed a 1 - centimetre - square spacecraft that is 25 micrometres thick and weighs under 7.5 milligrams .
The craft is modelled on the dust particles that orbit …

Today we 're going to go back in time about a third of a century to 1978 , when something strange happened on remote Bell Island in Newfoundland .
It was a quiet community , some fishermen and scattered families on small farms and in a smattering of hamlets .
It was the last place on Earth you 'd expect to be rocked by a sudden , shattering explosion .
But it was n't just an explosion .
On what should have been a sleepy Sunday morning , electrical appliances on the island burst apart .
Animals fell over dead .
Buildings were rent asunder .
Though the explosion was the loudest anyone there had ever heard , it seemed to have no precise epicenter .
To this day , the cause remains unknown , but hypotheses and conspiracy theories abound .
The Bell Island Boom has become , to some people , proof of government tests of secret superweapons .
Newfoundland is a large island off the east coast of Canada , and within Conception Bay at its eastern end is Bell Island .
It 's a pretty small island , only about 9 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide .
The significant part of its history began in the 1890's when rich iron deposits were discovered and mining began .
Tiny Bell Island actually became one of the world 's major producers of iron ore , and even saw action in World War II when it was attacked by a German submarine .
The mine prospered until the 1960's when pressure from cheaper competition finally forced a closure .
Bell Island is low lying with its highest point only a hair above 100 meters , so its deep mines were almost entirely below sea level , requiring constant pumping to keep the water out .
So while it was productive , it was always expensive and dangerous .
Since the mines closed , they have been filled with water .
The island is now laced with tunnels and entrances and passages that lead to underground lakes marking the top of the water table .
It 's now a site of interest to cave diving adventurers .
With its mine closed and its small economy in shambles , the communities on Bell Island had been largely emptied out for more than a decade when the Bell Island Boom struck on Sunday , April 2 , 1978 .
Without warning , a sudden BANG rocked the island , like a giant electric shock .
By some reports , it was heard as far as 100 kilometers away .
There was extensive damage to electrical wiring .
One property , that of the Bickford family , reported physical damage to their buildings .
There were holes in the roof ; their television set and fuse boxes actually exploded ; and the roof of their chicken coop was destroyed and five chickens inside were killed .
Near the shed were two or three holes in the snow which looked like some buried explosives had gone off .
Digging in these holes found nothing of interest .
And then the strangest of the stories began trickling in .
The Bickford 's young grandson reported a hovering ball of light after the blast .
One woman on Newfoundland reported a beam of light slanting up into the sky from Bell Island .
And several people on the island said they heard a ringing , like a tone , just before the boom struck .
A 2004 documentary film called The Invisible Machine postulated that the Bell Island Boom was a test of an electromagnetic pulse weapon .
This particular theory was deeply flawed , and depended upon a hypothesized beam weapon being attracted to the iron ore from Bell Island 's old mines .
These filmmakers were apparently pretty confused to think that natural iron ore is a terrifically powerful magnet , which of course it 's not .
Although iron is magnetic and can be magnetized , natural iron ore has its molecules jumbled in every direction and rarely happens to have a significant magnetic field , certainly not strong enough to divert or attract a particle beam .
Fueling the fires of conspiracy theories about weapons testing was the mysterious presence of John Warren and Robert Freyman from the Los Alamos National Laboratory ( then called the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory ) in New Mexico , who happened to show up right after the boom struck .
To many , this was confirmation enough that the Bell Island Boom was indeed a weapons test .
But to understand what the boom really was , we first have to understand the context in which it took place .
For about four months before the boom struck , the entire eastern seaboard had been plagued by a series of unexplained booms .
Beginning in late 1977 and fading out in mid 1978 , some 600 of these so - called " Mystery Booms " left reporters and the public scratching their heads from South Carolina up to Canada .
The same conspiracy theories surrounding the Bell Island Boom had been proposed to explain the Mystery Booms .
Everything from tests of some kind of superweapon by the United States or the Soviet Union , to an atmospheric doomsday device inspired by Nikola Tesla , or even a massive nuclear device like Convair 's proposed Sky Scorcher .
As it turns out , the majority of the Mystery Booms were solved , but with disappointingly mundane explanations that paled beside the much more intriguing conspiracy theories .
Many witnesses noted that the Mystery Booms seemed to politely follow a predictable schedule .
There was a good reason for this , according to Dr. Gordon MacDonald , who spent seven months compiling an authoritative report on the Mystery Booms for the Mitre Corporation .
Of the nearly 600 booms recorded , over 2/3 of them could be positively attributed to sonic booms from aircraft , most notably the Concorde .
The Concorde began its flights between New York and Europe only a few days before the first recorded Mystery Boom on December 2 , 1977 .
Because of sonic boom concerns , the Concorde was required to take a wider path out to sea ; but on particularly hot days , fuel expansion required the pilots to shortcut over Nova Scotia in order to retain the required fuel reserve .
On some days , these booms would propagate up to 100 kilometers by bouncing between two main refracting layers of the stratosphere .
But eliminating the booms that could be traced to supersonic aircraft still left nearly 200 of MacDonald 's Mystery Booms unexplained .
He attributed them to natural phenomena , but of exactly what nature he did not know .
As it turns out , the reason the guys from Los Alamos were there is that they did know .
Warren and Freyman had been monitoring imagery from the Vela satellites .
This fleet of four satellites kept the globe under constant surveillance , looking for the distinct signatures of nuclear bomb detonations .
They also picked up large lightning flashes , and it was in part from the Vela satellites that we learned about lightning superbolts .
About five of every ten million bolts of lightning is classified as a superbolt , which is just what it sounds like :
An unusually large bolt of lightning , lasting an unusually long time : About a thousandth of a second .
Superbolts are almost always in the upper atmosphere , and usually over the oceans .
Often these upper atmosphere storms can occur with people on the ground being completely unaware , perceiving nothing other than a clear sunny day .
Dr. William Donn , chief atmospheric scientist at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Observatory , compiled reports from airline pilots of extremely high - altitude flashes that corresponded with nighttime Mystery Booms .
He said the daylight booms may have high - altitude flashes as well , but if they do we would n't be able to see them from below because of the daylight .
Although versions of this story on the Internet often claim that Warren and Freyman snooped around and went back to Los Alamos without a word to anyone , the truth is that they spoke quite openly with the media and with other scientists investigating Bell Island .
According to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Rick Cera who spoke with Freyman off - camera , Warren and Freyman had been tracking superbolts over the east coast since December 1977 .
When they learned of the Bell Island Boom and saw that it correlated with a rare overland superbolt , they were asked to go check it out to see what kind of damage it might have caused .
They were surprised the damage to the Bickfords ' property was not worse .
Warren 's specialty was in plasma physics , and Freyman was an expert in RF and its propagation in the upper atmosphere .
He 's best known as a co-developer of RFID technology .
They certainly had a professional interest in observing the aftermath of a superbolt .
There 's no evidence to support the hypothesis that the Bell Island Boom was the result of a manmade weapon , and all the pieces are in place that support its characterization as a freak lightning superbolt .
Popular tellings of the Bell Island story refer to Warren and Freyman as " military attaches " , including The Invisible Machine authors .
I suppose you could call them this if you 're so inclined .
Los Alamos is a government facility , but Warren and Freyman were both well established scientists with publications and legitimate credentials .
Whether this qualifies them as " men in black " is , I suppose , a matter of personal language choice .
Their visit to Bell Island could reasonably be argued to be consistent with a government weapons plot , but in the same way that my ownership of a toothbrush is consistent with a government plot to keep my breath minty fresh .
Imagination is the only evidence supporting either plot .
All the evidence that does exist , however , is consistent with a lightning superbolt .
The destruction of electrical appliances was due to the staggering voltage propagating throughout Bell Island 's copper power grid .
The damage to the chicken shed roof and the electrocuted chickens inside are also consistent with lightning , as were the holes in the snow outside .
The angled beam striking the island reported by a witness on Newfoundland could have been a lightning bolt ; it 's anecdotal and the CBC reporter dismissed it as unreliable .
The high - pitched tone preceding the boom reported by witnesses on Bell Island is interesting , but anecdotal ; it could have been anything , we can't know , and there 's nothing concrete that indicates it was related to the subsequent boom .
The Bickfords ' grandson 's story of the hovering ball of light is also interesting , and unfortunately anecdotal .
Even if we take the his story at face value — which stretches the limits of a responsible scientific investigation — we still learn nothing .
Hovering balls of light are not consistent with any known phenomenon , certainly not any military weapons , not an electromagnetic pulse , and not lightning either .
However , undoubtedly something extraordinary did happen on the Bickfords ' property and any report coming from the boy is not surprising .
This may constitute an intriguing footnote to the Bell Island Boom , but by no logic can it invalidate the prevailing theory to explain the evidence we have :
That a lightning superbolt struck the Bickfords ' property .

Mercedes chief Dieter Zetsche says it will be up to team boss Ross Brawn to decide if Michael Schumacher takes number one status for his Formula 1 comeback .
Schumacher was given priority over his team - mates for much of his previous F1 career .
He will be paired with countryman Nico Rosberg at Merccedes when he returns this year .
When asked by Gazzetta dello Sport if Mercedes would designate Schumacher as number one , Zetsche replied : " We have a team manager for this .
Ross Brawn is one of the best .
If he was n't he would n't have won both titles last year , despite his team being in their debut .
He will decide and it will be the best for the drivers and the constructor . "
Zetsche added that he had no concerns whatsoever about Schumacher returning after three years away , and reckons the German is as enthusiastic as any rookie .
" We are convinced that Michael will do well and that he 'll win again , " he said .
" Maybe not immediately , let 's give him some time , but an ace never disappoints .
I 've been impressed by his enthusiasm .
Rather than a return , it seems to me like a new debut . "
Asked how he would feel if Schumacher proved disappointing , Zetsche said : " This is an hypothesis I do n't even contemplate .
Ross Brawn has already spoken about Schumi 's competitiveness .
" He has been close to him for years and he knows him more than I do .
If he says it 's okay , I have no reason to think otherwise . "
This has shaped up into a regular bout between Superman Red and Superman Blue .
As ComicsAlliance recently reported , Dwight Howard starred in a new ESPN commercial emphasizing the Orlando center 's persona as the NBA 's resident Superman .
This apparently rankled some Shaq - tastic feathers , as Cleveland center and 4 - time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal asked reporters , following a Cavaliers defeat of Orlando just prior to the All Star break , " You tell me who the real Superman is ? "
O'Neal went on to suggest that he had " invented " everything Howard had done , according to Yahoo Sports .
Howard responded badly to the accusations of biting The Big Aristotle 's style , and , despite an attempt to diffuse the beef during All Star Weekend , a mini-controversy erupted .
Then , just this past Sunday , the two teams squared off once more .
This time it was Howard who came out on the winning side , and secured his stake in the Super - title for at least another day .
But which NBA giant is really closer to being a real life Metropolis Marvel ?
As Lex Luthor might put it , just who is Superman ?
Check out how ComicsAlliance 's tale of the tape measures the Super - feud after the jump .
Choosing between these two worthy superstars is no easy task .
In order to decide who deserves full custody of the legendary S - shield , we 've taken a comparative look at just what makes Superman who he is .
While neither has revealed any aptitude for X - ray or heat vision , or freeze breath , for that matter , each player makes a worthy case for inclusion in the House of El. Super Trait : Man of Steel
Edge : Shaq
Reasoning :
This one should really need no explanation .
But in case you forgot ...
Super Trait : Leap Tall Buildings in a Single Bound
Edge : Dwight Howard
Reasoning : Howard 's ascension to superhero status came out of his much celebrated 2008 Slam Dunk Contest victory , in which he donned the cape and tights and took to the skies .
Dunk contests routinely showcase unbelievable athleticism , but rarely is a player of Howard 's considerable stature able to compete with the comparatively shorter , more rangy swing players that typically dominate the contest .
Almost the size of a building himself , Dwight 's got the power of flight .
Super Trait : Champion for Truth , Justice , and the American Way
Edge : Shaq
Reasoning :
When it comes to defending justice , Shaquille O'Neal puts his money where his mouth is .
Shaq has long dabbled in the art of law enforcement , serving as a reserve officer for Miami Beach and the Los Angeles Port Police .
He has acted in an official capacity as an advocate for Internet safety among youths , and in 2006 , told ABC News , " I have full powers of arrest . "
Not even Clark Kent has a greater ability to protect innocents during his day job than Shaq .
Super Trait : Last Son of Krypton
Edge : Dwight Howard
Reasoning : Even Shaq himself would cop to this one , just this week telling the Associated Press , " Dwight is one of the only true big men left . "
As the NBA becomes more predicated on speed and outside shooting , powerful , lumbering " true centers , " become less and less common .
This makes Howard , who has plenty of speed but is fundamentally an " inside " player , the last of a dying breed .
He was n't sent here on a rocket or anything , ( as far as we know ) , but this still gives him " Last Son , " status .
Super Trait : More Powerful Than a Locomotive
Edge : Shaq
Reasoning : Power has always been the key to Shaq 's success .
The self described " M.D.E. " ( that 's Most Dominant Ever , for you vo-Shaq - ulary n00bs ) , gained widespread notoriety early in his career by dunking with such ferocity that he more than occasionally shattered backboards .
His strength was unparalleled , and his combination of power and size , not just height , but size , was what set him apart from his peers .
He was n't just strong , he was Silver - Age strong .
Super Trait : Man of Tomorrow
Edge : Dwight Howard
Reasoning : Not even Shaq can overpower the effects of time .
And while O'Neal has played seventeen years of outstanding ball , his best days on the court are behind him .
Howard , however , has plenty of Tomorrow to look forward to .
Drafted to the pros as a teenager straight out of high school , and then leading the Magic to the NBA Finals last season , the twenty - four year old Howard is surely basketball 's prototypical center of the future .
Verdict : 3 - 3 Tie , Reign of the Supermen
Sure , it 's a cop-out , but if DC Comics does n't have to settle on just one iteration of Superman , why should super hero - inclined NBA fans ?
In the comics ' realm , creators reinterpret the Superman mythos every few years , tweaking bits and pieces here and there to keep the character sufficiently modern and relevant .
It is important to maintain the vitality of the character .
Well , the NBA is also full of characters and personas that are constantly evolving , and during that evolution there is bound to be some crossover , ( and that 's crossover as in intersection ; not crossover as in hand - changing dribble , or crossover as in publishing line - wide event storytelling ) .
So in the end , it goes something like this ; Shaquille O'Neal is the Golden Age Superman .
He was the first of his kind ; he was unrivaled in his grandeur , and he wore the " S " with distinction .
Dwight Howard is the modern day Superman .
He is sleek and streamlined ; he is less original , less accomplished , but possesses the power to inspire current and future generations .
One 's great strength is his history .
The others ' is his potential .
So rest easy , Metropolis .
Your protection is in good hands .
So long as , y'know , the two Supermen do n't destroy each other or anything .
If you live anywhere near New York or were looking for an excuse to make the trip , the Kihasa Spray Toad exhibit is reason enough .
Learn more by clicking " continue reading " below .
Luckily , researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Bronx Zoo were on hand to collect an " assurance colony " of 499 toads .
Over the last nine years these researchers have figured out how to keep the little toads comfortable and , more importantly , how to encourage them to produce baby toads !
The eensy - teensy - tiny results can be enjoyed below !
The Bronx Zoo has just unveiled what is sure to be a major - miniature attraction and an essential piece of conservation to boot - Kihansi Spray Toads !
When Tanzania built a massive hydroelectric dam in the Kihansi Gorge , this tiny toad lost 90 % of its habitat .
True to their name , Kihansi Spray Toads required the mist generated by water crashing through the gorge to keep their skin moist .
When the heavy water was reduced to a trickle , the spray dried up .
Extinct in the Wild , Kihansi Spray Toad on Exhibit at Wildlife Conservation Society ’s Bronx Zoo
New Exhibit Highlights the Work of WCS to Conserve a Species Extinct in the Wild
Bronx , NY – February 2 , 2010 – The Wildlife Conservation Society ’s Bronx Zoo announced today the opening of a new exhibit featuring the Kihansi spray toad , a species listed as extinct in the wild last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
The small , yellowish toad once occurred in large numbers but was only found in a verdant , moist five - acre microhabitat in the Kihansi gorge of Tanzania .
This species is unusual among toads ; females give birth to live , fully - formed young , rather than laying eggs that hatch into free - living tadpoles .
“ The Wildlife Conservation Society is taking a leading role to ensure this toad does not disappear from the planet by playing an active role in its conservation , ” said Jim Breheny , WCS Senior Vice President of Living Institutions and Director of the Bronx Zoo .
For the first time at WCS ’s Bronx Zoo , visitors will be able to see and learn about the Kihansi spray toad .
The exhibit is as unique as its inhabitants .
Keeping the toads comfortable necessitated the construction of a specialized system that filters , cools , and treats the water with ozone .
The treated water is then delivered to the animals through a series of nozzles that create a fine mist within the enclosure .
For nine years , a team of herpetologists at the WCS ’s Bronx Zoo has been working behind the scenes on a conservation program intended to save the Kihansi spray toad from disappearing altogether by propagating the species for eventual reintroduction into its natural habitat .
What happened to the Kihansi spray toad ?
In 2000 , the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the Kihansi Gorge of Tanzania was predicted to dramatically change the Kihansi spray toad ’s habitat .
The micro-habitat where the toad lived was dependent on the mist created by the waterfalls in the gorge .
Although this dam is vital to the Tanzanian economy in that it generates one - third of Tanzania ’s total electrical supply , its construction reduced the original size of the Kihansi falls to 10 percent of its former flow , drastically lessening the mist zone in which the toads thrived .
Following an agreement between WCS and the government of Tanzania , WCS scientists and Tanzanian officials collected an assurance colony of 499 Kihansi spray toads from the gorge .
The small colony was brought back to New York to initiate the off - site conservation program .
Scientists are still debating the ultimate cause of extinction of this species in the wild , but it was probably a combination of habitat change and the emergence of infective chytrid fungus , which is responsible for alarming crashes and extinctions of amphibian species in many parts of the world .
The only remaining population of Kihansi spray toads consists of more than 4,000 individuals residing at WCS ’s Bronx Zoo and the Toledo Zoo .
After being propagated at WCS ’s Bronx Zoo for nine years , the project is entering the repatriation stage where WCS is working with the government of Tanzania and several international partners to return a small population to a facility at the University of Dar es Salaam within the next year .
The Tanzanian government has also been managing the Lower Kihansi Environment Management Project in the gorge .
A system of sprinklers , replicating the toad ’s habitat , has been installed in preparation for the species ’ return .
The ultimate goal of WCS and partners is to return the toads to the Kihansi gorge when habitat conditions can be assured for their long - term survival .
Chelsea King Searchers ' Move Heaven and Earth ' to Find Girl Straight - A San Diego high school student has been missing since Thursday .
Feb. 27 , 2010  --
Police and scores of volunteers searched through chilly , rainy weather today for a 17 - year - old San Diego straight - A student who disappeared Thursday after going out for a run .
Chelsea King , 17 , of Poway , Calif. , in San Diego County , disappeared after parking her BMW sedan outside Rancho Bernardo Community Center on Thursday afternoon , and when she was late coming home her parents called police , San Diego County Sheriff 's Office spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said .
The search for King began Thursday night and continued throughout Friday , Caldwell said .
Sheriff 's deputies were joined by the FBI , the San Diego Police Department , the San Diego Fire - Rescue Department and the Del Mar Lifeguard Service .
Caldwell said 90 law enforcement personnel were deployed in 15 search and rescue teams .
Helicopters , volunteers and officers on horseback , bloodhounds and officers on ATVs scoured an area roughly four miles square along the shores of Lake Hodges today , Caldwell said .
" We 're literally moving heaven and earth to find this little girl , " Caldwell said .
This afternoon divers also searched the lake , while law officers and volunteers combed the streams and rivers feeding into the basin , Sheriff Bill Gore told ABC San Diego affiliate KGTV .
" It 's been a truly great effort by everybody , all with the same goal of trying to return Chelsea to her family , " Gore said .
" It 's obviously the unknown that 's so stressful and so traumatic in something like this . "
The searches will continue throughout the night and Sunday , the sheriff said .
" We would n't be here if there was n't a chance of finding her , " Gore said .
" The more we search , the more we can eliminate . "
The area where the teen disappeared , on the south shore of Lake Hodges , is rocky , uneven terrain , criss - crossed by trails through rough brush .
King 's parents were given a private briefing this morning on what investigators know , Caldwell said , but she declined to give any information about what , if any , evidence had been found regarding what might have happened to the girl .
" We do n't have specific indications , but we 're not ruling anything out , " she said .
There were local reports Friday that a girl 's shoe might have been found near Lake Hodges , but Caldwell would neither confirm nor deny the reports .
" I 'm not speculating about anything that may or may not have been found , " she said .
On Friday , dozens of King 's friends and fellow students at Poway High School joined the search , KGTV reported .
Chelsea King Missing Since Thursday ; FBI Aids in Search
Poway High junior Breanna McArdle , who like King runs cross country , told KGTV she heard about her teammate 's disappearance while checking her Facebook account Thursday night , and decided to join the search Friday .
" [ Chelsea is ] amazingly energetic and really , really nice and really charismatic , " McArdle said .
At a news conference Friday evening , San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said deputies impounded King 's home computer and cell phone , according to ABC San Diego affiliate KGTV .
" We 're in the process of downloading information from [ them ] , seeing if there might be anything that might of help to us in our [ effort ] to return Chelsea to her parents , " Gore said .
Police were hoping that she had just gotten lost on her run and would be found unharmed , he said .
" I 'm still optimistic , " he said .
" It 's a big area we 're looking through , and hopefully we 'll get the right lead or the right clue or the right tip that takes us to Chelsea and we 'll get her back home in the near future . "
Gore described the girl 's parents as " worried to death . "
" They want their daughter home safe and sound , " he said .
Chelsea is white , 5 - feet - 5 inches tall and 115 pounds , with strawberry blond hair and blue eyes .
She is a member of the San Diego Youth Symphony and a straight - A student at Poway High School , where she is due to graduate this spring .
A family spokesman told KGTV that she has been eagerly awaiting college acceptance letters .
The sheriff 's department asked that anyone with information about King 's whereabouts call 858-565-5200 .
The World from Berlin ' The Taliban Wants to Undermine the Handover '
Taliban insurgents on Monday plunged the Afghan capital Kabul into chaos with a series of well - coordinated attacks across the city .
Militarily , the offensive was a failure .
But the propaganda value of the attack , which comes ahead of the Afghanistan conference later this month , is clear , say German commentators .
Dramatic images of World Trade Centre collapse on 9/11 released for first time
Advertisement
We have seen the Twin Towers collapse hundreds of times on TV .
The steel and glass skyscrapers exploding like a bag of flour , the dust and smoke pluming out across Manhattan .
But never like this , from above .
Nine years after the defining moment of the 21st century , a stunning set of photographs taken by New York Police helicopters forces us to look afresh at a catastrophe we assumed we knew so well .
You know but cannot see the 2,752 men , women and children who died at the World Trade Centre on September 11 , 2001 .
None is visible here .
Terror : A tidal wave of dust and debris roars through lower Manhattan as the World Trade Centre collapses on September 11 , 2001
Collapse :
This image captures the sheer size of the debris cloud enveloping buildings and cars as the towers collapse
The cloud spreads out , consuming the surrounding area and moving out over the East River
SO WHY ARE WE SEEING THEM NOW ?
After 9/11 the U.S.'s National Institute of Standards and Technology collected images from amateur , professional and freelance photographers as part of its investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Centre .
It completed its research in 2005 .
In the summer of last year , ABC saw that NIST was asking the photographers ' permission to release the images and filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act to get access to them .
The images seen here are ones taken by NYPD helicopters and come from the 2,779 pictures supplied on nine CDs to the news organisation .
All we see is the spectacular moment of collapse , what film directors call the wide shot , showing the towers in their urban setting , before , during and after their fall .
Even for those who were there , like me , running from the cloud and choking in the dust , it is hard to believe .
But what is all too evident to everyone is that this event changed the world , with consequences that will haunt us for decades .
With the Twin Towers collapsed the world we thought we knew .
These dramatic images were taken by police photographers in helicopters and it is the first time they have been seen , having been released under a Freedom of Information request made by America 's ABC News .
Burning buildings can be seen crumpling in on themselves as plumes of smoke rise up over the New York skyline that terrible September morning .
The images show how the police helicopter first began taking images from afar before moving in to reveal the devastation taking place underneath .
They also reveal the horror faced by those trapped in the burning buildings and then the walls of smoke and debris that enveloped the surrounding area as the towers came crashing down .
Released more than eight years after the deaths of 2,752 people on that day , they are powerful reminders of the attack that led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The legacy of the New York attack continues today with as British forces joining with Afghan soldiers and Nato to launch the biggest attack on the Taliban - accused of harbouring Al Qaeda who organised the 9/11 attack - since the initial 2001 offensive .
Meanwhile , in New York , work is continuing to build on the rubble of what became known as Ground Zero .
Structural steel for the 1,776ft tower , which will be known as 1 World Trade Centre , has already reached 200 ft above street level .
Workers are now installing 16 steel nodes on the 20th - floor of the tower which will serve as joints between the steel framing for the building 's podium and the steel for the rest of the tower .
The 104 - storey skyscraper is due to be completed in 2013 and will be one of the tallest buildings in the U.S .

If President Obama wants to really understand why he got his ass handed to him in the Massachusetts Senate race — a defeat as shocking and strange as if Joe Lieberman was elected president of Iran — he might want to read one of the thousands of economic horror stories happening around the country every day , stories that have put most Americans in a very foul , desperate mood .
Like this story out of a small town in northern Indiana , where a casket maker was forced to close down operations and lay off its 50 employees because Americans can no longer afford bury their loved ones , and instead they ’re cremating their bodies to save money .
Even the dead are suffering in today ’s economy .
The casket - maker , Ampcor , had been operating for almost 50 years , specializing in producing casket handles .
Now it ’s over — and what little business there still is in the casket industry is being outsourced to cheaper casket handle manufacturers in China , according to a local news report :
LA PORTE —
When Kimber Cornell clocked out of work on Thursday , she had no idea it would be her last shift .
A punch press operator at American Metal Products Corporation ( Ampcor ) , Cornell thought it was just another day at the factory , which manufactures metal parts for caskets .
But just as they were leaving Ampcor for the day , Cornell and her coworkers were ushered into a break room and told that the doors would be closing on the La Porte business indefinitely .
“ Everyone sighed in disbelief , and a lot of us cried .
We did n’t know what we were going to do , ” Cornell , a 12 - year Ampcor employee , recalled Monday .
Everyone , including the supervisor , is sharing the pain — including the brutal , callous way that Americans get fired these days :
When the ball dropped Thursday , employees — even supervisors — were taken by surprise .
“ I was dumbfounded I did n’t know what to think , ” said Van Vaught , president of Carpenters Union Local 3056 , which most Ampcor employees belong to .
Plant manager James Keitz said he was told just five minutes before the entire staff that the operation would be closing and was just as caught off guard .
A couple of years ago , a story like this would either seem fictional or easy late - night comedy material .
But now just about everyone outside of Wall Street or Washington DC can relate , and it ’s not funny at all .
What ’s made it worse is that for the past six months or more , Obama ’s all - star economic team has been talking up supposed “ green shoots ” in the economy — if only because their friends on Wall Street have seen nothing but green since the Bush bailouts began in October of 2008 .
The shock is setting in , as the casket manufacturer story shows :
“ We as workers thought things were looking up , ” Cornell recalled .
For some that feeling made the reality even more devastating .
Terry Brennan , a packer at Ampcor for 17 years , compared the feeling to losing a loved one .
“ It ’s like the world just stopped — that ’s how it felt .
That ’s how it still feels , ” Brennan said Monday .
Brennan is a member of the executive board for Local 3056 .
She said the union is meeting with Ampcor owner , Dave Christian , to hammer out details of the layoff .
“ We still do n’t know if we ’re going to be getting our last paycheck or vacation time , ” she said .
Every government in the world understands that in order to function and avoid chaos or overthrow , there has to be some level of accountability , a relationship between ruler and ruled .
Even Communist China adheres to the accountability principle by periodically executing some of the more venal businessmen and bureaucrats in its ranks , if only to keep the masses from revolting , and to keep those in power somewhat humbled .
The Chinese have been executing so many corrupt officials lately that they ’ve even deployed mobile execution busses to deal with the backlog .
I ’m not saying I ’m necessarily for executing our corrupt officials — but you know , death - penalty opponents probably would n’t want me to be the deciding member on a blue - ribbon commission to decide the matter , either .
And I think a huge number of Americans feel this way too .
( In any event , it ’s better than what we have here : billionaire - owned human plasma busses that shuttle human feeding cows from the Mexican border to nearby blood - draining centers , to feed obscene Wall Street profits — something I wrote about a couple of weeks ago . )
Since Obama campaigned on accountability , one way he could start reconnecting with the people he rules is by mass - firing the corrupt failures and sociopaths who are currently running America ’s economy into the ground .
It ’s painful to admit , but so far even a loser like George W. Bush made some of his closest officials accountable to their failures when the public revolted — for example , his sacking of the disastrous Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after the 2006 election disaster , and FEMA failure Michael Brown after Hurricane Katrina .
They were n’t sacked for being failures — by 2006 , Rumsfeld had already screwed up two wars , the single worst record of any Defense Secretary in American history — but because the voters revolted .
So now Americans are in revolt against the government .
Obama ’s first response should be mass - executions , in the form of pink - slips , to the economic team that ’s screwed this country up .
So far , Obama seems to have learned exactly the wrong lesson — he told ABC News that the election defeat came not from substance , but from bad style :
“ If there ’s one thing that I regret this year is that we were so busy just getting stuff done and dealing with the immediate crises that were in front of us that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are and why we have to make sure those institutions are matching up with those values . ”
A deluded and arrogant line like that could have come straight out of Larry Summers ’ mouth , and probably did .
Summers , the administration ’s economy czar , used to say the same thing in the 1990s , when the emerging - markets economies he oversaw under Clinton collapsed one after another : the policies he ’d forced on countries from Southeast Asia to Russia were technically correct , it was just that the people suffering from those policies were too primitive to understand what was good for them .
Summers , the Brain Bug of this administration ’s catastrophic enrich - the - rich economic program , is the first official whom Obama should send packing .
His entire career has been nothing but a series of disasters and failures that boggle the mind , and the last year has been no exception .
In fact the entire economic team , operating together on the same failed assumptions , should get the axe , and anyone whom they ’ve opposed should be promoted in their place .
Here I ’ve compiled a partial list of the biggest failures and crooks that Obama should send to the Government Career Execution Bus :
1 ) . Larry Summers , Director of the National Economic Council .
Villain equivalent : Brain Bug from Starship Troopers
Larry Summers photographed here in pensive repose .
Why :
In 1990 , he served as economic advisor to Lithuania ; two years later , Lithuania ’s economy crashed so hard that its suicide rate soared to the world ’s highest , and they voted back the Communists to power , the first ex-communist country to do so .
During the 1990s , Summers essentially ran Russia ’s economy , even drafting presidential decress and faxing them it to Yeltsin for his signature .
Result : Russia ’s GDP contracted 60 % , suffered the worst financial collapse of any country at that time , and democracy was replaced by Putinism .
Summers then went on to deregulate the financial industry , leading to the collapse today ( Obama just announced that he would propose new banking laws undoing Summers ’ disastrous legislation from a decade ago . )
He even bankrupted Harvard in his brief tenure there , losing the university a couple billion dollars — Harvard at least was smart enough to fire him .
Obama , a Harvard grad , should too .
2 ) . John Dugan .
Head of the OCC , which regulates banks .
Villain equivalent :
The pneumatic - cow - gun - toting villain in No Country For Old Men
John Dugan tells Sheila Bair to call heads or tails .
Why : From 1993 through 2005 , Dugan , a Republican , was a top lobbyist for Covington and Burling , where he worked with Summers and Geithner to deregulate the finance industry .
In the 2000s , as state attorney generals started to do the regulatory job that Washington would n’t , Dugan lobbied hard to deny states the ability to do Washington ’s work .
In 2005 , Dugan switched to the law - making side when Bush named him head of the OCC , where he fought to deregulate further and fend off state lawsuits against the banks that were blowing up the bubble .
In 2008 , Obama inexplicably re-appointed Dugan , and now he ’s trying to name himself the top super - regulator for all banking and finance , while at the same time doing his best to undermine and drive out the one regulator who ’s doing her job — FDIC chief Sheila Bair .
Like Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men , Dugan has been ruthlessly offing everyone who ’s got in his way in his mad pursuit of ill - begotten riches for the billionaires he ’s loyally served .
Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve chief
Villain equivalent : Smithers
Bernanke did n’t see the bubble forming as it formed , kept the easy money flowing until it was too late , secretly funneled trillions of taxpayer dollars to favored banks , and even apologized to free - market crackpot Milton Friedman , whose theories have been completely debunked by the crash .
In 2002 , while at the Fed , Bernanke officially groveled to Milton Friedman and took all the blame for the free - market - mad crash of 1929 :
“ I would like to say to Milton and Anna…regarding the Great Depression .
You ’re right , we did it .
We ’re very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n’t do it again . ”
Tim Geithner , Treasury Secretary
Villain equivalent : Ash , the cyborg in Alien with orders from corporate headquarters to harvest the monster in the guts of his crew members
Tim Geithner : “ I admire Bob Rubin ’s purity .
Unclouded by conscience , remorse , or delusions of morality …
Got milk ? ”
Geithner is the perfect failure to advance the corrupt plutocracy ’s agenda .
Serving under Summers in the 1990s , Geithner forced Indonesia to accept a ruinous economic program in return for IMF aid that caused riots and mass poverty .
China was so horrified that they built up a massive 2 trillion in dollar reserves , so as never to be in a position where Tim Geithner dictates their economic program .
In the mid-2000s , he ran the New York Fed , which was supposed to regulate Wall Street .
Instead , it was a vehicle to funnel trillions to the losers who sponsored Geithner ’s career .
For that job , and for potentially criminal activity in the AIG collapse , Geithner was rewarded with the Treasury Secretary ’s job .
Note : he has also colluded with Dugan to destroy Sheila Bair .
Why is he Ash ?
Consider this scene in Alien , when Sigourney Weaver plugs Ash ’s head back in to get answers about the alien monster — imagine this is Geithner ’s head , milk pouring out of his wheezing mouth , as Sheila Bair questions him :
Ripley : How do we kill it , Ash ?
There ’s got to be a way of killing it .
Ash : You can ’t .
Parker :
That ’s bullshit .
Ash :
You still do n’t understand what you ’re dealing with , do you ?
The perfect organism .
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility .
Lambert : You admire it .
Ash : I admire its purity .
A survivor .
Unclouded by conscience , remorse , or delusions of morality .
Parker : Look , I am , I ’ve heard enough of this , and I ’m asking you to pull the plug .
[ Ripley moves to turn Ash off , but he interrupts ]
Ash : Last words .
Ripley : What ?
Ash : I ca n’t lie to you about your chances , but ….
you have my sympathies
There are scores more who should be fired ( Neil Wolin ) , but none of this would make much of a difference unless Obama replaces them with competent officials who serve the interests of America and Americans , and not the billionaires who brought all this ruin in the first place .
Sheila Bair would be a great choice to replace Bernanke ; Elizabeth Warren to replace Geithner ; and both Dugan ’s OCC and Summers ’ NEC should be abolished altogether , the buildings fumigated and salted to ensure they remain permanently barren .
Beyond personnel changes , though , Obama needs to find a vision .
The real problem lies in the fallacy of “ post - ideological ” ideology that his administration runs on .
If you believe your own bullshit about being “ post - ideological ” you ’ll naturally fall back on the default ideology , which is the same free - market , deregulation - mad , Wall Street designed ideology that brought so much ruin in the first place .
There is no such thing as “ post - ideology ” — Obama showed this when , last year , he refused to nationalize the banks due primarily to powerful ideological objections to the very idea of nationalization of banks , regardless of its efficacy .
Obama needs to decide , ideologically , whose side he ’s on : the billionaire “ centrists ” whose alleged competence he ’s trusted unflinchingly up till now , or the people and the country he rules over , whose sufferings he ’s ignored .
But Obama was never a radical — he was always a centrist , temperamentally as well as ideologically , he was always with the consensus and with the powerful , just not as savagely as Bush was .
His big statement on the election defeat — that his problem has been a matter of substance , of not explaining to the people well enough all the wonderful work he ’s done for them — suggests that this November is going to be a painful one for those who still hold on to the Hope .

The Case of the Serial Comma
The Mystery Solved | A Puzzle Remains | The Wrong " Wrong Rule " | The Authorities Speak ! | The Letters
The Mystery Solved
Dear Readers ,
Many thanks to all who responded to my plea for help in tracing the origin of the Wrong Rule about omitting the final comma in a series ( " red , white and blue " instead of " red , white , and blue " ) .
Your letters and my further research have revealed this :
The only authorities who advocate omitting the final comma are newspaper style guides ( which wish to save column space ) and some English writers ( who waffle on the rule ) .
My original assertion stands , with minor qualifications : Except for journalists , all American authorities say to use the final serial comma : " He went to the store to buy milk , butter , and eggs . "
The reason for the final serial comma is to prevent the last 2 items ' being confused as a unit ( butter - and - eggs ) .
A Puzzle Remains
I am still puzzled that the serial comma error has been so universally promulgated .
People who know nothing else about punctuation recite this error with conviction , which says something ominous about the state of English language instruction .
Why have many English teachers taught this wrong rule ?
Are they truly unaware that press style is for journalists and that we have a wealth of better authorities for standard American usage ?
People Know the Wrong " Wrong Rule "
Complicating matters , most people remember a misleadingly simplified version of the wrong rule : " You do n't need a comma before and . "
This assumption leads people to make yet another punctuation error  to omit the necessary comma in a compound sentence , as these examples illustrate .
For the record , I include the original letter and my response , as well as several subsequent letters , which enlightened me and inspired my further study .
But first , here is what the authorities have to say .
Authorities on the Serial Comma
Wilson Follett | Kate L. Turabian | Chicago Manual of Style | William Sabin | Council of Biology Editors | Strunk and White
Wilson Follett , Modern American Usage : A Guide .
Edited and completed by Jacques Barzun in collaboration with Carlos Baker , Frederick W. Dupee , Dudley Fitts , James D. Hart , Phyllis McGinley , and Lionel Trilling .
NY : Hill & Wang , Inc. , 1966 , pages 397-401 .
Follett argues for using the final comma .
He examines the reasons for the comma's omission :
What , then , are the arguments for omitting the last comma ?
Only one is cogent  the saving of space .
In the narrow width of a newspaper column this saving counts for more than elsewhere , which is why the omission is so nearly universal in journalism .
But here or anywhere one must question whether the advantage outweighs the confusion caused by the omission .
Having analyzed the confusion created by the comma's omission , Follett concludes :
The recommendation here is that [ writers ] use the comma between all members of a series , including the last two , on the common - sense ground that to do so will preclude ambiguities and annoyances at a negligible cost .
This advice is unchanged in the most recent edition of Modern American Usage ( NY : Hill and Wang , 1998 )  even though its editor , Erik Wensberg , substantially revised many of the work 's other prescriptions .
Kate L. Turabian , A Manual for Writers , 5th Edition , Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 1987 , Chapter 3.68 :
A series of three or more words , phrases , or clauses ( like this ) takes a comma between each of the elements and before a conjunction separating the last two : Dishes had been broken , cutlery lost , and carpets damaged .
Chicago Manual of Style , 14th Edition , Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 1993 , Chapter 5.5 :
In a series consisting of three or more elements , the elements are separated by commas .
When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series , a comma is used before the conjunction . . .: Attending the conference were Farmer , Johnson , and Kendrick .
We have a choice of copper , silver , or gold .
William Sabin , Gregg Reference Manual , 8th Edition , New York : Glencoe , 1993 , paragraph 162 :
When three or more items are listed in a series , and the last item is preceded by and , or , or nor , place a comma before the conjunction as well as between the other items .
Study the rules for the use of the comma , the semicolon , and the colon .
Council of Biology Editors , Scientific Style and Format , 6th Edition , NY : Cambridge University Press , 1994 , Chapter 4.15.6 :
To separate the elements ( words , phrases , clauses ) or a simple series of more than 2 elements .
A comma should precede a closing " and " or " or . "
This rule applies to adjectives each modifying the following noun .
The tomatoes , beans , and peppers were planted in April .
[ Note : They acknowledge but discourage the omission of the final comma by some writers . ]
Strunk and White , Elements of Style , 2nd Edition , New York : Macmillan , 1972 , Chapter I. Elementary Rules of Usage , Rule 2 :
In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction , use a comma after each term except the last .
Thus write :
Red , white , and blue
Gold , silver , or copper

The Letters
Dear Miss Grammar ,
When I was in school , I was taught not to use the comma in a string of words before the " and . "
For example :
He went to the store to buy milk , butter and eggs .
However , now I 've noticed in my children 's books they are using the comma before the " and . "
Has grammar changed in the last 20 years or what ?
 Stumped
Dear Stumped ,
We would like to track down the source of the misguided instruction you and thousands of our students received about omitting the final comma in a series .
All authorities these days ( and for many years , one must add ) teach otherwise : " He went to the store to buy milk , butter , and eggs . "
The reason for the final serial comma is to prevent the last 2 items being confused as a unit ( butter - and - eggs ) .
Yours is a recurring question , both in our writing classes and to " Miss Grammar . "
I just wish I knew how it got started .
Did some teacher think it was " cool " or somehow efficient to leave the final comma out ?
My associates and I have searched through dozens of texts to find the source of this persistent non-sense , but without success so far .
Thank you for writing .

Dear Dr. Moody ,
Regarding the lack of a final comma in a series , you wrote : " I just wish I knew how it got started .
Did some teacher think it was ' cool ' or somehow efficient to leave the final comma out ?
My associates and I have searched through dozens of texts to find the source of this persistent non-sense , but without success so far . "
One of your culprits is the Associated Press Stylebook ( p. 274 ) .
" Use commas to separate elements in a series , but do not put a comma before the conjunction in a simple series :
The flag is red , white and blue . "
Personally , my flag is red , white , and blue .

Dear Miss Grammar ,
I am new to the Internet and am so happy to find these wonderful grammar sites on the Web .
I enjoyed yours very much , but I have a question / comment .
I work in an advertising agency as a proofreader .
I am constantly looking up the answers to my grammatical queries .
I recently purchased a very good reference book titled : Grammatically Correct - The Writer 's Essential Guide to punctuation , spelling , style , usage and grammar .
I am sure the title itself has made you cringe , as the disputable serial comma is missing .
I read your answer to someone 's query on your Web site regarding the use or misuse of the serial comma .
You were quite adamant that it should always be used .
However , I am finding in more and more reference books that it describes the writer 's choice as one of style .
In addition , I am noticing that it is being used much less frequently in everything from magazines to signs .
Perhaps this is simply another example of grammar as a living thing , constantly changing .
I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this .
Thank you .
KN

Dear KN ,
Thank you for writing .
As for my adamant stance , please look at the references I cite : The Chicago Manual of Style , Follett 's Modern American Usage , Strunk and White , the Gregg Reference Manual , Scientific Style and Format .
The applicable passages are quoted and referenced from the latest editions .
One does not argue against such authorities .
These are among the highest authorities on American English usage .
I could list many second - level grammarians  such as the delightful Karen Elizabeth Gordon  who follow these authorities in their own prescriptions .
Indeed , let me be so bold as to declare that any American grammarian who dismisses the serial comma as a matter of personal taste is plainly ignorant .
They should be regarded with the same scorn as those English teachers who taught us that one inserts a comma wherever one takes a breath .
After much searching and many letters from thoughtful readers such as you , I have discovered only two sets of authorities that approve of dropping the serial comma : the Associated Press Stylebook ( hence the comma 's absence in many newspapers and similar publications ) and British grammars ( which waffle on the rule , saying to use the comma if omitting it would be confusing ) .
So unless you are writing copy for the newspaper or are publishing in the UK , always use the serial comma .
Violating usage standards is scarcely a criminal offense .
If you are a professional writer or editor , however , part of your job is adhering to the applicable standards .
That the multitudes regularly violate those standards is no justification .
Lots of people say " him and me went to see the game " ; innumerable people write " it's " when they mean " its " ; and many people who are neither journalists nor English drop the serial comma .
Cheers ,

Dr Moody ,
Congratulations on a fascinating display .
There is a small point I should like to draw to your attention about the use of the serial comma .
You say in reply to an inquiry about the use of serial commas that you wonder where the notion got started that there should n't be any comma before the conjunction joining a string of words or phrases to the very last one in the series .
I have several reference works stating that both ' A , B , C , and D ' and ' A , B , C and D ' are correct although in most instances the author recommends the former option .
G.V. Carey , for example , writes in Mind the Stop , p. 65 ( Sorry no underlining or italics on my computer for e-mail ) , 'When all is said , this remains a matter for individual choice .
But it is also a matter of general principle ; you can belong to the ' final comma school ' or the ' no final comma school ' , but having made your choice , you should aim at consistency . '
Harry Shaw says in Punctuate It Right , p. 68 , 'Some writers omit the comma before the conjunction ... its use is recommended , although it may be omitted . '
Sir Ernest Gowers says in The Complete Plain Words , page 164 , '... commas are always put after each item in the series up to the last but one , but practice varies about putting a comma between the last but one and the and introducing the last .
Neither practice is wrong .
Those who favour a comma ( a minority , but gaining ground ) argue that ...'.
Please do not think that I am trying to criticize the very interesting discussion you present in your pages .
Regards ,
HM ,
Pontiac Municipality , Quebec ,

Dear HM ,
Thank you for your contribution .
Some day , I shall update the site and note your remarks with those of others who have been kind enough to respond to my plea .
Dropping the serial comma seems to be ( 1 ) a journalism peculiarity ( and the source of Harry Shaw 's dictum ) and ( 2 ) a British option ( hence Carey and Gowers ) .
Nonetheless , the current ( and most of the old ) American authorities I list at my site strongly support the final comma to reduce ambiguity .
As one ever on the side of clarity , I endorse that rule .
However : Standard punctuation is a relatively new invention , whose practice varies among languages and even among dialects of one language ( American and British English ) .
Were I to emigrate to the UK  or Canada  I should have to relearn some rules :
When in Rome . . ..

Dear Miss Grammar ,
I prefer using the serial comma , but my company follows the Associated Press Stylebook , which does not use a comma before the conjunction in a simple series .
It appears to be typical newspaper style to omit the final comma .
A Reader
Dear Reader ,
Thank you for the information .
Unless you are writing for a newspaper , however , why follow AP Style ?
All other style guides advocate using the final comma .

The six -nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) is comprised of Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , Kyrghyzstan and Uzbekistan , with observer status for Iran , India , Pakistan and Mongolia .
It was joined recently by Brazil , for trade discussions among the BRIC nations ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) , all of which seek a multi-polar world .
If it 's not a move to make US hegemony obsolete , then what 's the purpose of this new organization ?
US diplomats may well wonder .
After all , this is exactly what a multi- polar world means : no hegemony by any one country .
Another clue as to what 's about to happen : in 2005 the SCO asked Washington to set a timeline to withdraw from its military bases in Central Asia .
It seems that the US has inadvertently driven Russia , China and their neighbors to find common ground by developing an alternative to the dollar as a dominant or reserve currency , and hence an end to the US ability to run balance - of - payments deficits ad infinitum .
Mr. Medvedev called for China , Russia and India to " build an increasingly multi- polar world order . "
What this means in plain English is :
We have reached our limit in subsidizing the United States ' military encirclement of Eurasia while also allowing the US to appropriate our exports , companies , stocks and real estate -- in exchange for paper money of questionable long - term worth !

Most African governments are at best lacklustre in their response to environmental problems ; at worst , in a host of countries they are fully complicit in a wide range of unlawful activities ranging from poaching , to uncontrolled fishing and logging .
Worsening the problem are the ubiquitous “ do - gooders ”  from abroad who seem to spring up in all the wrong places with all the wrong ideas and invariably do more harm than good .
One need look no further than Gorongoza National Park in central Mozambique for an example .
Prior to the end of Portuguese colonial rule it was one of the great African game reserves , with a range of flora that stretched from enchanting Fever Tree forests to sprawling plains and sandstone cliffs .
It accommodated an abundant variety of wildlife that made it a unique natural marvel .
Of course , this was before it was turned intoa butchery by the newly installed Frelimo regime following the end of Portuguese colonial rule .
In the ghastly process the buffalo of the neighbouring Zambezi delta , numbering over 100,000 animals , were virtually wiped out ; much of the meat processed into “ bully - beef ”   and shipped to Afghanistan to fill the bellies of Soviet soldiers .
But despite the mayhem some game survived .
This attracted the benevolent , but blundering attentions of an American IT multi-millionaire by the name of Greg Carr who admirably sought to save the park from further destruction .
Sadly he has failed .
Ignoring the advice of many regional experts familiar with the wiles of the crooked governing kleptocrats , he leapt joyfully into the latter ’s welcoming embrace .
Sickeningly , Carr appears to have lauded their labours in relieving him of over $ 20 million with little to show for it short of a mountain of wrecked vehicles and hundreds of bloated employees .
Worse , word has spread , and he has managed to create a socio- economic magnet for people who now see Carr as a soft touch ; instead of protecting the wildlife ( it is a Game Reserve ) , he has triggered an influx of predatory villagers .
The plight of the remaining game is now probably more precarious than before Carr ’s intervention .
“  ”  I know some people in high places would like him dead .
It ’s a great pity , but none of the NGOs will help a guy like Darrell because they are afraid of standing on political toes . ”  ”  
But Carr keeps illustrious company in compounding Africa ’s conservation woes .
Western governments have long been generous benefactors for the various government agencies tasked with protecting wildlife , but sadly , much of the money is spent on the salaries of incorrigibly corrupt officials , providing them with transport to expand their nefarious activities .
Thanks to the arrogance and ignorance of folks like Bill Gates , Bono , and Jeffrey Sachs , the continent has been showered in millions of chemically - treated mosquito nets , most of which have by - passed the bodies they were supposed to protect and ended up lining fishing nets .
Perfect if one wants to poison fish and sterilise watercourses .
“  Without Western aid the law - enforcement agencies would not have been able to move and sell all the illegal meat , ivory , and fish , ”  says a safari- operator who wishes to remain anonymous .
Still , there might be hope : Mushingashi Game Ranch , in Western Zambia , is run by Darrell Watt ” a former soldier and wildlife enthusiast .
“  Ten years ago there was little game there , ”  says friend and former game - ranger Terry Roach .
“ now it ’s a little out of hand .
The antelope don” t even move out the road anymore .
The place is full of game ; plenty of lion , the elephant are settling and the buffalo are back . ” 
Of course , saving game was not an easy task for Watt .
“  Darrell has been harassed endlessly by government because he ’s standing on their toes , ”  says a well - known Zambian hunter who also wishes to remain anonymous .
“  Most of the game that survived years of rampant poaching has found sanctuary with Darrell … I know some people in high places would like him dead .
It ’s a great pity , but none of the NGOs will help a guy like Darrell because they are afraid of standing on political toes . ” 
In Mozambique , Derek Littleton , a former Zimbabwean Ranger , manages his concessions in Niassa Province , in the extreme north of the country , providing rare relief for the formally game - rich country ’s dwindling wildlife population .
“  Derek is doing a good job but he ’s got his work cut out for him .
He holds a candle for wildlife in this country .
For the rest of the country it ’s really game - over .
There is no real plan , people have a license to kill , and the government pays lip service to conservation .
If you want ivory the Pemba Police Station is probably the best place to buy it . ” 
Better known is Charles Davy from the Zimbabwe “ Lowveld ”  who , far from being applauded for his conservation efforts in saving a vast tract of wildlife wilderness , seems to be attracting all the wrong sort of attention .
Unfortunately for him he is a serial offender ; he is a white - hunter with a pretty daughter who dates Prince Harry ” and he ’s rich .
In a cheap shot on a “ usual suspect ”  , the London Daily Mail recently took a leap of faith in accusing Davy of involvement in rhino - horn trafficking on the strength of what one of their reporters gleaned from a taxi - driver .
Paradoxically , to the chagrin of the hand - wringing do - gooders , what these three locales have in common is they are all hunting areas .
But with strict take - off quotas in place and effective anti-poaching operations , only a small fraction of the game is ever killed .
The formula works ; these areas produce rare examples of relatively safe wildlife havens on a largely lawless continent .
Again , much to the irritation of foreign know - alls , the people at the helm are hard - bitten professional hunters who have weathered war and hostile political turbulence with a fortitude of few whites who have lived a lifetime in the African wilderness .
It ’s a wrench upon the conventional wisdom , but the facts show the hunters have got it right and the rest have got it woefully wrong .
Those who have come to help have only helped destroy .
Humanitarian “ feel - good ”  philosophies aimed at stimulating population growth and Western guilt , which leads to “ politically correct ”  interventions that do not ruffle official feathers , seem set to stay .
The only hope for African wildlife lies with those who make a living out of killing it .
This summer , Wired writer Evan Ratliff wrote a story about how people erase their identities and start over .
After it ran , he tried to disappear — spending 25 days on the lam until a few enterprising Wired readers tracked him down through some brilliant hacking and sleuthing .
Now we 're going to try the experiment again .
Evan , Wired , Loneshark Games and I are working with Universal Pictures to do another , similar contest connected to the new film Repo Men : and this time we want you to go on the run .
We need four applicants willing to disappear from their lives from late February to late March .
If they can stay hidden for that time period , they 'll end up with $ 10,000 each .
There 's more information , and an application , here .
We 'll need to recruit hunters soon too ; but now we just need folks who are willing to drop their lives and go .

Only Spica sits well inside the budget envelope set by the agency Europe 's scientists have presented the six dream space missions they would like to fly before 2020 .
The concepts ranged from a quest to map the " dark " components shaping the cosmos , to a plan to find far - off planets that most resemble Earth .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) will probably carry just three or four of the ideas forward for further study .
And it warned some of the concept teams that their likely costs would bust the budget available to carry them out .
The wished - for missions are all competing for just two potential launch opportunities , in 2017 and 2018 , under Esa 's Cosmic Vision programme , which aims to answer the " big questions " in space science .
Graph shows costs to Esa only Instrument costs will be covered by national governments
This puts the overall cost of most missions roughly on a par Spica is much lower because it is predominantly a Japanese mission
The consortia behind the proposed missions presented the details of their preparatory work to peers at the Oceanographic Institute of Paris , France .
The agency intends to allocate the best ventures up to 475 million euros ( £ 430 m ) ( at 2010 prices ) each to implement their ideas .
But the early cost estimates indicate four of the competing consortia are already struggling to shape those ideas to the cash available , and two of the missions are projected to have a final price for Esa of 600 million euros ( £ 540 m ) or more .
Mindful of the recent criticism the agency has received from member states on the issue of cost overruns , Professor David Southwood , Esa 's director of science and robotics , told the teams : " Industry and the science community need to get to work on this ; it 's a collective responsibility . "
The six consortia vying for the opportunity to fly a medium - class mission under Esa 's Cosmic Vision programme are : EUCLID - MAPPING THE 'DARK UNIVERSE '
Hubble mapped the distribution of dark matter on a small patch of sky This is a telescope designed to survey the unseen cosmos .
It will map the distribution of " dark matter " , the matter that cannot be detected directly but which astronomers know is there because of its gravitational effects on the matter we can see .
Hubble has done this for a tiny portion of sky measuring two square degrees .
Euclid will do it across 20,000 square degrees of sky .
This should give scientists new insight not just into dark matter , but also into that other great mysterious cosmological phenomenon thought to be driving the expansion of the Universe at an ever increasing rate - so - called " dark energy " .
" We will get an incredible atlas of the sky out to about 10 billion light - years , " said Dr Alexandre Refregier , from CEA Saclay , France .
" We will be able to study all the structures and the evolution . "
SPICA - TO FILL THE 'INFRARED GAP '
A joint mission with the Japanese space agency ( Jaxa ) to send the next generation of infrared telescope into orbit .
Europe 's contribution would include the 3.5 m primary mirror and an instrument .
Spica would see targets beyond the vision of the current state - of - the art infrared observatories - Esa 's new Herschel telescope and Nasa 's soon - to - launch James Webb telescope .
" Spica will be much more sensitive , " explained Professor Bruce Swinyard from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , UK .
" It means we will be able to go from studying the formation of stars to being able to study the formation of planets .
That 's a big transition . "
Jaxa would launch Spica on one of its H - IIb rockets .
A Jaxa director , Professor Tadayuki Takahashi , told the Paris meeting : " The European contribution is essential to the realisation of Spica . "
PLATO - SEARCHING FOR PLANETS LIKE OURS
The hunt is on to find more rocky planets , but in the habitable zone A spacecraft incorporating a suite of telescopes to hunt for planets around nearby bright stars .
Crucially , these would include many rocky planets in the " habitable zone " - the region around a star where water can keep a liquid state .
Plato would find these worlds by monitoring stars for the tiny dips in light that occur when planets move across their faces .
" We will end up monitoring half the sky ; it 's incredible , " enthused Dr Don Pollacco , from Queens University , Belfast , UK .
" We will study these planets and their stars in intricate detail .
And we can eventually use those planets to look for life in their atmospheres . "
Plato could dramatically increase the numbers of known rocky planets , enabling scientists to really refine their models of how planetary systems form and evolve over time .
CROSS - SCALE - SAMPLING THE SPACE AROUND US
A constellation of spacecraft that would fly around Earth to sample the charged gas , or plasma , that envelops our world .
" Cross - Scale asks fundamental questions about the nature of the plasma Universe , " said Professor Steve Schwartz from Imperial College , London , UK .
" Ninety - nine percent of the Universe we see is in a plasma state .
It 's highly energised , highly charged .
Its particles are accelerated up to energies that are far bigger than anything the Large Hadron Collider will ever do .
The fundamental physics on all of this currently eludes us . "
Esa would provide seven spacecraft ; Japan and Canada are considering their own mission ( Scope ) which could bring an additional five satellites .
Together they would sample the plasma and detail its behaviour in three dimensions .
MARCO POLO - GRABBING SAMPLES FROM AN ASTEROID Marco Polo would pick up a sample from the surface of the asteroid
A mission to a near - Earth asteroid to grab a handful of dust and pebbles off its surface to bring back to Earth labs for study .
Marco Polo is a spacecraft that would land on the asteroid to try to drill or scoop up what would be perhaps just tens of grams of material .
" It 's really all about getting back a sample from what we would call a primitive asteroid , something which has been altered as little as possible since the formation of the Solar System , " said Dr Simon Green , from the Open University , UK .
" It 's a time capsule back to 4.5 billion years ago .
It tells you what conditions were like when the asteroids formed and the Earth formed . "
This material might contain organic ( carbon - rich ) molecules that could inform us about some of the precursor chemistry that eventually started life on our own planet .
SOLAR ORBITER - GETTING UP CLOSE TO THE SUN'S ' ENGINE '
This is one of the most advanced of the concepts in terms of planning .
It would be a joint venture with the US .
Solar Orbiter would be a successor , in European terms , to the Soho and Ulysses missions .
It would circle the Sun , flying to within 35 million km of our star to make detailed measurements of the activity from the equator to the poles .
The multi-instrumented probe would both observe the Sun and take in - situ measurements of its environment .
" We want Solar Orbiter to help us understand how magnetic storms happen on the Sun and how they reach Earth , so we can predict them , " said Dr Marco Velli of the University of Florence , Italy .
" You have to go so close because you need to see the source .
If you want to understand a supersonic engine , you have to go to where it is sub-sonic .
That 's where you can see how things work .
You 'll never get that information sitting out by the exhaust . "
Although the first launch opportunity is in 2017 , the current assessment is that none of the teams will be ready to meet this date .
Esa 's Space Science Advisory Committee will convene in the New Year and rank the competitors .
Their recommendations will then go to the Science Programme Committee who must decide in mid-February which of the projects should go forward for more detailed evaluation .
It is expected at least two of the consortia 's proposals will be discarded at this stage .
A final decision on the winning missions is not expected before the end of 2011 .

Doug Glanville on baseball , its controversies and its lessons for life .
No one would have accused me of having multiple ladies on each arm when I was in high school or college .
I was a diligent student , kind of nerdy , the son of a teacher , and as interested in baseball and computers as I was in girls .
Still , I was told I had potential in the social department , if I applied myself .
But something magical happened before I had to do much work .
I signed a professional baseball contract as a junior in college and went away to my first spring training as a member of the Chicago Cubs organization .
I remember returning to campus and , after appearing on a closed - circuit cable show to discuss my new career , having the attractive hostess offer to walk me home .
Wow , that never happened before .
Apparently , I had skipped a few of the steps to social acceptance , and before I knew it , “ unapproachable ” and “ woman ” were no longer being used in the same sentence .
So what actually did happen ?
Even once you enter the professional ranks , there is plenty to worry about .
A baseball player on draft day is still miles away from the big leagues .
Soon after being drafted , I realized something profound : a lot of the work required to make it takes place off the field , and involves how you manage your life .
I witnessed a few of my minor league counterparts blow their opportunities in part because they were trying to live the life before they had the life , burning the candle at both ends every night .
If it was n’t for Phoenix ’s early club curfew , there ’s no telling when players would have come home .
Because I had a few shells to bust out of , I put my toe in that party water , too .
I was just 20 when I was drafted and it did n’t take long to understand that a new kind of woman was interested in me : the sort of woman who in the past had stirred my insecurity .
It was like a kid finding Batman ’s belt in the lost and found .
No point in giving it back until you ’ve tried all your new powers .
But we forget to ask , will I be able to stop once I ’ve tasted these powers ?
Superficially , the new bar for women was set based on the physical : some sort of exterior beauty , along with fame , sophistication , wild - child possibility , flirtation with the dark side — all qualities and places I could hardly fathom until I entered the world of a pro athlete .
It did n’t help that minor league players in spring training are in the same venues as the big leaguers .
When the day ’s training was over , the places to hang out were frequented by all levels of players , and even coaches .
As you climb the baseball ladder , your social confidence explodes .
You receive the sort of attention you never did as an acne- ridden honors student .
Quite frankly , it is addictive , and when you are in it , there seems to be no end in sight .
But it is n’t rooted in good practices ; it ’s more like , “ flash your badge and they will come . ”
Your confidence is based on a pack mentality , strong in numbers .
You can push aside the inconvenience of having to start a conversation — just by being in the V.I.P. section and offering tickets to the next day ’s game , the conversation is started for you .
If you have a well - connected agent or an entourage to find you a companion , you might not need conversation at all .
At the very least , your newly acquired wealth can keep the drinks flowing to the point where you do n’t feel like you ’re trying to ask your first - grade crush , Michele Soleimani , to borrow her pencil .
The above dynamic grows exponentially , and before you can blink , your bad relationship habits are written all over the contact list on your cell phone .
So where can you end up ?
Tiger Woods country .
In an athlete ’s environment , money can be its own pollutant ; you can become desensitized to the significance of what it can buy .
Typically , if a person spends hundreds of dollars on arrangements to pass time with someone , that someone would be important in his life .
But when you have extensive financial resources , it ’s easy to send similar signals to people who are meaningful only for a moment .
Even worse , you might only concern yourself with what it means to you .
As the money flows in , so do the toys — cars , clothes , bling — and once in the stratosphere , a la Tiger , it is amazing how easy it is , if you are not careful and grounded , to start seeing women as another accessory in your life .
The pro athlete ’s world is self - centered at best .
Schedule is fixed , practice a must , travel a given .
Anyone choosing to share that has to get on board and fit in .
It can get to a point where the relationship is strictly one - way ( the athlete ’s way ) , and the other party becomes insignificant , more a prop than a true relationship partner .
If the player dares to take the next step — marriage — there will likely be a legal team at his disposal ( via his agent ) that can set up a prenuptial agreement .
This negotiation is often dragged out for months as a way of seeing whether the future spouse shows an ugly side during the process .
But it ’s a red flag for your relationship if you have to resort to such tactics to force the worst in someone , and the prenup becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy , set up not just to distribute assets but to deal with an inevitable break - up or philandering .
In fact , it might as well be seen as a pre-meditated agreement ( I may do all of this dirt , so when I do and you want to leave , I still win because instead of half you only get a check for X dollars and one house ) .
Reducing a marriage to time , money and X is usually a bad way to start .
But in the athletes ’ world , relationships can get crafted around their whims .
The spiritual significance of an enduring commitment falls by the wayside , giving way to parameters and rules defined by the ego of the player , and maybe his legal and PR team .
Although it does n’t have to be this way , relationships can become part of the world of glitz and illusions .
With that kind of unstable foundation , it ’s easy to see how someone like Tiger Woods could see his world come crashing down simply because he hit a fire hydrant .
Tiger Woods has been transformational for the game of golf in so many ways .
That is indisputable .
But he has proven to be just like every other figure who fell for the little guy with the pitchfork on his shoulder telling him , “ It ’s all good , no one will know , you can get away with it . ”
But that little guy on his shoulder did n’t tell him that in the real world , you do n’t get away with it because even when you are the only one who knows , that is enough to destroy you .
It just will happen from the inside out .
( Reuters ) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress are preparing to merge the two healthcare bills passed in 2009 by the Senate and House of Representatives into a single bill .
This compromise bill would have to be passed by both chambers of Congress before being sent to President Barack Obama to sign into law .
Healthcare reform is Obama ’s top legislative priority , and the Democrats are aiming to overcome unified Republican opposition .
Here is a detailed summary of the major differences between the House and Senate versions that Democrats must resolve .
INSURANCE MARKET REFORM
Both bills would bring insurance market reforms barring insurers from excluding people for pre-existing conditions and preventing them from arbitrarily dropping policy holders .
Both bills would create insurance exchanges in which small businesses and individuals without employer - sponsored health benefits can shop for coverage .
The Senate bill would create state - based exchanges .
The House bill would create a national exchange but would allow states to operate state - based exchanges if they meet minimum requirements .
The House bill would allow insurers to charge older people up to twice the amount they charge younger policy holders .
The Senate bill would allow insurers to charge older people up to three times what they charge younger people .
The Senate bill would allow young people to stay on their parents ’ insurance plans until the age of 26 .
The House bill would allow such coverage until age 27 .
Both bills would place limits on how much insurers can spend on administrative costs and profits .
The Senate bill would require insurers to spend at least 85 cents of every premium dollar on medical care in small group markets and 80 cents in large group markets .
The House bill would require insurers to spend at least 85 percent of premiums on care .
PUBLIC OPTION
The House bill would create a new government health insurance plan to compete with private insurers .
This “ public option ” would have to meet the same coverage requirements as private insurers .
The Senate bill has no public option .
The Senate bill would direct the U.S. Office of Personnel Management , which oversees health policies for 8 million federal workers and their families , to contract with private insurance companies to offer policies on the exchanges .
Both bills also would create nonprofit cooperatives to provide medical coverage to members .
FINANCING
Another big difference between the two bills is how they are financed .
The House bill would impose a 5.4 percent surtax on individuals earning more than $ 500,000 a year and couples making more than $ 1 million .
It also would raise money by imposing a 2.5 percent excise tax on medical devices .
The Senate bill includes a 40 percent excise tax on high - cost health insurance plans .
It also would raise payroll taxes for Medicare , the government health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled , to 2.35 percent from the current 1.45 percent for individuals earning $ 200,000 or more annually and for couples earning $ 250,000 or more .
The Senate bill includes special fees on insurers , drug companies and medical device makers and would impose a 10 - percent tax on indoor tanning .
ABORTION
Abortion could be another contentious issue .
Both bills would bar the use of federal funds to pay for an abortion .
The House bill contains tougher language that would require anyone seeking coverage for elective abortions to buy separate insurance riders .
The Senate bill would let states opt out of including plans with abortion coverage on the exchanges and would require anyone with abortion coverage to write two separate premium checks -- one for the abortion coverage and one for the rest .
MEDICAID COVERAGE
The Senate bill would make Medicaid , the government health insurance program for the poor , available to everyone with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty level .
The House would expand the Medicaid program to everyone with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level .
The poverty level in 2009 for an individual was $ 10,830 and for a family of four $ 22,050 .
Many states have eligibility requirements below that level .
COVERAGE MANDATES
Both bills would require most individuals to obtain health insurance and would impose penalties on those who do not .
The House bill would impose a 2.5 - percent penalty tax on income up to the average cost of an insurance policy .
The Senate would phase in a $ 750 - per- person annual penalty up to $ 2,250 per family or a penalty of 2 percent of taxable income , whichever is greater .
The full penalty would take effect in 2016 .
EMPLOYER MANDATES
The House bill would require employers with payrolls above $ 750,000 to provide health insurance to workers .
Those who do not provide insurance would face a penalty of 8 percent of payroll .
Employers with a payroll between $ 500,000 and $ 750,000 would pay fines on a sliding scale of 2 percent , 4 percent and 6 percent of payroll .
The Senate bill has no such employer mandate .
But large firms with more than 50 workers would have to pay a fine of $ 750 annually per worker if any of their employees obtain federally subsidized coverage on the exchange .
Workers with employer - sponsored plans with costs deemed unaffordable -- exceeding 9.8 percent of salary -- may drop that coverage and purchase federally subsidized insurance on the exchange .
In those cases , the employer would pay a fine up to $ 3,000 per worker receiving the insurance subsidy .
In some cases the Senate bill would require employers with health plans to provide cash vouchers to lower - income workers to obtain insurance on the exchange .
The people of Manchester have either lost all interest in travelling abroad and drinking , or could n't give a monkey 's about the government 's lame duck ID card scheme , if a commons answer is anything to go by .
Manchester is the first big trialling ground for the ID card scheme , before a broader trial across the rest of the North West .
The government has been spending almost half a million quid trying to publicise the scheme in the city , touting its uses when travelling to Europe and clubbing .
And the results so far ?
Meg Hillier , the Home Office minister stuck with responsibility for the scheme , revealed in a Commons answer this week that a whacking 1,300 people in Greater Manchester " have applied and attended an enrolment appointment for an identity card " between November 30 and January 14 , 2010 .
Allowing for three Bank Holidays and weekends , that works out to around 43 people a day .
Hillier revealed that over the same period , 439,000 passport applications were received by the Identity and Passport Service .
However , she said that passport info was not " readily held in a format to enable a further breakdown of those resident in Manchester " .
She added that while ID card applicants could also apply for a passport , the two processes were currently separate .
Fingerprint biometric passports are due to kick in from 2012 , at which point anyone seeking a passport can also get an ID card .
However , a quick back of the envelope calculation using those figures suggests that while 0.7 per cent of the UK population as a whole was applying for a passport , a mere 0.05 per cent of the 2.5 m Greater Mancunians were rushing to get an ID card .
If you use the population of the city proper , the rate is 0.26 per cent .
Back in October , the government said 2,000 people in the North West expressed an interest in applying for the card .
That suggests a conversion rate that would make a direct mail firm proud .
though how many more people have joined the queue remains to be seen .
Perhaps those eager early birds are simply hoping to have a truly unique collectable if the Tories scrap the benighted scheme if / when they get into power . ®
A long - term study showing the changes in habitat associations of polar bears in response to sea ice conditions in the southern Beaufort Sea has implications for polar bear management in Alaska .
Karyn Rode , a polar bear biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage , Alaska and one of the study 's authors , says data collected between 1979 and 2005 show that polar bears in the region are occurring more frequently on land and in open water and less frequently on ice during the fall .
This means there are increased chances for human / bear interaction .
The paper was published in the December issue of Arctic -- the journal of the Arctic Institute of North America .
Polar bears were observed over the 27 - year period by U.S. government Minerals Management Services staff as part of the fall bowhead whale aerial survey conducted annually in the southern Beaufort Sea .
Ice conditions were also recorded .
Data showed that as ice conditions changed , bears were being found on different habitats .
Between 1979 and 1987 , 12 % of bear sightings were associated with no ice .
Between 1997 and 2005 however , 90 % of bear sightings were associated with no ice .
" When bears were seen , they were more often seen in open water and on land than on sea ice .
At the same time , changes were observed in ice , suggesting that these observations are connected , " says Rode .
In addition , the number of bears sighted steadily increased from 138 bears in the years 1979 - 1987 , to 271 bears between 1988 and 1996 , and finally to 468 bears between 1997 and 2005 .
Rode warns that this study was not designed to estimate the number of bears using the nearshore area .
Data were drawn from studies created to track bowhead whale migration routes , not polar bear populations .
Therefore , it should not be concluded that more bears are occurring in the nearshore waters off the Southern Beaufort Sea coast .
However , Rode states that " Our results do suggest that bears that use the nearshore area are more likely to occur on land in recent years because their preferred habitat , sea ice , is unavailable .
" This is one of the few data sets available over such a long time frame .
It shows there has been a shift in habitat use , " she says .
In the Beaufort Sea region , there was less ice in 2005 than when the study period began in 1979 .
In general , freeze up is later and spring melt comes earlier with measurements showing since 1979 the summer melt period has increased by 13 days per decade .
This is one reason for the region 's rapid retreat of multi- year ice , which provides a thicker , more stable platform for hunting and denning .
This work is helpful in highlighting the need to proactively develop programs to manage bear - human interactions in coastal areas .
Bear - human interactions in Native villages and with industry in Alaska have been on the rise in recent years .
This media release is part of the Promotion of Arctic Science , an Arctic Institute of North America project made possible with the generous support of the Government of Canada Program for International Polar Year .
The mission of the Arctic Institute of North America at the University of Calgary is to advance the study of the North American and circumpolar Arctic and to acquire , preserve and disseminate information on physical , environmental and social conditions in the North .

The synod is the ruling body of the Church of England
The ruling body of the Church of England has voted in favour of extending equal pension rights to the civil partners of deceased clergy .
The move by the general synod will give civil partners the same rights as heterosexual widows or widowers .
Previously , partners of gay clergy were allowed benefits , but only in respect of service since 2005 when civil partnerships were first legalised .
Gay clergy are accepted by the Church on the condition they are celibate .
Those in active gay relationships are still banned .
Pension deficit The Reverend Mark Bratton , from Coventry , argued in the synod on Thursday that the existing rules were unfair and that many gay partners provided invaluable support in the life of their parish .
" The injustice of the current arrangement is obvious , " he said .
" The benefit to the reputation of the Church of remedying this injustice will be great , and I believe , inversely proportional to the small cost . "
The Reverend Jeffrey John was embroiled in a row over his sexuality
His motion was passed despite some concerns over the Church 's pension deficit - said to be as much as £ 360 m - and the ongoing controversy surrounding gay bishops .
In 2003 , the Reverend Jeffrey John said he had been forced to step down as Bishop of Reading - despite insisting his gay relationship was celibate - because of the " damage " his consecration might cause to the unity of the Church .
And just this week , the synod heard a plea for recognition from breakaway Anglican dioceses in the United States which have split from the mainstream Church over the ordination of gay bishops .
The Rev Mark Bratton stressed that , for him , extending pension parity was a point of fairness .
But the BBC's John McManus , who was at the synod , said outsiders could be forgiven for being confused as to where Anglicanism really stood on homosexuality .
' Undermining our mission ' A series of other speakers backed the motion , including Canon Giles Goddard , from London .
He said the perception that the Church was homophobic was " deeply undermining our mission as Christians " .
Simon Baynes , a lay member from St Albans , said he had been " struck " by the case of the Rev Jeffrey John in particular .
" If Jeffrey died , his partner of over 30 years would receive £ 3,370 per annum , " he said .
" But if , instead of being in a partnership for 30 years , Jeffrey had been married for just a few days before he died , his widow would receive £ 7,550 per annum . "
The synod rejected a proposed amendment to the motion , which would have seen pensions extended to siblings who had devoted their lives to caring for a brother or sister who was a member of the clergy .

Before and after : entire colonies of bees have collapsed in the US
The decline of honeybees seen in many countries may be caused by reduced plant diversity , research suggests .
Bees fed pollen from a range of plants showed signs of having a healthier immune system than those eating pollen from a single type , scientists found .
Writing in the journal Biology Letters , the French team says that bees need a fully functional immune system in order to sterilise food for the colony .
Other research has shown that bees and wild flowers are declining in step .
Two years ago , scientists in the UK and The Netherlands reported that the diversity of bees and other insects was falling alongside the diversity of plants they fed on and pollinated .
Now , Cedric Alaux and colleagues from the French National Institute for Agricultural Research ( INRA ) in Avignon have traced a possible link between the diversity of bee diets and the strength of their immune systems .
" We found that bees fed with a mix of five different pollens had higher levels of glucose oxidase compared to bees fed with pollen from one single type of flower , even if that single flower had a higher protein content , " he told BBC News .
You 've now got large areas of monoculture ; and that 's been a fairly major change in what pollinating insects can forage for
David Aston
British Beekeepers ' Association
Attack of the killer everything Bees make glucose oxidase ( GOX ) to preserve honey and food for larvae against infestation by microbes - which protects the hive against disease .
" So that would mean they have better antiseptic protection compared to other bees , and so would be more resistant to pathogen invasion , " said Dr Alaux .
Bees fed the five - pollen diet also produced more fat than those eating only a single variety - again possibly indicating a more robust immune system , as the insects make anti-microbial chemicals in their fat bodies .
Other new research , from the University of Reading , suggests that bee numbers are falling twice as fast in the UK as in the rest of Europe .
Forage fall With the commercial value of bees ' pollination estimated at £ 200 m per year in the UK and $ 14bn in the US , governments have recently started investing resources in finding out what is behind the decline .
In various countries it has been blamed on diseases such as Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ( IAPV ) , infestation with varroa mite , pesticide use , loss of genetic diversity among commercial bee populations , and the changing climate .
Varroa mite infestation could be made worse by lower bee immunity
The most spectacular losses have been seen in the US where entire colonies have been wiped out , leading to the term colony collapse disorder .
However , the exact cause has remained elusive .
A possible conclusion of the new research is that the insects need to eat a variety of proteins in order to synthesise their various chemical defences ; without their varied diet , they are more open to disease .
David Aston , who chairs the British Beekeepers ' Association technical committee , described the finding as " very interesting " - particularly as the diversity of food available to UK bees has declined .
" If you think about the amount of habitat destruction , the loss of biodiversity , that sort of thing , and the expansion of crops like oilseed rape , you 've now got large areas of monoculture ; and that 's been a fairly major change in what pollinating insects can forage for . "
As a consequence , he said , bees often do better in urban areas than in the countryside , because city parks and gardens contain a higher diversity of plant life .
Diverse message
While cautioning that laboratory research alone cannot prove the case , Dr Alaux said the finding tied in well with what is happening in the US .
There , collapse has been seen in hives that are transported around the country to pollinate commercially important crops .
Biodiversity near ' point of no return ' " They move them for example to [ a plantation of ] almond trees , and there 's just one pollen , " he said .
" So it might be possible that the immune system is weakened ... compared to wild bees that are much more diverse in what they eat . "
In the US , the problem may have been compounded by loss of genetic diversity among the bees themselves .
In the UK , where farmers are already rewarded financially for implementing wildlife - friendly measures , Dr Aston thinks there is some scope for turning the trend and giving some diversity back to the foraging bees .
" I 'd like to see much greater awareness among land managers such as farmers about managing hedgerows in a more sympathetic way - hedgerows are a resource that 's much neglected , " he said .

SAN JOSE , Costa Rica —
Would a libertarian nationalize key industries and govern like Hugo Chavez ?
Apparently some Costa Ricans think so — and they just might vote for him .
Libertarian candidate Otto Guevara has turned Costa Rica ’s presidential election on its head , stunning opponents by surging into second place .
But as Guevara continues to rise in the polls , it 's unclear whether his countrymen understand what libertarianism entails .
Guevara , 49 , wants to eliminate Costa Rica ’s currency , slash income taxes and declare the country 's crime problem a state of national emergency .
Yet many voters seem to believe his Libertarian party falls to the left of the incumbent center - right party .
This perception is n't helped by the fact that his campaign manager used to be a communist .
His ascension comes at the expense of former Vice President Laura Chinchilla , 50 , who had looked poised to become Costa Rica ’s first female president .
Guevara has risen to 27 percent in polling by CID - Gallup , up from 8 percent in August .
Meanwhile , Chinchilla is polling at 44 percent .
If neither candidate exceeds 40 percent in the Feb. 7 election , it will go to a runoff .
This is Guevara ’s third campaign for president , and the Libertarians clearly feel that they 've finally gotten it right .
In the last elections , they finished with less than 10 percent of the vote .
At a campaign rally this month at an amusement park in San Jose , Guevara seemed most confident .
He stood before his faithful in party colors — a red jacket and white shirt beneath — with his shiny dark hair slicked back , almost like a Costa Rican Robert De Niro in “ The Untouchables . ”
Guevara made headlines that day by announcing a push to eliminate Costa Rica ’s currency , the colon , in order to dollarize the economy , as Ecuador , El Salvador and Panama have done .
Costa Ricans currently use both the colon and the dollar , and Guevara argues that if the wealthy do their transactions in dollars , everyone else should be able to as well .
“ We want Costa Rican salaries to be paid in the same currency as the ones paid to high executives in private banks , ” he said .
His list goes on with bold pledges to provide every student with a laptop , slash income taxes and burn bureaucratic red tape .
The applause grows loud as he exclaims , “ Making money is not a bad thing ! ”
Spending it apparently is n’t either .
His campaign had spent more than $ 1 million on advertising by mid-December , according to a report in La Nacion , forcing Guevara to fend off speculation about the source of his finances .
The rumors include an allegation that Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli , one of the region ’s only libertarian leaders , donated to his campaign .
Guevara has denied the charges .
One ad caused quite a stir for showing a man walking down the street in his boxers .
When asked why he was walking “ chingo ” ( Costa Rican for naked ) , the man replies “ because that ’s the only way they see that I ’m not carrying anything , and they do n’t rob me . ”
Then Guevara enters promising an iron fist on crime .
With the election only a few days away , the buzz around Guevara has pollsters somewhat perplexed .
Carlos Denton , co-founder and president of CID - Gallup , said a lot of people do n't seem to understand what Guevara 's program stands for .
He said most Costa Ricans see Chinchilla 's National Liberation Party ( PLN ) as the center - right party in the race , with many believing the Libertarians fall to the left .
" They ’re not comprehending that Libertarians are actually to the right of what the PLN is . "
The United States has a longer standing libertarian tradition than Costa Rica , boasting such high - profile followers as magazine publisher Steve Forbes and former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan .
But until now , Costa Rica ’s libertarians had been a comparatively fledgling group .
The Libertarian Movement party ( ML ) formed in 1994 and four years later , got one of its founders , a 37 - year - old Harvard educated attorney , elected to the Legislative Assembly .
The attorney was Otto Guevara .
After battling his way as the party ’s only congressman , Guevara went on to run for president , making considerable gains with each campaign , from 1.7 percent of the vote in 2002 to 8.4 percent in 2006 .
The growing support earned the party six out of 57 seats in the assembly .
Part of the confusion about ML 's ideological stance comes from the fact that Guevara ’s campaign manager was a member of the communist party Vanguardia Popular in the 1970s .
Roger Retana said he believes that libertarianism today possesses what he was seeking in those days in Marxism : utter freedom of the individual .
This belief , he said , has been misconstrued by local media .
“ The central ideological beliefs of the Libertarian Movement is liberal thought , ” Retana said .
“ Our central focus is through liberty to empower the entire creativity of the individual .
This of course does n’t mean renouncing the state and the social responsibility it should have . ”
In Costa Rica , which prides itself on socialized health care and public education and has been one of the slowest Latin American countries to give up its state - run telephone monopoly , Retana ’s last comment is vital to any campaigner , no matter the political stripe .
Despite Guevara ’s campaigning efforts , his iron - fist , smaller government messages have gotten lost on some Ticos .
“ That guy in power would be like having Hugo Chavez ! ” said a Guevara opponent , Edwin Cardenas , comparing a Guevara presidency to the left - wing president of Venezuela , famous for swelling the size of government and nationalizing key industries .
That ’s not likely from a libertarian .
Meanwhile , if the election were today , 30 percent of decided voters might cast their ballots to see Guevara in power .
“ I will vote for Otto , because I think he has the best government plan to push Costa Rica forward , to stop crime and corruption , and we want change now in all this bureaucracy , ” said Verny Quesada , a graphic designer .
It remains to be seen if enough undecided voters tip the balance to force a runoff — not to mention whether those voters understand what it means to cast a ballot for a libertarian .
THE number of applications for international patents fell by 4.5 % in 2009 compared with the year before to 159,000 as companies in Western countries cut back on R&D spending during the recession .
Yet applications from east Asian economies , including Japan and South Korea , increased slightly , while those from China soared by 30 % .
Since 2005 applications from China have grown by 210 % as the country has developed a home - grown high - tech sector .
But , reflecting America 's economic power and corporate dynamism , the United States is still the country from which the most filings orginate , and it has a huge lead .
However , the number of American applications has fallen substantially from a peak of 54,000 in 2007 .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to repeal the antitrust exemption currently granted to health insurance companies .
The vote was 406 - 19 to repeal the exemption , which has been in place since the end of World War II .
The 19 who voted against the repeal are Republicans .
Liberal Democrats have said a repeal would help inject competition into the health care industry while reducing consumer costs .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters Tuesday that President Obama strongly supports the repeal .
" At its core , health reform is all about ensuring that American families and businesses have more choices , benefit from more competition and have greater control over their own health care , " Gibbs said .
Read the bill
" Repealing this exemption is an important part of that effort .
Gibbs said the president is not seeking repeal of the exemption in lieu of broader changes to the insurance market .
" This is a complementary step along the way , " he said .
The debate in the House on Wednesday included a colorful moment between Rep. Anthony Weiner , D - New York , and Republicans .
" You guys have chutzpah , " Weiner told Republicans during the debate .
" The Republican Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry , " he said , drawing the objections of Republicans , who asked that his words be stricken from the record .
Weiner then asked for unanimous consent to replace his words and said , " Every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry . "
The Republicans objected again , prompting Weiner to rescind his words .
The House version of the health care bill passed last year would have removed the antitrust exemption , while the Senate 's version would not .
Advocates of an exemption repeal say the exemption has allowed health insurance companies to essentially divide the country into geographic zones .
They argue the companies benefit from what amounts to local monopolies .
Industry defenders , in turn , point out that insurers are still subject to state regulations .
They say the impact of an exemption repeal is overblown .
CNN Fact Check : Would exemption repeal lower premiums ?
Administration officials and their allies in Congress have taken an increasingly tough stance against the unpopular insurance industry .
Among other things , Obama 's latest proposal for health care reform would give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurers .
Specifically , Obama 's plan calls for the secretary of health and human services to work with a seven - member board made up of doctors , economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium increases .
The board , to be known as the Health Insurance Rate Authority , would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved , although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators .
The antiques world was rocked ( okay , more like gently bumped ) when a recent episode of Antiques Roadshow estimated a woman 's collection of carved Chinese jade objects at $ 710,000 to $ 1.07 million .
Either figure would make it the highest - appraised item in Antiques Roadshow history .
Unfortunately , when the woman actually sold the items at auction , she only got $ 494,615 .
Why the discrepancy ?
It 's complicated -- read about it here if you want the blow - by - blow from real antiques experts .
Meanwhile , below I have collected the Top 10 Antiques Roadshow valuations ( actually 11 items , as there 's a tie for second place ) , courtesy of YouTube user Ultranothing .
The jade still comes in first as I 'm counting by valuation , despite its later actual sale value being lower than predicted .
1st Place : Jade Collection
$ 710,000 to $ 1.07 million .
Tie for 2nd Place : Clyfford Still Painting
$ 500,000 " insurance value " ; a conservative estimate .
Tie for 2nd Place : Navajo Ute First Phase Blanket
$ 350,000 - $ 500,000 .
3rd Place : 1790 's Card Table
Purchased for $ 25 , valued at $ 200,000 - $ 300,000 , and apparently sold in 1998 for $ 541,500 .
4th Place : Art Deco Jewelry Collection
$ 257,000 .
5th Place : Patek Philippe Split Chronograph Watch
$ 250,000 .
6th Place : Painting of Ships Possibly by James E. Buttersworth
$ 200,000 - $ 500,000 if restored and painter 's identity verified .
It turned out not to be a Buttersworth , but still sold for $ 288,000 ( it was by Antonio Jacobsen ) .
7th Place : 6th - 9th Century Chinese Marble Sculpture
$ 120,000 - $ 180,000 at auction , $ 150,000 - $ 250,000 for insurance .
8th Place : 1840 's Solid Gold Sword
$ 200,000 and up .
9th Place : Charles Schulz Cartoon Collection
$ 150,000 - $ 200,000 at auction .
10th Place : Jasper Cropsey Painting
$ 150,000 .

Number of Republicans in America Reaches Record High
After falling for two straight months , the number of Americans who consider themselves Republicans jumped nearly three points in August .
During August , 37.6 % of Americans considered themselves Republicans .
That ’s up from 34.9 % in July and 35.4 % in June .
It ’s also the largest number of Republicans ever recorded by Rasmussen Report since monthly tracking began in November 2002 .
The previous peak for the GOP was 37.3 % in September 2004 .

Whether you ’re a designer , developer , animator , or blogger , your workstation plays a major role in how you get things done .
Some of us like a neat , clean , and inspiring workspace , while others require a crazy over - the - top hardware configuration .
In this article , we ’ve compiled a showcase of photos that will give you workstation envy .
The thing about workstations is that even if you have a nice one , seeing another awesome setup can make you a bit jealous .
They should insist on adding reforms that would do more to reduce costs , in order to avoid higher income , payroll or similar taxes .
( These taxes are different from the proposed excise tax on high - cost health insurance , which would actually reduce health - care spending . )
Further cost - saving reforms could include meaningful changes in medical liability law ; better opportunities for people to save money when they take steps to lower their health care costs ; and Medicare savings from greater use of competitive bidding .
Some elements of the Democratic legislation could be part of a bipartisan agreement  for instance , help for people with limited means and / or high medical needs to buy insurance in a competitive marketplace .
Such a market would let people easily compare a broad range of options and keep the savings if they chose a less costly plan .
Republicans should also build on proposals to enable health care providers to get higher Medicare payments when they deliver better care at less cost .
For example , the Democratic bills would let providers share in Medicare savings if they can show that the way they prevent and manage illnesses reduces complications and costs Medicare less .
Republicans should further propose that Medicare strengthen its capacity to provide data and measure patient outcomes  to help providers and to evaluate changes in care quickly .
This is desperately needed to help make Medicare sustainable while improving the quality of care .
Currently , doctors lose money when they work with nurse practitioners , pharmacists or wellness programs to help patients avoid costly complications  because Medicare does n’t pay for this , and it results in fewer billings for the visits , tests and procedures Medicare does pay for .
All these steps can add up to a health care system that does much more to support patients and health professionals in improving our health and saving money .
That ’s a bipartisan opportunity we can’t afford to miss  either because Democrats are unwilling to change or because Republicans insist on starting over .
 MARK McCLELLAN , director of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution and former Medicare administrator in the George W. Bush administration

When Americans think about health care , they think first of health , not finance .
They go to the doctor to get well , not to show off their government - issued insurance card .
So President Obama ’s health care reform plan was doomed from the moment the American people figured out that his goal was to spend less on health care .
Before Steve Jobs had even brought yesterday 's iPad- announcing keynote to a close , I called together a quorum of indie gaming 's Justice League — a handful of the best and brightest developers pushing the medium forward across every new device — to ask : what 's the iPad going to mean for the future ?
Between those that 've already staked out a strong presence on the iPhone and iPod Touch ( Canabalt 's Adam Saltsman , Eliss 's Steph Thirion , Rolando 's Simon Oliver , Spider : The Secret of Bryce Manor 's David Kalina and Critter Crunch 's Nathan Vella ) , those that 've seen their PC hits brought to the device ( Fantastic Contraption 's Colin Northway ) , those that have n't landed there yet but will soon ( Fez 's Phil Fish and Henry Hatsworth 's Kyle Gray ) , and those that I selfishly hope eventually might ( World of Goo's Kyle Gabler ) , opinions were cautious , but on the whole optimistic .
While it 's clear that the past two years of training on the iPhone have taught us that there is indeed a viable future in multi- touch and accelerometer - based gaming , and that the App Store can provide developers with an enthusiastic and sustainable audience , its position as a third - pillar between the phone and the laptop is entirely unproven , leaving many developers in a holding pattern before diving nose - first into an unquantifiable market .
But despite this , with the problems it solves ( like : the issue of the Big Fat Thumbs ) and the opportunities it opens ( its screen is now not necessarily only for a single person ) , you can already hear the sound of hundreds of collective gears turning to chart gaming 's future course .
So below , the thoughts of all the above developers , with — as a bonus where applicable — off - device screenshots that blow up to their iPad-native 2 x resolution when clicked , for a preview of what the device 's scaling simulator will look like when it lands in March .
Adam Saltsman , co-founder , Semi Secret ( Canabalt , Wurdle ) , creator of Flixel :
I have been forcefully ignoring all the buzz until today , but I have to say I 'm a little giddy right now .
Pixel doubling means Canabalt is ready to ship right now , and I did all the assets for Wurdle ( and our new unannounced game ) at 2 x resolution , so we can actually very easily ship ' HD ' versions of those alongside our iPhone res stuff .
They have n't shown much in this regard , but this device is pretty much begging to be subjugated for all sorts of insane multitouch music composition purposes , and there 's also the possibility here to do something pretty special , which is finally getting to do what board games do – a big shared playspace that you interact with in an intuitive way .
This would be a pretty big deal in getting people into games that might otherwise be intimidating from a dual - sticks perspective .
We 're also making a big tech announcement that will be super extra awesome , very soon I hope !
Colin Northway , creator of Fantastic Contraption :
Two things strike me as interesting about this : 1 ) is there going to be another gold rush ?
And the more interesting : 2 ) What kind of games are going to work really well on the iPad ?
The first question is really just about answering if we can afford to explore the second .
The iPhone 's interface has proved itself capable of supporting some great game experiences that would n't work nearly as well with a mouse .
You could play Flight Control perfectly fine with a mouse but you would n't draw the same sweeping natural lines .
At the same time there is a brutal lack of screen real estate which means some game ideas just can't exist on the iPhone or feel shoe - horned onto the iPhone ( like Fantastic Contraption ) .
So this is kind of the best of both worlds .
We get the wonderful tactile interface but people do n't have to squint to see what 's going on or wish they had see - through fingers .
There will be some people with game ideas that did n't quite work on the iPhone who will be dusting them off and examining them under this new light .
I am definitely one of those people .
Kyle Gray , creator of Henry Hatsworth , Experimental Gameplay Project co-founder :
The Apple Hype Machine never fails to impress .
I was in the middle of a meeting when this thing was announced and my inbox practically exploded with talk about the iPad in the interim ( mostly from you lot , but some from friends pitching ideas as well ) .
Most surprisingly was my wife falling in the " do want " category .
It 's a real testament to Apple 's prowess that it can have such a strong pull on someone who 's more into purses than processors .
That being said , a buddy and I have been working on an iPhone game in our spare time , so this is pretty damned exciting news .
Now to just make something for it without getting pulled in by its siren 's song …
Phil Fish , co-founder , Polytron ( Fez and the iPhone 's upcoming Power Pill [ above ] ) :
It is n't the huge leap forward in terms of multi - touch interface i was hoping for , but it 's certainly still a big step forward .
It is n't the multi - touch terminal to my MacBook I think it should be .
Lack of camera is a missed opportunity for augmented reality overlays that the 1ghz processor would handle a lot better than even a 3GS .
I guess it 's up to the developers to make good use of it now .
But I 'm still incredibly giddy .
" Just a bigger iPhone " is already a huge step forward in terms of multi- touch usability .
I do n't understand what people are complaining about .
A bigger screen here means a lot more than just a bigger screen .
It implies so much more .
Backwards compatibility with iPhone apps is good , but is just that .
The real meat is going to be in iPad exclusives , designed for the huge real estate .
Simon Oliver , founder , Hand Circus ( Rolando and the upcoming Okabu ) :
The larger real - estate is going to be great , in terms of being able to interact with it without your fingers smothering the screen , and being able to add more functionality without tons of clutter .
I think it definitely opens up the iPhone / iPod / iPad range to quite a few genres that a lot of people might have considered verboten previously – you know those games on the iPhone where the screen is covered in UI clutter .
Simulation and construction games , MMORPGs ( I 'm sure Blizzard was watching the keynote with avid interest ) , and as Adam was saying , this is gonna be awesome for fun music / painting / animation creation tools and games .
With that big touchscreen you 've got a perfect canvas for creative play .
I hope an iPad lands in Toshio Iwai 's lap !
I 'd love to do a Rolando title with a more " zoomed - out " perspective – i.e. same size characters but you can see 4 x the playspace – would definitely be fun to explore what the bigger screen could afford in terms of more elaborate puzzles , more characters and fun multitouch interactions .
David Kalina , co-owner , Tiger Style ( Spider : The Secret of Bryce Manor ) :
While the iPad seems like a pretty incredible piece of hardware , I can't help but wonder if there will actually be a viable marketplace for an independent game developer .
The iPhone revolutionized the way people thought about cell phones , whereas the iPad seeks to occupy some hole between the laptop and the phone that may or may not actually exist .
Of course , the market has a way of working these things out .
As a developer of touch interfaces , more screen real estate really does make a difference beyond allowing us to draw more pixels on the screen .
It means that we should be able to communicate to players more clearly when fingers are present , as well as allowing multiple touches to take place without obscuring all of the game content .
Hopefully , this will encourage developers to explore more native interfaces for their games , rather than settling for the awkward and uninspired ' virtual gamepad ' .
But also , it gives developers the potential to explore interesting new designs for single - device multiplayer .
As a designer , this is the aspect of the iPad that I find most intriguing .
Steph Thirion , creator of Eliss :
I just spent the past two hours reading announcements and tech specs and iPad programming guides , so my head is a bit fuzzy , and it 's a bit early to come to conclusions .
I still have a lot of important questions , but here are some early thoughts and feelings .
Like my girlfriend was just saying , this could be ' the Wii of general computing ' : accessible to everyone .
This is the first device ( at an accessible price ) that makes web browsing like reading a newspaper : a casual , pleasurable thing , not done on a professional workstation .
And for the not so common tasks ( like Adam said , music making , etc. ) , a multitouch screen of this size for $ 500 is absolutely mad ( JazzMutant are officially fucked ) .
As far as gaming , I think David has a very good point ( why go for expensive development for a smaller market ) , but on the other hand , if the first point holds true , and a couple of these devices start to pop up in every household , then we have a market .
What we could potentially see then is the border disappearing between general computing devices and gaming devices !
Any way this evolves , this device opens up a world of possibilities for new interfaces .
Even if we do n't get rich off of it , we 'll still be able to build the coolest shit on it .
But even then , we still need to hold one of these devices .
Are they truly responsive ?
If I 'm correct , this is the first time Apple has made their own processor .
How many touch points does the multitouch handle ?
Is multitouch as precise as the iPhone ?
Following on Apple 's history , this device will rock , but that does n't change the fact that we have n't yet seen it fly .
Finally , is it true that all apps in the AppStore can be run on the tablet , without modifications , without a green light from the developer ?
I have n't tested Eliss on the iPad , yet Apple has basically announced that it 's coming out for this new device I had only heard rumors about .
If this is true I find this a bit surprising .
We should have the right to decide if we want to allow our apps to be run and stretched on a different device than they were designed for .
Nathan Vella , president , Capy Games ( Critter Crunch and the upcoming collaborative Superbrothers : Sword & Sworcery EP ) :
When it comes down to it , I am really excited to see what people make for the platform .
Some of my favorite games of 2009 were iPhone games , and despite the fact that there 's an astronomical amount of shit on the App Store , the gems ( pretty much exclusively made by indies ) really validate it .
I sincerely hope the same thing happens with the iPad .
Sure , we 'll get our Need for Speeds and our Monkey Balls , but it 's the games from Steph Thirion , Hand Circus , Mr. Saltsman / Semi-Secret , Mobigame and the other super - awesome indies that will pull me into the platform as a gaming device .
While functionality - wise it does n't offer an earth - shattering step forward from the iPhone , I think there 's a lot of possibilities for insanely creative people to make something special for the iPad .
On the " specs " side , since Capy ( and Capy in collaboration with Superbrothers ) makes iPhone games with pixel art , I am really interested to see how the device handles its up - scaling .
We 've always thought of iPhone as a great place to continue our love of pixels , so I am terrified at the thought of muddy anti-aliased pixel art ( much akin to what happens when you zoom in Firefox 3 + ) .
Here 's hoping that they implement it in a way that easily and effectively maintains nice clean pretty pixels .
We have our collective fingers crossed .
Capy is working on a WiiWare game called Heartbeat , and we 've been toying with the idea of eventually bringing it to iPhone , since games built specifically for the Wii interface have a real good shot at translating well into touch controls .
Now that there 's another addition to the iPhone " family " – specifically one with a big - ass higher - res screen – it certainly makes that possibility more interesting .
The combination of WiiWare and iPad / iPhone might be a powerful thing to consider for future development , especially for small studios making interesting stuff on WiiWare .
I know for sure we 'll have a huge push internally to put our Capy / Superbrothers / Jim Guthrie collab Superbrothers : Sword & Sworcery EP on the iPad .
Superbrothers would probably sacrifice a limb to get the game on that screen , and rightfully so .
It would look mighty pretty at that resolution .

The Airborne Laser just ca n’t deliver a beam with enough power ( Image : Jim Shryne / USAF )
The laser works in testing but is too weak to be effective ( Image : MDA / ABL )
A laser - toting Boeing 747 blasted two missiles out of the sky earlier this month , but despite this apparent success the Pentagon is going back to the drawing board in its search for an anti-missile laser weapon .
Advertisement
The ABL ’s problem is that it ca n’t deliver enough power over enough distance to be genuinely useful , so the culmination of a project begun in 1996 and costing an estimated $ 5 billion will be to downgrade the ABL to a “ testbed ” .
It will be handed over by the Missile Defense Agency to the US air force for general research use .
ABL will be used for more tests this year , but the MDA ’s latest budget documents reveal it will devote the rest of its “ directed energy research ” budget towards a new kind of laser yet to even escape the research lab .
Non-lethal energy
Last May , Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Congress that the ABL ’s range was limited to 135 kilometres , well short of the minimum requirement of 200 km .
The distance over which the recent tests took place has not been disclosed , but it is believed to be relatively short .
Future tests will try longer shots , but it looks like the chemical oxygen iodine laser ( COIL ) used just ca n’t deliver lethal energy through hundreds of kilometres of dusty , turbulent atmosphere .
That ’s largely because the laser ’s bulk limits what can be fitted into a 747 , which directs the beam through a turret in its nose .
Room for only 6 of the 8 to 14 laser modules the design asked for could be found .
New contender
The leading candidate to provide megawatt - class power in a more compact package is a new twist on an idea first proposed at the dawn of the laser age 50 years ago – alkali lasers .
Their light is emitted by vaporised alkali metals such as caesium or potassium .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is developing “ diode - pumped ” versions of alkali lasers and reports they have “ mass - to - power ratios that far exceed what is possible with today ’s other laser systems ” .
That makes them good candidates for delivering high power in constrained spaces like an aircraft .
The new system fires an array of high - powered diode lasers , a type used in consumer gadgets like DVD players , into a cloud of alkali metal atoms .
The energy is absorbed by their outer electrons and then released as laser light .
Scale and efficiency
The most powerful alkali lasers so far only produce tens of watts , while the MDA needs more than 10,000 times that .
But current designs should scale easily to about a kilowatt of power , says Bill Krupke , a laser consultant who worked at Livermore for 27 years and holds a patent on diode - pumped alkali lasers .
Flowing the vaporised metal through the laser – a technique already used in the ABL – could scale the technology to much higher powers , he says .
The best alkali laser reported so far , by Boris Zhdanov of the US Air Force Academy , had an overall efficiency of 30 per cent , compared with the ABL ’s estimated 20 per cent .
If MDA wants to shoot down missiles from the air , alkali lasers may be the only feasible option .

The Beijing government has approved plans to build a Disney park in Shanghai , representing a major milestone in the more than decade - long effort by the Walt Disney Co. to build a theme park in mainland China .
Disney submitted plans in January that had been developed jointly with the Shanghai municipal government to build a $ 3.59 - billion park to open as early as 2014 .
It would be the entertainment giant 's fourth theme park location outside the U.S. , after Paris , Tokyo and Hong Kong .
This framework agreement received formal approval from the central government , Disney said today .
The central government 's action clears the way for Disney to work out detailed plans to build and operate the park , a final plan that would address infrastructure issues such as subway and road access to the park , as well as finances .
" China is one of the most dynamic , exciting and important countries in the world , and this approval marks a very significant milestone for the Walt Disney Company in mainland China , ” said Disney President and Chief Executive Robert A. Iger .
Disney has been in on - again , off - again discussions with the government in China since 1995 , when the Shanghai government first contacted the company to propose building a theme park in the city .
Talks have ebbed and flowed since then , with discussions resuming in earnest about two years ago , according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of negotiations .
The new park would give Disney access to 300 million people who live within a day 's travel of Shanghai , a sprawling , affluent and modern city of about 16 million people .
The new Magic Kingdom - styled theme park would have amenities similar to other Disney destinations around the world , while nodding to its Shanghai region .

Ephedra - free Lipo - 6 x stacker causes heart attack After the American government outlawed ephedra slimming supplements as a result of hundreds of fatalities , the supplements industry introduced ephedra - free stackers .
Perhaps not as effective as the outlawed ephedrine - based stackers , these alternatives were safer .
Unfortunately ' safer ' does n't mean ' completely safe ' .
Cardiologists at the American Walter Reed Army Medical Center have reported a case of an almost fatal heart attack , which was probably caused by the ephedra - free stacker Lipo - 6 x .
Lipo - 6x , manufactured by Nutrex Research , contains no ephedrine , the active ingredient in the forbidden Ephedra sinica extracts .
According to the label , Lipo - 6 x contains substances related to ephedrine such as synephrine [ structure on the right ] , beta - phenylethylamine , n- methyl - beta - phenylethylamine , tyramine and hordenine .
These substances are found in extracts of the legal Citrus aurantium and Acacia rigidula , and they imitate the effect of adrenalin .
In addition , Lipo - 6 x contains caffeine , a stimulatory compound that makes cells more sensitive to adrenalin .
It also contains yohimbine and guggulsterones .
The article that the cardiologists published in the Texas Heart Institute Journal describes a 24 - year - old man who collapsed at work with chest pain and breathing difficulties .
The man had done a 2 - hour weight and cardio training session that morning .
The man was a picture of health : not overweight , no diabetes , no high blood pressure , healthy blood values , non-smoker , did not use steroids , drugs or alcohol , had no family history of heart problems .
And he was in peak condition : he trained five times a week .
The only risk factor the doctors could find was that the guy took Lipo - 6 x just before training , twice a week .
His dose was 1 capsule .
And he'd a capsule the morning he had a heart attack .
When the doctors examined pictures of the blood vessels in the man 's heart muscle , they saw that an important blood vessel was no longer working .
The picture below shows a blood clot that was partially blocking the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery [* ] .
The distal left anterior descending coronary artery was completely blocked [ # ] .
The doctors did microsurgery to try and clear the blood vessels .
They were partially successful , as the photo below shows .
The blood clot in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disappeared [* ] , but the distal left anterior descending coronary artery remained blocked [ # ] .
The doctors put the man on aspirin , beta - blockers , statins and ACE - inhibitors .
He recovered and was discharged from hospital .
The researchers believe that it was the supplement that caused the man to have a heart attack .
Lipo - 6 x does n't contain ephedrine , but ephedra - free stackers are not without health risks .
" Our case highlights the potential health hazards associated with supplements that contain sympathomimetic compounds similar to ephedra " , the cardiologists conclude .
" In light of these facts , as well as the empiric risk of synergism in the above - mentioned agents , we believe that performance enhancement use was the precipitant of this patient 's cardiac event , and we believe that greater FDA involvement in the regulation of such supplements is warranted " .

Enlarge By Justin Sullivan , Getty Images Toyota announced it would halt sales of 8 Toyota models in the U.S. that are involved in a recall for potential accelerator pedal problems .
The recall includes the Camry , shown here on a lot in San Rafael , Calif .
Read more on TM at
In an unprecedented auto - industry move — but echoing the massive Tylenol drug recall of 1982 — Toyota told its U.S. dealers Tuesday to immediately quit selling the new and used cars and trucks that it recalled on Jan. 21 because their throttles could stick open .
Toyota ( TM ) also said that it will quit building 2010 versions of those models Monday and that the halt will last until it finds a remedy for the stuck - throttle problem .
That could take weeks , the company previously said , but it gave no forecast Tuesday .
Toyota has suspended U.S. sales of eight models , which were recalled to fix accelerator pedals that might stick .
These models are : 2005 - 10 Avalaon , 2007 - 10 Camry , 2009 - 10 Corolla , 2010 Highlander , 2009 - 10 Matrix , 2009 - 10 RAV4 , 2008 - 10 Sequoia and 2007 - 10 Tundra .
For auto shoppers , it means that some of the most popular Toyota - brand vehicles will be harder to find or not available .
" This is major , " says Jessica Caldwell , senior auto analyst at industry tracker Edmunds.com .
The eight vehicles involved make up about two - thirds of Toyota - brand sales in the U.S. , she estimates .
Toyota 's Lexus and Scion brands are not involved in this recall or the sales and production halts .
DEALERS SCRAMBLE : Move puts lots of inventory off limits
It 's the right move — finally , says James Bell , executive market analyst at auto research site kbb.com .
" It reminds me how conservative the culture is at Toyota . "
Until Tuesday , Toyota had said it would continue making and selling the 2010 versions of the recalled models .
It said the sticking - throttle problem appears only with age and wear , so new ones are safe .
" Restoring confidence in Toyota " and ensuring customer safety were cited by Toyota U.S. Vice President Bob Carter as reasons for the halt .
" Toyota can recover , but this major and perhaps unprecedented step suggests the problem is serious , " says Carl Tobias , professor at the University of Richmond 's law school .
On the other hand , he says , the drastic action shows that " Toyota is serious about fixing " the problem as well as its image .
Tylenol maker Johnson & Johnson pulled pain medicine Tylenol from shelves in 1982 when seven people died after taking it .
Those packages had been tampered with and poisoned .
J&J later was praised for bold and fast action .
Tylenol regained its popularity quickly once it returned to the market , with anti-tampering packaging .
Toyota 's sticking - throttle recall is different from the recall of 4.2 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles late last year .
In that one , throttles could get jammed open by floor mats .
Toyota is trimming the gas pedals and later will replace them with pedals of a different design .
However , 1.7 million vehicles in the latest recall also are included in the floor - mat - related recall .
TOYOTA'S SAFETY ADVISORY : What Toyota said and news on the recall
The sticking - throttle problem involves only vehicles using accelerator - pedal assemblies from CTS , a component supplier , Toyota says .
Some Camry plants , for example , use assemblies from another supplier , and those cars will still be made and sold .
In its first public comment since the recall , CTS said Tuesday that of 1.4 million pedals surveyed , only eight had the sticking - throttle problem .
WASHINGTON  Ralph D. Fertig , a 79 - year - old civil rights lawyer , says he would like to help a militant Kurdish group in Turkey find peaceful ways to achieve its goals .
But he fears prosecution under a law banning even benign assistance to groups said to engage in terrorism .
The Supreme Court will soon hear Mr. Fertig ’s challenge to the law , in a case that pits First Amendment freedoms against the government ’s efforts to combat terrorism .
The case represents the court ’s first encounter with the free speech and association rights of American citizens in the context of terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks  and its first chance to test the constitutionality of a provision of the USA Patriot Act .
Opponents of the law , which bans providing “ material support ” to terrorist organizations , say it violates American values in ways that would have made Senator Joseph R. McCarthy blush during the witch hunts of the cold war .
The government defends the law , under which it has secured many of its terrorism convictions in the last decade , as an important tool that takes account of the slippery nature of the nation ’s modern enemies .
Call it the Walmart of weed .
In a 15,000 - square - foot warehouse just down the road from the Oakland Airport , an entrepreneur is opening a one - stop shop for medicinal marijuana cultivation that ’s believed to be the largest in the state .
Do n’t know the first thing about growing pot ?
The folks at iGrow have a doctor on site to get you a cannabis card and sell you all the necessary equipment for indoor , hydroponic cultivation – from pumps , nutrients and tubing to lights and fans .
Do n’t know how to set it up ?
For a fee , on - site technicians will show you how to build it in your home and even maintain it weekly .
“ A lot of people do n’t know much about growing pot , ” said Dhar Mann , 25 , the owner , who stood in front of an array of Ikea - like displays , showing different rooms of cannabis cultivation systems .
“ Since there are no full - service resources like us , they take risks , like electrical fires . ”
This is hardly a fringe business .
When iGrow opens today , at least three City Council members will attend .
So will most of the leaders of the cannabis industry in Oakland , a city long at the vanguard of medicinal marijuana .
Today ’s opening also comes on a key day for proponents of a statewide ballot measure to allow recreational marijuana .
They plan to turn in about twice as many signatures as needed to qualify the measure for the November ballot .
The supporters of that measure are being led by Richard Lee , owner of Oaksterdam University , an Oakland - based business that trains people for work in the cannabis industry .
The medicinal marijuana world is still unsettled .
Cities from Los Angeles to Berkeley are grappling with how to permit and regulate medical marijuana dispensaries .
Oakland , where voters last summer agreed to have the city to tax and regulate “ cannabis businesses , ” has allowed only four licensed dispensaries .
Though iGrow provides all the supplies and know - how for cannabis cultivation , they do n’t sell the seedlings – only dispensaries can .
And even some of the vendors tread a delicate line .
Gabriel Goodhart , the owner of Easy Feed Systems based in West Oakland , was setting up one of the system displays at iGrow on Wednesday .
His company has an explicit policy of not setting up any system where marijuana is visible when they show up – or even mentioning the word “ marijuana . ”
“ Liability is shifting , ” said Goodhart , a libertarian who is a registered Republican .
“ A small business like ours ca n’t take the risk . ”
But , he believes , the issue is a moral one .
“ It ’s not fair to medical patients to put them in a gray area where they have to be involved in criminal activity to stay healthy , ” he said .
“ That ’s like not having health insurance . ”
The cost of creating your own cultivation system or relying solely on a dispensary is vast .
At a dispensary , a patient might spend $ 120 a week for a quarter - ounce of marijuana .
However , it might cost $ 1,000 to set up an eight - plant system , said Zeta Ceti , one of iGrow ’s “ indoor growing technicians . ”
But in the course of a year , they might only use half of their harvest and be able to sell the remaining 3 pounds for $ 12,000 to a dispensary .

Having a very sharp knife goes a long way toward preventing disastrous knife slips , but there are oh - so - many ways of cutting yourself with any kind of knife .
Tom Mylan , a Brooklyn butcher , shares his hard - earned tips on avoiding bad blade slips .

Photo by sfllaw .
Mylan 's not just writing from some high holy mountain of expertise , either — the man 's honest about knowing every single way one can cut themselves , whether cooking dinner or breaking down a carcass .
Beyond the basics of having sharp blades , he offers a mental reminder of what your knife grip should feel like :
The first element to avoiding your blade is keeping it in your hand .
As Fleisher 's Aaron Lenz describes it , you should hold your knife like the butt of a pistol , fingers wrapped tightly around the grip " like someone was trying to take it away from you . "
Some people hold a boning knife like a conductor 's baton during a particularly slow part of Pachelbel 's Canon .
This is wrong .
You will either drop your knife through your fingers , causing you to cut your knife hand with your knife , or , more likely , lose track of it in your brain 's motor control center and cut the hand holding the meat .

Read on for more of Mylan 's advice about cutting , cleaning , and never , ever leaving your knife on a cooking surface .

A federal judge is dismissing lawsuits accusing the government of teaming with the nation 's telcos to funnel Americans ' electronic communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker 's decision was a major blow to the two suits testing warrantless eavesdropping and executive branch powers implemented following the 2001 terror attacks .
The San Francisco judge said the courts are not available to the public to mount that challenge .
" A citizen may not gain standing by claiming a right to have the government follow the law , " ( .pdf ) Walker ruled late Thursday .
He noted that the plaintiffs include most every American connected to the internet or to have used a telephone – meaning the lawsuits boil down to a " general grievance " and are barred .
The decision came days after a government audit showed the telecom companies and FBI collaborated for four years , between 2003 and 2007 , to violate federal wiretapping laws .
Judge Walker said that the lawsuits , in essence , cannot be brought because they are " citizen suits seeking to employ judicial remedies to punish and bring to heel high - level government officials for the allegedly illegal and unconstitutional warrantless electronic surveillance program or programs now widely , if incompletely , aired in the public forum . "
Cindy Cohn , the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation that brought one of the cases , said the decision means " when you 're trying to stop the government from doing something illegal , and if the government does it to enough people , the courts can't fix it . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which said it would appeal Walker 's order , and others originally brought suit against AT&T and other telecommunication companies in 2006 .
That was a month after President George W. Bush acknowledged a Terror Surveillance Program after it was disclosed in The New York Times .
The EFF , based on a former AT&T 's documentation , claims the program was , and continues to be a dragnet where carriers funnel customer communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
Bush , however , acknowledged the program as one in which his war powers granted him the authority to monitor American ’s telecommunications without warrants if the subject was communicating with somebody overseas and was suspected of terrorism
Walker tossed the case against the telecommunication carriers ( .pdf ) in June , after Congress – with then - Sen .
Barack Obama 's vote – immunized the carriers from being sued for their alleged conduct .
The 2008 legislation also authorized the Terror Surveillance Program as outlined by Bush .
That decision by Walker , which is on appeal , gave new focus to the two lawsuits targeting the government that Walker tossed Thursday .
The Obama administration argued that the case decided Thursday should be dismissed on grounds it threatened to expose government secrets , a legal privilege judges routinely rubber stamp .
The government also asserted " sovereign immunity , " a principle in which the government cannot be sued unless it has given consent .
Walker declined to rule on those arguments .
The ruling also elevates the importance of another lawsuit testing the president ’s authority to spy on Americans without warrants .
That suit involves two American lawyers accidentally given a " top secret " document showing they were eavesdropped on by the government when working for a now - defunct Islamic charity in 2004 .
That case is pending before Walker .

The World Junior Championship is typically a tournament for 19 - year - old players .
It 's by far the most prestigious and most popular tournament for junior hockey , earning the eye of scouts and fans alike each December .
Despite the incredible talent at the tournament every year , it 's not considered to be a big tournament for draft eligible players .
The best of the best will certainly find their way on the team , but every year is crucial in development -- 19 - year - olds are just better prepared for the tournament .
Look no further than Colorado 's Matt Duchene for a player passed over for this tournament .
For a country like Slovakia , winners of just one medal ( a bronze ) in the history of the tournament , the tournament can be tremendously challenging .
Slovakia has put together competitive clubs over the years , but it 's very difficult for a young player to stand out , even if they 're given ice time .
Apparently , no one this to told Tomas Tatar .
Barely 18 and a virtual unknown before the tournament , Tatar emerged as a star at the 2009 WJCs .
Tatar led Slovakia in scoring with seven goals and 11 points in seven games , including several highlight reel goals and a pair of clutch goals in a huge upset over the United States .
After Detroit selected Tatar in the 2nd round the following June , many were wondering if Tatar 's WJC performance was a fluke , or if he was the real deal .
That was a question that Tatar soon answered .
Despite being drafted into the OHL , and having an offer to play professional hockey in Slovakia , Tatar focused in on making the AHL and earning a contract from Detroit .
He did .
Visa issues kept him out of the first few games , but Tatar found himself a regular after the first month of the season .
Production was slow at first , but Tatar started to catch fire in November , becoming one of the top scorers on the Griffins during that team .
All this was despite being the youngest player in the league .
Tatar not only proved his WJC was not a fluke , but he proved to be a steal for Detroit at 60th overall .
Winging it in Motown had a chance to speak with Tatar about his adjustments to the AHL , his performances at the WJC , and being invited to Slovakia 's Olympic camp .
WIM : How do you feel you feel this season is going ?
TATAR : I feel great here .
It ’s a man ’s league here , I think it ’s pretty good .
It ’s a perfect experience for my hockey life .
I feel the league is really good , and I like it here .
WIM : How has it been adjusting to the AHL from Slovakia ?
TATAR : This league is so much more physical and faster .
The big difference here is age .
The Slovak league plays with older guys .
They are smart , but they do n’t skate like everyone does over here .
Everyone here wants to play in the NHL , so everyone ’s fighting for their place .
I think there is a big difference with the speed in the league , and the physical play , like in the corners .
WIM : Being the youngest player in the league , what were your expectations of yourself coming into the AHL ?
Did you think you ’d be able to score as much as you have ?
TATAR : I do n’t know .
I was a little nervous coming here because I had never played in the United States before .
Some leagues never play in North America .
I was a little bit nervous , but I had to learn the style here because it ’s a little bit different .
Many times here you just dump the puck and force it .
I needed to learn that , and I think now I ’m ok .
But in Grand Rapids , now , we are not really good in the standings .
We must be better , and we need some confidence in the locker room .
WIM : After you were drafted in both the NHL and OHL ( drafted by Kitchener , rights traded to Plymouth ) , did you have any preference about playing professional or junior ?
TATAR : Yeah .
When I was in camp and someone asked me where I wanted to play , I always said here , in the AHL .
Last year I played in the men ’s league in Slovakia .
I think it would be a step back to go play in the OHL , with the junior club .
I think the junior league here is so good , too .
But I play with men last year , so I was ready for big battles in the corner -- for typical men ’s hockey .
I felt like it would be a step back to go play in junior .
WIM : Going back to the draft last year , did you think that Detroit was interested in you ?
TATAR : Yeah .
I had many meetings with other teams , but Detroit called me a couple times .
They were checking me in some games in the Slovak league .
They talked with me in Toronto in the draft combine .
I thought that Detroit was a team that could draft me .
WIM : Were you a Red Wings fan growing up ?
TATAR : Yeah , they were my favorite team .
I was so excited .
WIM : Did you get a chance to meet anyone you idolized growing up ?
TATAR : Yeah , almost everybody , all the NHL guys .
I met with everyone from the managers to the players , all the big stars .
It was a good experience for me , too .
WIM : What were your impressions of the organization and the city when you were in your first camp ?
TATAR : I knew something about the organization before .
They asked me all the normal questions , and what the plans were for me with the Detroit Red Wings .
It was just all the normal questions for anybody playing somewhere new .
WIM : How would you describe your style of play ?
TATAR : Almost everybody thinks about me like I ’m a sniper .
I think if I have a chance , I know I can get a goal , but I think I ’m a pretty good passer , too .
I think maybe I ’m a playmaker , too .
I like playing physical , and fighting in the corner .
I like playing in the offensive zone .
I must work hard on my speed .
Here , in North America , almost everybody is a good skater .
I need to be a little bit better with that , and in the defensive zone .
You know , everybody has a different hockey style , and I need to get better in the defensive zone .
Here they are so different with defensive styles , not like in Europe .
WIM : How close do you feel you are to playing in the NHL ?
What might you need to work on ?
TATAR : I am still young , so I have time to get to the NHL .
I ask guys what is the biggest difference between the NHL and AHL , the guys say it ’s almost the same .
I must work hard and always be ready for the call up .
WIM : Moving on to the World Juniors , did you expect Slovakia to perform well after last year ?
TATAR : This year was a much different team than last year ’s .
This year was a much different year for the players .
Last year , we went in , and it was like nobody knew about Slovakia or something .
We were the biggest surprise in the tournament .
This year , nobody took it easy on us .
Everybody knew we were pretty good .
We won against America .
It was tough for us .
Maybe some players played specially against me .
It was so tough .
On the roster , we had very offensive guys , but not as many guys for defense .
We made a lot of mistakes in the defensive zone , and I think that was the problem .
WIM : Heading into last year ’s tournament , as a draft eligible player in a tournament for 20 - year - olds , did you expect you ’d score as much as you did ?
TATAR : It was a different tournament than this one .
We were a young line , with Richard [ Panik , who is Tampa Bay property ] and Marek Viedensky [ San Jose ] .
We know we are not the best players .
We said that we must play simple , and if we have the chance , shoot the puck on the net .
We had maybe a little luck , because it was like almost every shot was going in .
But , I think if you want to play hockey , you will need luck .
We might have had luck , but it was such a good tournament .
We had a good team in the defensive zone .
The goalkeeper [ Jaroslav Janus , Tampa Bay ] was so great .
It was a good experience for me .
WIM : What ’s a typical game day like for you ?
Do you do anything special ?
TATAR : No , I do n’t have a special ritual .
Usually the guys will go somewhere together to eat and talk a little bit about hockey , like what we need to do , what we need to work on together .
After , just a nap , and wake up and be ready for hockey .
WIM : Since you ’re in the United States for your first year , what do you do in your spare time to relax ?
TATAR : You know , I am so excited here .
There is so much stuff I can do after practice .
Almost every day I do something different .
It ’s such a different country .
Sometimes we go to the mall , sometimes to the cinema , sometimes going to a bar , going to dinner .
We were in Chicago , in the downtown .
There is so much to do here .
The guys show me , almost every day , something new .
WIM : What did it mean to you to get invited to Slovakia ’s Olympic camp ?
TATAR : Wow , that was a really good experience .
I was so happy .
I do n’t want to go to the Olympics , because I feel I ’m not ready for Olympic games .
But I was there with guys who played many years in the NHL , and I think they ’re so good .
It was a big experience for me .
I just asked guys what they do in the summer , and , same like here , I was new there , so guys would take me somewhere .
I had a great time there .
WIM : What players in particular helped you out ?
TATAR : Pavol Demitra , Marian Hossa , Zdeno Chara , almost everybody who ’s going to the Olympics .
There were big names .

A quarter of women over 35 say they never have sex
More than a quarter of women aged 35 - plus say they ' never ' have sex , according to research .
Twenty - eight per cent claim to abstain , with the highest figure occurring in Scotland , where 38 per cent are celibate .
Women in the Midlands are most likely to make love regularly , with 32 per cent saying they have sex every week .
Twenty - eight per cent of women over 35 admit never making love
Couples therapist Paula Hall , who works with the relationship charity Relate , said the results of the survey highlight the immense pressure women feel when it comes to sex .
This in turn could lead them to underrate their sex lives .
She said celebrity kiss - and - tell stories fuel the notion that frequent sex is the norm , but the reality is very different with the daily grind of work affecting the libido of many women .
Miss Hall added : ' It has led to exaggerated expectations , that everyone else is getting it three or four times a week and your behaviour is n't normal .
' This may result in women saying they never have sex when they may only occasionally be having sex . '
The survey , released by the Sky Real Lives cable channel to mark the launch of a series called The Secret Guide To Women 's Health , also looked at the effect of hormones on women 's lives and their health fears .
It found most women admit to violent mood swings at certain times of the month , with 35 per cent of those aged 35 to 44 saying they feel violent tendencies towards themselves or someone else during their period .
The poll of 745 women also found 42 per cent of those aged 35 to 64 have sought medical help for depression or are thinking about doing so .
Pandora Finally Turns A Profit
For the first time since it was launched in 2005 , the automated music recommendation service Pandora has managed to turn a profit .
“ We became profitable for the fourth quarter of 2009 , and now we ’re shooting for profits for the entire 2010 [ period ] , ” said Pandora CTO Tom Conrad in a recent chat with technology wonk Om Malik .
Conrad fails to specify exactly how much profit the company pulled down , but given the embattled , post - apocalyptic wasteland that is the modern music industry , it ’s impressive that Pandora is n’t deep enough in the red to give Sissy Spacek traumatic prom flashbacks .
Personally I adore Pandora , if only because its ability to show me new music that I actually dig is rivaled only by former MTV VJ Matt Pinfield .
Since he ’s been booted from the network in favor of reality shows about greasy Italian stereotypes , I ’m praying to every eldritch horror that ever occupied a corner in one of Lovecraft ’s fever dreams that Pandora lives forever .
“ Through strange eons , even death may die , ” and all that , right ?

A San Luis Obispo rancher who for years has illegally housed homeless people was ordered today to serve 90 days in jail .
A defiant Dan de Vaul stretched out his arms and let deputies place handcuffs on him before being led out of the San Luis Obispo courtroom .
The 66 - year - old defendant was offered probation after a jury convicted him in September of two misdemeanor violations of building and safety codes at his Sunny Acres ranch .
But De Vaul refused the terms of his probation because he said it would mean he could no longer provide shelter for about 30 people who reside in his sober - living facility .
For eight years , he ’s operated the program on his 72 - acre ranch , housing clients in mobile homes , tents , garden sheds and an aging Victorian home .
For a time , he also housed people in a three - story stucco barracks until it was shut down last year .
“ The first condition of probation is obey all laws , ” De Vaul said before the hearing , which was attended by about 30 of his supporters .
“ I ’m proud to go to jail for housing the homeless .
” Superior Court Judge John Trice said San Luis Obispo officials have repeatedly offered to help De Vaul bring his property up to code .
But De Vaul has declined all attempts at help , Trice said .
“ Such conduct can only be viewed as irresponsible and arrogant , ” the judge said before sentencing him to jail .
De Vaul was also ordered to pay a $ 1,000 fine .

Two men on a hike in a San Mateo County park came face - to - face with a pair of mountain lions , swung a stick to try to drive them away and hustled back to their car as the cougars followed them , state officials say .
The incident took place Sunday at Pescadero Creek County Park near La Honda and was verified by game wardens from the state Department of Fish and Game .
Officials closed the park until Thursday as they looked for the mountain lions , without success .
The incident was one of the most dramatic verified showdowns in the Bay Area between humans and the expanding mountain lion population .
" We found actual tracks and our tracking dogs picked up on the scent right off , " said game warden Patrick Foy .
" It was very obvious to us it was a credible story with real lions .
We put the hounds on the ground and they struck a scent immediately .
" Unfortunately , the lions were successful in escaping , " Foy said .
" There 's two aggressive lions ... out there . "
Residents warned
San Mateo County officials put out calls to all residents in the vicinity of Loma Mar and La Honda , the settlements closest to the county park , and posted warnings .
After being closed for four days , the park reopened Thursday .
The county issued another alert that a mountain lion had been seen Wednesday night in La Honda , a couple of miles north of the park .
There was no way of knowing whether it was one of the lions that confronted the hikers .
There have been rare attacks by mountain lions on hikers , mountain bikers and joggers elsewhere in California , but there has not been a confirmed attack in the Bay Area since a rabid cougar mauled a Sunday school teacher and one of her students near Morgan Hill in 1909 .
The two died of rabies .
Hiked off trail
Sunday 's face - off started when two brothers in their early 50s headed out for a hike at Pescadero Creek County Park , a remote , lightly visited open space with no facilities .
The two brothers , who asked not to be named in a Fish and Game report on the incident , told game wardens they occasionally enjoy straying from the trail " to see what 's on the other side of the bush , " according to Foy .
They hiked on Camp Pomponio Road , which goes through middle of park , and about 10 minutes in , wandered a few hundred yards off the trail , Foy said .
Near a creek , in a clearing at the edge of a densely vegetated area , a mountain lion emerged and walked right up to one of the hikers .
" The hiker shouted aggressively , but the lion did not go away , " Foy said .
" So he picked up a big stick and swung at the lion .
His brother came to his side and a second lion started closing in . "
Foy said the hiker never struck either cougar but eventually " managed to drive off the lions . "
Lions on their trail
The hikers then started to return to their car , but looked back and saw the lions were following them .
" You could see them the whole time , " one told game wardens .
The brothers described the lions as about thigh - high , Foy said , probably about 125 to 140 pounds , typical for a female lion and a yearling still traveling together .
Pescadero Creek County Park , along with adjoining Sam McDonald , Memorial and Heritage Grove county parks and Portola Redwoods State Park , comprise nearly 10,000 acres of contiguous parkland that includes redwood forests , grassland foothills and the headwaters of Pescadero Creek and other streams .
" It 's an awesome area , " Foy said .
" It 's amazing how remote it is , being so close to the Bay Area . "
Although mountain lion attacks are rare , they have become more numerous in the past couple of decades .
According to Fish and Game records , all but three of the confirmed attacks on people in California since 1890 have happened in the past 25 years .
The increase coincided with state voters ' approval of a 1990 initiative designating mountain lions as a protected species , even though they were not threatened or endangered .
The lions filled existing habitat and then expanded their range , at the same time the human population was moving farther into previously open space .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Hong Kong residents appealed to China on New Year ’s Day to allow full democracy to be introduced soon in the city , as opposition lawmakers pressed forward with a mass resignation plan later this month .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Congregating outside the city ’s historic domed legislature , protesters carried colorful banners with slogans such as “ Democracy Now ! ” and made their way to Beijing ’s representative office .
Some demonstrators held aloft portraits of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo , demanding the release of the prominent activist and writer , jailed last week for 11 years on a subversion charge .
Organizers said more than 30,000 protesters turned out for the New Year ’s Day “ return our right to universal suffrage ” march .
Police put the number at around 9,000 .
Hundreds of police erected steel barricades as protesters with loudhailers converged on Beijing ’s liaison office in the former British colony , returned to Chinese rule in 1997 .
There were minor scuffles when police tried to prevent a small number of protesters from storming the office .
A group of five pro-democracy legislators plan to resign en masse from the city ’s legislature , following the release of a political reform blueprint for elections in 2012 , which democracy advocates say does not go far enough .
The subsequent city - wide by - elections in Hong Kong ’s five major districts will trigger what the liberals say amounts to a symbolic referendum on full democracy .
Beijing has already promised to allow a full - scale election in Hong Kong in 2017 for the city ’s leader .
But recent signs , including comments by pro-Beijing figures , have suggested Beijing may only allow a power - preserving version of democracy with rules stacked against opposition candidates .
Hong Kong ’s mini-constitution guarantees full democracy as an “ ultimate aim ” but the city ’s seven million people now have no direct say in their leader .
Beijing remains wary of upsurges of public discontent in Hong Kong , with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao recently warning Hong Kong ’s bowtie - wearing leader Donald Tsang to be wary of “ deep - rooted conflicts . ”
In 2003 , half a million protesters spilled onto the streets in anger at the administration of Hong Kong ’s then - leader Tung Chee - hwa , who resigned soon afterwards .

On the eve of President Barack Obama 's State of the Union address Wednesday , a speech that 's expected to focus on the need for jobs , the nation 's largest engineering association is warning that the latest jobs data is " discouraging " for engineering .
The IEEE - USA , which is part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. , believes some engineers are pulling out of the field and taking jobs in other areas or leaving the workforce because of the weak economy , based on its most recent analysis of government labor data .
The engineering group argues that engineering employment is a bellwether of national economic vitality .
If companies are to create new products and systems , then they will need to hire engineers do the work .
Among electrical engineers , the unemployment rate dropped from 7.3 % to 5.2 % from the third to fourth quarter .
Good news ?
Not necessarily , because the total pool of employed electrical engineers declined in that same period by 3 % , from 331,000 to 321,000 .
Gordon Day , past president of IEEE - USA , said in an e-mail response to questions : " In the fourth quarter , there were about 10,000 more electrical and electronics engineers leaving their jobs ( layoffs , resignations , retirements , etc. ) than there were new hires , " he said .
But even though many of those 10,000 were added to the population of unemployed electrical engineers , many others stopped describing themselves as unemployed .
Some have found jobs in other fields or retired while " some will have just stopped looking for employment in engineering , " he said .
" The unemployment rate is the ratio of the number who describe themselves as unemployed to the number who describe themselves as employed , " and to some extent the numerator and denominator can change independently , explained Day .
Similarly , the unemployment rate for software engineers fell slightly from 4.7 % to 4.1 % , but the total pool of employed software engineers fell from 970,000 to 952,000 , nearly a 2 % decline .
" It appears that electrical engineers who lost their jobs in early 2009 are taking jobs in other fields or giving up on their job searches , " Day said .
The jobs data is not uniformly negative across all IT and engineering occupations .
The numbers of employed computer scientist and systems analysts increased from 745,000 to 792,000 , with unemployment falling from 7.3 % to 5 % .
Day said he hopes that the federal 2011 budget proposal , due Monday , " will call for continued growth in funding for technology , especially those investments authorized in the America Competes Act . "
" Engineers and other applied technologists create jobs broadly , so it is very important to restore the health of the high - tech workforce , " he said .
The Competes Act , approved in 2007 , includes a broad range of technology - funding and education initiatives .
President Obama is widely expected to give a lot of attention to jobs and unemployment in his State of the Union speech .
Analysts and industry groups are predicting improved IT spending and hiring this year , but every report released discussing the economy in recent months underscore these outlooks with caveats and warnings , including the one released Tuesday by CompTIA , an IT industry group .
CompTIA runs a bimonthly survey of more than 300 IT companies on their spending , R&D , staffing and other aspects of the business .
It measures the data and reports it as a confidence index on a 100 point scale , and in December this rating jumped 6.3 point to 56.6 , meaning more companies are now viewing the economy in the positive range .
In particular , increasing staffing levels and technology spending are trending in the positive direction , although spending on new revenue initiatives and R&D is flat , the group said .
Tim Herbert , CompTIA 's vice president of research , said the next bimonthly survey will be released in March , and will be particularly important in telling how well the economy is doing .
" We will probably have some additional evidence whether the recovery has truly taken hold , " he said .
Although there have been strong earnings reports from companies and shipments of things like PCs pointing in the right direction , Herbert is cautious about his outlook , and does n't see any quick return to pre-recession employment and spending levels .
As far as employment goes , " the hope will be that employment improves in some way , even if it 's only minor improvement , " Herbert said .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration has decided to continue to imprison without trials nearly 50 detainees at the Guantánamo Bay military prison in Cuba because a high - level task force has concluded that they are too difficult to prosecute but too dangerous to release , an administration official said on Thursday .
However , the administration has decided that nearly 40 other detainees should be prosecuted for terrorism or related war crimes .
And the remaining prisoners , about 110 men , should be repatriated or transferred to other countries for possible release , the official said , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the numbers .
There are just under 200 detainees left at the detention center .
President Obama established the task force shortly after his inauguration last year as part of his administration ’s effort to deal with the detainee issues left behind by the Bush administration .
It was facing a deadline of Friday to complete its work .
For the past year , national - security and law - enforcement officials under the direction of Matthew G. Olsen , a Justice Department lawyer , have been pulling together scattered files for each detainee at Guantánamo .
They evaluated any evidence against each man , the perceived threat he might pose if released , and the possibility of successfully prosecuting him .

The Washington Post has run another Sarah Palin op - ed .
And this time it 's worse than ever — it 's about the myth of global warming and how she is the true defender of science because she kills polar bears .
The piece essentially says that because man-made global warming is clearly non-existent , based on leaked emails from climate change scientists , Obama should boycott Copenhagen .
It is not clear whether Palin is delusional , or a liar .
Or which would be worse : in the first case she genuinely believes the idiocy she is spouting .
In the second she is not a moron but instead cynically exploits misinformation to appeal to her base .
In any case it seems the only thing to do is take her ridiculous claims one - by - one , lest we explode in a fit of outrage trying to tackle this filth as a whole .
The premise is based on this opening sentence :
With the publication of damaging e-mails from a climate research center in Britain , the radical environmental movement appears to face a tipping point .
Expounded upon in the third paragraph :
The e-mails reveal that leading climate " experts " deliberately destroyed records , manipulated data to " hide the decline " in global temperatures , and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer - reviewed journals .
They do n't reveal anything of the sort — and that the Washington Post would allow such shabbiness as the premise for an op - ed is a matter for genuine shame .
The emails , of course , were only damaging because right - wingers tried to make a bunch of pretty insignificant missives into a smoking gun for a global warming conspiracy .
Palin is doing here what she does best — she 's taking lies and , by blithely presuming they 're facts , lending them credence .
It is worth remembering that she coined the phrase ' death panels ' to refer to the myth that Obama was to begin killing old people as part of his healthcare reforms .
She goes on :
Generation Abdulmutallab
The foiled attempt by young Nigerian extremist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day has baffled many Africans and sent them scrambling for an explanation .
This is not the stereotypical poor and desperate young man usually associated with violence on the continent .
For one , Abdulmutallab is the son of a wealthy Nigerian banker and former government minister .
His father even tipped off the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria to his son ’s growing radicalism .
Second , neither Islam nor Christianity is indigenous to Africa , and the idea of dying on behalf of a foreign religion is absurd to most Africans .
Third , the United States was never a colonial power in Africa and , therefore , it seems an odd target .
In fact , it ’s a popular destination for many young Nigerians looking to emigrate .
And yet , Africa only has to look within to find the causes for radicalization .
About 60 percent of Africa ’s nearly 1 billion people are less than 30 years old .
In the past few decades , these young people have become increasingly disaffected , lost , and restless , and who can blame them ?
Poorly educated and jobless , they have few role models with moral stature .
The value system has collapsed .
Hard work and entrepreneurship no longer assure success and wealth .
Political connections matter .
The richest men in Africa are often heads of state and ministers .
Of the 209 African heads of state since 1960 , fewer than 15 can be classified as good , clean leaders .
The rest — an assortment of military brutes , briefcase bandits , and crackpot democrats — are decidedly uninspiring .
How can Africa claim to be fighting terrorism when the chairman of the African Union itself is Libyan leader Muammar al - Qaddafi , an admitted sponsor of terrorism ?
At the United Nations ’ May 2002 Children ’s Summit in New York , youngsters from Africa stunned the audience by ripping into their leaders .
" You get loans that will be paid in 20 to 30 years … and we have nothing to pay them with because when you get the money , you embezzle it , you eat it , " said 12 - year - old Joseph Tamale from Uganda .
Adam Maiga from Mali weighed in : " We must put an end to this demagoguery .
You have parliaments , but they are used as democratic decoration . "
Disenchanted by their own societies , African youth have become increasingly susceptible to radical ideas and religious extremists — not just the Islamist fanatics in northern Nigeria and Somalia , but also the Christian variety ( the Lord ’s Resistance Army in northern Uganda ) and the traditionalist ( the Mungiki sect in Kenya ) .
Some seek escape in rickety boats to Europe .
Others turn to crime ( drug trafficking , Internet scams ) , prostitution , and extremist groups that seek violent change .
It is sclerotic leadership and catastrophic government failure — not poverty — that breed this hopelessness and despair in Africa ’s young people , luring them to extremism .
In many African countries , government has ceased to exist or function .
In its place is a vampire state — a government hijacked by unrepentant bandits who use the machinery of the state to enrich themselves , crush their enemies , and perpetuate themselves in office .
In Chad , Ethiopia , Eritrea , Uganda , Sudan , and Zimbabwe , governments that scarcely provide basic social services are even at war with their own people .
And their people have responded with violence .
Just last week , a separatist group , Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda ( FLEC ) , opened fire on a bus carrying the Togolese soccer team to the Africa Cup , killing the driver and two team officials .
FLEC seeks independence from Angola , whose government is one of the worst of these dysfunctional bodies .
What motivated these young men was likely not that different from what compelled Abdulmutallab to board that plane .
Abdulmutallab ’s home country is a case in point .
Nigeria ’s government is a towering edifice of ineptitude , corruption , and waste .
The country is rich in natural resources , but 60 percent of its people live on less than $ 2 a day and lack access to basic social services .
Its rulers have looted more than $ 430 billion in oil revenue since independence in 1960 — or six times the United States ’ Marshall Plan for postwar Europe .
The educational system is a shambles .
University degrees are openly bought .
The electricity supply is intermittent ; only 30 percent of Nigerians have access to a reliable supply of electricity .
The clean water supply is spasmodic .
It is an oil - producing country but must import refined petroleum products from abroad .
Nigeria ’s president , Umaru Yar ’Adua , was elected in a brazenly rigged election in April 2007 and has been absent from the country since Nov. 23 , recovering from a heart ailment in a Saudi hospital .
That in itself is a telling commentary on the dilapidated state of health care in Nigeria .
Whole states and groups are now in open rebellion against Nigeria ’s decrepit federal government .
Twelve northern states have defied the Constitution and adopted their own state religion — sharia .
A local Islamist fundamentalist sect , Boko Haram ( " Western civilization is forbidden " ) , has emerged in the northern state of Borno , denouncing " the wicked political parties leading the country , the corrupt , irresponsible , criminal , murderous political leadership " and calling for jihad across Nigeria .
Clashes with security forces in Maiduguri in July left more than 800 dead .
These dangerous developments have received far too little attention in the West .
Then again , few people take anything coming out of Nigeria — the scam capital of the world — seriously .
Perhaps this was the reason why the tip from Abdulmutallab ’s father was n’t given top priority .
U.S. policymakers are finally starting to take notice of Nigeria ’s growing extremism , but it would be a grievous mistake for the United States to partner with the Nigerian government to fight terrorism .
In fact , this war has become a huge joke in Africa .
Back in 2001 , when then - U.S. President George W. Bush declared war on terrorism , rogue regimes that were terrorizing their own people saw an opportunity .
They quickly began parroting the war cry in order to receive U.S. aid .
Liberia ’s Charles Taylor , the indicted war criminal , set up an Anti-Terrorist Unit run by his son .
And Somali warlords , who had been terrorizing residents of Mogadishu , even formed a " Coalition Against Terrorism " and secured CIA funding in 2006 .
The current collection of U.S. allies in this war in Africa — Egypt , Ethiopia , Kenya , and Uganda — reeks of scandal .
Much like America ’s " allies " in Afghanistan and Yemen , they are characterized by repression , corruption , and government malfunction .
Partnership with such corrupt regimes carries the risk of propping up governments that have failed their people .
Ultimately , Africa ’s war on terrorism will not be fought at the national level — the countries have no credibility left — but in individual villages , mosques , and families .
This will require a much better understanding of African tribal identity on the part of Western policymakers and might involve embracing an idea that will make many of them uncomfortable : collective responsibility .
In the West , the individual is the focal unit and held accountable for his or her actions .
In traditional African societies , it is the collective or community — the family , the village , and the tribe .
Consider the African saying made famous by Hillary Clinton : " It takes a village to raise a child . "
Conversely , it takes a village to produce a criminal or a terrorist .
If an individual commits a crime , he brings shame to his family .
Further , the family is held liable for any damages the individual may cause .
It was this value system that propelled Abdulmutallab ’s father to tip off the U.S. Embassy of his son ’s growing radicalism .
We must learn from this example .
A mosque ’s fear of being shut down or a village ’s or family ’s fear of shame may motivate them to cooperate with authorities to prevent terrorism and , hopefully , begin disciplining the extremists among them .
Unlike what happened with Abdulmutallab ’s father , authorities must be ready to take advantage of these opportunities as they emerge .
These tips are just as credible , if not more so , than the intelligence provided by the self - serving security services of African countries .
Illiterate and tribal people also have their own ancient ways of dealing with government failures that breed extremism .
When Benin was teetering on the brink of implosion in 1991 , it convened a " sovereign national conference " — modeled after Africa ’s native institution of village meetings — and replaced its Marxist dictatorship with a democratic order .
South Africa followed suit in the early 1990s with a similar vehicle ( the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ) .
Ultimately , even the best counterterrorism strategy will fail without this type of political change and improved governance .
As long as young Africans are coming of age in a society where leadership is morally bankrupt , the only road to success is corruption , and extremists are the only figures to look up to , there ’s nothing to prevent a generation of Abdulmutallabs from emerging .
Steven Jackson -- the starting running back for the St. Louis Rams -- has been accused of one of the most vile crimes imaginable ... beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child .
Jackson's then - girlfriend Supriya Harris claims the NFL star got physical during an " argument " in March 2009 ... this according to a complaint filed with the Las Vegas Police Department .
In her complaint , Harris says , " Steven became enraged and pushed me to the ground , repeatedly . "
Harris also claims Jackson , " forcibly grabbed my arm and flung me against the door .
I was crying and trying to protect my stomach from the blows , as I was 9 mos pregnant . "
In the complaint , Harris claims Jackson " continued to shove me against the door until his nephew ... interceded and yelled , ' uncle , she has a baby , stop . ' "
Harris claims she was " bleeding heavily " from wounds she received after she was smashed into a door handle .
Harris says Jackson took her to a nearby hospital -- but instructed her to lie and tell doctors that she was injured from a fall in the shower .
Ten days after the alleged incident , Harris gave birth to their son .
According to the complaint , Harris claims she left Steven 4 months later -- after he threatened to beat her up again at a music festival in New Orleans .
Jackson and Harris have been arguing over child support payments -- and recently Harris had filed documents with the court begging the judge to force Steven to pay up .
That case is still pending .
We talked to Jackson 's rep -- but we 're still waiting for comment .
Harris declined to comment on the matter .
Beyond the Military , A Bright Future for Situational Awareness Systems
Forecast & Outlook :
The principles of ‘ situational awareness ’ based on perception , comprehensive and projection might soon support a wide range of applications that reach far beyond military operations and crisis response .
It is a user and outcomes - centric systems approach that could integrate anticipated advances in mobility , ‘ smart ’ infrastructure , learning systems , policy - making and business intelligence .
Situational Awareness systems might have what it takes to create demand for integrating a wide range of emerging disruptive technologies that include : low cost sensors , IT architecture ( network / virtualization ) , video , robotic vision , gaming , 3D / geospatial modeling , physical and virtual augmentation , autonomous systems , simulation software , location based service , social web lifestreams ( by activity / sentiment ) , and expert software learning systems .
Yes , this is a grab bag of buzzwords ( forgive me ! ) but Situational Awareness ( ‘ dashboard ’ ) platforms will require significant integration to make it useful for users in a networked world .
Managing Expectations & Changing Assumptions :
From Pilots to Drivers to Politicians to Businesses to Learners
Situational awareness will certainly raise red flags of ‘ Big & Little Brother ‘ by professional and part time conspiracy theorists , but as it becomes more understood and applied by individuals , I believe it will cultivate our capacity for increased awareness , mindfulness , and focus in an age of information distraction .
It will force learners to expand their collection of inputs , selectively identify their filters used in synthesizing and sense - making .
And help to mainstream systems thinking and the imperative of understanding structure , relationships and feedback loops in a globally interdependent world .
Yes , this is my wishful thinking !!
But we are in fact seeing a mainstream cultural transition between the ‘ anonymous web ‘
( Nobody knows I ’m a dog ! ) and a more ‘ social web ‘ ( ‘ Most people know I ’m a dog ) !
Why should n’t web users continue to evolve alongside the web as it enters its next phase of being embedded inside the physical world ?
To become as mainstream as today ’s ‘ social web ‘ behavior and expectations , situational awareness ( SA ) systems will have to stretch beyond historical and current day applications that lead to potential confusion that it might be just a code word for advanced ‘ surveillance ’ .
And I am certain that more accessible concepts like ‘ dashboards ’ will emerge to properly frame and engage mainstream world !
Situational awareness is most commonly divided into three stages of awareness and behavior that allow us to see wider , deeper and further :
Level 1 – perception of elements , relationships and structure in a given environment
of elements , relationships and structure in a given environment Level 2 – comprehension of the real - time situation
of the real - time situation Level 3 – projection and anticipation of possible outcomes into the future
The historical SA paradigm of perception , comprehension and projection is most familiar to military pilots ( “ lose sight , lose fight “ ) engaged in training and combat based situations .
In the recent years military leaders have extended SA approaches from pilot training to field troops navigating a combat theater of small networks distributed across remote rural regions and embedded inside challenging urban environments .
SA principles have also been embraced by crisis response teams seeking to create an information architecture for relaying real - time information across a temporarily disabled system .
Situational Awareness is the ultimate user - focused experience layer for infrastructure assessment and utilization .
Now what happens when we expand our definition of infrastructure to engage users and where might SA principles be applied ?
How might we imagine the positive decentralized benefits of situational awareness in non-military applications ?
Six Areas to Explore :
Driving /’ Connected Cars ’ Political Transparency / ‘ Civicware ’ Geospatial / Real - time for Policy - making and Public Safety Infrastructure Management Learning Systems Business Intelligence
# 1 ‘ Connected Cars ’ , Smarter Drivers
The most likely near - term application of situation awareness systems will experienced inside our cars !
Instead of engaging military pilots , we will engage civilian drivers to increase the safety and flow of our roadways !
Situational awareness software is likely to play a major role in the changing driver experience .
Automakers are already beginning to integrate ‘ sensing ’ systems inside and outside vehicles based on sensors , radar , and video recognition that relay information to drivers and to other cars .
In this future our cars are collecting data and relaying information that will help drivers make better decisions on congested roadways .
This era of ‘ connected cars ’ is likely to make roads safer for drivers and pedestrians , and increase the flow of traffic on our highways .
[ Telematics examples : Ford Sync ; GM OnStar ; Kia UVO ]
# 2 Political Transparency / Civicware
Political transparency is a major driver of change in emerging economies and fledgling democracies .
Civicware systems based on situational awareness allow us to gather real - time , onsite information based on a distributed network that is resilient to attack or centralized control .
In this light , we can view the situational awareness role that Twitter played in Iran during political protests in 2009 as adding an SA layer of new inputs and on the scene conditions that could never had existed prior to the age of mobile social networks .
Another widely cited example of SA systems in political transparency is Ushahidi – an effort to build a mobile phone based infrastructure for ‘ crowd - sourcing ’ information that could prevent post election violence based on misinformation ( e.g. groups rioting when in reality they are not ! )
The Ushahidi Engine allows anyone with a cell phone to gather and distribute real time situation information via SMS , email or web or view aggregated data on a map or timeline .
# 3 Policy Making / Public Safety
Geospatial visualizations are an emerging platform for communicating information based on place .
We can imagine a future in which social support services are based on a greater understanding of data sensed , synthesized , visualized and anticipated in communities afflicted by a wide range of events or socio-economic conditions .
In 2004 Christian Nold released an innovative map - based platform for gathering real - time information on emotional states .
His ‘ biomapping ’ projects can reveal where people are happy , hungry , angry , fearful or sad .
Imagine the public policy implications for supporting decision - making , policy analysis , and responses based on this bottom up data collection that can be conveyed on maps !
And let ’s not forget about policies that support public safety and enforcement against violent crimes !
In recent years police agencies around the world have implemented gun location directional systems to help them gain real - time situational awareness in an area with detected gunfire .
These stories are widely reported in the media , but what happens when there are ubiquitious sensors and mobile phone ‘ apps ’ that can create an open distributed infrastructure for safety .
What happens when community members build their own layers of situational awareness ?
What are the implications of lowering the cost of community safety oriented situational awareness systems ?
# 4 Smart Infrastructure Management
Situational Awareness is at the heart of emerging ‘ smart ’ infrastructure models that attempt to reveal real - time data and conditions within major infrastructure components for energy , transportation and water .
This allows infrastructure operators and users to make better decisions in managing resources and anticipating potentially disruptive events .
( e.g. electrical grid failures , peak demand , rush hour ) [ See PNNL Laboratory Situational Awarness for ‘ smart grid ’ )
# 5 Lifelong Formal and Informal Learning
Situational Awareness systems go beyond mere ‘ sensing and anticipating ’— and can be applied as a tool for learning how to improve our performance in responding to complex systems .
SA systems that are user and outcomes centric might find a home in formal and informal learning applications !
Pilots will often train in mock environments to improve their ability to sense .
Field troops will train in mock situations that teach them how to protect themselves in hostile environments .
But how might we apply staged - learning and / or scenario based learning to improve learners ’ ability to reveal their mental models that guide their responses .
How might SA layers expand our desire for more sensing inputs based on real - time information and a stronger understanding of structure , relationships and feedback loops within the environment ?
# 6 Business Intelligence and Capital Markets
What about the world of business ?
Both small and large companies are operating inside increasingly complex market environments that are fragmented and shaped by events and rapidly changing conditions ( many of which are not currently measurable ) .
We can already see growth in enterprise solution markets for situational awareness systems such as ‘ complex event processing ’ and business intelligence ‘ dashboards ’ and decision support systems .
Real - time market situational awareness might indeed offer the biggest return on investment for SA systems .
What is Beyond ?
Situational Awareness principles will likely have to be re-framed and re-packaged before mainstream audiences are likely to embrace and adapt systems designed to increase our ability to perceive , comprehend and anticipate .
We are probably a 5 - 10 years away from mainstream market users understanding and demanding early stage SA capabilities in their everyday world .
And 15 - 20 years away from more advanced systems and wider spread institutional adoption .
And I suspect transportation will be the first market followed by enterprise business intelligence applications .
So I suspect ‘ situational awareness ’ might be the next big thing for Tweeting web geeks and industry pundits … in 2018 ?!!
I suspect life in a world of ‘ smart , connected ’ devices will push SA to the forefront as a way of managing life in this ultra-connected landscape .
In the meantime , I will be looking for the positive applications of SA systems and the potential of a learning culture of systems thinking based on awareness , focus and foresight .

From the London Times , signs that the Met Office might need a refresher course in basic forecasting skills and bonuses revoked .
While I ’m often critical of NOAA ’s climate issues , the forecasts from NOAA put The Met Office to shame in terms of accuracy and detail .
And , NOAA staffers do n’t get bonuses , period .
Excerpts from the Times article by Steven Swinford
BUFFETED by complaints about its inaccurate weather forecasts , the Met Office now faces being dumped by the BBC after almost 90 years .
The Met Office contract with the BBC expires in April and the broadcaster has begun talks with Metra , the national forecaster for New Zealand , as a possible alternative .
The BBC put the contract out to tender to ensure “ best value for money ” , but its timing coincides with a storm over the Met Office ’s accuracy .
Last July the state - owned forecaster ’s predictions for a “ barbecue summer ” turned into a washout .
And its forecast for a mild winter attracted derision when temperatures recently plunged as low as - 22C .
Last week the Met Office failed to predict heavy snowfall in the southeast that brought traffic to a standstill .
This weekend a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times reveals that 74 % of people believe its forecasts are generally inaccurate .
By contrast , many commercial rivals got their predictions for winter right .
They benefit from weather forecasts produced by a panel of six different data providers , including the Met Office .
Despite criticism , staff at the Met Office are still in line to share a bonus pot of more than £ 1 m .
Seasonal forecasts , such as the one made in September , are not included in its performance targets .
John Hirst , the chief executive of the Met Office , insisted last week that recent forecasts had been “ very good ” and blamed the public for not heeding snow warnings .
He received a bonus of almost £ 40,000 in 2008 - 09 .
Metra already produces graphics for the BBC , including the 3 - D weather map that made some viewers feel sick when it was introduced in 2005 .
Weather Commerce , Metra ’s UK subsidiary , has already usurped the Met Office in supplying forecasts to Tesco , Sainsbury ’s , Marks & Spencer and Waitrose .
…
The Met Office was bullish , though , saying : “ We have always been in the strongest position to provide the BBC with accurate and detailed weather forecasts and warnings for the UK . ”

The Treasury responded to reports that the New York Fed asked AIG to suppress and delay facts about the bailout .
Meg Reilly , a Treasury spokesperson claimed : " In the transaction at the heart of this dispute ... the FRBNY [ Federal Reserve Bank of New York ] made a loan of $ 25 billion which is on track to be paid back in full with interest . "
She claims the loan is currently " above water . "
In the first place , that loan is not the heart of the dispute .
Nonetheless , the FRBNY should immediately release the details of all of the Maiden Lane III assets backing that loan and show the current prices BlackRock has placed on them .
Based on the current market , it is extremely likely that the loan is underwater .
The assets backing the loan are so - called super senior and AAA rated collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
Similar CDOs trade for under ten cents on the dollar , not close to the average price of 35 cents for the loan 's assets shown in a recent Fed report .
The Fed claims prices climbed 4.5 % .
Yet in the secondary market , prices have dropped .
The Fed awarded no -bid contracts to BlackRock to manage and price these assets ( among other things ) .
Given BlackRock 's track record as a CDO manager * , I have no reason to believe its prices are reliable .
As I mention above , I have reason to question the prices .
If the Treasury wants to publicly claim the loan is not underwater , now is the time to prove it , even though this particular loan is not the key issue .
As Representative Darrell Issa explained in his letter to the Fed , at the heart of this dispute is my assertion that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , in his former role as President of the FRBNY , paid 100 cents on the dollar to settle AIG 's credit default swap contracts , and he wildly overpaid .
Other bond insurers including Ambac , MBIA , and FGIC have settled similar contracts for as little as ten cents on the dollar .
The general public was kept unaware of several politically explosive facts .
Risky subprime loans partly backed CDOs that AIG insured .
Goldman Sachs played a key role in AIG 's distress with both credit default swap transactions and CDOs that Goldman underwrote .
The identities of the banks -- including some foreign banks -- that received payments were not revealed until five months after the bailout .
The November 2009 TARP Inspector General 's report failed to mention that Goldman originated or bought protection from AIG on about $ 33 billion of the problematic $ 80 billion of U.S. mortgage assets that AIG " insured " with credit derivatives , about twice as much as the next two largest banks involved .
The TARP report also failed to highlight the character of the synthetic CDOs underwritten by Goldman Sachs that remain on AIG 's books .
There is nothing wrong with hedging or taking the opposite view to one 's customers .
There is nothing wrong with using credit derivatives to accomplish this goal .
But there are serious questions about whether residential mortgage backed securities and downstream CDOs were value - destroying and misrated .
Wall Street was chiefly responsible for the " financial innovation " that did massive damage to the U.S. economy .
I assert there should be fraud audits of Wall Street 's securitization activities .
Given the extraordinary circumstances surrounding AIGs trades , the global financial crisis , and the AIG bailout , it is time to reopen this issue .
AIG 's counterparties can repurchase the approximately $ 62 billion CDOs from Maiden Lane III at full price **.
If the Fed really believes they are worth 35 cents on the dollar , then these counterparties will be getting a windfall versus ten cents on the dollar .
As for Goldman Sachs 's approximately $ 8.2 billion in CDOs ( including synthetic CDOs ) that are still on AIG 's books , they can be settled at ten cents on the dollar , and excess collateral currently held by Goldman can be returned .
This is the value at which other bond insurers have settled similar deals .
The return of payments to AIG can be used to pay down its public debt , before banks pay tax - payer subsidized bonuses to their employees .
----------
* BlackRock managed Pacific Pinnacle CDO ( $ 1 billion ; closed 1/1/07 ; event of default 2/4/08 ) ; Pinnacle Point Funding ( $ 2B closed 6/7/07 ; acceleration 12/13/07 ) ; Tenorite CDO I ( $ 1 B closed 5/11/07 ; liquidation 2/7/08 ) ; and Tourmaline CDO III ( $ 1.5 billion closed 4/5/07 ; event of default 3/31/08 ) .
( Earlier I wrote a post that included a 2005 Tourmaline deal managed by BlackRock that ended up being part of a CDO bailed out by the Fed . )
I highlight BlackRock 's 2007 CDOs similar to those in it now manages for the Fed , because in 2007 mainstream media was already reporting on the potential for these CDOs of this type to blow up .
I wrote an article for the precursor to Risk Professional in early 2007 warning about the type of value - destroying CDOs that AIG insured .
I had also issued earlier warnings on other types of value - destroying CDOs .
** The price can be adjusted for interim principal and interest payments , as applicable . ﻿

When Traian Basescu was reelected Romanian president by a thread in December , everyone , friend or foe , said he owed his victory to a handful of Romanian expats ’ votes .
Basescu himself thanked those living abroad for their support , while his leftist adversaries suggested expats should not be allowed to vote anymore .
One would have thought that , after one of the dirtiest election campaigns in postcommunist history , those in power and the opposition alike would finally turn their attention to the crippling crisis choking the economy of the EU ’s second poorest country .
Right ?
Wrong .
Several weeks ago , taking a short break from opulent traditional Christmas grub and thick - red Romanian wine , a prominent leftist politician close to ex-presidential candidate Mircea Geoana cracked on TV what everyone thought to be a joke : that Basescu ’s victory was facilitated by an occult “ violet flame , ” and that his wearing a purple necktie or a purple sweater during the campaign was no accident or fashion statement , but a way of using “ negative energy .
” People stopped from feasting for a moment , laughed and then resumed partying .
But the “ violet flame ” would n’t go away .
Geoana , still reeling from his defeat , came up publicly with what many dismissed as just a ridiculous accusation , unworthy of a former diplomat and foreign minister : that he had been targeted by waves of no less than “ negative energy ” during the final live debate before the runoff that was won by Basescu .
His wife , Mihaela , said the attack was so powerful that Geoana ’s concentration was broken .
Many said Geoana was just adding insult to injury with his incredible statements .
But then video footage showed a mystery character who media said was a shady parapsychologist , Aliodor Manolea , walking right behind Basescu as he entered the debate hall .
Then , photos were published of the same Manolea standing close to Basescu during the campaign .
In a country where magic and the occult have deep roots in popular beliefs , the story of the president ’s healer and the violet flame has bumped from the headlines other less important stories such as the IMF delegation ’s visit , critical for Romania securing a lifeline loan , or the meager budget law .
Basescu and the party behind him , the center - right PDL , at first dismissed the accusations as loony .
But then they failed to explain the parapsychologist ’s presence in the footage and photos , and what began as a slightly amusing story has now become an embarrassment for Geoana and Basescu alike .
Folk traditions aside , there is another reason why Romanians became so interested in the story .
Mircea Geoana ’s unbelievable statements about his being “ hexed ” by Basescu proved that the country had been at a hair ’s distance from electing as president a politician whose diplomatic credentials did not do much to hide an immature and narrow - minded character .
For his part , Basescu will also have to explain sooner or later the healer ’s presence in the presidential camp during the debate .
So far , that did not happen .-- Eugen Tomiuc
Analysis of ancient DNA from skeletons suggests that Europe 's first farmers were not the descendants of the people who settled the area after the retreat of the ice sheets .
Instead , the early farmers probably migrated into major areas of central and eastern Europe about 7,500 years ago , bringing domesticated plants and animals with them , says Barbara Bramanti from Mainz University in Germany and colleagues .
The researchers analyzed DNA from hunter - gatherer and early farmer burials , and compared those to each other and to the DNA of modern Europeans .
They conclude that there is little evidence of a direct genetic link between the hunter - gatherers and the early farmers , and 82 percent of the types of mtDNA found in the hunter - gatherers are relatively rare in central Europeans today .
For more than a century archaeologists , anthropologists , linguists , and more recently , geneticists , have argued about who the ancestors of Europeans living today were .
We know that people lived in Europe before and after the last big ice age and managed to survive by hunting and gathering .
We also know that farming spread into Europe from the Near East over the last 9,000 years , thereby increasing the amount of food that can be produced by as much as 100 - fold .
But the extent to which modern Europeans are descended from either of those two groups has eluded scientists despite many attempts to answer this question .
Now , a team from Mainz University in Germany , together with researchers from UCL ( University College London ) and Cambridge , have found that the first farmers in central and northern Europe could not have been the descendents of the hunter - gatherers that came before them .
But what is even more surprising , they also found that modern Europeans could n't solely be the descendents of either the hunter - gatherer alone , or the first farmers alone , and are unlikely to be a mixture of just those two groups .
" This is really odd " , said Professor Mark Thomas , a population geneticist at UCL and co-author of the study .
" For more than a century the debate has centered around how much we are the descendents of European hunter - gatherers and how much we are the descendents of Europe 's early farmers .
For the first time we are now able to directly compare the genes of these Stone Age Europeans , and what we find is that some DNA types just are n't there - despite being common in Europeans today . "
Humans arrived in Europe 45,000 years ago and replaced the Neandertals .
From that period on , European hunter - gatherers experienced lots of climatic changes , including the last Ice Age .
After the end of the Ice Age , some 11,000 years ago , the hunter - gatherer lifestyle survived for a couple of thousand years but was then gradually replaced by agriculture .
The question was whether this change in lifestyle from hunter - gatherer to farmer was brought to Europe by new people , or whether only the idea of farming spread .
The new results from the Mainz - led team seems to solve much of this long standing debate .
" Our analysis shows that there is no direct continuity between hunter - gatherers and farmers in Central Europe , " says Prof Joachim Burger .
" As the hunter - gatherers were there first , the farmers must have immigrated into the area . "
The study identifies the Carpathian Basin as the origin for early Central European farmers .
" It seems that farmers of the Linearbandkeramik culture immigrated from what is modern day Hungary around 7,500 years ago into Central Europe , initially without mixing with local hunter gatherers , " says Barbara Bramanti , first author of the study .
" This is surprising , because there were cultural contacts between the locals and the immigrants , but , it appears , no genetic exchange of women . "
The new study confirms what Joachim Burger´s team showed in 2005 ; that the first farmers were not the direct ancestors of modern European .
Burger says
" We are still searching for those remaining components of modern European ancestry .
European hunter - gatherers and early farmers alone are not enough .
But new ancient DNA data from later periods in European prehistory may shed also light on this in the future . "
Oh my .
Oh thank you .
Finally good news on the injury front .
Turns out , Niklas Kronwall is scheduled to return to the line up tomorrow night ( against Phoenix ) after missing considerable time due to a knee injury .
Kronwall will be with old pal Brad Stuart on the second pairing and bring a huge missing aspect back to this Detroit team .
With Kronwall back , the Wings actually have some choice in what they put on the ice next to Ericsson instead of being forced .
But wait , there 's more !
Also , Andreas Lilja has been headache free for 13 straight days .
Doctors required Lilja to be headache free for 14 days before they discussed his potential return to the ice .
Lilja has been out since February 28 of last year when Shea Weber smacked him up side the head and gave him a concussion .
Lilja will likely take a rehab stint down in Grand Rapids before returning to Detroit if he makes it through the last few days symptom free .
Think of the implications these two announcements have .
No longer will there be two AHL caliber defenders ( at least right now they 're AHL caliber ) defenders on the blue line in Detroit but possibly 0 on the blue line .
Likely what happens when Lilja returns is that he will be paired with Ericsson and Lebda / Meech will sit out or be traded .
Then there 's Jason Williams and Tomas Holmstrom .
Both are expected back at some point within the next four games .
Williams is likely slated for a return against Nashville following his broken fibula injury and Holmstrom could be back against the Pens after missing time with a fractured foot .
Participants this week were guardedly optimistic ( at best ! ) about the potential for significantly disrupting and transforming gender relations following natural disasters .
The possibilities for change were not in question .
Most would certainly agree with Bahattin Aksit 's observation from Turkey that " as physical and social space collapse " during disasters , " there is an opportunity for transforming gender roles and maintaining them in the post - disaster period . "
Indeed , several instances were offered of positive change .
From Armenia , the NGO Women and Development targeted rural women for grassroots health education , capitalizing on the period after a major earthquake to provide more knowledge , skills , and resources to women as family health providers .
Perhaps more significantly , Armine Mikayelyan and her colleagues noted ( Armenia ) , the post - disaster period helped break women 's traditional silence around health issues related to male migration , such as sexually - transmitted diseases .
Because rural women were explicitly targeted for training , they were not only more able to keep families healthy but " became surer and saw themselves as part of their problem 's solution . "
Indian women , too , reportedly gained self - confidence following gender - sensitive relief measures targeting women : Disasters can be great liberators !!
While witnessing a very vocal meeting of rural women in village Srirampur , Orissa , about a year and a half after the cyclone of 1999 , I was informed by the NGO there ( Church 's Auxiliary for Social Action ) that before the cyclone , women would rarely come out and interact on social issues , let alone interact with outsiders .
This changed after the cyclone , because relief packages of most NGOs , and even the government , were targeted at , or through , women .
That phase really empowered them , made them amenable to interacting on social issues , and also increased their self - esteem and their status within their families and society !
[ Anshu Sharma , SEEDS , India ]
Similarly , Bahattin Aksit ( Turkey ) observed after the 1999 Marmara earthquake that men were left " lonely and lost " while " women 's local networks and friendships were empowering them to talk about the trauma and finding local community ways of coping with the new life . "
While women 's local , community orientation was a powerful resource for them in the immediate aftermath , neither male nor female domains were significantly broadened or challenged in the aftermath of the event .
Many cautioned against a leap of faith , pointing out the power of unintended consequences and questioning the sustainability of increased equality after disasters .
Unintended consequences followed from even well - intentioned and gender - sensitive reconstruction initiatives .
Without informed appreciation of local cultural practices and institutions , some projects unexpectedly contributed not to women 's empowerment but to the loss of traditional sources of status and power .
Similarly , without a full understanding of how gender relations shape men's lives , as well as women's , the intended goals of some projects were short - circuited .
The backlash against women can be subtle or perhaps even violent .
Examples from Micronesia and Nicaragua make the point : [ A ] number of the islands are traditionally matrilineal , with women taking responsibility for land - based activities and how the land is transferred .
Land is rare , and is therefore , a source of great power .
. .
In not understanding the matrilineal systems [ donor agencies ] approach response and recovery operations by deciding where to locate structures and the types of materials to be used .
The site determination may have been the women 's responsibility .
. . [ Construction materials ] are imported , which for a number of reasons can be problematic .
. .
The same occurs with food assistance delivered in quantities and types inappropriate to the cultural system .
. . preferences change .
[ W ] omen do not quickly repair gardens , expectations for food assistance lead people to not gather planting materials in the next disaster , and some family members migrate to the capital to earn cash for purchasing these preferred imported food products .
The government 's power grows as it is seen as more important than the value of the traditional lifestyle .
More men are employed in the limited cash economy than women .
. .
The value of subsistence work erodes --- as does the socio-cultural structure that values the roles of women .
Sometimes the social impacts from this can be devastating --- alcoholism , domestic abuse , etc. [ Cheryl Anderson , Social Science Research Institute , University of Hawaii ]
As I began a project rebuilding houses for families affected by Hurricane Mitch I worked primarily with women .
. .
I had spoken to the American Red Cross and Save the Children USA , who had told me that they were putting their houses in the name of the women .
They were also , like WFP , giving food assistance directly to women .
. .
Tensions began to rise , as the men had nothing to do except build houses .
Building houses was fine , but finding a job to sustain the family after the aid had gone was close to impossible .
Houses became symbols of the men's ability to provide for the family .
. .
After Hurricane
Mitch many men worked on rehabilitation and received food aid in exchange for their work .
Yet , in many cases , women went to pick up the family rations from distribution points and cooked the family meals .
Many men spoke of their " payment " being given to women and could n't understand why .
. .
Women 's names were going to appear on the titles , and they were going to be considered the owners of the houses .
As I understood that many men did not stay year around , and knew that all of the women had worked on building the houses , it seemed good to give the houses to women .
Yet , once the titles were handed over and signed , men started permanently disappearing ( not sending money home ) and two women showed signs of violence .
. .
I know that the signs of violence I saw were not unique after Hurricane Mitch , and that the impact of focusing aid on women is equally damaging for the community as focusing aid on men was 15 year ago .
[ Sarah Henshaw , World Food Program , Nicaragua ]
Additionally , observers argued that the sustainability of changes ostensibly empowering women must be questioned , if only to better understand the forces undermining disaster initiatives geared toward gender equality .
Especially for people and places " trapped in a disaster cycle , " as Dave Etkin ( Canada ) noted , the key issue is " to maintain the change over time , as rare events tend to become lost in memory and our institutional decision - making tends to value short - term goals ( until the next election ) .
" Not only myopia but political and economic interests can undermine steps toward gender equality following disasters .
Citing Indian 's women income - generating efforts after the Orissa cyclone ( e.g. , seed banks , rice ponding , rope making ) , Anshu Sharma [ India ] also cautioned that more " innovative programming " was needed to avoid setting women up for failure over the long run by having " to compete with existing players in an already saturated market . "
Apparently progressive changes may not be long - lived , as is so often the case during and after armed conflict .
Miranda Dandoulaki ( Greece ) suggested that natural disasters are " extreme and extraordinary situations " which may bring women more directly into acclaimed activities in the public sphere - but not for long : [ D ] isasters by definition are connected with a shortage of resources and lack of capacity to cope with the situation in the disaster area .
This makes easier the use of all available human resources ( men and women ) .
My experience is that there is a stronger involvement of women in public , social and political matters during the emergency phase than in normal periods , and also a more active participation in the efforts of the community to deal with the situation .
Nevertheless , in most cases women are involved in " secondary " support operations ( such as food preparation and distribution , information dissemination , child care , health and psychological support , shelter ) and not in the well - publicized and media - attracting operations , such as search and rescue .
Also , the involvement of women in most cases lasts until things " go back to normal . "
A crucial topic is how to intervene at the transaction phase to support women keeping the role they gained during the extreme emergency phase .
[ Miranda Dandoulaki , OASP , Greece ]
What makes unanticipated consequences and unsustained change so likely ?
The case studies and commentary suggested a range of reasons for failure , including : outside actors misinterpreting local power structures and social dynamics
reinforcing local cultures that may in turn " promote and reinforce a disempowering role for women "
inattention to how gender - targeted services are likely to impact men and women , respectively , over time
short - term , self - interested perspectives on relief and recovery
unintended program effects which undermine women 's capacities
lack of empirical knowledge ( research ) about short - and long - term prospects for change
backlash against challenges to gender power
the " paternalistic disposition of aid agencies and governments "
insufficient control over recovery and reconstruction resources by women
But respondents also spoke directly and indirectly to success .
To foster sustained gender equality in the wake of natural disasters , they suggested the need for new kinds of vulnerability analysis , and affirmed again the significance of participatory disaster planning .
Some also argued the need for new theoretical frameworks and increased research .
In a rapidly deteriorating cultural environment , culture , class and socio-economic status become increasingly complex and difficult to disaggregate - the " snapshot " taken today is no longer relevant tomorrow , so to speak .
Having said that , the vulnerability analysis done today is still the best approximation as far as a methodology for examining the differential vulnerability of women and men , in various cultural and socio-economic contexts .
I believe that the essential , when undertaking such vulnerability analyses , is to be clear about one 's assumptions on the one hand , and use multiple methods - ethnographic approaches being among the most important in my opinion .
[ Fibula Rodriguez , International Institute for Disaster Risk Management , Philippines ]
The " window of opportunity " does exist , but requires that care and appropriate planning occur prior to the onset of any hazard --- partially in the culture of any of the donor and aid organizations and / or NGOs working in the area .
This also requires that the people and communities that will be affected during disasters have a role in designing their own programs .
Some of the local men designed structures using local materials ( thatched roofs , wood bases , fishing nets to secure roofs , sometimes modified with reinforced concrete bases ) that withheld a typhoon far better than those constructed from imported materials .
Nursery programs were developed to store seeds and clippings that can be distributed for faster garden recovery .
Programs were designed to distribute local foods , such as taro and root crops from neighboring islands .
Program consequences should be evaluated and the approach to planning should be participatory .
[ Cheryl Anderson , Social Science Research Institute , University of Hawaii ]
[ W ]e have too few examples , and even fewer documented cases with which we can support our arguments .
I know researchers are always saying we need to do more research but this is truly the case here - not that I think research is the answer to our problems , I hasten to add !
What factors [ make social changes following disaster ] empowering and liberatory …?
What are the factors which lead to women 's empowerment that is sustainable and gender equitable ?
[ Maureen Fordham , Anglia Polytechnic University , Cambridge , UK ]
We should develop a social science framework which goes beyond existing disciplines .
This does not mean that we cannot study disasters from disciplinary frameworks , we can and we should .
But it is not enough .
We should go beyond and develop new social science frameworks .
It was same with women / gender studies , where several new social science frameworks emerged .
It is same with the study of change , where to study current changes in the world , several globalization frameworks , world system frameworks and so on emerged .
In studying disasters , gender and change we need a new post disciplinary framework .
[ Bahattin Aksit , Department of Sociology , Middle East Technical University , Turkey ]
A number of respondents cautioned against implementing gender - targeted programming without full and complete gender analysis .
Noting that women 's control over disaster resources is empowering , they also urged increased decision - making power .
Both the power of law and governmental policy and the promise of postdisaster mobilization at the local level were noted .
[ A ] s a woman it was easier to relate to women , and .
. .
I followed the lead of experienced NGOs working in [ Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch ] who were working primarily with women .
. .
This was all because giving to the women theoretically empowered women and ensured that the family as a unit could partake in the assistance .
I had not analyzed the potential impact on the community as a whole , even though I thought I understood the individual gender roles .
I learned that understanding gender roles means looking at the roles of both men and women , and the impact a potential project can have on the community as a whole .
[ Sarah Henshaw , World Food Program , Nicaragua ]
[ Disasters in most cases are connected with additional inflow of resources ( human , financial , technical , know - how , attention of the media and policy makers , etc. ) in the disaster area at least in the first phase .
Although one can find many cases of misuse and short - sighted utilization of these resources , on the other hand they are a seed for change , if a gender - aware reconstruction policy is decided and measures are taken with the view to long term intervention and change .
[ Bahattin Aksit , Middle East Technical University , Ankara , Turkey ]
What are the factors which lead to women 's empowerment that is sustainable and gender equitable ?
. . .
The one that clearly stands out to me is control over resources .
The Orissa example is one where the fact that women received the family relief kits , house building grants , loans and .
. . memberships , and passed on the benefits to the families made all the difference .
Extending the logic , I would like to add the factor of grater participation in domestic and social - decision making .
This is what seems to be at work now , when the relief phase is long over .
[ Anshu Sharma , SEEDS , India ]
[ Self - help income - generating measures following South Asian cyclones ] started a new social system , wherein the position of women is higher than it ever was .
This appears to have been well accepted by everyone .
Also important here is the role of an Indian Constitutional Amendment reserving one - third of seats in elected local governments ( rural and urban ) for women .
Though there have been teething problems in the process , there is promise of a very positive impact .
[ Anshu Sharma , SEEDS , India ]
Regardless of the size or the length of the harmful effects , disasters have the advantage to encourage a mobilization of the energies and the demonstration of the wills of action to attenuate the sufferings and the impact on the physical plan .
Mechanisms such as social mobilization during a natural or a provoked disaster should be exploited to reorient the visions .
In plain times , the individualistic behaviors and attitudes tinted of selfishness do n't encourage any open - minded person for a possible change .
[ Madeleine Memb , Journalist , Cameroon ]
From their measured discussion of relative successes and apparent failures , commentators this week suggested practical first steps and long - range strategies toward sustained gender equality after disasters .
Using the brief " window of opportunity " to empower women , and hence reduce community vulnerability to future disasters , is a difficult undertaking but not " mission impossible . "

Click to view slide show of commanders in the Haqqani Network .
Pictured is a composite image of Siraj Haqqani .
The US has killed five terrorists while targeting the al Qaeda - linked Haqqani Network in an airstrike in Pakistan ’s Taliban - controlled tribal agency of North Waziristan .
Unmanned US strike aircraft , the Predators or Reapers operating from secret bases in Pakistan and Afghanistan , fired three missiles at “ a fortress - like ” Haqqani Network compound and a vehicle in the village of Dargi Mandi just outside the main town of Miramshah , a report at Dawn .
Five Haqqani Network fighters and three foreign fighters , a term used to describe al Qaeda members , were reported killed and several more were wounded , according to according to The New York Times .
No senior leaders have been reported killed at this time .
Haqqani Network fighters surrounded the compound after the attack .
The Miramshah region is controlled by the Haqqani Network , the Taliban group that is based in North Waziristan group and operates in eastern Afghanistan .
Anti-Soviet mujahedeen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani is the patriarch of the Haqqani Network , while his son Siraj is the military commander who runs the day - to - day operations .
The Haqqanis are closely allied to al Qaeda and the Taliban , led by Mullah Omar .
The Haqqani family runs the Manba Ulom madrassa in the village of Danda Darpa Khel , a hub of activity for the terror group .
The US has struck at targets in Danda Darpa Khel five times since Aug. 20 , 2009 , and seven times since September 2008 .
The last US strike , on Feb. 18 , took place in Danda Darpa Khel and targeted Siraj .
Intelligence indicated Siraj was attending the funeral of Sheikh Mansour , an al Qaeda military commander who was killed in a US strike the day prior .
Siraj escaped the attack , but his brother Mohammed , a military commander in the Haqqani Network , was killed .
Siraj is one of the most wanted Taliban and al Qaeda leaders in the Afghan - Pakistan region .
The US military has described Siraj as the primary threat to security in eastern Afghanistan .
He is the mastermind of the most deadly attacks inside Afghanistan , including suicide assaults in Kabul , and he is the senior military commander in eastern Afghanistan .
Siraj serves as the leader of the Taliban ’s Miramshah Regional Military Shura , one of the Afghan Taliban ’s four regional commands [ see LWJ report , “ The Afghan Taliban ’s top leaders “ ] .
Siraj is considered dangerous not only for his ties with the Afghan Taliban , but also because of his connections with al Qaeda ’s central leadership , which extend all the way to Osama bin Laden .
On March 25 , 2009 , the US Department of State put out a $ 5 million bounty for information leading to the capture of Siraj .
Today ’s attack is the sixth this month and the seventeenth this year .
All 17 of the strikes have taken place in North Waziristan .
The US carried out 53 strikes in 2009 and 36 in 2008 .
[ For up - to - date charts on the US air campaign in Pakistan , see : Charting the data for US airstrikes in Pakistan , 2004 – 2010 . ]
The US ramped up the airstrikes in Pakistan after an al Qaeda suicide bomber , aided by the Haqqani Network and Pakistani Taliban leader Hakeemullah Mehsud , killed seven CIA officials , including the station chief , and a Jordanian intelligence officer .
The Dec. 30 , 2009 , attack was carried out by a Jordanian al Qaeda operative and double agent at Combat Outpost Chapman in Afghanistan ’s Khost province .
The al Qaeda suicide bomber lured CIA officials by claiming to have information that would lead to Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command .
Since the Dec. 30 suicide attack , the US has been hunting Hakeemullah , who appeared with the Jordanian suicide bomber on a martyrdom tape that was released shortly after the attack .
Hakeemullah was rumored to have died on three separate occasions after being targeted in a Jan. 14 strike .
The Taliban have denied he is dead and have claimed that a tape confirming he is alive will be released soon .
But more than a week has passed since the Taliban said Hakeemullah would release a tape .
Background on the recent strikes in Pakistan
US intelligence believes that al Qaeda has reconstituted its external operations network in Pakistan ’s lawless , Taliban - controlled tribal areas .
This network is tasked with hitting targets in the West , India , and elsewhere .
The US has struck at these external cells using unmanned Predator aircraft and other means in an effort to disrupt al Qaeda ’s external network and decapitate the leadership .
The US also has targeted al Qaeda - linked Taliban fighters operating in Afghanistan , particularly the notorious Haqqani Network .
As of the summer of 2008 , al Qaeda and the Taliban operated 157 known training camps in the tribal areas and the Northwest Frontier Province .
Al Qaeda has been training terrorists holding Western passports to conduct attacks , US intelligence officials have told The Long War Journal .
Some of the camps are devoted to training the Taliban ’s military arm ; some train suicide bombers for attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan ; some focus on training the various Kashmiri terror groups ; some train al Qaeda operatives for attacks in the West ; some train the Lashkar al Zil , al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army ; and one serves as a training ground for the Black Guard , the elite bodyguard unit for Osama bin Laden , Ayman al Zawahiri , and other senior al Qaeda leaders .
The air campaign has had success over the past few months .
Since Dec. 8 , 2009 , the air campaign in Pakistan has killed two senior al Qaeda leaders , a senior Taliban commander , two senior al Qaeda operatives , and a wanted Palestinian terrorist who was allied with al Qaeda .
The status of Hakeemullah Mehsud is still unknown .
Already this year , the US has killed Mansur al Shami , an al Qaeda ideologue and aide to al Qaeda ’s leader in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu Yazid ; and Haji Omar Khan , a senior Taliban leader in North Waziristan .
Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim , the Abu Nidal Organization operative who participated in killing 22 hostages during the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am flight 73 , is thought to have been killed in the Jan. 9 airstrike .
And Abdul Basit Usman , an Abu Sayyaf operative with a $ 1 million US bounty for information leading to his capture , is rumored to have been killed in a strike on Jan. 14 , although a Philippine military spokesman said Usman is likely still alive and in the Philippines .
In December 2009 , the US killed Abdullah Said al Libi , the top commander of the Shadow Army ; Zuhaib al Zahib , a senior commander in the Shadow Army ; and Saleh al Somali , the leader of al Qaeda ’s external network [ see LWJ report , “ Senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders killed in US airstrikes in Pakistan , 2004 – 2010 ” for the full list ] .

Dear EarthTalk :
What is the current status of whales ?
How effective is the International Whaling Commission and which countries are involved in illegal whaling ?
— Jonathan Wingate , Yulee , Fla .
Some larger whale species have been recovering since the dark days before the whaling industry was regulated , but the majority of cetaceans — that is , the distinct order of marine mammals consisting of whales , dolphins and porpoises — are in decline , with some likely headed for extinction in the near term .
According to data collected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , which maintains a “ Red List ” of threatened or endangered species , two of the largest whale species , humpbacks and southern rights , have rebounded since 1982 when the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling .
Based on IUCN ’s 2008 survey of cetaceans , both species , while still threatened , were upgraded from “ Vulnerable ” to “ Least Concern ” status on the Red List .
“ Humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting , ” says Randall Reeves , IUCN ’s assessment leader .
“ This is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive . ”
But other cetaceans have n’t fared so well .
Almost a third of the world ’s 80 - plus cetacean species had their Red List status changed based on the IUCN ’s 2008 assessment , with the vast majority now considered at greater risk than before .
Overall , nearly a quarter of cetacean species are considered threatened , and of those , more than 10 percent ( nine species ) are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered , the highest categories of threat .
Reeves says that the real situation could be much worse , as researchers could not obtain enough data on more than half of the world 's cetacean species to properly classify their status .
While commercial whaling is what first put cetaceans at risk — the IWC ’s 1982 moratorium greatly reduced stress on many species — other threats loom larger than ever :
Whales the world over withstand ship strikes , habitat deterioration and declining prey .
And the smaller cetaceans ( dolphins , porpoises and small whales ) often drown in huge fishing nets that trawl the ocean scooping up everything in their path .
And of course commercial whaling still goes on despite the moratorium .
Norway , Even with its IWC membership , disregards the moratorium and resumed commercial whaling in 1994 .
Iceland , which initially withdrew from the IWC over the moratorium , began commercial whaling again in 2006 .
Japan claims to hunt whales for scientific research purposes — but critics say this is just a front to obtain and sell whale meat under the false pretense of species counts .
Whalers from several nations , including the U.S. , hunt limited amounts of cetaceans for subsistence purposes , but these numbers are very small .
The IWC is a voluntary organization not backed up by any treaty , so its ability to regulate whaling is limited .
Perhaps the biggest factor in nations ’ willingness to honor the moratorium is the court of public opinion ; awareness of the plight of cetaceans has skyrocketed since the 1960s when environmental groups like Greenpeace first began publicizing the threats faced by the largest creatures on the planet .
Today “ Save the Whales ” might seem like a cliché from bygone days , but with so many cetacean species in decline , it just might be a more needed environmental battle cry than ever before .

Over at The Daily Dish , Andrew Sullivan posted a wrenching picture of Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators .
A series of clashes has followed the Israeli decision to add “ The Tomb of the Patriarchs ” to their national register ; the site is part of a complex called the Ibrahimi Mosque , sacred also to Muslims .
The Middle East is not a sandbox where sharing happens .
And so two nations continue a senseless , gruesome intolerance of the other , each rallying to ancient symbols in their holy land that name the same ancestors .
The Jews ’ patriarch is the Muslim ’s Ibrahim / Abraham .
Abraham , a guy mostly concerned with sex and sheep , would not believe the shit going down in his name .
The Jews claim Abraham as their founder , so the Christians have to , too , and the Muslims have a direct link through Abraham ’s son with Hagar , Ishmael .
Abraham ’s very Jewish son Isaac and Ishamel were half - brothers , so we ’re actually all half - brothers and half - sisters with one another if you go in for the Bible and the Quran .
Why the hell ca n’t we love each other or at least pretend to get along at the dinner table — and make room for everyone there ?
The fight over this particular revered building is a very old one .
We ’ve been trading it back and forth between religions for whole eras , squabbling sibs indeed .
But these days the relics of dubious history are being fought over by flesh - and - blood people who have bled each other dry with disuse and contempt .
Some of them have semiautomatic weapons .
How strange that the fathers they claim to honor are shared , and would surely turn away in horror from the awful view , just as Abraham did when his God told him to stab Isaac to death on a mountain ( God was only kidding ) .
Microsoft is the largest , most profitable software company in the world .
And its profits are still being generated by the same engines that have driven Microsoft for years : Office , Windows , and its server division .
( Meanwhile , its entertainment and devices division is only recently profitable again , and its online division is a money pit . )
This is why Google is increasingly focusing on disrupting Microsoft 's core businesses , including its Google Docs rival to Office ; its Chrome OS rival to Windows ; and now Google Buzz , an add - on to Gmail that some have compared most closely to Sharepoint , one of Microsoft 's enterprise tools .

R eading the leaks from Washington , you can tell we ’re gearing up to do something in Yemen .
A little regime - change action maybe , a sideshow to the big production number in Iraq .
Hitting Yemen makes sense–a lot more sense than occupying Iraq .
Nobody in DC really believes that Saddam and his two million mustache - clone slaves could really threaten a nest of ants , much less America .
They peddle that stuff to the suckers , but they do n’t believe it themselves .
They do n’t believe the crap they throw out about Iraq as a haven for terrorists , either .
No Arab militant would be seen dead with Saddam ; they hate him as much as we do .
Saddam could n’t even persuade Abu Nidal to work for him , for Christ ’s sake !
Abu died in Baghdad last month , and by all accounts he was offed on Saddam ’s orders , because he would n’t set up the agent networks Saddam wanted .
When a dictator ca n’t make Abu Nidal start up terror networks , folks , then that dictator is just not a competent manager of “ human resources , ” as my asshole Christian boss would say .
I think it ’s pretty clear by now that ol ’
Saddam is about the worst personnel manager since Jeffrey Dahmer started trying to figure out how to make his tricks stay the night .
Fact is , Saddam as terror - monger is a joke .
If Iraq is a threat to America ’s big cities , then I ’m a 29 ″ waist .
But Yemen … that ’s a different story .
The Yemen connection to Al Qaeda is for real .
The attack on the USS Cole in Yemeni waters was just a small sample of the scary stuff waiting for anyone who tries to take Yemen .
Sana ’a , the Yemeni capital , is full of soldiers , spies and recruiters for every Jihad from Kashmir to Algeria .
Bin Laden himself is Yemeni .
The bin Laden clan were typical Yemenis : energetic , hardworking , a lot tougher and smarter than the average Arab .
Bin Laden ’s father did a Jed Clampitt : loaded up the truck an’ headed for the big money , building big public projects in Riyadh .
The Saudis were always happy to let their poor Yemeni cousins do the work .
The Saudis are mixed up in Yemen right up to their noses .
Typically for them , the goddamn morons , they were a lot better at stirring up Islamic crazies than controlling them once they were riled up .
Saudi Arabia has been trying to keep Yemen off - balance for most of the twentieth century .
The last thing they want to see is a strong , united Yemen on their southern borders .
They ’re afraid of the Yemenis - and for good reason .
The Saudis have every hi-tech weapon money can buy , but they do n’t have any soldiers worth a damn .
The Yemenis are fiercer , smarter , and quicker by far .
They ’ve been warring against each other for decades .
They ’d go through the fat , phony Saudi Army like a mongoose through a dairy cow .
And that ’s why trying to pull off a “ regime change ” in Yemen wo n’t be easy .
These people can fight .
More importantly , they can fight without getting orders from a central source , unlike the Iraqis .
And they can handle any amount of chaos we throw at them .
They thrive on it .
And as for setting up a “ regime change ” — there ai n’t no “ regime ” in Yemen in the first place !
As my high - school guidance counselor used to say , “ That ’s the root of the whole problem ! ”
The big vacuum where a state would be is what makes Yemen the preferred destination for every Arab radical on the run .
The history of Yemen is uncommonly fucked - up , even by the standards of the Arabian Peninsula .
And that ’s sayin ’ somethin’ !
I mean , where do you want to begin ?
Pick any date you want ; it ’s going to be the same .
Here ’s a simplified Yemeni history timescale :
2000 BC : Yemen ruled by Queen of Sheba , who ’s actually mentioned in the Bible .
High point of Yemeni development .
It ’s all downhill from here .
1999 BC to 1838 AD . : Anarchy , chaos .
Slavetaking and pillage .
Tribes controlled by petty chieftains joined in shifting alliances with frequent betrayals .
1838 AD : The British land and claim Aden and South Yemen for the Crown .
The British grabbed a piece of the Yemen coast on the off - chance it might come in handy someday .
They were n’t shy back then , before “ Imperialism ” was a dirty word .
If they saw a shoreline that looked inhabitable , they rowed ashore and planted a Union Jack .
They held onto Yemen for decades , but it was n’t until the Suez Canal was finished in 1870 that they finally realized what they ’d wanted Yemen for .
By God , it commanded the entry to the Red Sea !
While the British were occupying South Yemen , the part facing the Indian Ocean , the Ottomans held onto Northern Yemen , the part that faces the Red Sea .
Both empires settled for forts along the coasts .
Nobody much wanted to explore inland , where the tribes still ruled themselves .
Those tribes did n’t take kindly to surprise visitors ( and still do n’t ) .
So the borders of Yemen start out at the coasts with big strong dark lines , then fade into nothing as they head inland .
Nobody really knows where the borders are once you head inland .
It ’s the Rub - al - Khali , “ The Empty Quarter ” — the nastiest , driest and blankest part of the whole stinking Arabian peninsula .
Until they found oil up there , nobody but the tribes gave a damn who owned it .
( Since then , the Saudis , the big hogs , have started working up a nice little border war with the Yemenis . )
In 1918 the Ottoman Empire — one of the biggest , oldest empires in the world — just crumbled .
Northern Yemen , which used to be Ottoman territory , was suddenly independent , whether it wanted to be or not .
The British held onto South Yemen , though .
The North tried forcing the British to pull out of the South so they could set up a united Yemeni state .
The British sent more troops .
Yemenis fought a small but deadly little guerrilla war against the British right through to 1967 , when the British finally pulled out .
That ’s when Yemeni history gets REALLY confusing and messed - up .
To oversimplify : the British withdrawal in 1967 left a power vacuum in South Yemen .
It filled up fast with the “ Pan - Arab ” schemes which were all the rage among early - sixties towelheads .
In 1962 , North Yemen had joined the “ United Arab Republic , ” a big pan -Arab scheme run out of Egypt .
That was a disaster , but it gave the Egyptian intelligence services a foot in the Yemeni door .
A coup against the Yemeni ruling family that year gave all the local powers a chance to interfere : the Saudis backed the Yemeni Royals , the Egyptians supported the rebels .
But it was n’t really ideological .
Nothing ever is in countries like Yemen .
It was the old clan - vs - clan warfare , just gussied up with fancy foreign words about “ democracy ” and “ socialism . ”
That was exactly what happened in 1967 , when South Yemen , newly independent , renamed itself “ The People ’s Republic of South Yemen . ”
That set the next , inevitable war : this time a civil war between the royalist North and the Communist South .
It was Vietnam reversed ; alone among Third World conflicts , the South were the evil commies , and the North were the good anti-commies .
Most freedom - loving folks were used to rooting on the South of any Third World civil war against the North : South Vietnam , South Korea …
It was so confusing that it just never made the papers .
That war got off the ground in 1972 and ran , off and on , right up to 1990 .
In that time there were dozens of peace treaties , coups , unions , declarations , promises and commissions .
It ’s impossible to say how bloody the war was – more like a long - running feud .
As far as I can tell ,
none of the treaties and declarations made a damn bit of difference .
Weirdly enough , there was apparently something actually resembling peace in Yemen for a couple of years in the early ’90s .
Somebody tell Dan Akroyd !
He should ’ve put this on his Strange Impossible Paranormal Events series : peace in Yemen !
The locals were so embarrassed at this “ peace ” thing that they got to work and started up the good ol ’
North vs. South Civil War again in 1994 .
This time it was the South saying it wanted out of United Yemen .
( You ca n’t blame them .
If I had a family like this , I ’d be down at the courthouse with a petition for a name - change first thing on Monday morning . )
The new war was going very nicely , with the Saudis sniffing around the borders looking to make a little extra trouble without actually having to fight , like the overfed jackals they are .
If this all sounds completely insane , that ’s because it is .
Fact is , Yemen does n’t have a “ history ” like some nice European country .
What ’s the history of a gangfight ?
We ’re talking about the Horn of Africa , for God ’s sake !
Somalia is just across the straits !
Small - scale war ( or big - time banditry , if you prefer ) is a way of life in those parts .
There are inland zones in Yemen where kidnapping for profit is still the big local industry .
The power of the government , if any , never really made it into these “ tribal areas like Hawdramawt , which is a permanent no - go zone for government troops .
If you have the money or the right connections , you ’re welcome in the “ Tribal Areas . ”
The backwoods Yemenis are kind of like backwoods people anywhere : they do n’t trust the gummin’t , not even a little , and they have a soft spot for outlaws on the run .
If anybody from the Yemeni government tried to come in and take out a “ guest , ” they ’d be violating those “ age - old laws of hospitality ” you always hear about these savages having .
These tribal hosts resent that .
And they express their feelings with AKs and RPGs .
Last year we found out just how seriously they resent it .
The US prodded the Yemenis to send troops into one of the “ tribal areas ” to flush out some Al Qaeda suspects sheltering with the locals .
It was not what you would call an unqualified success : 18 government soldiers died , versus three local “ tribal fighters . ”
I ’d say the locals won that one .
I ’d say somebody got himself ambushed .
And I ’d say that if I were a Yemeni soldier , I ’d report sick on the day they sent the next patrol into that neighborhood .
The most obvious lesson from Yemen ’s incredibly fucked - up history is that these people are good guerrilla fighters .
They ’ve been at it long enough , damn it — they should be good at it by now .
So it would be a big mistake to treat Yemen like Iraq .
The invasion of Iraq is going to be a cakewalk , militarily .
I mean , Jeez — remember Sam Kinison ’s bit on the Iraqi Army ?
“ They were surrendering to video cameras !
‘ Put your hands up or I ’ll zoom !
I ’ll do it !
Do n’t make me zoom you ! ”
Yemenis are a different breed .
They fight back .
And they fight dirty .
But hey , so do we .
We fight dirty with the best of ’em .
There was a truly glorious kill last week in Yemen , when a Hellfire launched from a CIA Predator RPV managed to vaporize a half - dozen Al Qaeda guys who were driving around Yemen in their SUV .
I wonder if any of the surviving relatives tried to collect on the insurance .
“ Sorry guys , Toyota Landcruisers are not warranted against the impact of a Hellfire missile . ”
The Hellfire warhead was designed to penetrate the turret armor of a 55 - ton tank , so you can imagine what an easy time it had annihilating an SUV .
Did you see the pictures of the kill - scene ?
That ’s my idea of good porn .
There was just a smudge on the ground where the SUV had been .
You ’d ’ve needed dental records to decide what make and model it was .
Quincy , M.D. : “ The molars look Toyota , but the bicuspids are Honda … ”
As for the occupants , there were no body - parts left at all .
This was one accident where even my Driver ’s Ed teacher , who was totally insane on the subject of seatbelts , would ’ve had to admit that buckling up would n’t ’ve made much difference .
Even driver - side airbags would n’t have helped these fuckers .
It ’s nice to see the Hellfire getting a little action , because it ’s one of the real success stories of US weapons design .
It was developed to provide attack helicopters , specifically the AH 64 ( “ Apache ” ) with a standoff weapon which could kill all Soviet armored vehicles .
The name stands for “ Helicopter - launched Fire - and - Forget ” missile .
But “ Hellfire ” makes the point pretty nicely on its own .
The missile acquires the target before it ’s fired .
Once the helicopter enters the target data , it can fire the missile and immediately take evasive action .
The missile guides itself to the target .
The idea was that Hellfire would allow AH 64 pilots the chance to attack Soviet convoys and get out of sight quickly , before the ZSU - 23 quad AA vehicles that traveled with all Soviet convoys could bring their guns to bear .
The Apache would track the Soviet convoy , in tandem with smaller scout choppers , then pop up out of the forest ( they were imagining a Central European NATO / Warsaw Pact scenario ) , launch its Hellfires , then zoom off low and fast .
The Israelis appreciated the Hellfire before anybody else .
They have a good eye for the American weapons that really work .
Hellfires have been weapon of choice in the strikes Israel ’s been making on Hamas leaders travelling in their cars .
The Israelis were also the big pioneers in using RPVs in combat .
So you can see that this CIA strike in Yemen , using a Hellfire fired from an RPV , has IDF / Mossad influence written all over it .
The whole notion of assassinating your enemies on their home ground is a big Israeli tradition too , of course .
Mossad and Shin Beth have a rep that they will track you down anywhere , no matter what it costs or how long it takes .
The CIA does n’t have that kind of reputation .
I hate to say it , but they used to be kind of a joke when it came to assassinations .
I remember a joke I heard from one of my quasi - spook net friends : “ In 1964 there was an attempt to assassinate Sukarno .
Everybody knew immediately that the CIA was behind it , because the bomb killed every single person in a crowded room EXCEPT Sukarno . ”
But the CIA did it right this time .
And durn , they were proud of themselves .
Whatever happened to the “ cloak of secrecy ” ?
Everybody at CIA was on the phone , calling reporters , faxing graphic shots of the vaporized SUV to the wire services .
I mean I appreciate a good kill shot - we get way too few in this war - but it does n’t make me respect them .
If we stick to firing Hellfires from RPVs , we may be able to do the job in Yemen — kill the people who need killing without losing anybody of our own .
We might even be able to bribe some locals to kidnap the people we want .
All that tribal “ hospitality ” crap tends to evaporate when you offer some lice - ridden sheik a million bucks to hand over his “ guest . ”
A few deals like that , and we can bring the people we want to Gauntanamo for one of those special US Marine Corps makeovers , with blindfolds and earplugs , manacles and white noise - the whole “ Welcome to the World of Consequences ” treatment .
That would be the smart way to do it .
But it ’s not like we just found out about Yemen .
The Cole got blown up in October , 2000 — and all we heard for two years was bitch - fights from every agency in DC about whose fault it was .
It ’s a classic matchup : Yemen vs. the USA — a dirt - poor little country with no government at all vs. a big rich superpower with so much government it can’t seem to get anything done .

I keep bouncing around with what i want for a watermark image , and I have an idea I like but I 've been too lazy and / or busy to draw up .
I 'll get around to it eventually .
University of Texas at Dallas economist Stan J. Liebowitz drops a huge bomb on conventional wisdom about the real estate bubble :
This has not been a " subprime " mortgage crisis at all .
In fact , subprime mortgages in some categories are still not defaulting at record - high levels .
Instead , by far the most important determinant of default — and the common feature of nearly all defaults since 2006 — is whether the mortgage has an adjustable interest rate :
The mortgage data do not suggest that subprime loans went bad first , followed by Alt - As and then prime loans .
Instead , the data suggest that adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) went bad first , with the rise occurring at about the same to for both prime and subprime ARMs .
Foreclosure rates on fixed rate mortgages ( FRMs ) , both prime and subprime , barely participated in the foreclosure outbreak , having much smaller and much later increases in foreclosures .
To understand why this is important , please consider how widespread the belief in the subprime crisis really is .
The president believes it .
The media believe it .
I believed it , and if you want to play gotcha on me , here 's your chance .
I can not speak to the quality of Liebowitz 's data , which are drawn from the Mortgage Bankers Association 's National Delinquency Survey .
But the case he puts together is pretty damned interesting .
And it makes intuitive sense :
If you 're flipping or buying a second home or betting on the come , you want to reduce your short - term exposure .
And we already know that being underwater on a mortgage is the primary factor in the decision to default .
Back at the end of the Bush Administration ( were we really so young back then ?
will we ever learn to laugh again ? ) , there was a fad for a financial metaphor drawn from epidemiology : that the crisis began with subprime loans but could begin to " spread " to prime loans .
In fact , however , prime default rates began spiking at the same time as or even slightly before subprime default rates .
But while the role of ARMs was getting a lot of attention at the time , nobody defined it as the reset crisis or the recast crisis .
So for example , at the moment Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was giving this May 2007 speech about the sub - prime crisis , there was already a year 's worth of data showing that prime and sub - prime loan defaults were growing , in percentage terms , at almost exactly the same rate .
( Sub - prime loans have higher ordinary default rates . )
Bernanke of course had a personal stake in deceiving the public in this way .
He himself was carrying an adjustable - rate mortgage at the time , which he has subsequently managed to refi—thus locking in an attractive rate before raising interest rates on the rest of us .
But why was everybody else so eager to believe it ?
Liebowitz suggests a possibility : " The subprime story provided an easy scapegoat : subprime lenders . "
Even more convenient are the scapegoats who do n't get any attention : subprime borrowers .
Nobody would doubt that subprime borrowers , who are most likely to have low incomes and little financial experience , must be the leading edge of the default phenomenon .
Except that it seems to be untrue .
A low - income , bad - credit borrower who is serious about owning a home is more likely to keep making payments in hard times than a higher - income , good - credit person who has arranged his purchase so as to have little or no equity in the house .
Major pieces of the conventional wisdom about the mortgage collapse continue to fall apart on inspection .
We know , for example , that houses still sell when you cut the asking price , that unemployment is not a major factor in defaults , that modifying loans does not help bad borrowers .
If Liebowitz is right about ARMs as the main cause of defaults , we will , as he says , " have very different economic explanations for the defaults and very different remedies . "
We 'd also have a better understanding about why all efforts to treat the situation are just making the patient worse .
But there 's a class element here too .
The right hates poor people and the left loves them to death .
But both agree that the poor must not be left to make their own decisions on financial matters .
My friend John Hope Bryant says the difference between being broke and being poor is that being poor is a state of mind .
Apparently it 's a state of mind you can be in even if you 're rich .
The sad part is that once upon a time good New Deal liberals were leading the drive to get poor people the tools to help themselves :

Recently , I was asked about credit cards and banks by a friend of mine .
I told her about credit unions and why I thought they were so much better than banks .
For a brief review , you can read my article about the credit union revolution .
A few days later , I received the following email , which I ’m reprinting with her permission :
Dear Kristy ,
Thank you for helping me make a decision to look into a credit union in order to dump my bank .
And thanks for some information about credit and credit cards .
With your encouragement in mind , I did a little research and made a major decision today .
I had a wonderful experience switching to a credit union from my bank and wanted to share .
I chose Sun West Federal Credit Union near me .
The manager has been in the credit union 30 years !
The woman with whom I did most of my “ work ” , a native Arizonan , has been with this credit union since 1996 .
I learned that Sun West was originally the AZ .
Phone Co. Credit Union .
It has great appeal to Good Sam employees because of its location as well as what they offer .
We accomplished so much in two hours !
I opened a checking account and added my auto deposits and bill payments which had been attached to my old account .
Ms. Nelson ( who helped me ) got Social Security on the phone and we have redirected my Social Security to be direct deposited to my new account .
I will take copies of my durable Power of Attorneys ( both my kids ) so they will have access to my account as well as be my beneficiaries .
I will take my bills ( electric , gas , water , insurance , etc ) and she will make calls while I ’m there and changing the automatic billing instructions .
With a credit rating of 816 , I have a Mastercard at a low rate with them .
We accomplished a lot !!!
They set me up with online banking , password and security questions done .
I ca n’t imagine how I could have been more fortunate !
I feel confident this is going a lot smoother than I would ever have hoped after much stewing and consternation over how , when and where to do this .
I will close my old bank checking account next month .
THANK YOU , THANK YOU , THANK YOU !
This is pretty freaking amazing , if you ask me .

7 Threads
A thread , also called a lightweight process , is a flow of control that can execute in parallel with other threads in the same program .
This chapter describes the functions that allow a program to create threads ( Thread module ) and synchronize by means of locks ( Mutex module ) , conditions ( Condition module ) , and synchronous events ( Event module ) .
7.1 Introduction
The creation of a thread is very different from the fork operation that creates a copy of the current process ( and therefore a copy of the program ) .
After a fork , the address spaces of the parent and child are totally disjoint , and the two processes can communicate only through system calls ( like reading or writing a file or a pipe ) .
In contrast , all the threads within a program share the same address space .
The only information that is not shared , and differentiates one thread from another , is the thread ’s identity and its execution stack ( along with certain system information such as the signal mask , the state of locks and conditions , etc. )
From this viewpoint , threads resemble coroutines .
The threads within a given program are all treated in the same fashion , except for the initial thread that was created when the program started .
When this thread terminates , so do all the other threads and therefore the program as a whole .
( Whenever we speak of multiple threads , we will implicitly mean threads within a given program . )
But unlike coroutines , which pass control explicitly from one to another and cannot execute in parallel , threads can execute in parallel and can be scheduled preemptively by the system .
From this viewpoint , threads resemble processes .
The common address space permits threads to communicate directly among themselves using shared memory .
The fact that threads can execute in parallel means that they must synchronize their access to shared data , so that one finishes writing before the other begins reading .
Although not necessary in principle , in practice this requires going through the operating system .
Synchronization is often a difficult part of programming with threads .
It can be done with locks and conditions , or in a higher - level fashion with events .
The advantages of threads over processes are the lower cost of creation and the ability to exchange large data structures simply by passing pointers rather than copying .
On the other hand , using threads incurs the cost of managing the synchronization among them , including the case of a fatal error in one of the threads .
In particular , a thread must be careful to release its locks and preserve its invariant before stopping .
Processes may also be preferable to threads when we cannot really benefit from the latter ’s advantages .
Implementation in OCaml
To compile an application using native threads , use the following :
ocamlc - thread unix.cma threads.cma -o prog mod1.ml mod2.ml mod3.ml ocamlopt - thread unix.cmxa threads.cmxa -o prog mod1.ml mod2.ml mod3.ml
If the ocamlbuild tool is used , all that is needed is to add the following to the _tags file :
< mod { 1,2,3}.ml > : thread < prog.{native , byte} > : use_unix , thread
If your installation does not support native threads , you can refer to section 7.8 or the manual for instructions how to use simulated “ vm - level ” threads .
The text and examples in this chapter assume native threads and do not apply , in general , to vm - level threads .
7.2 Creation and termination of threads
The functions described in this section are defined in the Thread module .
The system call create f v creates a new thread that executes the function application f v and returns a thread id that the caller can use to control the newly - created thread .
The function application executes concurrently with the other threads in the program .
The thread terminates when the application returns and its result is simply ignored .
If the thread terminates with an uncaught exception , the exception is not propagated to any other thread : a message is printed on the standard error output and the exception is otherwise ignored .
( The other threads have proceeded independently and would not be able to receive the exception . )
A thread can also terminate prematurely with the system call exit of the Thread module , not to be confused with Pervasives .
exit that terminates the entire program , i.e. all its threads .
The initial thread of a program implicitly calls the Pervasives .
exit function when it terminates .
When another thread terminates before the initial thread , it is deallocated immediately by the OCaml runtime library .
It does not become a zombie as in the case of a Unix process created by fork .
The system call self returns the thread id of the calling thread .
val self : unit -> t
We already know enough to propose an alternative to the preceding model for the concurrent server that used “ fork ” ( or “ double fork ” ) — by using a thread rather than a child process .
To establish such a server , we introduce a variant Misc.co_treatment of the function Misc. fork_treatment defined in section 6.7 .
let co_treatment server_sock service ( client_descr , _ as client ) = try ignore ( Thread.create service client ) with exn -> close client_descr ; raise exn ; ;
If the thread was successfully created , the treatment is handled entirely by the service function , including closing client_descr .
Otherwise , we close the client_descr descriptor , the client is abandoned , and we let the main program handle the error .
Note that all the difficulty of the co-server is hidden in the service function , which must handle the connection robustly until disconnection .
In the case of a concurrent server where the service is executed by another process , premature termination of the service due to a fatal error produces by default the desired behavior — closing the connection — because the system closes the file descriptors when a process exits .
But in the case where the service is executed by a thread , the descriptors of the different threads are shared by default and not closed at the termination of the thread .
It is therefore up to the thread to close its descriptors before exiting .
In addition , a thread cannot call Pervasives .
exit in the case of a fatal error during the handling of a service , because it would stop not only the service but also the entire server .
Calling Thread .
exit is often not a solution either , because we risk not having properly deallocated the thread ’s open resources , and in particular the connection .
One solution consists of raising an exception to signify a fatal stop ( for example an Exit exception ) , causing finalization code to be executed as it is handled .
For similar reasons , it is essential to block the sigpipe signal during the handling of a service by a thread , replacing the immediate termination of the thread by the raising of an EPIPE exception .
7.3 Waiting
The functions described in this section are defined in the Thread module .
The system call join allows one thread to wait for another to finish .
val join : t -> unit
The calling thread is suspended until the thread with the given thread id has terminated its execution .
This function can also be used by the principal thread to wait for all the other threads to finish before terminating itself and the program .
( The default behavior is to kill the other threads without waiting for them to terminate . )
Although this call is blocking and therefore “ long ” , it is restarted automatically when a signal is received : it is effectively interrupted by the signal , the handler is invoked , then the call is restarted .
The call therefore does not return until the thread has really terminated , and the call never raises the EINTR exception .
From the viewpoint of the OCaml programmer , it behaves as if the signal was received at the moment when the call returns .
A thread does not return , since it is executed asynchronously .
But its action can be observed — luckily !
— by its side effects .
For example , one thread can place the result of a computation in a reference that another thread will consult after making sure that the calculation has finished .
We illustrate this in the following example .
exception Exited type ' a result = Value of ' a | Exception of exn let eval f x = try Value ( f x ) with z ->
Exception z let coexec ( f : ' a -> 'b ) ( x : ' a ) : unit -> 'b = let result = ref ( Exception Exited ) in let p = Thread .create ( fun x -> result := eval f x ) x in function ( ) -> match ( join p ; !result ) with | Value v -> v | Exception exn -> raise exn ; ; let v1 = coexec succ 4 and v2 = coexec succ 5 in v1 ( ) + v2 ( ) ; ;
The system can suspend one thread in order to give control temporarily to another , or because it is waiting for a resource being used by another thread ( locks and conditions , for example ) or by another process ( file descriptors , for example ) .
A thread can also suspend itself voluntarily .
The yield function allows a thread to give up control explicitly , without waiting for preemption by the system .
It is a hint for the thread scheduler , but it may have no effect , for example if no other thread can execute immediately , the system may give control back to the same thread .
Conversely , it is not necessary to execute yield to permit other threads to execute , because the system reserves the right to execute the yield command itself at any moment .
In fact , it exercises this right sufficiently often to permit other threads to execute and to give the illusion that the threads are running in parallel , even on a uniprocessor machine .
Example
We can revisit the example of section 3.3 and modify it to use threads rather than processes .
1 let rec psearch k cond v = 2 let n = Array . length v in 3 let slice i = Array. sub v ( i * k ) ( min k ( n - i * k ) ) in 4 let slices = Array.init ( n /k ) slice in 5 let found = ref false in 6 let pcond v = if ! found then Thread .exit ( ) ; cond v in 7 let search v = if simple_search pcond v then found := true in 8 let proc_list = Array.map ( Thread.create search ) slices in 9 Array.iter Thread .
join proc_list ; 10 ! found ; ; psearch k cond v =n = Array.
length vslice i = Array.sub v ( i * k ) ( min k ( n - i * k ) ) slices = Array.init ( n/k ) slicefound =pcond v =!foundThread.exit ( ) ; cond vsearch v =simple_search pcond vfound :=proc_list = Array.map ( Thread.create search ) slicesArray.iter
Thread .join proc_list ;!found ; ;
The function psearch k f v searches with k threads in parallel for an array element satisfying the function f .
The function pcond allows the search to be interrupted when an answer has been found .
All the threads share the same reference found : they can therefore access it concurrently .
No critical section is required , because if different threads write to this resource in parallel , they write the same value .
It is important that the threads do not write the result of the search when it is false !
For example , replacing line 7 by let search v = found := ! found && simple_search pcond v or even : let search v = let r = simple_search pcond v in found := ! found && r would be incorrect .
* * *
The parallel search is interesting even on a uniprocessor machine if the comparison of elements could be blocked temporarily ( for example by disk accesses or network connections ) .
In this case , the thread performing the search passes control to another and the machine can therefore continue the computation on another part of the array and return to the blocked thread when its resource is free .
Access to certain elements can have significant latency , on the order of a second if information must be retrieved over the network .
In this case , the difference in behavior between a sequential search and a parallel search becomes obvious .

The other forms of suspension are tied to operating system resources .
A thread can be suspended for a certain time by calling delay s .
Once s seconds elapse , it can be restarted .
This primitive is provided for portability with vm - level threads , but delay s is simply an abbreviation for ignore ( Unix.select [ ] [ ] [ ] s ) .
This call , unlike join , is not restarted when it is interrupted by a signal .
To synchronize a thread with an external operation , we can use the select command .
Note that this will block only the calling thread and not the entire program .
( The Thread module redefines this function , because in the case of simulated threads calling the one in the Unix module would block the whole program and therefore all the threads .
It is therefore necessary to use select from the Thread module and not Unix. select , even if the two are equivalent in the case of native threads . )
Example
To make the Sieve of Eratosthenes example of section 5.2 work with threads instead of by duplication of Unix processes , it suffices to replace the lines 5 – 16 of the function filter by : let p = Thread .
create filter ( in_channel_of_descr fd_in ) in let output = out_channel_of_descr fd_out in try while true do let n = input_int input in if List.exists ( fun m -> n mod m = 0 ) first_primes then ( ) else output_int output n done ; with End_of_file -> close_out output ; Thread .
join p and the lines 4 –10 of the function sieve by : let k = Thread .
create filter ( in_channel_of_descr fd_in ) in let output = out_channel_of_descr fd_out in generate len output ; close_out output ; Thread .
join k ; ;
However , we cannot expect any significant gain from this example , which uses few processes relative to computation time .

7.4 Synchronization among threads : locks
The functions in this section are defined in the Mutex module ( as in Mut ual ex clusion ) .
We mentioned above a problem of concurrent access to mutable resources .
In particular , the following scenario illustrates the problem of access to shared resources .
Consider a counter c and two processes p and q , each incrementing the counter in parallel .
Assume the scenario described in figure 6 .
Thread p reads the value of counter c , then gives control to q .
In its turn , q reads the value of c , then writes the value k+1 to c .
The thread p resumes control and writes the value k+1 to c .
The final value of c is therefore k+1 instead of k+2 .
This classic problem can be resolved by using locks that prevent arbitrary interleaving of p and q .
Locks are shared objects that can be held by at most a single thread within a program at a time .
A lock is created by the function create .
val create : unit -> t
This function returns a new lock , initially not held by any thread .
To acquire an existing lock , it is necessary to use the system call lock with the lock as argument .
If the lock is held by another thread , the caller is frozen until the lock is released .
A lock must be released explicitly by the thread that holds it with the system call unlock .
val val lock : t -> unit unlock : t -> unit
The lock call behaves like Thread .
join with respect to signals : if the thread receives a signal while executing lock , the signal will be noted ( i.e. the OCaml runtime will be notified that the signal has arrived ) , but the thread will continue to wait so that lock effectively returns only when the lock has been acquired , and never raises the EINTR exception .
The real treatment of the signal by OCaml will happen only upon the return from lock .
We can also try to acquire a lock without blocking with the system call trylock
This function returns true if the lock has been acquired and false otherwise .
In the latter case , execution is not suspended since the lock is not acquired .
The thread can therefore do something else and eventually return and try its luck later .
Example Incrementing a global counter used by several threads poses a synchronization problem : the instants between reading the value of the counter and writing the incremented value are in a critical region , i.e. two threads cannot be in this region at the same time .
The synchronization can easily be managed with a lock .
type counter = { lock : Mutex.t ; mutable counter : int } let newcounter ( ) = { lock = Mutex.create ( ) ; counter = 0 } let addtocounter c k = Mutex.lock c.lock ; c.counter <- c.counter + k ; Mutex.unlock c.lock ; ;
The sole read operation on the counter poses no problem .
It can be performed in parallel with a modification of the counter : the result will simply be the value of the counter just before or just after the modification , both results being consistent .
* * *
A common pattern is to hold a lock temporarily during a function call .
It is of course necessary to make sure to release the lock at the end of the call , whether the call succeeded or failed .
We can abstract this behavior in a library function :
let run_with_lock l f x = Mutex.lock l ; try_finalize f x Mutex.unlock l
In the preceding example , we could also have written :
let addtocounter c = Misc.run_with_lock c.lock ( fun k -> c.counter <- c.counter + k)
Example
An alternative to the model of the server with threads is to start a number of threads in advance which handle requests in parallel .
val tcp_farm_server : int -> ( file_descr -> file_descr * sockaddr -> ' a ) -> sockaddr -> unit
The tcp_farm_server function behaves like tcp_server but takes an additional argument which is the number of threads to start , each of which will become a server at the same address .
The advantage of a pool of threads is to reduce the time to handle each connection by eliminating the cost of creating a thread for it , since they are created once and for all .
let tcp_farm_server n treat_connection addr = let server_sock = Misc.install_tcp_server_socket addr in let mutex = Mutex.create ( ) in let rec serve ( ) = let client = Misc.run_with_lock mutex ( Misc.restart_on_EINTR accept ) server_sock in treat_connection server_sock client ; serve ( ) in for i = 1 to n- 1 do ignore ( Thread. create serve ( ) ) done ; serve ( ) ; ;
The only precaution to take is to ensure mutual exclusion around the accept so that only one of the threads accepts a connection at a time .
The idea is that the treat_connection function performs a sequential treatment , but it is not a requirement — we can effectively combine a pool of threads with the creation of new threads , which can be dynamically adjusted depending on the load .
* * *
Acquisition of a lock is an inexpensive operation when it succeeds without blocking .
It is generally implemented with a single “ test - and - set ” instruction provided by all modern processors ( plus other small costs that are involved , such as updating caches ) .
However , when the lock is not available , the process must be suspended and rescheduled later , which involves a significant additional cost .
We must therefore incur this penalty only for a real suspension of a process in order to give control to another , and not for its potential suspension during the acquisition of a lock .
Consequently , we will almost always want to release a lock as soon as possible and take it back later if necessary , rather than simply holding onto the lock .
Avoiding these two operations would have the effect of enlarging the critical region and therefore the frequency with which another thread finds itself effectively in competition for the lock and in need of suspension .
Locks reduce interleaving .
In return , they increase the risk of deadlock .
For example , there is a deadlock if a thread p waits for a lock v held by a thread q which itself waits for a lock u held by p.
( In the worst case , a thread waits for a lock that it holds itself . )
Concurrent programming is difficult , and guarding against deadlock is not always easy .
A simple way of avoiding this situation that is often possible consists of defining a hierarchy among the locks and ensuring that the order in which the locks are acquired dynamically respects the hierarchy : a thread never acquires a lock unless that lock is dominated by all the other locks that the thread already holds .
7.5 Complete example : http relay
We modify the http relay developed in section 6.14 so that it services requests using threads .
Intuitively , it suffices to replace the establish_server function that creates a process clone with a function that creates a thread .
We must however take certain precautions .
The challenge with threads is that they share the entire memory space .
We must therefore ensure that the threads are not “ stepping on each other ’s toes ” with one undoing what was just done by another .
That typically happens when two threads modify the same mutable structure in parallel .
In the case of the http server , there are several changes to make .
Let us start by resolving problems with access to resources .
The proxy_service function , described in section 6.14 , handles the treatment of connections .
Via the intermediary functions parse_host , parse_url and parse_request , it calls the regexp_match function which uses the Str library .
However , this library is not re-entrant ( the result of the last search is stored in a global variable ) .
This example shows that we must beware of calls to innocent - looking functions that hide potential collisions .
In this case we will not rewrite the Str library but simply sequentialize its use .
It suffices to protect calls to this library with locks ( and there is really no other choice ) .
We must still take the precaution of releasing the lock when returning from the function abnormally due to an exception .
To modify the existing code as little as possible , we can just rename the definition of regexp_match in the Url module as unsafe_regexp_match and then define regexp_match as a protected version of unsafe_regexp_match .
let strlock = Mutex.create ( ) ; ; let regexp_match r string = Misc.run_with_lock strlock ( unsafe_regexp_match r) string ; ;
The change is rather minimal .
It should be noted that the regexp_match function includes both the expression matching and the extraction of the matched groups .
It would definitely have been incorrect to protect the Str.string_match and Str.matched_group functions individually .
Another solution would be to rewrite the analysis functions without using the Str library .
But there is no reason for such a choice , since synchronizing the library primitives is easy to do and does not turn out to be a source of inefficiency .
Obviously , a better solution would be for the Str library to be re-entrant in the first place .
The other functions that are called are already re-entrant , in particular the Misc.retransmit function that allocates different buffers for each call .
However , there are still some precautions to take regarding error handling .
The handling of a connection by a thread must be robust , as explained above .
In particular , in case of error , the other threads must not be affected .
In other words , the thread must terminate “ normally ” , properly closing the connection in question and going back to accepting other pending connections .
We must first of all replace the call to exit in handle_error because it is essential not to kill the whole process .
A call to Thread .
exit would not be correct either , because thread termination does not close its ( shared ) descriptors , the way the system does for process termination .
An error in the handling of a connection would leave the connection open .
The solution consists of raising an Exit exception that allows the finalization code to do what is required .
We must now protect treat_connection by catching all errors , in particular Exit but also EPIPE , which can be raised if the client closes the connection prematurely .
We will take care of this by using a protected function .
let allow_connection_errors f s = try f s with Exit | Unix_error ( EPIPE , _, _ ) -> ()
let treat_connection s = Misc.co_treatment s ( allow_connection_errors proxy_service ) in

7.6 Conditions
The functions described in this section are defined in the Condition module .
Synchronization with locks is very simple , but it is not sufficient : locks allow waiting for shared data to be free , but do not allow waiting for the data to have a particular state .
Let us replace the example of a counter by a ( first - in / first - out ) queue shared among several threads .
Adding a value to the queue can be synchronized by using a lock as above , since no matter what the state of the queue , we can always add an element .
But what about removing an element from the queue ?
What should be done when the queue is empty ?
We cannot hold the lock while waiting for the queue to be filled , because that would completely prevent another thread from filling the queue .
So it must be released .
But how can we know when the queue is no longer empty , except by testing it periodically ?
This solution , called “ busy - waiting ” , is definitely not satisfactory .
Either it consumes computing cycles unnecessarily ( period too short ) or else it it is not reactive enough ( period too long ) .
Conditions provide a solution to this problem .
A thread that holds a lock can wait for a condition object until another thread sends a signal on that condition .
As with locks , conditions are passive structures that can be manipulated by synchronization functions .
They can be created by the create function .
val create : unit -> t
A process p that already holds a lock v can wait on a condition c and the lock v with the system call wait .
The process p informs the system that it is waiting on the condition c and the lock v , then releases the lock v and goes to sleep .
It will not be woken up by the system until another thread q signals a change on the condition c and the lock v is available ; the process p will then hold the lock v again .
val wait : t -> Mutex .t -> unit
Note : it is an error to call wait c v without holding the lock v .
The behavior of wait c v with respect to signals is the same as for Mutex.lock .
When a thread signals a change on a condition , it can either ask for all threads waiting on that condition to be woken up ( system call broadcast ) , or else for just one of them to be woken up ( system call signal ) .
val val signal : t -> unit broadcast : t -> unit
Sending a signal or a broadcast on a condition does not require holding a lock ( unlike waiting ) , in the sense that it will not trigger a “ system ” error .
However , it can sometimes be a programming error .
The choice between waking up one thread or all the threads depends on the problem .
To consider the example of the queue again , if a thread adds an element to an empty queue , there is no need to wake up all the others , since only one will effectively be able to remove that element .
On the other hand , if it adds a number of elements that is either not statically known or very large , it must wake up all the threads .
Note that if adding an element to a non-empty queue does not send a signal , then adding an element to an empty queue must send a broadcast , since it could be followed immediately by another addition ( without a signal ) and therefore behave like a multiple addition .
In summary , either send a signal on every addition , or send a broadcast only when adding to an empty queue .
The choice between these two strategies is a bet on whether the queue is usually empty ( first solution ) or usually non-empty ( second solution ) .
Often , one thread knows only an approximation of the reason why another thread is waiting on a condition .
It will therefore signal the condition whenever the situation might be what the other thread is waiting for .
An awakened thread , therefore , cannot assume that the condition it was waiting is now satisfied .
It must , in general , re-test the state of its shared data , and if necessary wait on the condition again .
This does not constitute busy - waiting , because it only happens when another thread signals the condition .
Here is another justification for this approach : when a thread has just produced a lot of some resource and wakes all the others using a broadcast , nothing prevents the first one that wakes up from being greedy and exhausting the entire resource .
The second one to wake up must go back to sleep , hoping to be luckier next time .
We can now give a concrete solution for shared queues .
The queue structure defined in the Queue module is extended with a lock and a non_empty condition .
1 type 'a t = 2 { queue : 'a Queue.t ; lock : Mutex.t ; non_empty : Condition .t } 3 let create ( ) = 4 { queue = Queue.create ( ) ; 5 lock = Mutex.create ( ) ; non_empty = Condition.create ( ) } 6 7 let add e q = 8 Mutex.lock q.lock ; 9 if Queue.length q.queue = 0 then Condition .
broadcast q.non_empty ; 10 Queue.add e q.queue ; 11 Mutex.unlock q.lock ; ; 12 13 let take q = 14 Mutex.lock q.lock ; 15 while Queue.length q.queue = 0 16 do Condition.wait q.non_empty q.lock done ; 17 let x = Queue . take q.queue in 18 Mutex.unlock q.lock ; x ; ; 'a t ={ queue : 'a Queue.t ; lock : Mutex.t ; non_empty : Condition.t }create ( ) ={ queue = Queue.create ( ) ; lock = Mutex.create ( ) ; non_empty = Condition.create ( ) }add e q = Mutex.lock q.lock;Queue.length q.queue = 0Condition.broadcast q.non_empty ; Queue.add e q.queue;Mutex.unlock q.lock ; ; take q =Mutex.lock q.lock;Queue.length q.queue = 0 Condition.wait q.non_empty q.lockx = Queue.take q.queueMutex.unlock q.lock ; x ; ;
Addition never blocks , but we must not forget to signal the non_empty condition when the list is empty beforehand , because it is possible that someone is waiting on the condition .
Removal is a little more complicated : after acquiring the lock , we must try to remove an element from the queue .
If the queue is empty , we must wait on the non_empty condition .
When awakened , we try again , knowing that we already have the lock .
As explained above , the broadcast q.non_empty signal ( line 9 ) is executed by a thread p already in possession of the lock q.lock .
This implies that a reader thread q executing the take function cannot be between line 15 and 16 where it would have verified that the queue is empty but not yet have gone to sleep .
In this case , the signal sent by p would be ineffective and ignored , since q has not gone to sleep yet ; but q would then go to sleep and not be woken up , because p has already sent its signal .
The lock therefore guarantees that either q is already asleep or else has not yet tested the state of the queue .
Exercise 21 Implement a variant in which the queue is bounded : addition to the queue becomes blocking when the size of the queue reaches a fixed value .
( In a concurrent world , we might need this scheme to avoid having a producer that produces endlessly while the consumer is blocked . )

7.7 Event - based synchronous communication
The functions described in this section are defined in the Event module .
Locks and conditions together allow all forms of synchronization to be expressed .
However , their use is not always easy , as shown by the example of the initially simple queue whose synchronization code subsequently turned out to be subtle .
Event - based synchronous communication is a collection of higher - level communication primitives that tend to facilitate concurrent programming .
The primitives in the Event module were initially developed by John Reppy as an extension of the Standard ML language called Concurrent ML [ 16 ] .
In OCaml , these primitives are located above the more elementary synchronization of locks and conditions .
Communication occurs by sending events along channels .
Channels are like “ lightweight pipes ” : they allow communication among threads in the same program and take care of synchronization between producers and consumers .
A channel carrying values of type 'a has the type 'a Event. channel .
Channels are homogeneous and therefore always carry values of the same type .
A channel is created with the new_channel function .
Sending or receiving a message is not done directly , but through the intermediary of an event .
An elementary event is “ sending a message ” or “ receiving a message ” .
They are constructed by means of the following primitives :
Construction of a message does not have an immediate effect : it just creates a data structure describing the action to be done .
To make an event happen , the thread must synchronize with another thread wishing to make the complementary event happen .
The sync primitive allows a thread to wait for the occurrence of the event passed as argument .
Thus , to send a value v on the channel c , we can execute sync ( send c v ) .
The thread is suspended until the event occurs , that is to say until another thread is ready to receive a value on the channel c .
In a symmetric fashion , a thread can wait for a message on channel c by performing sync ( receive c ) .
There is a competition among all the producers on one hand and all the consumers on the other .
For example , if several threads try to send a message on a channel but only one is ready to read it , it is clear that only one producer will make the event occur .
The others will remain suspended , without even noticing that another was “ served ” ahead of them .
The competition can also occur within the same thread .
Multiple events can be combined by the choose primitive .
The resulting event is an offer , in parallel , of the events passed as arguments , and occurs when exactly one of them occurs .
We distinguish between the offer of an event and its occurrence .
The call sync ( choose [ e1 ; e2 ] ) synchronizes by offering a choice of two events e1 and e2 , but only one of the two events will effectively occur ( the offer of the other event will be simultaneously canceled ) .
The wrap_abort primitive allows to handle an event being canceled .
The call wrap_abort e f creates an event that is equivalent to e , but if it is not chosen during synchronization , then the function f is executed .
( This is only interesting when it is part of a complex event . )
A thread can try to synchronize on an event without blocking ( somewhat like Mutex. try_lock ) with poll .
The call poll e offers the event e but if it cannot occur immediately , it cancels the offer rather than blocking and has no effect ( or more exactly , behaves as if the expression poll e had been replaced by the value None ) .
By contrast , if the event can happen immediately , then it behaves as if the thread had done sync e , except that the value Some v is returned rather than v .
Example
In section 7.3 the example of the Sieve of Eratosthenes , the communication between different threads is done with pipes as in the original program , using system memory ( the pipe ) as intermediary .
We may think that it is more efficient to communicate directly by using the memory of the process .
A simple solution consists of replacing the pipe by a channel on which integers are sent .
Sending integers on the channel is not sufficient , because we must also be able to detect the end of the stream .
The simplest is therefore to pass elements of the form Some n and to terminate by sending the value None .
To minimize the changes , we use the code of the example in section 5.2 .
We simulate pipes and the functions for reading and writing pipes by channels and functions for reading and writing channels .
It is sufficient to take the previous version of the program and change the input / output functions to ones that read and write a channel , rather than an input / output buffer from the Pervasives library .
For example , we can insert the following code at the beginning of the program just after the open Unix ; ; directive : let pipe ( ) = let c = Event.new_channel ( ) in c , c let out_channel_of_descr x = x let in_channel_of_descr x = x let input_int chan = match Event.sync ( Event.receive chan ) with | Some v -> v | None -> raise End_of_file let output_int chan x = Event.sync ( Event. send chan ( Some x ) ) let close_out chan = Event.sync ( Event.send chan None ) ; ;
However , if we compare the efficiency of this version with the previous one , we find that it is twice as slow .
Communication of each integer requires a synchronization between two threads and therefore several system calls for acquiring and releasing locks .
On the other hand , communication via pipes uses buffered i/o that allows several thousand integers to be exchanged with each system call .
To be fair , one should also provide buffered communication on channels , using the channel only to exchange a packet of integers .
The child can accumulate the results in a private queue , to which it can therefore write without synchronization .
When the queue is full , or upon an explicit request , it is emptied by synchronizing on the channel .
The parent has its own queue that it receives by synchronizing and empties gradually .
Here is a solution : type 'a buffered = { c : 'a Queue.t Event.channel ; mutable q : 'a Queue.t ; size : int } let pipe ( ) = let c = Event.new_channel ( ) in c , c ; ; let size = 1024 ; ; let out_channel_of_descr chan = { c = chan ; q = Queue.create ( ) ; size = size } ; ; let in_channel_of_descr = out_channel_of_descr ; ; let input_int chan = if Queue. length chan.q = 0 then begin let q = Event.sync ( Event.receive chan.c ) in if Queue.length q > 0 then chan.q <- q else raise End_of_file end ; Queue. take chan.q ; ; let flush_out chan = if Queue.length chan.q > 0 then Event.sync ( Event.send chan.c chan.q ) ; chan.q <- Queue.create ( ) ; ; let output_int chan x = if Queue. length chan .q = size then flush_out chan ; Queue.add x chan.q let close_out chan = flush_out chan ; Event.sync ( Event.send chan.c chan.q ) ; ;
This version allows us to regain efficiency comparable to ( but not better than ) the version with pipes .
Compared to the original version with processes and pipes , there are two potential advantages .
First , threads are more lightweight and less costly to launch .
Second , communication on a channel merely passes a pointer , without copying .
But these advantages are not noticeable here , because the number of threads created and the data exchanged are not big enough compared to the cost of system calls and compute time .
In conclusion , we can say that communication between threads has a cost of up to one system call ( if the process must be suspended ) and the cost can be significantly reduced by buffering communication and sending larger structures less often .

Exercise 22
An http server can be subjected to a high , bursty load .
To improve response time , we can refine the architecture of an http server by always keeping a dozen threads ready to handle new requests .
This means that a thread does not handle only a single request , but a potentially infinite series of requests that it reads from a queue .
To avoid overloading the machine , we can limit the number of threads to a reasonable value beyond which the overhead of managing tasks exceeds the latency for servicing requests ( time spent waiting for data on disk , etc. ) .
After that , we can keep some connections waiting to be handled , and then finally we can refuse connections .
When the load diminishes and the number of threads is above the “ ideal ” value , some of them are allowed to die and the others remain ready for the next requests .
Transform the example of section 7.5 into this architecture .

7.8 Implementation details
Implementation of threads in Unix
The Unix system was not originally designed to provide support for threads .
However , most modern Unix implementations now offer such support .
Nevertheless , threads remain an add - on that is sometimes apparent .
For example , when using threads it is strongly discouraged to use fork except when doing exec immediately afterward .
In effect , fork copies the current thread , which becomes a crippled process that runs believing it has threads when in fact they do not exist .
The parent continues to run normally as before .
The special case of a call to fork where the child immediately launches another program does not cause the parent any problem .
Luckily , since that is the only way to start other programs !
Inversely , one can do fork ( not followed by exec ) , and then launch several threads in the child and the parent , without any problem .
Native and simulated implementation in OCaml
When the underlying operating system has threads , OCaml can provide a native implementation of threads , leaving their management to the operating system as much as possible .
Each thread then lives in a different Unix process but shares the same address space .
When the system does not provide support for threads , OCaml can emulate them .
All the threads then execute in the same Unix process , and their management , including their scheduling , is handled by the OCaml runtime system .
However , this implementation is only available when compiling to bytecode .
The OCaml system provides the same programming interface for the native and simulated versions of threads .
The implementation of threads is therefore split : one implementation for the emulated version that includes its own task controller , and another implementation that is based on posix ( 1003.1 c ) threads and lifts the corresponding library functions to the level of the OCaml language .
In the process , the OCaml language handles certain simple administrative tasks and ensures an interface identical to the emulated version .
This guarantees that a program compilable on one Unix architecture remains compilable on another Unix architecture .
However , whether threads are emulated or native can change the synchronization of calls to the C library , and therefore change , despite everything , the semantics of the program .
It is therefore necessary to take certain precautions before believing that a program will behave the same way in these two versions .
In this chapter , the discussion mainly concern these two implementations , but recall that by default , we have taken the viewpoint of a native implementation .
To use emulated threads , one must pass the - vmthread option instead of - thread to the ocamlc compiler .
This option is not accepted by the ocamlopt compiler .
Sequentialization of OCaml code
The implementation of threads in OCaml must face one of the peculiarities of the OCaml language : the automatic management of memory and its high consumption of allocated data .
The solution adopted , which is the simplest and also generally the most efficient , is to sequentialize the execution of OCaml code in all threads : a lock in the runtime system prevents two threads from executing OCaml code simultaneously .
This seems contrary to the whole idea of threads , but it is not , since the lock is released before blocking system calls and reacquired upon return .
Other threads can therefore take control at that moment .
A special case of such a system call is the call to sched_yield , performed at regular intervals to suspend the running thread and give control to another .
On a multiprocessor machine , the only source of true parallelism comes from the execution of C code and system calls .
On a uniprocessor machine , the fact that the OCaml code is sequentialized is not really noticeable .
The programmer cannot rely on this sequentialization , because one thread can give control to another at almost any moment .
With one exception , the sequentialization guarantees memory coherence : two threads always have the same view of memory , except perhaps when they execute C code .
In effect , the passing of the lock implies a synchronization of the memory : a read operation by one thread occurring after a write operation to the same address by another thread will always return the freshly - written value , with no need for additional synchronization .
Threads and signals
Generally speaking , using signals is already delicate with a single thread due to their asynchronous character .
It is even more so in the presence of multiple threads because of the addition of new difficulties : which thread should a signal be sent to ?
To all , to the primary one , or to the one currently running ?
What happens if one thread sends a signal to another ?
In fact , threads were implemented before answering these questions , and different implementations can behave differently with respect to signals .
The Thread.join , Mutex.lock , and Condition . wait functions despite being long system calls , are not interruptible by a signal .
( They can not therefore fail with the EINTR error . )
If a signal is sent while waiting , it will be received and handled when the call returns .
The posix standard specifies that the signal handler is shared among all the threads and in contrast the signal mask is private to each thread and inherited upon creation of a thread .
But the behavior of threads with respect to signals remains largely underspecified and therefore non-portable .
It is therefore preferable to avoid as much as possible the use of asynchronous signals ( such as sigalrm , sigvtalrm , sigchld , etc. ) with threads .
These can be blocked and examined with Thread .
wait_signal .
We can dedicate a thread to signal handling and nothing else : it can wait for the reception of signals , undertake the necessary actions , and update certain information examined by other threads .
A radical new approach to the design of communications networks , called “ network coding , ” promises to make Internet file sharing faster , streaming video more reliable , and cell - phone reception better — among other improvements .
MIT is in the thick of these new developments .
Last year , MIT researchers shared in two awards from IEEE , formerly the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , for papers that made vital contributions to the field of network coding .
“ Most networks right now are built roughly along the same principles as a transportation network , or any other network that ’s trying to deliver tangible goods , ” says Muriel Médard , a professor in the Research Laboratory of Electronics who was a co-author on both papers .
A packet of data traveling across the Internet , for instance , passes through a series of devices called routers before it reaches its destination .
A router does n’t tamper with the packet ’s contents ; it just sends it on to the next router .
With network coding , however , a router does n’t just hand off the packets it receives ; it mathematically combines them into new , hybrid packets .
If the combination is done cleverly enough , this makes the whole network more efficient .
To see how this might work , suppose that we ’re at a coffee shop with our laptops .
I ’m trying to send you a message over the coffee shop ’s WiFi connection at the same time you ’re trying to send me a message .
Ordinarily , my message will travel to the coffee shop ’s wireless router , and then the router will send it to you .
Your message will travel to the router , and then the router will send it to me .
That ’s four total transmissions .
But if , instead of forwarding our messages , the router combines them and broadcasts the combination , there are only three total transmissions .
Since you have a copy of the message you sent me , you can subtract it from the combination , and I can do the same with the message I sent you .
If our laptops and the router do a little extra processing , they reduce the system ’s bandwidth consumption by 25 percent .
Of course , this example assumes that the receivers already have the data they need to decode the combination , which is rarely the case in the real world .
And data traveling over a network usually pass through a number of routers : if each of those routers is recombining packets that are already combinations themselves , the decoding process becomes much more complicated .
But in principle , there ’s a way to get it all to work .
Network coding was born around 1999 or 2000 , in a couple of papers that suggested that combining data at routers could improve network efficiency .
But how that combination should be done , and what kinds of efficiency gains were possible , were unclear .
Then , in 2003 , Médard , her grad student Tracey Ho ( who ’s now at Caltech ) , MIT professor of electrical engineering David Karger , and colleagues at the University of Illinois and Caltech proved a counterintuitive result : in many cases , the best way to combine data at a router is to do it randomly .
Today , cell phones and computers send messages digitally : every message is a sequence of 0s and 1s .
But any sequence of 0s and 1s can be thought of as a single number .
With random network coding , a router receives , say , three messages , multiplies each of them by a different , randomly selected number , and adds the results together .
That final sum is the new , hybrid message .
The router sends the hybrid on to the next router in the network — but it also includes information about the three random numbers it used to produce the hybrid .
Random coding yields the biggest gains in networks where connections are spotty , but where there are several possible routes between sender and receiver .
Suppose , for instance , that you ’re in a densely populated city with good cell - phone coverage .
You ’re within range of several different cell towers , but you ’re inside a building that ’s interfering with your transmissions .
Your cell phone is sending out lots of packets of data , but there ’s not one nearby cell tower that ’s receiving all of them .
If each tower simply “ hybridizes ” the packets it receives and sends them on , then as long as the recipient gets enough hybrids from enough different towers , it can reconstruct the original message .
Ho , Médard , and their colleagues proved mathematically that if the same group of messages was sent to several different receivers , random coding made the most efficient possible use of the network ’s bandwidth .
“ The idea is seemingly loopy , ” Médard says .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that it was greeted with some amount of bemusement in some parts of the community . ”
As a graduate student , Ho was charged with presenting the findings at a conference in Japan , and her audience was skeptical .
“ People said , ‘ You must be comparing it to bad routing , ’ ” Médard says .
Under cross-examination from a room full of seasoned researchers , Médard says , “ Anyone else would have just curled into a fetal position . ”
But Ho , she says , was “ cool as a cucumber .
She was also the collegiate pistol champion .
So the girl can keep her cool .
” The IEEE award last year was an indication that the bemusement had turned to recognition .
“ It ’s a theoretical result , but it has deep practical implications , ” says Chris Ramming , director of the Corporate External Research Office for chip manufacturer Intel .
Before coming to Intel , Ramming worked for the U.S. Defense Department ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
“ When I was a program manager at DARPA , we had a big project that used that approach as the core of the implementation techniques , ” Ramming says .
“ It was definitely seminal , and people are trying to build on it .
There is still a lot of untapped potential to explore .
” The other paper honored by the IEEE last year , and MIT researchers ’ continuing work on network coding , will be the subject of part two of this series .
After spending the majority of her 48 years trying , and failing , to slim down , Veronica Mahaffey was still 50 pounds overweight -- not morbidly obese by a long shot , but still far from the size she wanted .
Worried about her health , she called a San Diego weight - loss surgery clinic last spring and asked for help .
She was told no .
At 185 pounds and with a body mass index of 28 , the Ramona mother of four was not heavy enough to meet medical guidelines or insurance company qualifications for weight - loss surgery .
Those standards require a BMI of 40 or higher , or 35 or higher for people with a related medical problem such as diabetes or sleep apnea .
“ People would say , ‘ You look fine . ’
But I could n’t get into normal - size clothing .
That ’s not fine , ” Mahaffey said .
“ And then I was told I was going to have to gain weight to qualify for surgery .
That does n’t make sense . ”
Ultimately , she got the surgery through a clinical trial of one of several new weight - loss procedures .
Now 10 pounds from her goal weight of 135 , she says she looks better , feels better and is confident she ’ll no longer have to fight her weight .
Her experience may soon be shared by thousands of Americans .
Usually reserved for the most obese people , weight - loss surgery is unlikely to be a last - ditch option much longer .
Technological advancements are turning it into a one - hour , incisionless procedure -- making it more attractive to moderately overweight adults like Mahaffey ; overweight and obese teenagers ; and normal - weight people with difficult - to - control diabetes .
Several new procedures are already in human clinical trials .
“ I see surgery playing a bigger role , ” said Judith Stern , a professor of nutrition and internal medical at UC Davis , " . . . because the weight - loss drugs we have now are lousy . ”
The need for new treatments is impossible to ignore .
A New England Journal of Medicine study published last month concluded that obesity rates would soon negate life - span gains achieved through declining smoking rates .
And a report released in November from the American Public Health Assn . and other groups projected that healthcare costs related to obesity would quadruple in 10 years , accounting for 21 % of healthcare spending .
Bariatric surgery , many doctors say , should be a bigger part of the solution .
“ We ’re seeing increased disability due to obesity among a younger population , ” said Dr. John Baker , president of the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery .
“ We ca n’t afford to wait .
As a tool to bring down costs and the burden of disease , bariatric surgeons have the most effective tool in medicine today . ”
Other health professionals are aghast at the idea of even more Americans yearly undergoing the surgery .
Bariatric surgery rates have already doubled in the last six years , resulting in 220,000 procedures in 2008 , according to the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery .
And even the simplest procedures are not without risks .
“ The fact that bariatric surgery is the only efficient method of long - term weight loss is true , ” said Dr. Blandine Laférrere , a diabetes expert at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York .
“ But does that mean everyone who is overweight should have it ?
I do n’t think so , because none of these procedures is benign . ”
Supportive studies
Many studies already attest to the effectiveness and increasing safety of the most popular weight - loss surgeries among morbidly obese people .
Depending on the type of surgery used , patients lose 50 % or more of their excess body weight and maintain that loss for as long as 10 years after surgery .
In comparison , the most recent studies on long - term use of weight - loss medications show a typical weight loss of 5 to 22 pounds over one year with some side effects .
Other research has found that bariatric surgery cures
Type 2 diabetes in a majority of patients studied , as well as improving symptoms related to sleep apnea and heart disease , such as high cholesterol and blood pressure .
“ When we first started doing bariatric surgery , most of the family practitioners were very much against it , ” said Dr. Gregg K. Nishi , a bariatric surgeon at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center .
“ Now they send their patients to us in droves because we cure their medical problems .
As we develop new noninvasive procedures that are safe , I think the popularity will grow . ”
The improvements in traditional bariatric surgery , combined with patient interest , have led to a surge in investigational new procedures , as well as discussions on whether more people could benefit from surgery .
“ Investigators are working on ways to make these operations more effective , safer , less invasive and lower - cost , ” said Dr. Philip Schauer , director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic .
Furthest along in clinical trials is a noninvasive technique called TOGA , or transoral gastroplasty .
In the procedure , a surgeon inserts a flexible tube through the mouth into the stomach and then uses staples to create a pouch that limits the amount of food that can be consumed .
Cedars - Sinai is one of nine medical centers testing the technique , created by a Palo Alto company called Satiety Inc .
A previous small study showed that patients lost an average of almost 25 pounds after three months with no major complications reported .
Long - term data are n’t yet available .
“ Patients feel great afterward , ” Nishi said .
“ They do n’t have any of the pain you have with laparoscopic [ minimally invasive ] surgery . ”
He expects that , when perfected , the procedure will take one hour , and the patient can go home shortly afterward .
The most common weight - loss surgeries -- laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastric banding , which restrict stomach size so that patients feel full more quickly -- usually require one to three days in the hospital .
Mahaffey underwent a similar procedure called POSE ( for Primary Obesity Surgery , Endolumenal ) , which is designed for people who need to lose only a moderate amount of weight .
“ People 50 pounds overweight are the ones we should treat , before the problem gets worse , ” said the surgeon who performed the procedure , Santiago Horgan of UC San Diego .
In a noninvasive technique still in the early stages of development , a device is placed in the upper part of the small intestine to create a barrier between food and the wall of the intestines , thus mimicking the effect of gastric bypass surgery .
Called the EndoBarrier , it could help patients lose weight before a more invasive weight - loss procedure or to help resolve Type 2 diabetes , of which obesity is a primary cause .
The device is expected to cost about half as much as gastric banding and one - quarter as much as gastric bypass .
Growing acceptance
Lowering the cost of surgery will be key to offering an effective weight - loss option to thousands , or millions , more people , Schauer said .
The costs of traditional weight - loss surgery vary widely across the nation , with an average cost in California of $ 52,224 , according to a HealthGrades report released in July .
“ Many experts believe if we get a procedure close to the $ 10,000 range , then we could dramatically expand both access and insurance coverage , ” he said .
Whether insurance companies will welcome the idea of more people receiving bariatric surgery remains to be seen .
Weight - loss surgery is now covered by insurance only for those patients who have premium benefits and a BMI of 40 or higher , or a BMI of 35 or higher with obesity - related medical problems .
Standard health plans typically do n’t include bariatric surgery .
Surgery may be cost - effective if it cures diabetes and prevents heart disease , joint problems and other illnesses linked to obesity , Baker said .
A 2008 study in the Journal of Managed Care found that insurers fully recover their costs for bariatric surgery two to four years after the procedure due to reduced health problems in the patient .
The patient pool for bariatric surgery is already beginning to widen .
Insurance companies tend to follow the lead of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , and in February , the federal agency announced that it would approve payment of surgery for people with Type 2 diabetes and a BMI of at least 35 .
In November , a consortium of influential medical groups , including the Obesity Society , composed of researchers who study all aspects of obesity , published a consensus statement recognizing the “ legitimacy ” of bariatric surgery as a dedicated treatment for some patients with Type 2 diabetes and noted that surgery may be suited for people with Type 2 diabetes who are not yet morbidly obese -- those with a BMI of 30 to 35 .
“ There is mounting evidence that for someone with a BMI of 30 with diabetes that is not well - controlled , surgery is a good option , ” Schauer said .
A BMI of 30 , for example , would reflect someone who is 5 foot 8 and 197 pounds .
“ Surgery is grossly under-used , ” added Dr. John Kral , an obesity expert at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn .
“ If these procedures prove safe enough , people are going to start having them before their eating behavior gets out of hand . ”
Risks remain
Nutritionists are not enthusiastic .
They reject the notion that surgery should take the place of dieting and exercise .
“ People with a BMI of 33 , for example , do n’t weigh a lot , ” said Stern , an advisory board member for Weight Watchers International .
“ Is that worth the risks of surgery , the side effects , the potential for problems ?
I ’m absolutely opposed to bariatric surgery under a certain BMI , such as 37 with co-morbidities . ”
Paul Ernsberger , an associate professor of nutrition at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine , has studied the long - term complications of weight - loss surgery .
While the surgical procedure itself has become quite safe , he said , too many patients suffer problems later , such as nutritional deficiencies , diarrhea , regurgitation and bowel obstructions .
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , 19 % of patients experience dumping syndrome , which is involuntary vomiting or defecation .
Complication rates involving ulcers , wound problems , hemorrhage , deep - vein thrombosis , heart attacks and strokes range from 2.4 % to 0.1 % .
“ Changes in laparoscopic technique may make a shorter hospital stay , but the long - term complications are still there , ” Ernsberger said .
Weight - loss surgery is too risky to do purely for cosmetic results , the motivating factor for some patients , Ernsberger said .
“ Are we interested in people ’s health , or are we interested in their weight ? ” he said .
“ Surgery can help with obesity - related health problems , but so can pills . ”
Baker said the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery does not advocate surgery for cosmetic purposes alone , adding that it should always be accompanied by changes in nutrition and physical activity .
For people with a BMI of 25 to 30 , which is considered overweight but not obese , diet and exercise changes should still be the treatment of choice , Baker said .
“ Even people who have surgery still have to focus on those things .
You have to change your lifestyle and habits for any weight - loss program . ”

Whilst trade unions in Britain are on the receiving end of landmark anti-union legislation , the same is true for low paid workers self organising in Germany .
On Saturday members of the Free Workers ’ Union ( German section of the IWA ) staged a demonstration at the Berlin International Film Festival at New Babylon Cinema , to highlight the fact that workers should decide how they organise , not the state .
This is in response to the fact that the FAU is now effectively banned as a union .
The FAU , who in 2007 were involved in the occupation and self management of the Biria bicycle factory , sees itself in the tradition of Free Workers ’ Union of Germany whose platform was written by Rudolf Rocker and opposed the social chauvinism of the Social Democrats during The First World War .
They are currently under observation by Germany ’s domestic intelligence agency .
Background
The New Babylon Cinema located on Rosa Luxemburg Square has a reputation as being ‘ leftist and queer friendly ’ , this is in contrast to the low wages and paternalistic attitude encountered by the workers who run the cinema .
Fed up with the conditions they were subjected to , workers decided to organise themselves and joined the FAU , unfortunately this lead to one worker , Jason Kirkpatrick , being fired without notice .
After presenting the cinema with a labour contract in June which was agreed to by workers at an employee meeting , the cinema ’s management refused to negotiate claiming that the FAU was not qualified to negotiate contracts .
By July , the FAU had organised an effective boycott of the cinema and managed to generate national media attention for their cause .
Die Linke and the Trade Union bureaucracy
The New Babylon cinema is partly state owned and receives a subsidy of 300,000 Euros from the Left Party / SPD coalition who run the senate , despite the Left Party calling for a minimum wage of 10 Euros , the lowest paid workers at the New Babylon receive half of that and the projectionists , 8 Euros .
Cinema workers were left wondering why the Left Party did not use their influence to improve their situation .
Despite only one worker at the cinema belonging to The German Confederation of Trade Unions ( DGB ) , in September , supported by the Left Party it announced it would fight for a labour contract at the cinema , without consulting the FAU and with the exclusion of Babylon workers from negotiations .
The labour contract signed by DGB demanded less than the one presented by the FAU , although some workers wages have risen by 30 % , this is still below the DGB ’s standard contract for cinemas .
During the boycott the Left Party organised a film night at The Babylon and condemned the FAU as opportunist , the cinema used this as a pretext to take the FAU to court .
The initial trial on October 7th issued a court order against the boycott .
This was followed by a second court ruling on December 11th by Berlin Regional Court which banned the FAU from acting or calling itself a union .
The FAU was not informed of the legal action taking place against them and there was no public hearing .
The FAU ’s appeal hearing had to be moved to a larger room due to the crowd which had turned out in support .
Under German Law , unions must have a certain degree of ‘ social might ’ before they can sign labour contracts .
In court the DGB claimed that as the FAU has no exiting union contracts , it has no ‘ social might ’ .
This ruling now effectively prevents workers from self organising and forming decentralised unions , independent from the DGB who have a legal monopoly on trade union activity .

Why yes , I did see an all - female production of Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar last night .
And yes , it was awesome .
Advertisement
The Bushwick Shakespeare Repertory , which will be performing Julius Caesar at 8 pm every night this weekend , bills itself as " a female - driven collaborative [...] committed to casting women in roles not traditionally available to them in Classical Theatre . "
Caesar is pretty much full of these roles , since nearly all the characters in the play are male .
All - female Shakespeare productions are nothing new — one 1986 all - female production of Caesar replaced the fight scenes with " elaborate sequences of competitive flamenco dancing , " which seems like a really inefficient way to depose a leader .
Still , it 's always interesting to see a play so apparently rooted in time and place reinterpreted — in this case , as a power struggle at a 1960s girls ' school .
Director Jordan Simmons left the fight scenes in , thankfully , though some of the ladies did get stabby with nail files and scissors rather than swords .
Flipping the gender of the characters made for some funny jokes , which the cast milked to varying degrees — a little extra emphasis on the first syllable of " countrymen , " a sly inflection in the words , " peace , ho ! " Simmons also chose to infuse the play with adolescent snark .
The final scene , in which Antony praises the dead Brutus as " the noblest Roman of them all " and Octavius promises , " within my tent his bones to - night shall lie , " is usually performed with great solemnity , but Emily Clare Zempel 's Antony and Alexis Robbins 's Octavius made these lines drip with snideness — rather than " noble Romans , " these were kids rejoicing at another 's downfall .
And that may have been part of the point of the show — that the political machinations of famous men are sometimes as petty as the spats of schoolgirls , and , on the flipside , that the spats of schoolgirls are just as worthy of dramatic interpretation as the betrayal of a ruler .

The Skype service on a TV will work much as it does on a PC , but with some limitations .
A TV program will stop playing once a Skype call is made or answered ; TV processors are not yet powerful enough to allow people to chat while they watch a show , the companies say .
Panasonic , based in Japan , and LG , based in South Korea , will sell specially designed Web cameras for their Skype - enabled sets , which should cost $ 100 to $ 200 .
These cameras , unlike typical webcams , are customized for the technically challenging environment of the living room , where there can be a wide range of distances between the TV and viewers .
The deals give the newly independent Skype , formerly a division of eBay , another valuable foothold in the home .
About 520 million people around the world use the service to place free phone calls and have video chats with one another from their computers and other devices that run Skype software .
The company makes money by charging competitive rates for people to call regular phone numbers and for add - on services like voice mail .
Video chatting has become an increasingly important feature of Skype .
The company says video chats account for 34 percent of calls on the service , and as many as half on days like Christmas and New Year ’s , when families seek to connect face to face .
To further nurture this activity , Skype is also announcing on Tuesday that its software for Windows PCs and televisions will support high - definition video calling in the 720 p HD format , if users have webcams that support the technology .
Skype makes no money from video chats , at least for now .
But Mr. Rosenberg of the company says that it may soon start charging for add - on services , like the ability to set up a video conference call for three or more parties .
“ What we finally created with the Skype network is a community of users that are available via video .
Having Skype on the TV is a big part of building that , ” he said .
The fall of Eliot Spitzer was , for some , a matter of glee .
He rode a much higher horse than other politicians .
Told on Friday that Mr. Paterson was dropping out of the race , Mr. Spitzer said , “ Oh , of course . ”
With all that has gone on in the last two years , did he have any regrets about quitting so quickly ?
Mr. Spitzer clearly has given the subject a great deal of thought , but he did not want to discuss it on Friday .
He made enemies — the right ones , in his estimation , on Wall Street — and held a job that he had fought hard to get , but he also had a wife and children who had suffered humiliation .
Had he remained in office , any strengths that Mr. Spitzer might have brought to Albany were sorely needed .
Every state has been reeling from the recession .
The New York State Legislature has done little to address economic circumstances that are likely to have changed forever .
“ What happened in the last decade was a massive redistribution of wealth to people who did not create value , but simply moved assets around , ” he said .
“ You look at where we were in 1945 — we were the only place in the world with skilled labor , with education , the rule of law , a middle class with the capacity to consume .
Now we ’re not the center of the universe .
All that has moved east , to China , and Asia .
Albany is a footnote issue . ”
In place of real engagement , Albany has a cult of faux piety that is deranged .
In 2007 , Mr. Spitzer ’s office gave out records that showed the use of helicopters and state troopers by Joseph L. Bruno , then the leader of the Republican majority in the State Senate .
It was evident that Mr. Bruno was using expensive state resources for political purposes .
Yet a series of investigations focused not on what Mr. Bruno was doing , but on the role of Mr. Spitzer and his staff in making the information public .
Telling the truth became a scandal .
“ There were 10 different investigations , ” Mr. Spitzer said .
“ There ’s an expression in corporate litigation , the Pac - Man operation — each investigation would go after the investigation before it . ”
Update : Bungie has confirmed that Halo 2′s online components will be put to sleep with the rest of the gang .
Ahh shucks , maybe we ’ll see it reworked down the road sometime .
Original Story : Microsoft has announced that Xbox Live services for the original Xbox will shut down as of April 15 , with the company also confirming that all downloadable Xbox Original titles on the 360 will be losing their online functionality .
Apparently auto - renewals are to be turned off for anyone using Live on an original Xbox , but the real big question concerns whether or not Microsoft will rework the still community - rich servers of Halo 2 or if it is to suffer the same fate as the rest of the titles .
Major Nelson on the decision :
“ While I ca n’t comment on the specifics , this change will allow us to continue evolving the LIVE service with new features and experiences that fully harness the power of Xbox 360 and the Xbox LIVE community . ”
The thought coming from MS seems to be that this was an inevitability and the decision to do so will allow for better flexibility for new features down the road .
MOHAWK NATION OF AKWESASNE —
The NYPD has gone on the reservation — sending its drug czar upstate to try to help cut off a massive pipeline of pot and ecstasy to the city run by Mohawk Indian smugglers on the Canadian border .
“ I was astounded at how lenient the border is , ” said Chief Joseph Resnick , head of the NYPD ’s narcotics division .
He spoke after a trip six weeks ago to the Akwesasne reservation , which straddles the US - Canadian border and which he said supplies most of the high - potency marijuana and ecstasy sold on city streets .
“ Once you cross into the US , you ’re on the Indian reservation , which is sovereign land .
The whole border is the real point of origin .
When we bust large numbers of ecstasy and hydroponic pot , most of it comes through there . ”
The feds say that in the last 10 years , more than $ 1 billion worth of marijuana has come through the reservation , which stretches five miles along the banks of the St. Lawrence River .
Smugglers traverse the fast - moving water in Jet Skis and high - powered speedboats .
When the river freezes , they switch to snowmobiles .
The contraband is then packed into vans or trucks and driven down the New York State Thruway , authorities said .
The crossing , featured in last year ’s Oscar - nominated movie “ Frozen River , ” is also a major route for illegal immigrants as well as huge quantities of untaxed liquor and cigarettes , investigators said .
The banks of the St. Lawrence are dotted with small docks and access roads .
The 40 - square - mile reservation includes territorial waters and about 100 islands .
Interdiction efforts are often stymied by this geography — and influenced by politics .
While federal and state cops and Royal Canadian Mounted Police are allowed onto the reservation , they tread carefully .
Some tribe members are openly hostile to them ; a road sign labeled officers “ terrorists . ”
The Mohawks have their own force on the “ res , ” as they call the Akwesasne reservation , and prefer to do their own policing .
Many of the traffickers are enterprising Mohawk tribe members in their 20s , attracted by fast money and better pay than they can make doing almost anything else .
One self - professed smuggler interviewed by The Post described how easy it was to elude US Border Patrol officers , who oversee the waterways on the US side of the river , and the Mounties ’ marine patrol on the Canadian side .
“ We go at night and run all night .
I get on my Jet Ski , put on a helmet and night - vision goggles and just go .
The boats we have are way faster than theirs .
They ca n’t catch us . ”
He said he earned about $ 300,000 in a two - week period last year after delivering a haul of cigarettes , liquor and pot — and returned with large equipment bags stuffed with stacks of $ 100 bills , which took all night to count , he said .
“ There are about 100 millionaires on the res , ” he said .
“ A lot of them use the money to build these big houses or fix up their houses , then they put in safes to keep the cash . ”
He said he knew of one man who had made $ 9 million smuggling drugs and contraband .
Just about everyone on the reservation — home to 21,000 Mohawks divided into the St. Regis and Akwesasne tribes — knows someone in the smuggling trade .
A trip to Cornwall Island on the Canadian side revealed a disparity in wealth among residents .
Some homes were dilapidated structures with rusted vehicles sitting on overgrown lawns .
Others would n’t look out of place in the Hamptons .
Many had brand - new Jet Skis or speedboats on driveways .
At the east end of the island , an unmarked speedboat , in which two of the boaters had their faces covered , zoomed past .
One looked around nervously , and the other stared at a Post photographer as he took his picture .
“ You see these boats race across the river all the time ; they run everything , ” said James Burns , a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ Those fellows were probably nervous because they saw you with a camera . ”
The island was the home of Mickey “ Big Boss Man ” Woods , a 38 - year - old busted last year and charged with transporting more than 10,000 kilos of Canadian pot through the reservation between 2005 and 2008 .
A federal indictment alleges that Woods and his crew of 33 , including 16 tribe members from the island and two more from the nearby town of Hogansburg , NY , made tens of millions .
The indictment seeks to seize $ 45 million in alleged proceeds from illegal drugs .
The pot is grown in Canada , Resnick said , and it ’s the highest quality and most expensive available in New York City .
“ It ’s hydroponic , which means it ’s grown indoors , and has concentrated levels of THC , ” the chemical in pot that creates a high .
“ The price is about $ 3,000 a pound — as opposed to $ 500 to $ 1,000 for homegrown .
On the street , you ’ll pay up to $ 600 an ounce . ”
Coordinated crackdowns have led to several recent arrests , including a state Attorney General ’s Office indictment on Oct. 28 of 18 alleged traffickers .
They were headed by Scott Jerome , 33 , who stands accused of running hundreds of pounds of pot through the reservation with the help of Mohawk tribe members .
One of the biggest arrests came in June , when the DEA broke up what it said was a major ring that pumped hundreds of pounds of pot into New York and other cities on the Eastern seaboard .
There have been several seizures of ecstasy — including one in April and another in September that netted 81,000 pills , which have a street value of $ 1.6 million , DEA Agent Burns said .
The NYPD got involved after the DEA formed a task force in March “ for the specific purpose of targeting criminal organizations that use the reservation for their activities , ” he said .
The group , which includes federal border patrol and immigration and customs officers , along with state troopers and local sheriffs and prosecutors , met in late September .
They were joined by Resnick and a contingent of other city cops .
“ They had a good representation and were very interested in what we had to say about smuggling operations .
It ’s my understanding that they intend to have some folks up here .
It ’s been bantered about .
They ’ve also been talking about that with the State Police . ”
Not so , said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne .
“ Yes , NYPD narcotics have been briefed regarding activities on the reservation .
We cooperate with other agencies by sharing information , but there is now none and never has been any plans to assign any NYPD personnel there . ”
If the NYPD does take on a larger role , it could experience resistance from the Mohawks , who have clashed with federal officers .
“ They act like they are a sovereign nation , but we can go onto the land any time we want , ” said one US Customs and Border Protection guard .
Said another : “ When the river freezes , there ’s so many snowmobiles out there we do n’t even bother .
If border patrol tried to police the traffic , there would be a war . ”
Tribe leaders have said that drug smugglers represent only a small percentage of their population — and they resent being characterized as a lawless group .
None , including a grand chief , would speak on the record .
Leaders are proud of their members .
Although the Akwesasne reservation suffers from some of the same problems as others — high unemployment , obesity , alcoholism — it also has successful industries , including tobacco factories , construction and maple syrup .
There is a large presence of Mohawk ironworkers in New York City , many of whom live in The Bronx and Bay Ridge , Brooklyn .
Burns pointed out that although tribe members have been arrested for smuggling , the Mohawks are by no means the only ones involved in illicit trafficking .
“ The whole north border is sparsely populated , and there are a lot of places that are unregulated where you can cross , ” he said .
“ There ’s a lot going on at the reservation , but that ’s not the only place . ”

Transcript : Mohamed ElBaradei
In January , Foreign Policy published excerpts from its interview with former International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) head Mohamed ElBaradei .
Following his return to Egypt on Feb. 19 , here is an extended version of ElBaradei ’s comments on his time at the helm of the IAEA , his opinion of the George W. Bush administration , and his ambitions to run in Egypt ’s upcoming presidential election .
Foreign Policy :
What were some of the primary skills that you needed to be effective in your job , during your 12 years as director general of the IAEA ?
Mohamed ElBaradei : Well , I think the No. 1 skill is impartiality — and that is key .
Particularly in the area of verification , you are sitting in judgment of countries ’ behavior , and that is very difficult for countries to stomach .
You are , in one way , hired by them — and on the other , sitting in judgment of their behavior .
That means you have to be impeccably impartial and stick to the facts .
But , that being said , you will always have disagreements because , obviously , you are trying to be an objective judge in a very subjective political environment — the security environment .
Foreign Policy : During your time as IAEA director general , does any one country or administration stick out to you as the greatest challenge to deal with ?
ElBaradei : Well quite a few .
Of course , it was not easy in some cases to deal with the Bush administration .
In the case of Iraq and the case of Iran , we had different viewpoints of the meaning of diplomacy and , in many cases , about the facts themselves .
This is equally true with North Korea .
The problem , in our area of work , is that you are dealing with very subjective policy views from different states .
So you try to separate the wheat from the chaff and make sure that you are only dealing with facts .
You must try to understand where people are coming from .
There is a lot of misconception when you hear that this is just a technical organization .
Every aspect of our work is in nuclear security , nuclear verification , or nuclear power , and so there is always a policy dimension to it .
And you have to understand the context within which you are working and the implication of what you are doing or saying .
There is always an effort by people to use and abuse what you say .
So you have to walk on very thin ice in terms of exactly measuring every word you author and every action you take — that does n’t mean politicizing the work of the agency , but that means understanding the context in which you are operating .
That will continue to be the same .
When I get a piece of intelligence , for example , I have to be very aware that there is misinformation and that there are people who like to hype the issues for their own political ends .
These are all policy issues , and you must make value judgments .
You try to find a way to get the antagonistic parties together and try to find a solution .
Of course , you cannot impose a solution but , from where you are sitting , you can see options and possibilities where things can move forward .
At the end of the day , we are not doing verification for the sake of verification .
We are doing inspection to make sure that countries are not developing nuclear weapons .
If , in addition to our verification , you see a way for direct engagement between the parties and a way to build trust , of course you try to suggest the way forward .
I ’ve been doing that in the case of Iran and in tough cases like North Korea .
Just before I left office , there was this deal about fuel [ where the Iranians would transfer their stocks of enriched uranium out of the country , in exchange for fuel plates for their nuclear reactor ] , which I still believe is a fantastic opportunity for both the United States and Iran to get engaged .
I have been , while doing verification on Iran , actively pursuing that package on behalf of the United States and behalf of Iran — I was mediating between the two .
That is part of the job :
You have to understand that it is partly mediation , partly inspection , partly diplomacy .
You wear so many hats and switch between them quickly in order to keep your eye on the ball .
That way , you keep the world safer and more secure and ensure that we do not end up killing each other for the wrong reasons .
FP : It seems like people are beginning to doubt that the Iranians are negotiating in good faith .
Do you think that ’s fair ?
Do you think this deal still has potential ?
ElBaradei : I think that , unfortunately , as we were moving ahead with this fuel package deal , which we were about to conclude , Iran fell into an internal fight as a result of the [ contested June 2009 ] election .
This issue became [ part of ] a payback situation in Iran , as I see it .
I still have hope that this domestic hype will come to an end and then Iran will see the fantastic opportunity you have in that deal .
It is not the deal per se , but the horizon that it opens .
I know from President Barack Obama , personally , that if that deal were to take place , it would defuse that crisis by giving him the space to negotiate a comprehensive package with Iran where nothing is off the table .
This would be the opening of what everybody has been hoping for , for many , many years .
I hope that the Iranians , as they settle down their domestic situation , will understand the value of such an opening .
To have somebody like Barack Obama , who for the first time offers to negotiate with them without preconditions — which is something we have long been waiting for — and [ for Iran ] to have an opportunity to sit directly with the United States and talk about all the mutual grievances , is also an opportunity that will not last very long .
If the Iranians are not negotiating fair and straight then there is no option other than to go toward sanctions , which would not resolve any issues and would make things worse .
But people will have to take the other road , if the road of dialogue and negotiation is not open .
However , as I said , I think there is still some hope .
Turkey is still doing their best ; you remember I offered that Turkey would be a place we could store Iranian fuel until Iran receives its fuel [ plates , for its nuclear reactor ] .
Brazil is also still active in trying to find a way out .
I have n’t lost hope but , frankly , I have been disappointed that this deal has not been picked up by the Iranians so far .
FP : With regards to Iran , do you think the IAEA would have behaved differently if the Bush Administration was n’t in office at the time ?
Was part of your concern that the Bush Administration would move too quickly to war ?
ElBaradei : No , not at all .
I would have behaved exactly the same .
I ’m a lawyer .
I go for due process , I go for fairness and equity — these values mean a lot to me .
I think we reported every piece of information we had on Iran to our member states and to our clients in the Board of Governors .
In fact , the reason that Iran was not immediately referred to the Security Council was a value judgment by the member states .
It was a deliberate decision by the Europeans and the time , the EU - 3 [ the United Kingdom , France , and Germany ] , not to take Iran to the Security Council , because during those couple of years , they were negotiating with Iran about a comprehensive package .
There was a package [ deal ] offered first , I think in 2003 and 2004 , by the EU - 3 .
Not referring Iran to the Security Council was part of that package .
It was held out by the Europeans as a carrot to induce Iran to come to the table and to negotiate a comprehensive package .
We were aware of that .
That ’s why I was saying earlier — that you have to be aware of the environment within which you operate .
But all the facts we had from the day we started inspection in Iran until today are shared with all of our member states .
The Bush administration was saying in 2005 that Iran had an ongoing nuclear program , and we were accused of losing credibility by [ U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations ]
John Bolton and company when we said we did not see concrete proof of an ongoing program .
But we were exonerated , if you like , and our conclusion was validated by the NIE [ National Intelligence Estimate ] report in 2007 , which said that Iran had [ done ] some weaponization studies but was not developing weapons , and that they stopped it in 2003 .
So when we said in 2005 that we do n’t have concrete proof of an ongoing program , we were correct .
However , nobody came back to us to apologize after all of the vilification we had in 2005 .
It was the same in the case of Iraq , when Dick Cheney said before the war that I was wrong .
After the war all he said was that he misspoke .
Well , the result of the " misspeaking " was horrendous , as I see it today .
FP : On a personal level , did you believe then , and do you believe now , that Bush was a threat to the Arab world ?
ElBaradei : I ’m not sure I would say he was a threat to the Arab world .
I would say that his policies of relying heavily on the threat or use of force , and of adopting a diplomacy that is black and white — that was completely counter - productive .
If there is one thing I have learned , there is little that is black and white ; there is a grey zone which you have to deal with .
If you really want to resolve issues , you have to engage the parties .
You cannot call them biblical names —
Axis of Evil , Satan , and what have you — and then expect them to have trust in you .
This was not just vis -à - vis the Arab or Muslim world — it was a policy that has not yielded positive results in terms of integrating the United States with the rest of humanity .
You have seen Latin American countries bolting ; many regimes were moving away from the Bush Administration at the time .
You have seen the same phenomenon in the Muslim world .
You still have a couple of wars you do n’t know how to get out of , and you have also gotten an increase in terrorists .
The so - called moderate regimes have lost a lot of credibility , because they were not able to deliver .
So it was not a policy of inclusion , rather it was a policy of exclusion .
That has been manifested more in the Middle East because the Middle East is still a hotbed of tension , and will continue to be until people understand that you have to find a solution to the Palestinian issue , and you have to fix the problem of repression in many Arab regimes .
You have to make people feel that they are being treated as human beings by their own governments and by the outside world , and that perception is not there .
People feel that they are being unfairly treated by their own government and unjustly treated by the outside world .
That ’s the most fertile ground for increasing radicalism .
That is really my worry in the long term , in that part of the world .
Foreign Policy : Officials in your own safeguards committee have said that Iran is trying to construct a nuclear weapon .
What prevented you from including some of that information in your dossier to the IAEA ’s board ?
Was that a difficult decision ?
ElBaradei : Again , this is from the people who wanted to hype the Iranian issue for their own policy objectives .
All the information about alleged weaponization studies was information received by member states .
We do n’t have the expertise or the human intelligence to be able to get this information .
All of it is provided to us by a handful of countries .
We obviously compile this information and analyze it , and we engage Iran to try and clarify these issues .
Unfortunately , Iran has not been substantively engaging us on these issues , and I have stated a number of times that we are quite concerned about these allegations .
Iran continued to say that these are all fake documents and reminded me of our experience in Iraq .
But also , we were not able to provide Iran with original documents or even copies .
So the question , as I mentioned to our member states in one of our closed sessions with the board , is that the entire issue hinges on whether these documents are authentic .
If these are authentic , then you do n’t need to be a nuclear physicist to know that Iran has been engaged in weaponization studies .
But I am not in the business of forensic science .
We are very good in dealing with nuclear material — I can do environmental sampling analysis , and I can take measurements .
I can give you litmus tests on nuclear material — but when it comes to [ verifying the authenticity of ] paperwork , we are really out of our depth .
However , we have a lot of this kind of information , and I keep reporting to the member states that we are quite concerned .
We have a lot of these allegations but we are not able to come to a conclusion on them .
My last report to the board , shortly before I left , mentioned that we are on a dead - end street unless Iran engages with us on clarifying these issues and proving to us that [ these documents ] are fake or manufactured .
Or unless we get the original documents , and we are convinced that these are accurate .
I told them we had reached a dead - end .
We have published in our reports a summary of all of this , but it is not a question of analysis — that ’s what I want to make clear .
As I ’ve said , I ’m not even a nuclear physicist .
But I told the board that , if these are accurate documents , then Iran has been engaged in weaponization studies .
But the million dollar question is the question of authenticity , and that continues to be the issue today .
People must understand that we cannot jump the gun .
A decision by us to say that Iran has been engaged in weaponization studies without being absolutely certain could have major ramifications .
People want us to say that , unfortunately , because we are the ones who have credibility .
But I will not abuse my credibility unless I ’m sure of my facts .
FP : Transitioning now to Egyptian politics , there has been a great deal of talk that you will be a candidate in the next presidential election .
Why do you want to be president of Egypt ?
ElBaradei : I do n’t want to be president of Egypt !
I have a lot of plans other than being president of Egypt .
You can understand that after having this thankless job for 12 years , that I wanted to have some time to do other things that I like to do , including spending time with my family — we have a house in the south of France , and I also have a granddaughter .
However , this issue is coming to me by default ; a lot of people are saying that they want me to be engaged in domestic politics — they want me to run for president of Egypt .
What I ’ve said is that I would not even consider running for president unless there is the proper framework for a free and fair election — and that is still the major question mark in Egypt .
I do n’t believe the conditions are in place for free and fair elections .
In fact , I just sent an article to an Egyptian newspaper today setting out what needs to be done before I could consider it .
These guarantees [ include ] an independent judicial review , international oversight , and equal opportunity for media coverage — there is a lot that needs to be in place — and of course , the ability to run as an independent .
The Constitution is written in a way that I cannot run unless I join an existing party , which , to me , is not how a democratic system works .
I would like to be , at this time , an agent to push Egypt toward a more democratic and transparent regime , with all of its implications for the rest of the Arab world .
If I am able to do that , I will be very happy because we need to achieve democracy in the Arab world as fast as we can .
Democracy meaning empowering people , democracy meaning a proper economic and social development , tolerance — it means building up modern societies .
FP : You faced some pretty bitter attacks in the Egyptian state media for these statements .
Do you fear that foreshadows some of the repression you will face when you return to Egypt ?
ElBaradei : I think the immediate reaction was a vicious attack by the government newspapers .
Then I think they realized they made a terrible mistake because it backfired in their face .
All of a sudden I became a national hero , sitting here in Vienna .
People were just disgusted by how they reacted [ to my statements ] .
So that immediately stopped , and now you do n’t see any of that any longer and I just saw a representative of the ruling party saying that they are looking forward to my return to Egypt and that they will welcome me back .
I think they realize that a vicious personal attack is not the way to go about it because they need to address the issues I have raised and will continue to raise , whether I ’m in Egypt or outside Egypt .
FP : Assuming that there is a free and fair campaign , what would you bring to the office that [ President Mubarak ’s younger son ] Gamal Mubarak would not ?
ElBaradei : Well , I would let him speak for himself if he decides to run .
I would bring a regime where people feel that they are the ones who are making the calls .
A regime that is based on the rule of law , based on established institutions , based on freedom , equal justice , transparency accountability — I mean basically anything that you have in a functional democracy .
FP : Earlier this month , on the eve of Coptic Christmas , there was an attack on the Copts emerging from mass .
Has this government done enough to improve relations between Muslims and Copts , or is that something you would want to work on as well ?
ElBaradei : I do not know how much they have done .
However , I do know that we still have a problem , which is terrible , between Muslims and Christians .
[ Fixing this ] is part of moving forward — of tolerance and of rational thinking .
I think it is a manifestation of social and economic conditions : Poverty , in my view , brings out the worst in people .
Education and economic and social development is the way to move forward .
We have lived for thousands of years together , Muslims and Christians ; we are part of the same society .
Of course , tolerance and teaching people to practice tolerance would be one of my immediate priorities from wherever I am .
You do n’t need to be in office , and it is one of the issues that I talked about today and I will continue to talk about it .
FP : President Mubarak has been criticized harshly in Egypt and from outside , from some quarters , for his policy toward Gaza .
Do you have any opinions on his policy toward Hamas ?
ElBaradei : I do n’t really know the details about his relationship with Hamas .
All I know about Gaza is that you have to distinguish between national security and humanitarian assistance .
I would quote Chris Patten , the chancellor of Oxford University , who wrote that we are failing Gaza and that 1.5 million innocent civilians have been penalized because of the behavior of some of the Hamas members .
To me this is not much different from what happened to Iraq before and after the war .
You end up penalizing the innocent and the vulnerable — the citizens .
According to Patten , Gaza is only getting 31 of the " essential items " from the Israeli side , while they need thousands of items .
They ’re not getting any construction materials .
They received 41 truckloads of materials ; the whole place is rubble .
That , to me , goes against the " responsibility to protect " , which was adopted with lots of fanfare in 2005 by all of the heads of state at the U.N .
The need to separate your politics from humanitarian needs and from protection of civilians is a principle that was established a hundred years ago with the Hague Convention and the Geneva Conventions .
I feel that we are moving away from that in many ways .
We talked about " crippling sanctions , " for example .
When you talk about " crippling sanctions , " you have to understand that those who are being crippled are not the people in power — it is the innocent civilians , the elderly , and the young .
That is to me absolutely the wrong approach .
FP : Does that mean you would stop the construction of this underground wall that is currently being constructed between Egypt and Gaza ?
ElBaradei :
As I said , I do n’t really know the details , but if this [ border area ] has been used for smuggling , drugs , weapons , or extremists , then Egypt has the right to make sure it protects its security .
But what Egypt can also do is use the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to allow Gaza to have humanitarian assistance .
For example , one idea I have is to create a free zone in the Egyptian part of Rafah [ the border town ] .
I do n’t see why we ca n’t have a free zone there where people from Gaza go and buy their own basic needs .
So there is a difference between protecting national security , which no one questions , and providing humanitarian assistance .
Right now , Gaza — as was mentioned by the former head of UNWRA , Karen AbuZayd — is the biggest prison in the world .
It pains you to hear that .
It pains you to hear that about any people , anywhere in the world .
FP : As you transition from a career as the head of an international agency to one in Egyptian politics , are there different skills that you ’ve had to learn ?
ElBaradei : Well , I ’m not sure that I will play a role in Egyptian politics .
But , of course , in sitting at the IAEA — one important skill you learn is management .
You have to identify the problems , the options available to you , how to motivate people , and how to make sure you have the right people around you .
Managing a country is like managing a company , in many ways .
It maybe involves more complicated issues , but it ’s the same skills .
Of course , [ both positions require ] the art of compromise .
I have been dealing with officials from a hundred different nationalities , each one coming with their own prejudices , their own culture , and their own way of thinking .
You have to see how to adopt an inclusive approach and get people to work together .
You talked to me about the Muslims and the Copts in Egypt , for example .
It ’s really essentially to accept each other — to cut a deal , if you like , you have to compromise and reconcile your differences .
I was working with 150 member states [ at the IAEA ] and , again , there are n’t two who see eye to eye on anything .
And you have to find the highest common denominator that you can get .
You get a lot of that through psychology — it is not really substance , as you learn .
It ’s really respect and dialogue :
These are all skills that you need wherever and whatever you do in public life .
Whether you are a CEO of Coca - Cola , whether you are the head of the IAEA , or whether you are the president of a country .

November 4 , 2009
British journalist Solomon Hughes , a writer for Private Eye magazine and columnist for the Morning Star newspaper , tells how a lobbyist moved from weakening Britain 's National Health Service to fighting efforts to reform the for - profit industry in the U.S .
THE LEADING corporate lobbyist against proposals for a " public option " in health care reform legislation helped waste billions of dollars introducing " free - market methods " in Britain 's publicly run National Health Service ( NHS ) .
Simon Stevens is UnitedHealth's chief lobbyist and is leading the company 's fight against a public option that would establish a government - run alternative to provide coverage for some of the uninsured .
As well as sitting on the UnitedHealth board , Stevens is chairman of the newly formed UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform and Modernization .
This means Stevens leads UnitedHealth 's campaign against any meaningful reform of America 's health care system , lobbying senators and leading public campaigns to stop any modernization threatening UnitedHealth 's profits .
UnitedHealth hired Stevens in 2004 when he left his old job as chief health adviser to British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
Stevens was the architect of Blair 's market - oriented " reforms " of Britain 's health service .
Lobbyist Simon Stevens ( right ) in Washington , D.C. , to give a report from UnitedHealth Group
Britain's NHS is far more comprehensive and " socialistic " than the Obama administration 's proposal for a public option .
Founded by a reforming Labour Party government in 1945 , it includes both automatic health care for all residents , funded through taxation , and state - run hospitals and clinics .
Tony Blair 's market - oriented Labour government that took power in 1997 gave some NHS medical work to private firms .
Stevens was central to these attempts to commercialize parts of the NHS .
However , far from delivering more efficiency , the Stevens - backed plans have involved literally billions of dollars of waste on failing or underused systems .
The market methods Stevens prescribes for the U.S. health service have already been found wanting in Britain .
Stevens was the main author of the " NHS Plan , " which took medical procedures and operations away from publicly owned and run NHS hospitals , and handed them over to private companies .
The plan was supposed to increase NHS efficiency through competition .
However , profit - hungry firms and badly written contracts meant the private provision was more expensive and worse quality than that offered by publicly owned hospitals .
Under one part of the plan , the NHS gave up on buying their own MRI scanners , and instead paid a private company to do the scans from the back of trucks in hospital parking lots .
Under the contract , the scanning company , called Alliance Medical , was paid for 133,000 scans over five years -- even if the scans were not actually performed .
This year , Britain 's Health Department admitted that the firm only carried out around 80 percent of the work , so it was paid around $ 40 million for doing nothing .
More money was wasted because NHS doctors did not trust the quality of the scans :
The Royal College Of Radiologists said that the firm 's scans could be poor quality , needed to be double checked , or arrived late .
The NHS Clinical Guardian agreed with many of these criticisms , and said that public - sector doctors needed to check the private companies work .
Another part of the plan meant that the NHS bought hundreds of thousands of minor operations from private clinics called " Independent Sector Treatment Centers . "
This " market reform " demonstrated the private sector was far less efficient than the public sector .
Contracts paid private companies 15 percent more per operation than public - sector NHS operations .
They also paid the firms whether the work was done or not .
Estimates by Professor Alyson Pollock , an academic critic of the scheme , suggest up to $ 1.6 billion may have been wasted on phantom operations .
Stevens ' lobbying in the U.S. is based on dubious lessons drawn from his UK work .
Barack Obama made his case for reform very much on cost grounds -- he said he hoped a public option would , by competing with greedy health insurers , force down costs .
Stevens claims that private insurers like UnitedHealth can cut costs themselves .
In particular , Stevens briefed senators that the introduction of new computer systems could cut U.S. health care costs by $ 332 billion .
Yet Stevens " market reform " of the British NHS included a computer system called " NHS Connecting for Health , " a program that cost around $ 20 billion , yet is barely effective .
Stevens was at the meeting that launched Connecting for Health , a suite of computer systems that were supposed to create electronic patient records and bookings , , and in the process allow private contractors to be levered into public health provision .
The program launched in 2002 , was supposed to cost around $ 3 billion and be ready in three years .
Instead , the UK National Audit Office estimates it will cost close to $ 20 billion and wo n't be ready for 10 years .
Bad management of private contractors when Stevens was Blair 's chief health adviser means the system is still ineffective .
Incredibly , in an article for Britain 's Health Service Journal about Obama 's reforms Stevens argued " just about everyone agrees the U.S. needs proper electronic health record systems , and Connecting for Health provides rich insights on the problems that stand in the way of doing so on a comprehensive national basis . "
DESPITE HIS involvement in these public - sector losses , Stevens has apparently been a very effective lobbyist for Untied Health .
The " blue dog " group of conservative Democrats helped start the resistance to a public option .
Before they did , in March , " UnitedHealth Group participated in a roundtable discussion with members of the House Blue Dog coalition , a group of influential , conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives , " according to a company statement .
" UnitedHealth Group , represented by Executive Vice President Simon Stevens , was the only insurance company invited to participate . "
UnitedHealth added that it was " invited back for further discussions surrounding specific policy proposals and issues within the health care reform debate . "
After the " blue dogs " threw a roadblock in the way of the public option , the Obama administration turned to negotiations in the Senate to rescue some form of health reform .
The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by Sen. Max Baucus , is the focus of these negotiations .
Stevens went to lobby Sen. Kent Conrad , a key member of the Finance Committee , in late May .
Soon after Stevens ' visit , Conrad declared that the public option was " dead . "
The announcement by this influential moderate senator that Obama must drop his public option or see his entire health reform fail was a major blow to the proposal for expanded state health insurance , though Democrats appear to be considering a proposal for a highly restricted public option again .
Conrad used a diversionary tactic to attempt to kill off the public option , claiming that " cooperatives " could provide coverage to the uninsured , rather than a government - run public option .
This cooperatives proposal is likely to be unworkable , but the proposal means Conrad can claim not to be simply working for the private health care industry .
While Conrad claims the idea is his own , it is similar to maneuvers that Stevens made in Britain -- while Stevens ' health - sector " reforms " invariably helped profiteering private firms , he often argued that new providers would be a " third sector " or " cooperatives " or charitable organizations .
UnitedHealth has spent over $ 2.5 million lobbying Congress this year , teaming Stevens with their other lobbyist , Tom Daschle , the former leader of the Democrats in the Senate .
WHILE STEVENS is lobbying against the public option in the U.S. , in a striking piece of corporate hypocrisy , his firm is lobbying for work with the publicly run NHS in Britain .
Indeed , UnitedHealth originally hired Stevens to help them win NHS contracts .
In America , under Stevens ' lead , United Health claims that any moves toward a government - run plan would be disastrous , but in Britain , the firm is desperate to squeeze a slice of business from the government - run NHS .
In the UK , the company describes itself as " working in partnership with the NHS . "
Its brochures claim it is " a rapidly growing company focused on improving the NHS . "
In the U.S. , UnitedHealth has been mobilizing popular support against the public option with a self - interested " astroturf " campaign that purports to be grassroots .
In Britain , a genuine popular campaign mobilized against UnitedHealth 's inroads into the NHS -- grassroots protests hobbled UnitedHealth 's first attempt to break into the UK's NHS .
In Britain , general practitioners ( GPs ) are at the frontline of the National Health Service .
These doctors are small independent practitioners who work mostly for the NHS .
UnitedHealth wanted to create a new model of multinational corporations providing GP services through " polyclinics " across a region , with a trial run in former mining towns in Derbyshire .
However , a fierce local campaign lost the company one of its contracts last year .
UnitedHealth is currently bidding to run similar GP services across North London , but it again faces a public campaign that includes local residents , labor unions and a former Labour Party Health Minister .
Campaigners in Britain do n't believe that UnitedHealth is a good partner for the publicly delivered NHS .
This is hardly surprising given the firm 's aggressive stance against Obama 's much weaker public option .
UnitedHealth organized its staff to go to the " town hall " meetings where protesters attacked Obama 's reforms as " socialist , " and as " bad " as our NHS .
UnitedHealth wrote a letter to all its employees telling them to " call the United for Health reform advocacy hotline " to " speak with an advocacy specialist " about Obama 's reforms .
The letter suggested writing to their congressman .
UnitedHealth recommended " working with an advocacy specialist to personalize your message . "
It also said staff should be " attending a town hall meeting " on health
The letter warned that " YOU MAY BE CONTACTED during business hours " by the " advocacy team " and encouraged to go to a " town hall meeting . "
UnitedHealth claims to be neutral about Obama 's reforms , but their " talking points " given to staff mobilized for town hall meetings says : " A government run health plan would be a roadblock to meaningful healthcare reform . "
UnitedHealth also funds another front group organizing protests at the town hall meetings -- the Campaign for an American Solution , which is fighting against Obama using a public option in health care .
According to this campaign 's publicity materials , a " government - run plan " would suck thousands of dollars out of Americans ' wallets , while simultaneously slashing spending on hospitals by 30 percent .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Five Australian Muslim men convicted of plotting to commit violent jihad in Australia were jailed on Monday for terms ranging from 23 to 28 years .
The men were found guilty in October 2009 of conspiring to commit a terror attack between July 2004 and November 2005 , by stockpiling weapons and chemicals to make bombs , in retaliation at Australia ’s involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
During a 10 - month trial , the prosecutor told the New South Wales state Supreme Court that the defendants obtained instructions on how to make bombs capable of causing large - scale death and destruction and literature which glorified the actions of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden .
The prosecution never told the court of any suspected target .
Judge Anthony
Whealy said in sentencing the men that the group was motivated by “ intolerant , inflexible religious conviction ” and said the prospects of rehabilitation was poor .
The men , aged between 25 and 44 and who cannot be named by order of the judge , were arrested in Sydney in 2005 as part of Australia ’s largest ever terror raids .
Australia , a close U. S. ally , was among the first countries to commit troops to U.S. - led campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Australia has never suffered a major peacetime attack on home soil , although 95 Australians have been killed in militant bombings in neighbouring Indonesia since 2001 .
While Democrats were fighting their losing battle in the Massachusetts Senate race last month Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was on the stump in North Dakota .
“ They need to be stopped , ” he said of the Democrats , to a group of tea - baggers and party operatives in Fargo .
John Hoeven , North Dakota ’s Republican governor , is vying for the Senate seat now held by Democrat Byron Dorgan , a liberal populist who shocked the political world when he announced that he will not seek a fourth term .
Hoeven is currently leading in the polls by 20 points against first - term state Sen.
Tracy Potter .
The Republican governor does not deserve the lead shown in the polls , the labor movement and other progressives believe .
The state ’s Democratic Party , with help from labor and others , is launching a series of radio ads to make that clear .
Some labor leaders there say a stronger candidate is needed who could cut through the highly organized right wing operation in their state .
Heidi Heitkamp , the state ’s popular former attorney general , would make a better candidate with broader appeal , some believe .
She is reportedly considering entering the race .
They echoed concerns voiced last month by Karen Ackerman , the AFL - CIO ’s political director , who said the labor movement can be effective in an election only when there is a strong progressive candidate who gives clarity to the issues of jobs and opportunities for working people .
This is even more of a concern in North Dakota , where the labor movement is small .
In the largely agricultural state , organized labor is centered in a few major industries .
Workers in the state ’s power plants belong to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , by far the state ’s largest union , while some workers in the state ’s large coal industry are members of the United Mine Workers .
Republicans , in their push against “ big government ” and workers ’ rights in open - shop North Dakota , are fond of claiming that their “ business friendly ” state is immune to the economic disaster that has swept the country .
But “ everything is not so good here , ” said Mark Froemke , a local AFL - CIO leader whose labor council takes in workers from North Dakota and neighboring Minnesota .
“ A big chunk of the workers are not getting their 40 hours and for many the pay is very low .
Farmers are relying on government agricultural checks and one of the reasons unemployment figures are so low is that when people lose a job there is so little opportunity and the jobless benefits are so small that they just pack up and leave . ”
Why would a state like this , which has n’t had a Republican senator in 24 years , even conside replacing a liberal populist with a right - wing Republican ?
“ The tea - baggers and the right were able to cause confusion , ” Froemke said .
“ They came in and threw everything into the pot and scared people about the possibility they could lose what they did have , in terms of health care .
They were able to tie the administration , in many people ’s minds , to Wall Street getting everything and Main Street getting nothing .
“ You can disagree with them but you have to hand it to them , organization - wise , ” he added .
“ Some of the same senior citizens who went out last year to vote for the first time for an African American for president became scared enough so they now opposed the very health care reform that would help them .
Some of the farmers who depend on the agricultural checks from the federal government now yell about how bad big government is . ”
Another labor leader said at least one of the Obama administration ’s moves was “ not at all helpful . ”
“ They were really wrong in opposing Dorgan ’s fight to let people buy cheap drugs from Canada , ” he said .
“ That was really a popular idea here . ”
Liberals and progressives are hoping the Senate race gets re-charged with a higher - profile Democratic candidate .
Three are as many as nine Senate seats up for grabs in 2010 , with control of the Senate hanging in the balance .
The AFL - CIO announced last week that at its executive council meeting March 1 - 4 , it will map a coordinated national strategy to meet that challenge .

When you tell people you believe ( or hope for ) universal reconciliation the knee jerk reaction is that you do n't believe in hell .
Well , I believe in hell .
I believe in hell for two reasons .
First , humans have committed horrific evils and the notion that God 's wrath is n't kindled in the face of these atrocities is ludicrous .
Universalism is n't some sweet , wishy washy , lovey dovey position .
Victims demand justice .
Evil needs to be punished .
I think it very clear that Jesus speaks about God 's moral fury in very harsh eschatological language .
But the second and perhaps more shocking reason I believe in hell is because I want to go to hell .
I need to go to hell .
Here 's the deal .
God hates sin .
As do I .
Hell is the biblical metaphor for this Divine fury .
Consequently , I do n't want to be saved from the consequences of my sin .
I do n't want a get out of jail free card .
If I am selfish , petty , or vindictive then I want to be free from those sins , not from their consequences .
As the Advent readings told us , Jesus came to set us free from sin .
Not from hell .
Hell is how we get freed from sin .
Hell is a mutual participation between God 's wrath and my own , directed at those aspects of my life that are stupid , selfish or shameful .
I hate it when I act like a jerk to my children or family or anyone else .
And that hatred is a participation in the wrath of God , a participation in hell .
And this wrath is n't self - loathing , depressive or neurotic .
It 's the simple and healthy recognition that I have moral work to do in my life .
And anger is a wonderfully motivating emotion .
I believe in hell because I need it .
We all need it .
And the worst thing you could tell me is that I 'd be rescued from it .
I do n't want to live in eternity as I am right now .
I do n't want God to see Jesus when he sees me .
I want God to see me , honestly , in all my sin and failure .
True ,
God will be upset with that vision .
As am I .
God 's grace is the fact that God wo n't destroy me for these failures , God will not treat me according to my sin .
Jesus died for me , loved me , while I was a sinner .
That much is clear .
So grace is n't the removal of consequences .
It is , rather , the notion that consequences are n't the issue anymore .
God is on my side .
He always has been .
It 's unconditional love .
With that out of the way this means God and I can get on with the business of fighting the sin in my life .
Being perfect as my heavenly Father is perfect .
And God and I do this together .
That 's why hell is a manifestation of God 's grace .
Hell is a partnership , the hard and often hellish work God and I do together to help me conform to the image of Christ .
This is , obviously , a odd view of hell .
But it is simply the logic of the parenting metaphors in the bible , that God is a loving Father .
All parents want their children to move from extrinsic to intrinsic motives in their moral development .
That is , early in life the threat of pain ( e.g. , a spanking ) keeps me on the straight and narrow .
An aversive consequence from the outside motivates me .
But , as we all know , if I stay stuck with these external motivations I fail to develop into a decent person .
I 'll only do good for a reward and I 'll only avoid vice because I might get caught .
What we want from our children is for them to shift from these extrinsic motivations toward intrinsic motives .
We want our children to start doing good for issues associated with identity , character , and joy .
We want them to good because they want to , not because they have to .
In my comments about hell above I 'm making a similar argument .
As long as hell remains an extrinsic motivator , an external consequence , then our moral development remains stagnant .
The same goes for heaven .
And we all know this .
Trying to be good to " go to heaven " always strikes self - reflective people as ridiculous .
In short , we need to move hell from the extrinsic to the intrinsic .
I should n't fear hell like a child fears a spanking .
Rather , as I spiritually grow I internalize hell , I participate in the wrath of God , living by its logic .
Further , as a child grows morally his goal is n't to escape punishment but to face the consequences of his choices courageously and with integrity .
And , yes , if you 've ever faced up to the messes you 've made in life , that experience is hell .
In AA it 's called the 12 Steps .
Is this works - based righteousness ?
No .
I can't do it myself .
I need grace .
I need hell .
Praise be to God .

These are some of the best entries of the 15th edition of Starship Modeler 's Wrecks , a taste of an online contest that calls for modellers to create wrecks of anything they can think about : from figures and planes to famous spaceships , vehicles and full dioramas .
The winning entry was that rustastic AT - AT , which is simply stunning .
My other favorites are the Apollo XIII , the dead Terminator and the Batmobile crashing on the Xmas Tree .
Ca n't get more kitsch and seasonal than that .

UPDATE : Interview with Dimitri Kaliviotis
I talked with Dimitri Kaliviotis , which not surprisingly is a professional model maker who has worked in a lot of Hollywood productions :
Jesus Diaz : Dimitri , first of all , congratulations on such an amazing piece of model - making .
Dimitri Kaliviotis :
Thanks for the compliments and interest in my work .
JD : How long did this beast take ?
Was it a kit or built from scratch ?
DK : It took about 2 months to complete .
Advertisement
JD : Is it a modified kit , right ?
Did you have to create new molds or was it mostly carving and painting ?
DK : You 're right , it is a heavily modified garage kit , which is not commercialy available .
The molds and pieces already existed when I started the construction of this model .
Most of the work however is finding and integrating the " found object " elements .
It was necessary to use found object because alot of the " guts " of the AT - AT are exposed .
You have to find the right piece for the right crevice / opening .
It does n't show from the pictures but the interior of the AT - AT is also " dressed " with found objects .
Advertisement
A couple of close - up pics would have illustrated this " integration " better .
" Found objects " usually include parts from vcr 's , broken toys and sometimes parts of other kits .
Carving and painting of course take up alot of time as well .
JD : I see that you are a professional model - maker .
I have seen your work and it is stunning as well .
What projects have you worked in ?
DK : Yeah , I 'm a professional model - maker .
I 've been working mostly on American film productions shot in Montreal , for the past eight years , since 1999 .
I work on SFX miniatures , which of course lend themselves more easy to " wrecked " subjects .
Films that I 've worked on include : " Taking Lives " ( the straw figurines ) , " 300 " ( the Persian coins + SFX miniature boat parts ) , the infamous " Battlefield Earth " ( SFX miniatures ) [ poor him ] , " Night At The Museum " ( dioramas ) and " The Mummy III " ( concept models ) among many others .
JD : It shows .
Amazing work again .
DK : Thank you again for your interest .
It is very flattering indeed .

REVIEW
Blind Pilot are another great harmonic / ambient acoustic band .
Their debut album “ 3 Rounds and a Sound ” is solid from start to finish , and almost every song will have you singing along by the end .
Israel ’s voice really completes the sound .
Definitely look forward to more of them in the future as well , they have really started to hit it big in the indie scene .
SONGS
The first song on the album , and their staple has to be “ The Story I heard ” .
This one has been stuck in my head from the first time I heard it .

This image released by NASA in 2003 shows a partial moon that was photographed by an Expedition 7 crewmember from the International Space Station .
( AP ) -- President Barack Obama is redirecting America 's space program , killing NASA 's $ 100 billion plans to return astronauts to the moon and using much of that money for new rocket technology research .
The moon plan , which NASA had already spent $ 9.1 billion on , was based on old technology and revisiting old places astronauts had already been , officials said .
The previous NASA chief , in selling the old moon plan , had even called it " Apollo on steroids . "
The rockets were based on space shuttle boosters .
" Simply put , we 're putting the science back into the rocket science at NASA , " White House science adviser John Holdren said at a budget briefing Monday .
The $ 4 billion that NASA spends yearly on human space exploration will now be used for what NASA and White House officials called dramatic changes in rocketry , including in - orbit fueling .
They said eventually those new technologies would be used to send astronauts to a nearby asteroid , a brief foray back to the moon , or the Martian moons .
The White House plan was short on details , such as where astronauts would fly next , on what type of rocketship , or when .
However , officials were quick to point out the failures of the Bush administration 's moon program , called Constellation .
It included the construction of two types of rockets , Ares I and Ares V , and an Orion crew capsule .
All were canceled .
Shutting down the program will cost about $ 2.5 billion , NASA said .
Former President George W. Bush proposed the moon mission after the Feb. 1 , 2003 , space shuttle Columbia disaster that claimed seven lives - exactly seven years ago Monday .
Besides redirecting money to new technologies , NASA is getting an extra $ 6 billion over five years to encourage companies to build private spaceships that NASA could rent .
Many of those companies are run by Internet pioneers .
The companies included in the pilot project include Blue Origin , which is run by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos .
Another firm already building private rockets is run by PayPal founder Elon Musk .
NASA will also spend an additional $ 2.5 billion over five years for more research on how global warming is affecting Earth , including replacing a carbon dioxide monitoring satellite that crashed last year .
NASA will also extend the life by several years of the International Space Station , which had been slated for retirement in 2016 .
NASA 's yearly budget is $ 19 billion .
NASA said if the private companies work well on their unproven spaceships , astronauts could fly in them to the space station as soon as 2016 .
After the next five space shuttle flights , NASA will have to hitch rides to the space station on Russian rockets .
" The truth is we were not on a sustainable path to get back to the moon , " NASA administrator Charles Bolden said in a telephone conference call .
" We were neglecting investments in key technologies . "
Congressional officials howled over lost programs and jobs , but it is hard for Congress to save such a large program that is being cut with redistributed money .
Sen . Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , called the cancellation of the moon program the " death march for the future of U.S. human space flight . "
Explore further NASA to get more money , but must scratch moon plan

Ever heard of the idea that for some illnesses and disorders to develop , you need to have an inherited risk factor plus environmental stress ?
It ’s known commonly as the diathesis - stress model ( diathesis basically means predisposition ) , and it ’s a common explanation for a large range of phenomena , from schizophrenia to serial murder .
Both diathesis and stress need to be present for the illness to arise .
This has been the prevailing view for some time , but a few researchers , such as Jay Belsky and Michael Pluess of Birkbeck university , are now making a slightly different case .
They do n’t say that the diathesis - stress model is incorrect , rather , that it is incomplete .
They have noted multiple instances in the existing research base in which the diathesis side of the model – for example the function of genes , or phenotypic characteristics – would be better explained as what they call ‘ plasticity factors ’ , as opposed to ‘ vulnerability factors ’ .
Is the diathesis - stress model incomplete ?
Let ’s look at the current viewpoint in a little more detail .
Typically , certain people are thought to possess particular gene variants which make them more likely to develop a psychological condition , for example depression , when a certain conditions occur in their life .
So , someone with a different allele ( different versions of the same gene are known as ‘ alleles ’ ) could go through the same experiences , and not come out the other side depressed .
The new point of view would say that rather than having a risk for certain illnesses , these people may actually have a brain that is more responsive to the environment generally .
If they did not go through a stressful period , but instead a supportive , nurturing one , they would be more likely to develop beneficial psychological characteristics – and again , people who had different versions of the gene could go through the same experiences and not come out the other side as well off .
This model is called ‘ differential susceptibility ’ ; people differ in their susceptibility to environmental influence .
The implication is that some brains are more plastic than others , and are therefore more susceptible to both positive and negative effects of supportive and unsupportive environments .
Vulnerability or Plasticity ?
Over the years a number of studies on temperament in children have been published which appeared to supported the diathesis - stress model .
They generally show that differences in parenting style predict differences in self - control , externalising problems , and other aspects of difficult temperament .
But the limitation of these studies is that they did not test for whether these same children would be more likely to receive benefits from different parenting styles .
In other words , these studies were not designed to tell the difference between vulnerability and plasticity – only to detect vulnerability .
Chill out …
A number of other studies , however , have been designed in a way that gets around this problem , and many have supported the idea of general plasticity .
To give an example , one study found that teenage boys with difficult temperament were the least likely to externalise problems after 6 months with sensitive , non-controlling mothers ; but they were also the most likely to externalise problems after 6 months with insensitive , controlling mothers .
Furthering the support for the theory , this pattern was not found in the teenagers who did not have a difficult temperament . ( 2 )
Another study , this time with an experimental design , looked at mothers who were thought to be at risk of developing insecure children due to their own difficulties .
These mothers were given an intervention in the form of a video feedback exercise , which successfully improved their parenting skills .
Was the intervention successful in building a more secure attachment style from the infants ?
Yes it was , but only for those who had a high level of negative reactivity prior to the intervention . ( 3 )
Genetic Markers of Differential Susceptibility
We ’ve looked at a few studies which might demonstrate the effects of differential susceptibility in the ‘ real world ’ .
There is also some evidence looking into the effects of genes , and again Belsky and Pluess ( 1 ) argue that because previous research had been led by the diathesis - stress model , findings which might support differential susceptibility have tended to go overlooked .
If anything I ’ve said up to now has been familiar to you , you might have heard of the 5 - HTTLPR gene .
It has had attention in the media and popular books ( eg. , The How of Happiness ) for being the ‘ depression gene ’ , in that people who have a specific variant of this gene , the so called ‘ short allele ’ , are more susceptible to depression .
A number of studies have supported this finding , but there have been some results which suggest the pattern may not be so clear as yet .
One study found , as predicted , that young adults with two short alleles had the most severe symptoms of depression when they had experienced problematic childhoods .
However , when short allele children had experienced a supportive childhood , they actually showed the fewest symptoms of depression later in life . ( 4 )
A warm and fuzzy conclusion ?
Although the recent evidence for individual differences in plasticity is quite compelling , the authors are very tentative and cautious in their papers , which I suppose is necessary when you ’re proposing something new .
You do n’t want to scare anyone off .
So they are keen to point out that the evidence is not quite solid as yet , and there is more work to be done .
This line of work is only beginning , and there are many unknowns .
Much the same as in priming research , the evidence of the effect is running a little ahead of the understanding of the mechanisms involved , and researchers are unclear on whether differential susceptibility stems mostly from ‘ nature ’ or ‘ nurture ’ , or on the breadth of the phenomena that it applies to .
Having said that , the idea that that the people most susceptible to negative symptoms and experiences might be the people most susceptible to positive symptoms and experiences , is quite a cheerful thought .

A 47 - year - old tribesman gathering food in a north Malaysian forest has fought off a tiger attack armed only with a rock .
The attack in the jungles of Perak state left Yok Meneh with a deep gash on his back and injuries to his hands and legs , the Sunday Star newspaper reported .
Yok Meneh told the newspaper he had been collecting wild green beans and other vegetables when the tiger attacked him .
" I was so engrossed in collecting petai ( green beans ) that I did not notice the tiger had crept up behind me , " he said .
" The moment I realised I had to save myself I tried to grab anything I could with my hands .
" I found a rock , grabbed it and fought back , hitting the tiger on its head again and again until it slunk away . "
" Bedraggled and bleeding " , Yok Meneh was found by his wife , who , with the help of workers from a nearby oil palm estate , took him to hospital .
In 2008 , Malaysia unveiled an ambitious national tiger action plan aimed at doubling the number of wild tigers in peninsular Malaysia to 1,000 by 2020 .

Do n't eat cereals that change the colour of the milk :
Unlikely but brilliantly simple rules that will transform the way you eat
After consulting dietitians , nutritionists , anthropologists , folklorists , doctors and nurses - as well as a large number of mothers and grandmothers - author MICHAEL POLLAN has come up with a fascinating list of so - called ' Food Rules ' that could help change your eating habits for ever ...
The whiter the bread , the sooner you 'll be dead
This blunt bit of grandmotherly advice is a reminder of the health risks of white flour .
As far as the body is concerned , white flour is not much different from sugar .
Recent research indicates that the grandmothers who lived by this rule were right : people who eat lots of whole grains tend to be healthier and to live longer .
Goes without saying : cereals that change the colour of your milk are highly processed and full of chemical additives
Do n't eat cereals that change the colour of milk
This should go without saying .
Such cereals are highly processed and full of refined carbohydrates as well as chemical additives .
Avoid foods Grandma would n't recognise
There are now thousands of food products in the supermarket that our ancestors simple would n't recognise .
They are processed in ways specifically designed to get us to buy and eat more by pushing our evolutionary buttons ( such as our inborn preferences for sweetness , fat and salt ) .
These tastes are difficult to find in nature , but cheap and easy for the food scientists to deploy , with the result that food processing induces us to consume more of these products than is good for us .
If it came from a plant , eat it ; if it was made in a plant , do n't
You know it makes sense .
Eat when you 're hungry , not when you 're bored
For many , eating has surprisingly little to do with hunger .
We eat out of boredom , for entertainment , to comfort or reward ourselves .
One old wives ' test : if you 're not hungry enough to eat an apple , then you 're not hungry .
Old wives ' tale : A healthy plate of food really will feature several different colours
Eat your colours
The idea that a healthy plate of food will feature several different colours is a good example of an old wives ' tale about food that turns out to be good science , too .
The colours of many vegetables reflect the different antioxidant phytochemicals
they contain .
Many of these chemicals help to protect against chronic diseases , but each in a slightly different way , so the best protection comes from a diet containing as many different phytochemicals as possible .
Avoid long lists of ingredients
The more ingredients in a packaged food , the more highly processed it probably is .
( A long list of ingredients in a recipe is not the same thing ; that 's fine . )
Avoid ingredients you do n't recognise
Enhoxylated diglycerides ?
Cellulose ?
Xanthan gum ?
Calcium propionate ?
Ammonium sulfate ?
If you would n't cook with these additives yourself , why let others use these ingredients to cook for you ?
The food scientists ' chemistry set is designed to extend shelf life and make old food look fresher and more appetising than it really is .
Whether or not any of these additives pose a proven hazard to your health , many of them have n't been eaten by humans for very long , so they are best avoided .
Shop at the edges of the supermarket
Most stores are laid out the same way : processed foods dominate the centre aisles , while fresh foods - meat , fish and dairy - line the walls .
Include some pre-digested foods
Eat foods that have been pre-digested by bacteria or fungi , such as yoghurt or soy sauce .
Do n't overlook oily fish :
Eat your mackerel and sardines
Do n't overlook oily fish
Mackerel , sardines and anchovies are particularly good choices .
According to a Dutch proverb : ' A land with lots of herring can get along with few doctors . '
Only eat foods that eventually rot
The more processed a food is , the longer the shelf life , and the less nutritious it typically is .
Real food is alive - and therefore it should eventually die .
( One of the few exceptions is honey , which has a shelf life measured in centuries . )
Avoid foods that are labelled ' low - fat '
Removing fat from foods does n't necessarily make them non-fattening .
Carbohydrates can also make you fat , and many low - fat and non -fat foods are more sugary to make up for the loss of flavour .
You 're better off eating the real thing in moderation than bingeing on ' lite ' food products packed with sugars and salt .
Eat slowly
Eat slowly enough to savour your food : you 'll need less of it to feel satisfied .
One strategy , encoded in a table manner that 's been all but forgotten : ' Put down your fork between bites . '
IT'S NOT FOOD IF IT ARRIVED THROUGH THE WINDOW OF YOUR CAR
Forget the drive - through - drive on !
Drink the spinach water
Another bit of traditional wisdom with good science behind it : the water in which vegetables are cooked is rich in vitamins .
Save it for soup or add it to sauces .
Only eat foods cooked by humans
In general , mass - produced food is cooked with too much salt , fat and sugar , as well as with preservatives , colourings and other biological novelties .
Buy smaller plates and glasses
The bigger the portion , the more we will eat .
Supermarkets supersize portions to get us to buy more .
But we do n't have to do this at home .
One researcher found that simply switching from a 12in to a 10in dinner plate caused people to reduce their consumption by 22 per cent .
Eat like the French , Japanese , Italians or Greeks
People who eat according to the rules of a traditional food culture are generally healthier than those who eat a modern Western diet of processed foods .
Pay attention to how a culture eats as well as to what it eats : small portions eaten at leisurely communal meals ; no second helpings or snacking .
Stop eating BEFORE you 're full : Leave the table a little bit hungry
Stop eating before you 're full
We think it is normal to eat until you are full , but many cultures specifically advise stopping well before that point is reached .
The Japanese say you should stop eating when you are 80 per cent full , while the Chinese specify 70 per cent .
Thus the traditional advice : ' Leave the table a little bit hungry . '
Do n't refuel at the petrol station
Food sold at petrol stations ( except perhaps for the milk and water ) is all highly processed - imperishable snack foods and extravagantly sweetened drinks .
Try not to eat on your own
When we eat alone , we eat more .
The shared meal elevates eating from a biological process of fuelling the body to a ritual of family and community .
It 's not food if it has the same name in all languages
Think Big Mac or Pringles .
Treat treats as treats
There 's nothing wrong with special occasion foods , as long as every day is not a special occasion .
Chips , pastries and ice - cream offer some of the great pleasures of life , so we should n't deprive ourselves of them , but the sense of occasion needs to be restored .
One way is to start making these foods yourself ; you wo n't go to that much trouble every day .
Another is to limit your consumption to weekends or social occasions .
Some people follow a so - called ' S policy ' : ' No snacks , no seconds , no sweets - except on days that begin with the letter S. '
Finally , break the rules once in a while
Obsessing over food rules is bad for your happiness , and probably for your health , too .
There will be special occasions when you will want to throw these rules out the window .
All will not be lost .
What matters is not the special occasion , but the everyday practice - the default habits that govern your eating on a typical day .
' All things in moderation , ' it is often said , but we should never forget the wise addendum , sometimes attributed to Oscar Wilde : ' Including moderation . '

Right around the time I started writing for GeekDad , I embarked on an adventure of learning about chemistry at home with my kids .
Since I 'm the type to obey any warning about using things only as directed , this was a giant leap for me .
By the end of the year , though , we had performed more than 30 experiments , most of which were pretty cool , and we had n't even burned a hole in the kitchen counter .
So imagine my delight at being contacted recently by Chemical & Engineering News , the weekly magazine published by the American Chemical Society .
They have a wonderful little column called " What 's That Stuff ? " that looks at what 's really in things like Silly Putty , self - darkening sunglasses , Cheese Wiz and artificial snow .
This week , they 're examining the chemistry of hand warmers , those little packets you can stick in your pocket or shoe to keep your extremities warm in winter weather .
And it turns out that when you Google " hand warmers " and " chemistry , " one of the first results is the experiment the kids and I did on our blog Home Chemistry !
As we discovered , the kind of hand warmers we were investigating contained iron powder , which quickly began to rust when exposed to air .
Ignoring the warning (! ) and opening the packet lets in more oxygen and speeds up the reaction , creating so much heat that your iron mixture will start to smoke .
( Since we did n't have lab glassware , we did our experimenting in a small canning jar designed to be heated . )
After the reaction cooled down , we also played around with the iron powder using a magnet , which made it act a little bit like ferrofluid .
Check out the column on hand warmers and if you want , try our experiment at home .
Believe me , if I could do it , you can too !

LOS ANGELES ( thefutoncritic.com ) -- Joss
Whedon fans always ask why he does n't go to cable .
They just might get their wish .
" Actually his representatives called and scheduled a lunch , I think I 'm supposed to have lunch with Joss in the next two or three weeks , " FX president John Landgraf told reporters when asked about working with the cult - favorite producer during the network 's executive session at the TCA this morning .
" And I have enormous respect for him , " he continued .
" And by the way , if you look at Shawn Ryan who created ' The Shield ' and is running ' Terriers , ' Shawn learned at the feet of Joss Whedon , the Joss Whedon school .
And Carlton Cuse by the way , as well .
So I do n't really know Joss , but I 'm really looking forward to meeting him .
I love his stuff . "

Computer chess programs are so popular , and so good , that almost anybody can use one to figure out where a player went wrong  when the game is over .
But at the board , competitors can rely only on their brains and wits ( unless they are cheating ) and are bound to make mistakes , especially when they are under pressure .
One reason why Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria is so good is that he forces opponents to make mistakes .
Ranked No. 2 in the world , he is an aggressive player who is always trying to attack .
There are problems with this approach , when being aggressive is not justified .
But the constant pressure that he places on his opponents often causes them to crack , even when Topalov himself has made a mistake .
His style was on display at the annual elite tournament in Linares , Spain , which ended on Wednesday .
Topalov edged the defending champion , Alexander Grischuk of Russia .
Topalov beat Grischuk in Round 5 , though with the benefit of computer - aided hindsight , he probably should have lost .

Thanks to DarkUFO reader Jason for the following .
I was re-watching LAX and thought that if Desmond was on the plane ( and was actually there and not a figment of Jack 's imagination ) , then that meant he never went to the island ( especially if its at the bottom of the ocean haha ) .
And Desmond not on the island has a much greater chance of marrying Penny than Desmond on the island .
And thus I found this ...
It appears our man Des is a ( happily ? ) married man in this alternate timeline .
Very exciting .
New revelations about two documents leaked to the Times of London to show that Iran is working on a " nuclear trigger " mechanism have further undermined the credibility of the document the newspaper had presented as evidence of a continuing Iranian nuclear weapons program .
A columnist for the Times has acknowledged that the two - page Persian language document published by the Times last month was not a photocopy of the original document but an expurgated and retyped version of the original .
A translation of a second Persian language document also published by the Times , moreover , contradicts the claim by the Times that it shows the " nuclear trigger " document was written within an organization run by an Iranian military scientist .
Former Central Intelligence Agency official Philip Giraldi has said U.S. intelligence judges the " nuclear trigger " document to be a forgery , as IPS reported last week .
The IPS story also pointed out that the document lacked both security markings and identification of either the issuing organization or the recipient .
The new revelations point to additional reasons why intelligence analysts would have been suspicious of the " nuclear trigger " document .
On Dec. 14 , the Times published what it explicitly represented as a photocopy of a complete Persian language document showing Iranian plans for testing a neutron initiator , a triggering device for a nuclear weapon , along with an English language translation .
But in response to a reader who noted the absence of crucial information from the document , including security markings , Oliver Kamm , an online columnist for the Times , admitted Jan. 3 that the Persian language document published by the Times was " a retyped version of the relevant parts of that original document . "
Kamm wrote that the original document had " contained a lot of classified information " and was not published " because of the danger that it would alert Iranian authorities to the source of the leak . "
In offering the explanation of the intelligence agency that leaked the document to the Times , Kamm was also damaging the credibility of the document .
A document that had been both edited and retyped could obviously have been doctored by adding material on a neutron initiator .
The reason for such editing could not have been to excise " classified information , " because , if the document were genuine , the Iranian government would already have the information .
Furthermore , there would have been ways of avoiding disclosure of the source of the leak that would not have required the release of an expurgated version of the document .
The number of the copy of the document could have been blacked out , for example .
The Times claimed in a separate story that the " nuclear trigger " document was written within the military technology development organization run by Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh .
A second document , also published in Persian by the Times , shows Fakhrizadeh ’s signature under the title , " Chief , Department of Development and Deployment of Advanced Technology , " and includes a list of 12 " recipients " within that organization , and is dated the Persian equivalent of Dec. 29 , 2005 , on the Western calendar , according to an English translation obtained by IPS .
The Times reporter , Catherine Philp , wrote that the neutron initiator document " was drawn up within the Center for Preparedness at the Institute of Applied Physics , " which she identifies as " one of the organization ’s 12 departments . "
But the reference to a " Center for Preparedness at the Institute of Applied Physics " is an obvious misreading of a chart given to the Times by the intelligence agency but not published by the Times .
The chart , which can be found on the Web site of the Institute for Science and International Security , shows what are clearly two separate organizations relating to neutronics  a " Center for Preparedness " and an " Institute of Applied Physics "  under what the intelligence agency translated as the " Field for Expansion of Advance Technologies ’ Deployment . "
But George Maschke , a Persian language expert and former U.S. military intelligence officer , provided IPS with a translation of the list of the 12 recipients on the cover page document showing that it includes a " Center for Preparedness and New Defense Technology " but not an " Institute of Applied Physics . "
International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) reports have referred to the Institute of Applied Physics as a stand - alone institution rather than part of Fakhrizadeh ’s organization .
The English translation of the document shows that none of the other five centers and groups on the list of recipients is a plausible candidate to run a neutron - related experimentation program , either .
They include the chiefs of the Center for Explosives and Impact Technology , the Center for Manufacturing and Industrial Research , the Chemical and Metallurgical Groups of the Center for Advanced Materials Research and Technology , and the Center for New Aerospace Research and Design .
Contrary to the Times story , moreover , the other five recipients on the list of 12 are not heads of " departments " but deputies to the director for various cross-cutting themes : finance and budget , plans and programs , science , administration and human resources , and audits and legal affairs .
The absence of any organization with an obvious expertise in atomic energy indicates Fakhrizadeh ’s Department of Development and Deployment of Advanced Technology is not the locus of a clandestine nuclear weapons program .
The nuclear weapons programs of Israel , India , and Pakistan prior to testing of an atomic bomb were all located within their respective atomic energy commissions .
That organizational pattern reflects the fact that scientific expertise in nuclear physics and the different stages through which uranium must pass before being converted into a weapon is located overwhelmingly in the national atomic commissions .
The Times story claimed a consensus among " Western intelligence agencies " that Fakhrizadeh ’s " Advanced Technology Development and Deployment Department " has inherited the same components as were present in the " Physics Research Center " of the 1990s .
It also asserts that the same components were present in the alleged nuclear weapons research program that the mysterious cache of intelligence documents now called the " alleged studies " documents portrayed as being under Fakhrizadeh ’s control .
Those claims were taken from the chart given to the Times by the unidentified intelligence agency .
But the idea that Fakhrizadeh has been in charge of a covert nuclear weapons project can be traced directly to the fact that he helped procure or sought to procure dual - use items when he was head of the Physics Resource Center in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
The items included vacuum equipment , magnets , a balancing machine , and a mass spectrometer , all of which might be used either in a nuclear program or for non-nuclear and non-military purposes .
The IAEA suggested in reports beginning in 2004 that Fakhrizadeh ’s interest in these dual - use items indicated a possible role in Iran ’s nuclear program
That same year someone concocted a collection of documents  later dubbed " the alleged studies " documents  showing a purported Iranian nuclear weapons project , based on the premise that Fakhrizadeh was its chief .
Iran insisted , however , that Fakhrizadeh had procured the technologies in question for nonmilitary uses by various components of the Imam Hussein University , where he was a lecturer .
And after reviewing documentation submitted by Iran and verifying some of its assertions by inspection on the spot , the IAEA concluded in its Feb. 22 , 2008 , report that Iran ’s explanation for Fakhrizadeh ’s role in obtaining the items had been truthful after all .
But instead of questioning the authenticity of the " alleged studies " documents , IAEA Deputy Director for Safeguards Olli Heinonen highlighted Fakhrizadeh ’s role in Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons work in a briefing for member states just three days after the publication of that correction .

Blow Jobs ( Fellatio ) significantly decreases the risk of breast cancer in women !!!
Filed under : January 6 , 2008 , 6:42 pmFiled under : Uncategorized
( AP ) — Women who perform the act of fellatio and swallow semen on a regular basis , one to two times a week , may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent , a North Carolina State University study found .
Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer , but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two .
In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio and swallowed the ejaculatory fluid , over the past ten years , the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly , one to two times a week , had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not .
There was no increased risk , however , for those who did not regularly perform .
“ I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act , ” said Dr. A.J. Kramer of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , who was not involved in the research .
“ I am surprised by these findings , but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women . ”
The University researchers stressed that , though breast cancer is relatively uncommon , any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision .
“ Only with regular occurance will your chances be reduced , so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine , ” said Dr. Helena Shifteer , one of the researchers at the University .
“ Since the emergence of the research , I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances . ”
The study is reported in Friday ’s Journal of Medical Research .
In 1991 , 43,582 women died of breast cancer , as reported by the National Cancer Institute .
Dr. Len Lictepeen , deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society , said women should not overlook or “ play down ” these findings .
“ This will hopefully change women ’s practice and patterns , resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases , ” Lictepeen said .
Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are , for whatever reason , not able to fellate regularly .
“ There ’s definitely fertile ground for more research .
Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages , ” he said .
Almost every woman is , at some point , going to perform the act of fellatio , but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference , say researchers .
Also key seems to be the protein and enzyme count in the semen , but researchers are again waiting for more test data .
The reasearch consisted of two groups , 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio and swallowed on a regular basis over the past five to ten years , and 9,728 women who had not or did not swallow .
The group of women who had performed and swallowed had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent .

Covert Video Cameras Covert Video Camera
We all have one of those days when our brains just would n’t function properly , not even after the second cup of coffee .
Information processing is at dial - up speed and we need to absorb as much data as possible .
What are you going to do if you were in this semi-zombie state and you have a very important note - taking session coming up ?
Get a covert video camera !
Record boring lectures and complicated meetings with your pen , watch , bag , or even a book !
There are also some that you can attach on your necktie , pocket , or a pack of gum .
A covert video camera may sound like something out of a spy movie , but a number of online gadget stores actually sell them .
There are so many kinds to choose from with these available specifications ( not comprehensive ) :
Video output : black and white , colored , high resolution , normal resolution
Operation : Automatic , push - button , motion or thermal activated
Audio output : only some record both audio and video
Recording process : wireless or wired to a TV , VCR , DVR or a recording system
Power : battery or electric socket
Recording storage : memory card , tapes , or hard drive
Recording length : depends on the storage capacity
For the purpose stated above , what you need is something that is tiny , stand - alone , and records both audio and video .
The coolest and most natural looking would be a covert video camera in a pen , watch , book , or pin .
They ’re small and can actually function as what they externally are .
However , most of these only record video .
If you do n’t mind lip - reading or just looking at the powerpoint presentation or board notes , then video only recorders would be enough .
But if you want to get the whole experience , there are several options for covert video camera with audio recording capabilities .
Examples are :
DVR Camcorder Pen
2GB , 4GB , and 8GB internal memory available
$ 119.95 for 2GB , $ 149.95 for 4GB , $ 249.95 for 8GB ( sans shipping fee )
Can really be used as a pen
Connect to computer via USB
Up to 2 hours of recording on single charge of rechargeable battery
Recording length : maximum of 15 hours on 2GB , 30 hours on 4GB , and 40 hours on 8 GB memory
Video resolution : 352*288 ( 2GB /4GB ) , 640x480 ( 8GB )
Mini Hidden Color Spy DVR Camera
$ 65.99 sans shipping fee
Can fit into a pack of gum
3 gp video format , 640x480 pixels AVI resolution
Has a built - in 2GB microSD memory – expandable until 8GB
Up to 6 hours of recording
Rechargeable batteries
USB connection to computer
With one of these , you now can replay whole lectures and meetings and note down things you missed when your brain decided to go on a part- vacation .
A lot more can be found by searching around spy gadget websites .
Some offer really good prices and very innovative covert video camera models .
Available also are home surveillance systems .
Of course , there are laws regarding the legality of operating such devices so better check them out before buying one .
[ The Times has an article on the enormous social impact from the loss of hundreds of schools in Haiti .
Also relevant is my recent post and story on Istanbul ’s efforts to strengthen schools and other public buildings before its next big quake . ]
A Washington Post article on the hundreds of schools that collapsed when Haiti was rocked by the earthquake puts a fresh focus on the importance of providing a safe environment for learning , particularly in the poorest developing countries .
“ Without education , we have nothing , ” said Michel Renau , director of national exams at the Ministry of National Education , Youth and Sports , which itself is a rubble pile in the city center .
“ We ’ve been set back very far .
But if we pull ourselves together quickly , we ’ll go on . ”
As was explored here following the enormous toll in student ( and teacher ) deaths from the earthquake in China ’s Sichuan province , this does n’t take high technology or big budgets — simply adherence to well established norms for designing buildings to sway instead of crumble or pancake .
( A Haitian school collapsed under its own weight in November 2008 , illustrating that basic lapses in building practices are widespread in poor countries . )
There ’s much more here on building safer schools .
One option for rural regions is using straw bales .
Illustrating a way to use concrete and brick safely , Santiago Pujol , an earthquake engineer at Purdue , provided me with renderings showing how the same mix of materials , configured differently , can result in a far sturdier design .
( Watch video of this design being tested on a giant “ shake table . ” )
Such structures can also be designed with aesthetics and sunlight in mind , as Dr. Pujol showed in a subsequent illustration :
Of course , the lessons here apply far beyond Haiti , given that tens of millions of children — from Istanbul to Oregon — are studying in schools that are already known to be what some earthquake engineers ruefully call “ rubble in waiting . ”
Soon , I ’ll be describing my recent visit to several Istanbul schools in various phases of retrofitting to help them withstand the next earthquake there .
See the map below , from an earlier print story of mine , to note the number of kids in earthquake zones :
Below , as time allows , I ’ll add input from experts on the challenges and opportunities facing Haiti in the months and years ahead as efforts are made to “ build back better , ” in the parlance of planners , engineers and seismologists who are part of a global movement to reduce losses from inevitable disasters .
Here ’s the first such comment .
Frederick Krimgold , the director of the Disaster Risk Reduction Program , Virginia Tech :
LASHKAR GAH , Afghanistan — Operation Moshtarak , or the Battle of Marjah , has been billed as the decisive operation of the Afghan war — think Stalingrad or the Battle of the Bulge .
It will “ break the back of the Taliban , ” according to military strategists , and will turn the tide of a conflict that has been looking increasingly desperate of late .
It is also , significantly , the first major test of the new American strategy — troops from the U.S. surge are committed , along with five brigades of Afghan forces and approximately 4,000 British troops .
This is a chance to see whether the much - vaunted plan to “ Afghanize ” the war in 18 months ’ time will actually bear fruit .
But after three days of listless fighting , the few dusty square meters of agricultural land in the middle of Helmand province may not live up to all the hype .
Military spokesmen had acknowledged that there has been less resistance than expected ; Gulab Mangal , the governor of Helmand , speaking to a press conference in Helmand ’s capital , Lashkar Gah , on Sunday , confirmed that fighting had been merely sporadic .
“ The situation here is calm , ” he said .
“ There has been no fierce fighting . ”
Certainly the Taliban are hopelessly outmatched :
There are 15,000 troops facing at most 2,000 insurgents .
Taliban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi told reporters that this was a sign of the moral weakness of the joint command .
“ The international and Afghan forces have proved their cowardice , ” he said .
“ They brought 15,000 troops against 2,000 Taliban . ”
The Taliban made a good show early in the operation , beating off a paratrooper force in the Loy Charahi area of Marjah .
But by the end of the first day , they were flagging .
“ Most of the Taliban are leaving Marjah , ” said a member of the Marjah citizens ’ council , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ They know they cannot resist . ”
The IED challenge
The insurgents have done what they could to even the score .
The Americans have made no secret of the fact that Marjah was their next target , going so far as to scatter leaflets over the area in previous weeks , warning civilians and insurgents alike that a battle was brewing .
The Taliban used the time to seed the area with Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) .
( For an in - depth look at these IEDs , and the U.S. effort to combat them , read GlobalPost 's series on Afghanistan 's Hurt Locker . )
Mullah Osmani , a local Taliban commander in Marjah , boasted that there was hardly a square inch of the area that had not been mined .
“ We have laid explosives on the roads and bridges , the fields and desert , every single way that people walk or ride , ” he said .
“ We have informed all villagers not to leave their houses unless there is an emergency .
If they have to go out they can contact us and we will show them which way to go , or we will defuse the mine . ”
Ahmad Ahamdi , a resident of the Saipan area of Marjah , said that he had seen the Taliban laying mines close to his house .
“ Just 200 meters from my door the Taliban have placed 35 interconnected devices , ” he said .
“ A lot of troops may be killed here . ”
Some reports out of Marjah estimate that nearly 70,000 mines and other types of IEDs have been planted .
The preponderance of explosives will certainly complicate the movement of the combined forces against the Taliban , say military officials .
Gen .
Sher Mohammad Zazai , commander of the 205th Atal Corps , acknowledged the difficulty .
“ There are six large battalions of the Afghan National Army along with six battalions from ISAF [ International Security Assistance Force ] conducting this operation jointly , ” he told reporters in Lashkar Gah .
“ The Taliban will never be able to withstand our operation , but there is one big challenge in the area : the mines , which could slow down the operation . ”
Hearts and minds
Gen. Rahim Wardak , the minister of defense , speaking at the same press conference , told reporters that the battle would not end soon .
“ This operation will take at least a month , ” he said .
“ We cannot deal with all these challenges , including the mines and the enemy movements , any more quickly .
But we promise the people of Marjah that we will pave the way for them to have a good life . ”
But the people of Marjah , trapped between the Taliban , the mines , and the onslaught of forces , are in no mood to be patient .
“ The governor said there would be no aerial bombardment , ” said Zahir Jan , a resident of Marjah .
“ But there are planes dropping bombs right now .
The situation is full of terror .
Dozens of people could be killed . ”
More than 60 helicopter gunships were involved in the initial assault on Marjah , according to Afghan officials .
It did not take long for the first news of civilian casualties to come in .
On Sunday two rockets aimed at what was thought to be an insurgent compound veered off target , killing 12 members of one family .
“ We deeply regret this loss of life , ” said ISAF commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal , conveying his apologies to Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
" The current operation in central Helmand is aimed at restoring security and stability to this vital area of Afghanistan .
It 's regrettable that in the course of our joint efforts , innocent lives were lost .
We extend our heartfelt sympathies and will ensure we do all we can to avoid future incidents . "
The use of the particular type of rocket involved in the incident has been suspended until an investigation can be conducted .
Abdul Rahman Saber , a member of the Marjah citizens ’ council and a former police chief in Helmand , said that Operation Moshtarak had come right on time .
“ People will be happy if this operation is a success and if all of these promises for reconstruction and development are delivered .
But if not , there will be a disaster . ”
People trapped inside their homes are running out of food , he said , which , if the operation continues for weeks , could turn into a real problem .
Another growing difficulty is the displacement caused by the fighting .
More than 900 families have fled Marjah for Lashkar Gah , about 15 miles away , where they are putting a strain on the resources of the Red Crescent .
“ We have begun giving assistance to 750 families , ” said Ghulam Farooq Noorzai , head of the Department of Refugees in Helmand .
There are lines of people in the center of Lashkar Gah waiting for food , blankets , and other emergency items .
Ahmadullah Ahmadi , head of the Red Crescent in Helmand , insists that the organization is ready for the tide .
“ We are pepared to give assistance to 2,000 families , ” he said .
“ Within two days we will even go to Marjah and help those who could not make it to Lashkar Gah . ”
But Sharifullah , who introduced himself as a displaced person from Marjah , has been unable to obtain any help .
“ I have been standing here since morning , ” he complained .
“ But I do not have my mother and sister with me .
I could not take them , or my household goods , out of Marjah .
The Taliban would not let me .
So now they tell me that they are only giving assistance to those with women and children .
This is not fair . ”
The Taliban are alternating between bravado and a shoulder - shrugging dismissal of the entire operation .
“ Frankly , Marjah is not that important to us , ” said Talban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmady .
“ My friends and comrades are in the area .
We have more than 2,000 volunteer fighters .
We will not give it away easily .
But it does not mean that Marjah is everything to us .
If God will , we will leave [ Marjah ] .
We have a place in people ’s hearts everywhere . ”
But that place is wearing thin in the residents of Marjah .
“ We do n’t want the Taliban any more , ” said one , who did not want to give his name .
“ But we do n’t want anybody else who will make fights .
We just want some peace and development . ”
Casualty figures are difficult to come by .
Preliminary reports state that 27 Taliban were killed in the first two days of fighting .
The Afghan Army sustained two injuries , according to the defense minister .
There have been ISAF casualties , but they have not been officially confirmed .
After the battle
With military victory all but assured , ordinary people and officials alike are looking toward the post - operation phase .
McChrystal has made gaining the trust of the population the cornerstone of his counterinsurgency strategy .
But he is under intense pressure to show results quickly : President Barack Obama , in his Dec. 1 speech announcing the surge , announced that U.S. troops would begin to draw down in July 2011 .
This may be one reason for the emphasis on the Afghan - led nature of Operation Moshtarak — the word “ moshtarak ” means “ together ” in Dari .
“ It is a matter of special pride to us that Afghan troops are leading this operation , ” McChrystal told a press conference in Lashkar Gah .
“ The international troops are in a supporting role . ”
The Interior Ministry has a battalion of police officers ready to guarantee security after the operation , said Interior Minister Hanif Atmar , speaking in Lashkar Gah .
“ We will help the tribal leaders in search operations , and we will pave the way for good governance , ” said Atmar .
“ Good governance ” is shorthand for an end to the massive corruption and abuse that have been the lot of Afghan citizens at the hands of their own government .
They have heard numerous promises over the years , and are skeptical that this time will be different .
According to author and analyst Felix Kuehn , speaking at a conference in London last week , the people in southern Afghanistan are as alienated from Kabul as they are from Washington or Bonn .
“ The central government does not exist in southern Afghanistan , ” he said .
A member of the citizens ’ council agreed .
“ If this time the government of Afghanistan does not deliver on its promises to the people of Marjah , this operation cannot succeed , ” he said .
“ Instead , it will be a complete disaster . ”
Aziz Ahmad Tassal contributed to this report from Kabul .
" Conspiracies , since they cannot be engaged in without the fellowship of others , are for that reason most perilous ; for as most men are either fools or knaves , we run excessive risk in making such folk our companions . "

Since time immemorial we have had conspiracies .
Julius Caesar died at the hands of a conspiracy led by Brutus , Cassius and other rebellious senators in 44 BCE , while more contemporaneously in California , 1996 , one twin conspired to have the other murdered — so much for the sibling bond !

AUSTRALIA has softened its traditionally staunch support for Israel in the United Nations but denied it was linked to tensions over the country 's apparent use of forged Australian passports in an assassination in Dubai .
At a vote in the UN General Assembly - where Australia has been one of Israel 's strongest supporters - the government abstained from a resolution demanding that Israel and the Palestinians investigate possible war crimes during the assault on Gaza that Israel began in December 2008 .

Three months ago , Australia voted against a similar resolution which sought to endorse the Goldstone report - a UN - sponsored paper which accused Israel and Hamas of war crimes .
The Foreign Affairs Minister , Stephen Smith , said yesterday that the change was not related to the passport scandal and that Australia abstained because the latest resolution did not specifically endorse the Goldstone report .

Officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , Johnson County Sheriff ’s Office and Lawrence Police Department were seen Thursday morning packing up boxes of files and other items from inside the store , 1103 Mass .
Authorities on scene said the FDA was in charge of the investigation , but an agency spokesperson would n’t say why agents were there .
“ The FDA does not comment publicly on criminal investigations , ” said Tom Gasparoli , FDA spokesman .
Lydia Shontz , who identified herself as an employee of the store , said when she arrived at work Thursday morning she was escorted away by police .
She said officers told her they had obtained a federal search warrant and then interviewed her about the marijuana - like substance K2 and other items the store sells , including cactus plants .
“ It sucks big - time , I knew that this would happen , ” Shontz said of the search .
“ I honestly did n’t expect it to be this powerful . ”
Customer after customer , many coming to Sacred Journey to purchase the controversial K2 , was turned away by a police guard at the door .
“ It sounds pretty ridiculous , ” Tim Ford , who came from Olathe to buy K2 , said of the raid .
Kansas
House legislators this week passed a bill that would make illegal the sale or possession of K2 , but that legislation has yet to become law .
The bill is likely to hit Gov. Mark Parkinson ’s desk this session .
Parkinson said he favors the proposal .
“ I think it ’s great that they ’re moving on it , ” he said .
The House and Senate have passed versions of the bill by wide margins .
Once differences are reconciled between the measures , the ban will go back to the House and Senate for final approval .
Law enforcement has said the herbal mixture , which is marketed and sold as incense , is being smoked by young people to get high .
THE first - year corporate lawyers of “ The Deep End , ” a series that has its premiere on ABC this week , inhabit an alternative legal universe , where advancement on the partner track seems measured by their perfect grooming and ability to model designer suits and trade flirtatious banter .
In the sleek offices of the fictional firm Sterling Huddle Oppenheim & Craft , high above the Los Angeles smog canopy , life is a colorful , quip - filled adventure .
“ This is your lucky chance , your break in the clouds , your four - leaf clover , ” a senior lawyer informs Dylan , a fresh Columbia Law School graduate , during his interview .
Associates may grumble that the firm is a pit of back - stabbing , a machine that grinds young lawyers down .
But they still find time for laughs over beers , games of basketball on a rooftop court and , of course , sex .
Adventure ?
Laughter ?
Among law associates ?
This must be a period drama .
In fact , “ The Deep End ” was conceived in 2007 , that halcyon era of $ 160,000 starting salaries and full employment even for law grads who had scored in the 150s on their LSAT’s .
ANN ARBOR -- Barbara
Smuts thought this dog owner must be a crackpot .
The woman from Maryland kept insisting her dog was going into the backyard and arranging his many plush toys into geometric shapes of circles , parallel lines and triangles .
Come on , you must be helping him , responded Smuts , a psychology professor at the University of Michigan who studies canine social behavior .
And if you 're not , the neighbors must be playing a trick on you , she said .
The woman steadfastly ruled out Smuts 's reservations , and the professor eventually flew to Maryland to visit the woman and her dog , Donnie .
Smuts now believes Donnie is , in fact , creating the displays .
FIND OUT MORE Smuts has a Web site at www.sitemaker.umich.edu/barbara.smuts/home.
You can e-mail her at bsmuts@umich.edu .
A show about her dog research will air on the National Geographic Channel at 1 p.m. Dec. 30 , 7 p.m. Feb. 1 and 2 a.m. Feb . 2 .
Cable TV viewers
will be able to make up their minds about Donnie on Sunday , when he and Smuts will be featured on a National Geographic Channel documentary called " Dog Genius . "
The show airs at 8 and 11 p.m .
Donnie , a male Doberman , was at first reluctant to perform for Smuts , probably because he was more excited about having a new person in the house .
So she suggested the woman install a few security cameras , which recorded Donnie in the act , moving his more than 80 plush toys into geometric shapes and creating social vignettes with them .
" She actually got some significant footage of him , " Smuts said .
" Not as much as I would like , but enough to show that he 's doing it , and it's not something he has been trained to do , and it 's completely spontaneous . "
Smuts also went to Maryland a second time to visit Donnie .
" I was watching from the den , and he picked up a toy , and put it in the right place , " she said .
Donnie 's owner has many photographs of his creations and had Smuts review them .
Smuts said they appear genuine .
" I 'm 99 percent certain that they 're all his , " she said .
For the show , National Geographic interviewed scientists and dog trainers to explore dog smarts .
Smuts is one of the people to appear on film , confirmed Erin Smith , a spokesperson .
So how smart are dogs ?
It 's a tricky question , Smuts said .
Dogs are brilliant in navigating social relationships and in communicating with body language , she said .
They 're also good at reading human cues and understanding what humans are trying to communicate - even better than chimpanzees , she said .
" It 's an evolutionary phenomenon , " Smuts said .
" The dogs who could understand what the people wanted or were feeling would be the ones the people would feed , and they would survive . "
Now , that could explain why your dog knows you 're about to take him for a walk even before you start for the door .
As for Donnie , Smuts says his past may hold some clues .
He was rescued by his owner , but had spent a year in a cage in a kennel , with just a single toy .
Donnie may be entertaining himself with his backyard arrangements while his owner is preoccupied .
He also creates relationships between his toys as he moves them , she said .
" Donnie ca n't be the only dog in the world who does this , " Smuts said .
" I 'm hoping that people will see this show and say , ' Hey , that 's like my dog , or I know a dog that does that , ' and e-mail me .
We need a larger sample to find out what 's going on . "
( CNN ) -- Peggy Bourland can't eat .
When she lies down to sleep , she fights the urge to go outside and curl up on the cold , hard ground .
" Ken ca n't eat right now .
He can't sleep in our bed , " she said , her husband 's military dog tags around her neck .
" I wo n't have what he cannot have . "
Last Tuesday , from his room at the Hotel Montana near Port- au - Prince , Haiti , U.S. Air Force Maj .
Ken Bourland sent an e-mail to his wife telling her that he was fine and had just settled in for what was going to be an exciting time taking a disaster preparedness course .
It was 4:51 p.m. ET .
Less than 10 minutes later , an earthquake leveled much of the Haitian capital , including the Hotel Montana .
" I had just clicked off the e-mail and was trying to find some cartoons for the kids to watch , " she said .
" And then I saw this breaking news .
An earthquake .
I thought , ' Did California get hit again ? '
Then I saw Haiti . "
Bourland popped her laptop open and fired off an e-mail : " Please tell me you 're OK . "
No response .

Crews have spent the past six days searching mounds of rubble , 30 feet high in places , that was the Hotel Montana , popular with tourists and visiting officials .
Some United Nations employees who lived there remain unaccounted for , the U.N. said Sunday , and Alain Joyandet , the French minister of cooperation , said approximately 200 French tourists staying there had not been heard from .
There is reason to hope .
On Friday , a woman trapped in the hotel 's collapsed bar was rescued .
In the past few days , students from South Florida 's Lynn University , who were in Haiti on a humanitarian mission to feed the poor , were freed from the Montana 's rubble .
Six others with the university are reportedly still missing .
Peggy Bourland gets two calls a day at her suburban South Florida home -- one at night , one in the morning -- from the family 's assigned military liaison .
There 's nothing to say , really .
She 's told to be optimistic .
She tries .
After the second call , when she has tucked the couple 's sons , 16 - month - old Andrew and 3 - year - old Charley into bed , she allows herself to cry .
" I do n't do it in front of them . "
She finds it overwhelming to return to thoughts about the Sunday before Ken Bourland left .
It was Charley 's birthday , and another military family came over .
" Ken sang to him and we all said , ' Daddy 's going on another trip . ' "
The Bourlands ' fifth wedding anniversary will be in March .
Their first date -- set up by her boss and his sister -- was one with hours of talk and lost time .
She liked the fact that he asked questions about every conceivable scenario that might arise from a decision .
He analyzed , where she just went with it .
He prepared for the small and big things .
He had been mulling for weeks , exhausting Google , over what kind of television to buy .
Ken 's steady demeanor has rubbed off on Chance , his stepson .
Peggy 's son was 9 when she introduced him to Ken .
The helicopter pilot endeared himself quickly with camping and a mutual zest for video games and remote control cars .
Now 13 , Chance understands what 's going on .
" I let him talk when he wants to , " she said .
" But sometimes there 's nothing to say .
You just wait and continue to wait , hoping for something good . "

In another measure of how what the establishment labels “ conspiracy theory ” is quickly becoming mainstream , Bloomberg News carries a story today acknowledging that those derided as “ crazy ” for warning that the world is run by a secret banking cabal have largely been proven right in light of the AIG cover -up .
“ The idea of secret banking cabals that control the country and global economy are a given among conspiracy theorists who stockpile ammo , bottled water and peanut butter .
After this week ’s congressional hearing into the bailout of American International Group Inc. , you have to wonder if those folks are crazy after all , ” writes Bloomberg ’s David Reilly today .
“ Wednesday ’s hearing described a secretive group deploying billions of dollars to favored banks , operating with little oversight by the public or elected officials . ”
Reilly goes on to describe how the New York Fed conducted a backdoor bailout ( or in plainer terms a wholesale looting of the taxpayer ) of banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank AG , and then sought to keep it secret from the public .
Reilly also highlights another telling quote by Representative Marcy Kaptur during the hearing on Wednesday , when she told Geithner , “ A lot of people think that the president of the New York Fed works for the U.S. government .
But in fact you work for the private banks that elected you . ”
[ efoods ]
Reilly savages Tim Geithner ’s denial of any involvement in the scandal and concludes with stating , “ When unelected and unaccountable agencies pick banking winners while trying to end - run Congress , even as taxpayers are forced to lend , spend and guarantee about $ 8 trillion to prop up the financial system , our collective blood should boil . ”
As we have constantly emphasized , as the global government and the financial takeover accelerates , it ’s becoming harder and harder for the elite to hide the true intention of what they are doing , which is centralizing power into fewer hands , destroying sovereignty and creating a one world order run by an unelected , undemocratic authoritarian system .
So whereas “ conspiracy theorists ” were once sidelined as paranoid kooks , as more and more of what they warned about comes to fruition , they gain more credibility and the establishment finds it more difficult to neutralize what they are saying by means of character assassination .
The Bloomberg writer ’s admission that the “ conspiracy theorists ” were probably right reminds us of former Clinton advisor Dick Morris ’ appearance on Fox News last year , when he pointed out that people who have been sounding the alarm bells over a global government takeover for decades have also been vindicated .
“ Those people who have been yelling ‘ oh the UN ’s gonna take over , global government ’ , they ’ve been crazy but now – they ’re right ! , ” stated Morris on Sean Hannity ’s show .

The Nissan Versa is one of the least expensive cars on the U.S. market with a base price of $ 9,990 , though sacrifices must be made to get there .
But now a report has emerged that Nissan is planning two more small cars , smaller than the Versa , to be priced comfortably around $ 10,000 .
The latest report confirms information dug up by Bengt Halvorson back in October .
That means you wo n't necessarily have to give up your power windows , stereo and air conditioning to get down to $ 10,000 .
The two models are still unnamed , but with Nissan already planning an eight - model rollout for the coming year , it 's not hard to see two more coming along for the ride .
What is a bit harder to see is how a sub - $ 10,000 sub - Versa - size car will fare in the U.S. market .
Its tiny size and low price may give the perception of a " disposable " car -- not necessarily good for Nissan 's brand image .
On the other hand , there may be a market for people that would like a hyper - efficient and low - cost third car with modern safety and conveniences built - in .
Nissan is obviously banking on the latter .
The decision to sell the $ 10,000 cars in the U.S. is a natural one , according to Nissan 's chairman for the Americas , Carlos Tavares .
He told Automotive News , " I think $ 10,000 is a good point .
As you know , there are very few new cars sold at that price point in the United States . "
The new small cars will be built on what Nissan calls the V platform , and though three cars will be built around the same architecture , only two will be sold in the U.S .
The third will be sold in Central and South America alongside the other two .
The V platform is the architecture Nissan will be using to replace the Micra 's underpinnings in other markets , potentially opening the door for the next - gen Micra to come to the U.S. as one of the two new cars .
No time frame has been given for the pair of $ 10,000 cars , but the next Micra is expected to come to some markets in late 2010 as a 2011 model , meaning the U.S. - bound models will like arrive sometime after that .

THE FALLOUT continues from D.C. Public Schools ( DCPS ) Chancellor Michelle
Rhee 's latest attack on public education , and there are signs that more attacks are in store .
On October 29 , Rhee appeared at a City Council hearing to answer for her Reduction In Force ( RIF ) tactic , in which she fired 388 DCPS workers in early October , including 266 teachers .
Outrage over the job cuts was widespread , and even spilled into the hearings .
This has exacerbated a split between Rhee and the City Council over summer school funding , which the council advised be cut before any layoffs were made .
Council Chair Vincent Gray hinted at criminal neglect on the part of Rhee and Schools Chief Financial Officer Noah Wepman , asking , " Why bother to have a legislative body if the people in the executive branch do whatever they choose because they do n't like the decision of the legislative branch ? "
This question has been on the minds of many in the community since Mayor Adrian Fenty dissolved the school board and consolidated power over D.C. public education in the hands of himself and Rhee .
Teachers and community members protesting Rhee 's October layoffs
Rhee stood by her decision , with the incredible claim that laying off teachers would have no effect on students .
" I decided that , as unfortunate as the cut was , I 'd rather see that cut happen to adults rather than children , " Rhee said .
Does
Rhee think that the many adults she fired do not have children -- or that a student whose favorite subject is French is not affected when the class is no longer available ?
THESE LATEST job cuts are already having a devastating impact .
In certain schools , entire subjects will no longer be taught .
Newer , inexperienced teachers will have to absorb a surplus of students , making it impossible for a healthy classroom environments to develop .
At one high school in the Anacostia neighborhood , multiple special education teachers lost their jobs , meaning that the special education department is now made up almost entirely of first - year teachers from the Teach for America program .
Many of the individuals whose jobs were cut are Black teachers who were active in the Washington Teachers Union ( WTU ) , whose contract was totally bypassed to implement the RIF .
This has created a climate in which current DCPS teachers have been hesitant to go on record out of fear of reprisals from the chancellor .
As one teacher , who asked to remain anonymous , said , " In June , we will see if there really was a summer school budget crisis or if there were [ other motives for the RIF ] . "
The WTU , despite calling a few small rallies and vigils , largely pursued a legal strategy of fighting Rhee in the courts to get the fired teachers ' jobs back - - a strategy that has now hit a wall .
Just before Thanksgiving , the D.C. Superior Court ruled in favor of Rhee and against the WTU 's lawsuit challenging the RIF .
Meanwhile , parents of students at Rose Hardy Middle School are concerned that their school might be next on the chopping block , after Rhee made public comments that she plans to " turn " the school .
Of the 75 percent Black school , Rhee said , " It 's not going to turn overnight , but I think the plan we 're moving forward on is one that is really going to boost [ the school as an ] option .
I think people will be incredibly pleased . "
Yet according to last spring 's standardized test scores , almost three - quarters of the school placed proficient or above in reading , and the fine arts and instrumental music program offered at Hardy is one of the best in the city .
So many are wondering what the problem is , and what " plan " Rhee has in store .
Many Hardy parents and teachers feel that Rhee wants to change the demographic of a successful school to accommodate a small group of privileged parents .
Keenan Keller , whose daughter attends seventh grade at Hardy , told the Washington Post , " If you 're a civil rights lawyer , and you read that , you 're asking , ' Turn from what to what ?
Turn from who to who ? ' "
Already , public education in D.C. is more restricted than most places in the country .
Washington is second only to New Orleans in the spread of charter schools , with 36 percent of all students attending charters .
Higher public education is under attack as well , with D.C. 's Southeastern University losing its accreditation after 130 years serving low - income and international students .
Tuition at the University of the District of Columbia increased 100 percent over the past two semesters .
The methods and procedures used to privatize education in the district , where one in six union members are teachers , are a blatant attack on our basic rights .
These changes should be seen as what they are : an aggressive strike at poor and working - class people 's education and the unions that protect our teachers , who are provided little more than scraps to educate our youth .
The resistance of D.C. teachers , parents and students will be crucial to making sure that Rhee does n't get her way , and that education remains public here in the nation 's capital .
We need to organize and unite against these injustices , and never forget that education is a right , not a privilege .
EIGHTEEN months ago , Li & Fung , a firm that manages supply chains for retailers , saw 100 gigabytes of information flow through its network each day .
Now the amount has increased tenfold .
During 2009 , American drone aircraft flying over Iraq and Afghanistan sent back around 24 years ' worth of video footage .
New models being deployed this year will produce ten times as many data streams as their predecessors , and those in 2011 will produce 30 times as many .
Everywhere you look , the quantity of information in the world is soaring .
According to one estimate , mankind created 150 exabytes ( billion gigabytes ) of data in 2005 .
This year , it will create 1,200 exabytes .
Merely keeping up with this flood , and storing the bits that might be useful , is difficult enough .
Analysing it , to spot patterns and extract useful information , is harder still .
Even so , the data deluge is already starting to transform business , government , science and everyday life ( see our special report in this issue ) .
It has great potential for good — as long as consumers , companies and governments make the right choices about when to restrict the flow of data , and when to encourage it .
Plucking the diamond from the waste
A few industries have led the way in their ability to gather and exploit data .
Credit - card companies monitor every purchase and can identify fraudulent ones with a high degree of accuracy , using rules derived by crunching through billions of transactions .
Stolen credit cards are more likely to be used to buy hard liquor than wine , for example , because it is easier to fence .
Insurance firms are also good at combining clues to spot suspicious claims : fraudulent claims are more likely to be made on a Monday than a Tuesday , since policyholders who stage accidents tend to assemble friends as false witnesses over the weekend .
By combining many such rules , it is possible to work out which cards are likeliest to have been stolen , and which claims are dodgy .
Mobile - phone operators , meanwhile , analyse subscribers ' calling patterns to determine , for example , whether most of their frequent contacts are on a rival network .
If that rival network is offering an attractive promotion that might cause the subscriber to defect , he or she can then be offered an incentive to stay .
Older industries crunch data with just as much enthusiasm as new ones these days .
Retailers , offline as well as online , are masters of data mining ( or “ business intelligence ” , as it is now known ) .
By analysing “ basket data ” , supermarkets can tailor promotions to particular customers ' preferences .
The oil industry uses supercomputers to trawl seismic data before drilling wells .
And astronomers are just as likely to point a software query - tool at a digital sky survey as to point a telescope at the stars .
There 's much further to go .
Despite years of effort , law - enforcement and intelligence agencies ' databases are not , by and large , linked .
In health care , the digitisation of records would make it much easier to spot and monitor health trends and evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments .
But large - scale efforts to computerise health records tend to run into bureaucratic , technical and ethical problems .
Online advertising is already far more accurately targeted than the offline sort , but there is scope for even greater personalisation .
Advertisers would then be willing to pay more , which would in turn mean that consumers prepared to opt into such things could be offered a richer and broader range of free online services .
And governments are belatedly coming around to the idea of putting more information — such as crime figures , maps , details of government contracts or statistics about the performance of public services — into the public domain .
People can then reuse this information in novel ways to build businesses and hold elected officials to account .
Companies that grasp these new opportunities , or provide the tools for others to do so , will prosper .
Business intelligence is one of the fastest - growing parts of the software industry .
Now for the bad news
But the data deluge also poses risks .
Examples abound of databases being stolen : disks full of social - security data go missing , laptops loaded with tax records are left in taxis , credit - card numbers are stolen from online retailers .
The result is privacy breaches , identity theft and fraud .
Privacy infringements are also possible even without such foul play : witness the periodic fusses when Facebook or Google unexpectedly change the privacy settings on their online social networks , causing members to reveal personal information unwittingly .
A more sinister threat comes from Big Brotherishness of various kinds , particularly when governments compel companies to hand over personal information about their customers .
Rather than owning and controlling their own personal data , people very often find that they have lost control of it .
The best way to deal with these drawbacks of the data deluge is , paradoxically , to make more data available in the right way , by requiring greater transparency in several areas .
First , users should be given greater access to and control over the information held about them , including whom it is shared with .
Google allows users to see what information it holds about them , and lets them delete their search histories or modify the targeting of advertising , for example .
Second , organisations should be required to disclose details of security breaches , as is already the case in some parts of the world , to encourage bosses to take information security more seriously .
Third , organisations should be subject to an annual security audit , with the resulting grade made public ( though details of any problems exposed would not be ) .
This would encourage companies to keep their security measures up to date .
Market incentives will then come into play as organisations that manage data well are favoured over those that do not .
Greater transparency in these three areas would improve security and give people more control over their data without the need for intricate regulation that could stifle innovation .
After all , the process of learning to cope with the data deluge , and working out how best to tap it , has only just begun .
Let me preface this post by reminding folks that IANAL ( I am not a lawyer ) .
The U.S. government policy on photographs and copyright is pretty straightfoward : photos produced by federal employees as part of their job responsibilities are “ not subject to copyright in the United States and there are no U.S. copyright restrictions on reproduction , derivative works , distribution , performance , or display of the work . ”
Why , then , is the Obama White House asserting that no one but “ news organizations ” can use its Flickr photos ?
Why is it asserting that manipulation is prohibited ?
Why is it asserting that photos may not be used in “ commercial or political materials , advertisements , emails , products , promotions that in any way suggests approval or endorsement of the President , the First Family , or the White House ” ?
The “ easy ” answer is that this appears to be a heavy - handed White House response to last month ’s controversy resulting from a billboard that implied the president endorsed The Weatherproof Garmet Co .
The company used an Associated Press photo of the president in one of the company ’s jackets as the basis for a Times Square billboard .
( The billboard came down a few days after it was launched ; the company had intended it to have a two month lifespan . )
Maybe it ’s a response to PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) using an image of First Lady Michelle Obama in an “ anti- fur ” ad .
This also happened in January , I might add .
Or maybe it ’s a ( belated ) response to the furor ( and lawsuit + criminal investigation ) generated by an artist who violated copyright when he modified an AP image into a poster that became an icon for Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Whatever the reason , the assertion of these “ rights ” seems to be in direct contrast to official government policy and is certainly in direct contrast to reasonable expectations by the public , given that the photos are being produced with taxpayer ( ie , public ) money .
Ironically , the same Flickr page that claims ( almost exclusive ) copyright also links to the U.S. copyright policy statement .
And it ’s in stark contrast White House actions in May 2009 , when Wired reported that its Flickr photos had been made “ public domain ” images .
The White House had been using a Creative Commons license , but many had noted that “ government works ca n’t be copyright . ”
Let ’s compare the U.S. stated policy on copyright with the current claims made by the Obama White House .
First , from USA.gov :
A work that is a United States Government work , prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person ’s official duties , is not subject to copyright in the United States and there are no U.S. copyright restrictions on reproduction , derivative works , distribution , performance , or display of the work .
Anyone may , without restriction under U.S. copyright laws , reproduce the work in copies in print or in digital form ;
prepare derivative works of the work ;
perform the work publicly ;
display the work ;
distribute copies or digitally transfer the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership , or by rental , lease , or lending .
Caveats
Other persons may have rights either in the work itself or in how the work is used , such as publicity or privacy rights .
Not all work that appears on US Government Websites is considered to be a US Government work .
Check with the content curator to see whether the work is a US Government Work .
Works prepared for the United States Government by independent contractors may be protected by copyright , which may be owned by the independent contractor or by the United States Government ..
Second , here ’s the language being used on the White House Flickr account — even though the Flickr page links to the USA.gov site that says government photos are , effectively , public domain :
This official White House photograph is being made available only for publication by news organizations and / or for personal use printing by the subject (s ) of the photograph .
The photograph may not be manipulated in any way and may not be used in commercial or political materials , advertisements , emails , products , promotions that in any way suggests approval or endorsement of the President , the First Family , or the White House .
The first thing I did was check to see if the photographer — Pete Souza — was freelancer or staff .
It turns out that he is on leave from Ohio University and is both the official White House photographer and director of the White House photo office .
It would be reasonable to assume that his office was instrumental in crafting the above language .
It would also be reasonable to assume that this policy was implemented after January ’s dual embarrassments .
Here ’s my question : does the White House have the authority to reverse the blanket “ there is no copyright ” policy of the federal government , simply because the President did n’t like his ( non- White House owned ) photo being used in what appears to be an endorsement ?
And is this the only recourse available to the White House to prevent unauthorized use of personal images ?
I do n’t know the answer to the first question ( I ’d like to think the answer is “ no ” ) but there seems to be existing law that protects the Obamas from unauthorized use of images of their persons to imply an endorsement .
As Politico reported in January , New York law protects individuals from unauthorized use of their image for advertising :
A couple of sources , including a New York lawyer who knows the state law on the issue well , say the company ’s on quite thin legal ice , citing section 50 of New York Civil Rights law , which says that “ A person , firm or corporation that uses for advertising purposes , or for the purposes of trade , the name , portrait or picture of any living person without having first obtained the written consent of such person , or if a minor of his or her parent or guardian , is guilty of a misdemeanor . ”
Perhaps the White House reminded The Weatherproof Garmet Co. of the particulars of New York law and succeeded in getting the billboard pulled without having to file a lawsuit .
The PETA “ endorsement ” is not as black - and - white a violation , as Michelle Obama ’s office has publicly confirmed ( May 2009 , June 2009 ) that she does not wear fur , which is what the PETA ad says .
To the White House , I suggest the following change in that ( unenforceable , in my opinion ) copyright claim :
A reminder that photographs may not be used in any manner that suggests approval or endorsement of the President , the First Family , or the White House , whether the endorsement is commercial or political in nature .
It ’s a good reminder .
You could almost call it a public service announcement .
And it ’s certainly less heavy - handed than the questionable language currently in use .

Men At Work had two number one singles in the US The Australian band Men at Work are facing a big legal bill after a court ruled it had plagiarised a Girl Guides ' song in its 1983 hit , Down Under .
Larrikin Music had claimed the flute riff was stolen from Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree , written by Marion Sinclair in 1934 .
The federal court in Sydney ordered compensation to be paid .
That amount has yet to be determined but Larrikin 's lawyer said it could reach 60 % of income from the song .

" It 's a big win for the underdog , " said Larrikin 's lawyer Adam Simpson after the judgment .
Sinclair , who died in 1988 , wrote the song for performance at a Girl Guides Jamboree in 1935 .
Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree has since been sung by generations of Australian schoolchildren .
A costs hearing will take place in late February , with Larrikin seeking 40 % - 60 % of earnings from songwriters Colin Hay and Ron Strykert and record companies Sony BMG Music Entertainment and EMI Songs Australia .
Down Under , first released in 1983 , was used in the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics in 2000 .

It 's the # 1 most common question I get :
My wife , my friend , my mom , my boss , is investing their health or their money in some magical or fraudulent product / scheme / belief .
What can I do about it ?
This is a tough situation to be in .
Whether it's a loved one who 's ill and is being taken advantage of by a charlatan selling a magical cure with no hope of treating the illness , or a friend who 's out of work and is going into deeper debt to buy into a hopeless multilevel marketing plan , it 's really hard to watch .
The hardest is when they have a real problem and are expending their limited resources trying to solve it with a medieval , magic - based system that you know can't possibly help .
But all too often , they think it 's helping .
Cognitive biases , anecdotal thinking , placebo effects and cognitive dissonance combine to build a powerful illusion that our brains are hardwired to believe in .
At some point , it falls to a caring friend to try and rescue them with a candle of reason .
You 're up against a foe who 's far more formidable than you might think .
This is n't like settling a bet with a friend where you can look up the answer on Wikipedia , see who 's right , then buy each other a beer .
You 're going after someone 's religion .
You 're setting out to talk someone out of believing something that they know to be true , for a fact , from their personal experience .
That right there makes your task nearly impossible , but it 's worse .
Their belief has spiritual underpinnings that make it deeply moral and virtuous .
Imagine if someone came to you and flashed a magazine article that said it 's best to turn your children out into the street and never talk to them again .
It 's not only unconvincing , it 's laughable .
Your effort to talk someone out of their belief in their sacred cow is likely to be just as laughable .
So what should you do , give up ?
You may be surprised to hear it from me , but I advise you to do just that , in many cases .
Know which battles to fight .
Weigh the risks .
Consider the context of your friend 's belief :
Is he in imminent danger of harming himself or others ?
Probably not ; and if not , this may not be the time to take what might be your only shot .
So I want to make this a rule : Before you decide what to do , consider the risks and the context .
How terrible are the consequences of your friend 's belief ?
Think that through comprehensively .
Make sure you have a good understanding of the risks to your friend if you do nothing , and the risks to your relationship if you attack their beliefs and ( in all probability ) fail to convince them .
It may well be that this first strategy I 'm going to present is the safest .
Strategy # 1 : Do Nothing
Doing nothing now does n't mean giving up .
When you choose not to confront your friend 's current weird belief , there 's still an effective strategy for helping him out that you can follow .
By accepting and tolerating your friend 's weird belief , you 're actually setting yourself up to be in a position of great influence the next time something weird comes down the line .
Your friend likely knows that you 're a skeptical person , and eventually he 'll recognize that you 've been putting up with his weird belief and saying nothing .
In fact he may someday ask you , " Hey , you know I believe in this weird thing , how come Mr. Cynical Skeptic has never tried to talk me out of it ? "
Ask " Is it important to you ? "
" Yes . "
" You 're important to me . "
Think what a powerful message that sends .
It may sound corny , but it 's a statement that your friend will always remember .
You 've just communicated that your friendship is more important than your " evil debunking hobby " .
You 've made it clear , unequivocably , that you do n't want such differences to come between you .
And now look at the position you 're in .
You 're trusted .
You 're an ally at the most important and fundamental level .
This is exactly where you need to be if you want to be influential on someone .
You can now begin to introduce critical thinking using topics that are more about exploration than confrontation , and this is a journey you should take together .
Next time you 're in the car together , play a few Skeptoid episodes .
Play episodes like The Baigong Pipes , Is He Real or Is He Fictional , The Missing Cosmonauts , and When People Talk Backwards .
Topics such as these do not attack or challenge anyone , they instill an appreciation and a passion for the value of critical thinking .
Once introduced , I find that most people want more .
Gather every bit of skeptical material you can find that you know will interest your friend , and that does not attack or challenge his belief .
So long as you remain a trustworthy friend and not an irrational adversary , you 're in a position to introduce him to the fundamentals of critical thinking , and to the value and tangible rewards of reality .
Do n't underestimate the value of seeds that are well planted in a good environment .
If your friend comes around on his own , his growth is far more complete than any that 's forced upon him .
Always remember the story of the little boy who could n't get his pet turtle to come out of his shell .
He tried to pull on its head , he shook it , he squirted water , he did everything he could think of .
But the turtle would n't come out .
Then his grandfather took the turtle and placed it on the warm hearth , and within a minute the turtle was out of his shell .
The little boy never forgot that lesson .
Strategy # 2 : The Intervention
Sometimes the situation is urgent and you do n't have time to do things the easy way .
There might be a medical crisis , an emotional crisis , or a financial crisis , and an immediate intervention is needed .
Sometimes a friend 's situation is dire enough that helping him is worth the loss of the personal relationship .
In these cases , and probably only in these cases , would I suggest a confrontational approach .
And to do this effectively , draw on the established principals of the counseling intervention .
First you want to gather a group of friends or family , and you need to meet with them separately .
Try to get a group , but even if there are only two of you , it 's worlds better than just you by yourself .
Your next task is to present your evidence to the group that the magical system your friend is relying on is pseudoscientific and cannot help him .
Do not expect them to accept what you say at face value , and do expect that some of them might buy into the magical system as well .
Be prepared .
Show your work .
Print out pages from the web .
Use the Science Based Medicine blog , use Skeptoid , use Quackwatch , use Swift .
Search the best sources and have all your ducks in a row .
The most important thing you need to do at this stage is to be certain that everyone in the group is united in their understanding of the useless , pseudoscientific nature of the magical sacred cow .
Tell the group why you 're concerned about your friend and why the help is urgently needed .
Be prepared to explain why you feel an intervention is warranted .
And this is important :
Do n't merely be prepared to show that the magical sacred cow is useless , you must also have an alternative path — one that is proven to provide the kind of help needed — to suggest to your friend .
Make sure everyone 's in agreement that an intervention is warranted , and that a better alternative path is needed .
If they 're not , only invite those who are to proceed .
The main criticism of counseling interventions is that they are ambushes .
Not only is it just plain wrong to ambush someone , it creates the practical problem of putting your friend on the defensive .
So I do n't propose making it an ambush .
My recommendation , which you may or may not choose to follow , is to call your friend up and say " Hey , Jim - Bob and Bubba and Sally - Sue and I want to come over and talk to you about your cancer , " or your new business , or your psychic friend , or whatever the problem is .
Now , of course , conducting the intervention is up to you .
I feel that trusted friends who can speak knowledgeably about the subject carry more weight than showing the printed - out articles from the web , but leave them for your friend to read .
Anyway , it 's going to be a really crappy hour , it 's not going to be fun for anyone , but with some luck you may just make a big difference in your friend 's life .
He may not love you for it , but the idea 's to help him , not to win brownie points for yourself .
Strategy # 3 : Be There
In some cases , doing nothing may seem too slow , and an intervention may be too harsh and unwarranted .
In these situations I often recommend that you just " be there " for your friend .
Your skeptical cat is probably already out of the bag to some degree , so your friend 's radar is probably already up just waiting for you to launch into him about his sacred cow .
What you may have is an awkward imbalance of a close personal relationship and an ideological divide .
This situation gets thrown on me all the time , when I meet someone , or someone introduces me and has told them what I do , I 'll sometimes get " Oh , you 're that cynical person I 've heard about . "
This is , of course , both wrong and insulting .
I 've gotten this so many times that I 've learned to just swallow it .
But nevertheless , the awkward divide exists , and the best way to handle an awkward situation is to openly acknowledge it .
The wording here is to difficult to get right , but at an opportune moment , you might want to say something like " Hey , I know you 're really into your thing , you know I 'm really into consumer protection , so we have a disagreement .
If you ever want to talk about it , I 'm happy to ; but I do n't want it to be a problem , and I 'm fine with just acknowledging we have a disagreement and leaving it at that . "
The wording that 's hard is declaring your own position .
Consumer protection , critical thinking , things that are proven ; you want to make your point but you do n't want to choose weasel words that sound insulting .
From that point , you can follow the Do Nothing strategy and introduce articles that you know you 'll both appreciate .
This method just fast - tracks it somewhat , in that the door is wide open to discuss your friend 's particular sacred cow at any time .
But unless there 's an imminent risk of harm , I tend to always let the friend bring it up , and I never try to drive the wedge or create a conflict myself .
It 's perhaps ironic that those of us who want to provide actual help , instead of magical or imaginary help , are usually considered the bad guys , and we 're the ones who have to tread lightly .
But that 's the reality of the situation , and we should take extra care to insure that our influence is a positive one .

Rebecca Flint , 14 – aka Beckii Cruel – is an internet hit among anime fans and her debut album is tipped to top Japanese charts
Like most 14 - year - old girls , Rebecca Flint likes to dress up and dance .
But unlike most girls , she records and posts her performances on YouTube .
The results have made her an ­internet phenomenon in Japan , home of the anime cartoon characters she imitates .
More than eight million people have watched Rebecca performing as Beckii Cruel , dancing to bouncy J- pop ( Japanese pop music ) and anime theme songs in the attic of her home on the Isle of Man .
Her success has led publishing giant Tokuma Japan to sign up Beckii , teaming her with 18 - year - old French college student " Sara Cruel " , from Lyon , and a 16 - year - old student from Portsmouth known as " Gemma Cruel " .
The trio – Beckii Cruel and the Cruel Angels – release their debut album in Japan on Wednesday , when it is expected to reach the top of the charts .
Beckii's looks have created a sensation in Japan , where she has become a " moe idol " , a female worshipped for her small face , large eyes and slender limbs , similar to those found in anime characters – the Japanese animation - style heavily influenced by manga comic books .
Anime has a huge following in Japan across all sections of society .
Taro Aso , a former prime minister , is a self - confessed anime obsessive , reading up to 20 comic books a week .
" The perceived virtual existence and borderless nature surrounding Beckii are a catalyst for stirring fantasies , " said Toshiyuki Inoue , an IT journalist , summing up the popularity of moe artists .
Kaori Sakurai , a freelance writer , said that the otaku – anime geeks who worship teenagers like Beckii – will often avoid pretty girls in real life , fearing that they would simply dismiss them .
But they have been won over by Beckii , who appears as just another fan like them .
Beckii's popularity in Japan rocketed after her YouTube videos were picked up by popular Japanese website Niko Niko Douga .
Her Japanese DVD debut , This is Beckii Cruel : Too Cute to be Real , was released last November and debuted at number eight in Japan 's DVD charts .
Beckii , who already features in Japanese TV commercials for chewing gum , performed live for the first time at Akihabara , home of otaku culture in Tokyo , last October .
The daughter of a policeman and a former dance instructor , Beckii first became interested in Japanese cartoons and comics three years ago when she picked up a translated copy of Fruits Basket , a Japanese girls ' manga created by Natsuki Takaya .
Since then , she has been voraciously reading manga and watching anime , while also studying Japanese .
Beckii's idea to film herself in " cosplay " – derived from costume play – followed and an internet star was born .
Hundreds of thousands of Japanese teenagers indulge in " cosplay " , with conventions regularly held around the country .
Tokyo Dome , home of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team , is a regular weekend hangout for teenagers dressed as their favourite anime or manga characters .
At a recent press conference in Japan alongside her father , Derek , Beckii said she was aware that her age and the nature of her videos would attract some unwanted attention .
" I 'm well aware of the dangers of the internet ; my school back home on the Isle of Man is good at educating us on that , " she said .
Beckii has had her own webpage since she was four – her older brother , Ryan had his at six .
Ten years on from setting it up with her father , who says he has educated his daughter on the dangers of the internet , she now has the second most subscribed website among Japanese musicians .
The expectation surrounding the release of her album this week suggests her incredible rise to fame shows no signs of slowing down .

Climate Scientists continue to see persuasive evidence of global warming and climate change when they speak at academic conferences , even though , as Andrew Sullivan rightly put it , the science is being ‘ swift - boated before our eyes . ’
( See also Bill McKibben at Tomdispatch.com on Climate Change ’s OJ Simpson moment ) .
This article at mongabay.com includes some hand - wringing from scientists who say that they should have responded to the attacks earlier and more forcefully in public last fall , or who worry that scientists are not charismatic t.v. personalities who can be persuasive on that medium .
Let me just give my scientific colleagues some advice , since as a Middle East expert I ’ve seen all sorts of falsehoods about the region successfully purveyed by the US mass media and print press , in such a way as to shape public opinion and to affect policy - making in Washington :
1. Every single serious climate scientist should be running a blog .
There is enormous thirst among the public for this information , and publishing only in technical refereed journals is guaranteed to quarantine the information away from the general public .
A blog allows scientists to summarize new findings in clear language for a wide audience .
It makes the scientist and the scientific research ‘ legible ’ to the wider society .
Educated lay persons will run with interesting new findings and cause them to go viral .
You will also find that you give courage to other colleagues who are specialists to speak out in public .
You cannot depend on journalists to do this work .
You have to do it yourselves .
2 . It is not your fault .
The falsehoods in the media are not there because you have n’t spoken out forcefully or are not good on t.v .
They are there for the following reasons :
a . Very , very wealthy and powerful interests are lobbying the big media companies behind the scenes to push climate change skepticism , or in some cases ( as with Rupert Murdoch ’s Newscorp / Fox Cable News ) the powerful and wealthy interests actually own the media .
b. Powerful politicians linked to those wealthy interests are shilling for them , and elected politicians clearly backed by economic elites are given respect in the US corporate media .
Big Oil executives e.g. have an excellent rollodex for CEOs , producers , the bookers for the talk shows , etc. in the corporate media .
They also behind the scenes fund “ think tanks ” such as the American Enterprise Institute to produce phony science .
Since the AEI generates talking points that aim at helping Republicans get elected and pass right wing legislation , it is paid attention to by the corporate media .
c. Media thrives on controversy , which produces ratings and advertising revenue .
As a result , it is structured into an ‘ on the one hand , on the other hand ’ binary argument .
Any broadcast that pits a climate change skeptic against a serious climate scientist is automatically a win for the skeptic , since a false position is being given equal time and legitimacy .
It was the same in the old days when the cigarette manufacturers would pay a ‘ scientist ’ to go deny that smoking causes lung cancer .
And of course we saw all the instant Middle East experts who knew no Arabic and had never lived in the Arab world or sometimes even been there who were paraded as knowledgeable sources of what would happen if the United States invaded Iraq and occupied it .
d. Journalists for the most part have to do as they are told .
Their editors and the owners of the corporate media decide which stories get air time and how they are pitched .
Most journalists privately admit that they hate their often venal and ignorant bosses .
But what alternative do most of them have ?
e. Journalists for the most part do not know how to find academic experts .
An enterprising one might call a university and be directed to a particular faculty member , which is way too random a way to proceed .
If I were looking for an academic expert , I ’d check a citation index of refereed articles , but most people do n’t even know how to find the relevant database .
Moreover , it is not all the journalists ’ fault .
journalism works on short deadlines and academics are often teaching or in committee and away from email .
Many academics refuse ( shame on them ) to make time for media interviews .
f. Many journalists are generalists and do not themselves have the specialized training or background for deciding what the truth is in technical controversies .
Some of them are therefore fairly easily fooled on issues that require technical or specialist knowledge .
Even a veteran journalist like Judy Miller fell for an allegation that Iraq ’s importation of thin aluminum tubes in 2002 was for nuclear enrichment centrifuges , even though the tubes were not substantial enough for that purpose .
Many journalists ( and even Colin Powell ) reported with a straight face the Neocon lie that Iraq had ‘ mobile biological weapons labs , ’ as though they were something you could put in a winnebago and bounce around on Iraq ’s pitted roads .
No biological weapons lab could possibly be set up without a clean room , which can hardly be mobile .
Back in the Iran - Iraq War , I can remember an American wire service story that took seriously Iraq ’s claim that large numbers of Iranian troops were killed trying to cross a large body of water by fallen electrical wires ; that could happen in a puddle but not in a river .
They were killed by Iraqi poison gas , of course .
The good journalists are aware of their limitations and develop proxies for figuring out who is credible .
But the social climbers and time servers are happy just to host a shouting match that maybe produces ‘ compelling ’ television , which is how they get ahead in life .
3 . If you just keep plugging away at it , with blogging and print , radio and television interviews , you can have an impact on public discourse over time .
I could not quantify it , but I am sure that I have .
It is a lifetime commitment and a lot of work and it interferes with academic life to some extent .
Going public also makes it likely that you will be personally smeared and horrible lies purveyed about you in public ( they do n’t play fair – they make up quotes and falsely attribute them to you ; it is n’t a debate , it is a hatchet job ) .
I certainly have been calumniated , e.g. by poweful voices such as John Fund at the Wall Street Journal or Michael Rubin at the American Enterprise Institute .
But if an issue is important to you and the fate of your children and grandchildren , surely having an impact is well worth any price you pay .

Surprise heavy rains have caused flash floods that hit Egypt and Israel
Heavy rains and flash floods have left seven people dead in Egypt and Israel .
Rains washed away mud brick houses in southern Egypt killing two women , and in Israel a woman drowned when her car was caught in a flash flood .
A British tourist was killed when a yacht capsized in bad weather on the Nile , Egyptian police said .
More than a dozen people are still missing in the resort city of Sharm el - Sheik , where one woman was killed and the roof of the airport was damaged .
The holidaymaker , who has not been named , was with three others when their boat overturned in the southern city of Aswan in heavy winds and sudden rain .
Three other tourists , including the man 's wife , an Indian and a Canadian tourist survived the capsize , an Egyptian police spokesman said .
Israel temporarily closed its border crossings with Egypt and Jordan due to the heavy rains , and a bridge collapsed near a cargo crossing between Egypt and Israel .
Flooding also wiped out communication lines in Sharm el - Sheik and destroyed two dozen homes in Ras Sudr .
Flash floods overcame dams in northern Sinai , local officials said , and flood waters are approaching the city of al - Arish , killing one man there .
In the Red - sea port of Hurghada a woman drowned when flooding swept her off the main road .
Five Egyptian ports were closed due to the unpredictable weather .

Editorial : Holster the harpoons till we have the facts
THEY are enigmatic sea monsters – rare , magnificent beasts patrolling the ocean depths .
Yet old chronicles tell of populations of whales hundreds of times greater than today .
Such tales have long been dismissed as exaggerations , but could they be true ?
Have humans killed such a staggering number of whales ?
New genetic techniques for analysing whale populations , alongside a growing archive of fresh historical analysis , suggest so .
Taken together , they indicate that we have got our ideas about marine ecology completely upside down : whales may once have been the dominant species in the world ’s oceans .
This is not simply an academic question .
It matters now more than ever before .
Whale numbers have been recovering slowly since the end of large - scale hunting in 1986 , but this global moratorium is only temporary .
The International Whaling Commission , the club of mostly former whaling nations which maintains the ban , has rules that say it can reconsider hunting a given whale species if its population climbs back to more than 54 per cent of its pre-hunting levels .
Right now , according to IWC estimates , Atlantic humpbacks and Pacific minkes may have recovered sufficiently to put them back in whalers ’ sights .
But , crucially , such decisions rest on the veracity of the IWC ’s estimates of historical whale populations – 54 per cent of what , exactly ?
If the old salts ’ tales of whale abundance are true , it is way too early to be dusting off those harpoons .
Human pressure on whale stocks “ was much earlier , much larger and much more significant than previously thought ” , environmental historian …
About a quarter of the 8.4 million jobs eliminated since the recession began wo n't be coming back and will ultimately need to be replaced by other types of work in growing industries , according to economists in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey .
While the job market is constantly shifting as some sectors fade and others expand , this recession threw that process into overdrive .
Thousands of workers lost jobs as companies automated more tasks or moved whole assembly lines to places like China .

WUWT readers may remember this article :
Watch the Wilkins ice shelf collapse in time lapse animation – looks like ‘ current ’ events to me where mechanisms other than melt were discussed .
It was pointed out that this photo appeared to be showing a stress crack , like the sort you ’d get from a wave .
Melt makes rounded irregular edges , not sharp straight line ones .

Now there ’s a study from Scripps that suggests that long period waves could be a big factor .
Antarctic Ice Shelf Collapse Possibly Triggered by Ocean Waves , Scripps - led Study Finds
Extremely long waves could have initiated 2008 collapse events
Scripps Institution of Oceanography / University of California , San Diego
Depicting a cause - and - effect scenario that spans thousands of miles , a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and his collaborators discovered that ocean waves originating along the Pacific coasts of North and South America impact Antarctic ice shelves and could play a role in their catastrophic collapse .
Image : Joe Harrigan Image : Joe Harrigan
Peter Bromirski of Scripps Oceanography is the lead scientist in a new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that describes how storms over the North Pacific Ocean may be transferring enough wave energy to destabilize Antarctic ice shelves .
The California Department of Boating and Waterways and the National Science Foundation supported the study .
According to Bromirski , storm - driven ocean swells travel across the Pacific Ocean and break along the coastlines of North and South America , where they are transformed into very long - period ocean waves called “ infragravity waves ” that travel vast distances to Antarctica .
Bromirski , along with coauthors Olga Sergienko of Princeton University and Douglas MacAyeal of the University of Chicago , propose that the southbound travelling infragravity waves “ may be a key mechanical agent that contributes to the production and / or expansion of the pre-existing crevasse fields on ice shelves , ” and that the infragravity waves also may provide the trigger necessary to initiate the collapse process .
Peter Bromirski Peter Bromirski
The researchers used seismic data collected on the Ross Ice Shelf to identify signals generated by infragravity waves that originated along the Northern California and British Columbia coasts , and modeled how much stress an ice shelf suffers in response to infragravity wave impacts .
Bromirski said only recently has technology advanced to allow scientists to deploy seismometers for the extended periods on the ice shelf needed to capture such signals .
The study found that each of the Wilkins Ice Shelf breakup events in 2008 coincided with the estimated arrival of infragravity waves .
The authors note that such waves could affect ice shelf stability by opening crevasses , reducing ice integrity through fracturing and initiating a collapse .
“ ( Infragravity waves ) may produce ice - shelf fractures that enable abrupt disintegration of ice shelves that are also affected by strong surface melting , ” the authors note in the paper .
Whether increased infragravity wave frequency and energy induced by heightened storm intensity associated with climate change ultimately contribute to or trigger ice shelf collapse is an open question at this point , said Bromirski .
More data from Antarctica are needed to make such a connection , he said .
In separate research published last year , Bromirski and Peter Gerstoft of Scripps Oceanography showed that infragravity waves along the West Coast also generate a curious “ hum ” - subsonic noise too low for humans to hear ( see Scripps explorations story Earth Sounds from Central America ) .

We saw impressive renders of Notion Ink's Adam last week , along with some speculation , but today we 're getting what 's probably the best look yet at this ambitious play into the tablet space .
Advertisement
The following specs , to be unveiled officially at MWC , are listed as " final " by the folks at Notion Ink .
Take some of it with a grain of salt , as they are grossly incorrect about items like accelerometer and touchscreen ( chart provided by Notion Ink ) :

The Technoholik video , filmed this weekend before the big reveal at MWC , follows here :
What you see in the video is essentially the final build .
The camera position could move , and there was a screen cover removed because it was loose during the demo , but in the end this is the 1080 p tablet Notion Ink will put up against the iPad ( and the multitude of other tablets that arrive this year and beyond ) .
Looks pretty sharp , especially in sunlight , although the trackpad location will definitely take some getting used to .

A few days ago I posted about my plan to use .ghci files for all my projects .
I am now doing so in at least five projects , and it 's working great .
There were two disadvantages : 1 ) every command had to be squeezed on to a single line ; 2 ) some names were introduced into the global namespace .
Thanks to a hint from doliorules , aboutI can eliminate these disadvantages .
Let 's take the previous example from HLint 's .ghci file :
It work's , but it 's ugly .
However , it can be rewritten as : Thenotation allows multi-line input in GHCi .
GHCi also allows full expressions after a .
Combined , we now have a much more readable .ghci file .
During the dot - com boom , it seemed like everyone was a day trader .
After the bust , it was almost a dirty word .
During the housing bubble , day traders were back in force .
Not too long ago it seemed like everyone is a day trader , then once again they all seemed to disappear .
So we ’re left to wonder , can you make money day trading ?
The simple answer is yes .
Of course you can .
You could also go into a casino and make money betting on roulette , but the odds are n’t in your favor .
While you theoretically can make money day trading , even experts debate whether you can consistently make money at it .
Even worse , you typically need tools and larger sums of money than regular investment programs .
The reason you see so many day traders during booms is because when the market is going up , everyone is making money , even day traders .
Since most issues are going up more often than not , day traders who follow the trend tend to make money .
In heavily trending markets it ’s easy to be a “ successful ” day trader .
Unfortunately , when the market turns on them they tend to get crushed .
They keep playing by the rules of a trending market and do n’t know how to function in the new environment .
There is a saying among investors :
Do n’t confuse brains with a bull market .
Day trading looks very appealing when everyone is making money .
At the same time , flipping houses looked like a no-lose proposition during the housing boom .
Now that the bust is here , most of those people have lost all the money they made in the boom and then some .
Ultimately day trading is gambling .
You can win at gambling , but you have to be disciplined , skillful and wise , and even then you might get a run of bad luck that wipes you out .
While it ’s not impossible to make money day trading , there are other less risky ways to make money that are much more likely to work in your favor -- Particularly if you ’re a novice .

( Newser ) – The good news for NBC is that the North American location of this year 's winter Olympics means far less tape - delaying of events than usual ; the bad news is that in an era when Twitter can tell you instantly who won the gold medal , delayed broadcasts annoy audiences more than ever .
That 's especially bad news for the West Coast , which wo n't see any major daytime or primetime event live , the Wall Street Journal reports .
Olympic broadcasters have long depended on tape - delays to get events on the air during primetime in time zones that are often halfway across the world from the games — and NBC says its research shows viewers prefer the delay over events airing at inconvenient times .
Still , NBC says the " vast majority " of events will air live in primetime , and to combat the frustration , it 's posting results instantly to its own website and has staff working around the clock to stop exclusive footage from turning up on YouTube .

US analysts believe they have identified the Chinese author of the critical programming code used in the alleged state - sponsored hacking attacks on Google and other western companies , making it far harder for the Chinese government to deny involvement ...
A freelance security consultant in his 30s wrote the part of the program that used a previously unknown security hole in the Internet Explorer web browser to break into computers and insert the spyware , a researcher working for the US government told the Financial Times .
Chinese officials had special access to the work of the author , who posted pieces of the program to a hacking forum and described it as something he was “ working on ” ...

Michelle
Mone shows off her slim figure after losing an incredible SIX STONE ... by taking ( her own ) diet pills
Posing in a series of figure - hugging dresses , Michelle Mone seems delighted to show off her trim new physique .
Now looking almost as slender as the glamorous models she employs , the bra tycoon boasts she has lost an incredible six stone .
Naturally , however , the newly slim - line millionaireness is not simply flaunting her weight - loss just for the sake it .
In great shape : Michelle Mone plans to model her own underwear range ;
She credits her weight - loss to Trimsecrets
Ever the businesswoman , the 37 - year - old has released these photos as a way of promoting her latest money - making venture .
The entrepreneur , who received an OBE for services to lingerie in the recent New Year Honours List , is launching a new range of slimming pills .
And even though an earlier brand of her tablets was condemned as useless by nutritionists , Mrs Mone is touting herself as the best example of what they can achieve .
A few years ago when her business was in trouble and her marriage was under pressure , she ballooned to a size 22 and weighed almost 18 stone .
Now , with her underwear empire back on track , she is a shadow of her former self - a size 12 who weighs just 11 stone .
Self - conscious :
In her bigger days , with Jennifer Ellison ; at one point Michelle weighed 18 stone
And - as far as her publicist is concerned - there is also no doubt about what has caused her significant slimming - down .
Her firm insisted that the elegant photos of the new - look Mrs Mone could only be published accompanied by a statement saying : ' Michelle owes her weight - loss to Trimsecrets , available from www.trimsecrets.com.'
Mrs Mone , left school in the East End of Glasgow aged 15 , then founded MJM International in the 1990s .
Her Ultimo underwear has been modelled by such beauties as Penny Lancaster , Rachel Hunter , Mel B , Peaches Geldof , Helena Christensen and Jennifer Ellison .
Back to her best :
At 37 , Michelle is now a trim size 12
But Mrs
Mone admitted that when her weight grew out of control , she felt ' desperate ' .
She said : ' I 'd go to photoshoots all the time and see gorgeous models in bras and knickers and they 'd have beautiful bodies .
' I 'd feel fat and ugly standing beside them . '
Then , a few years ago , she tried Trimsecrets , a herbal supplement devised by alternative health expert Jan De Vries , based in Troon in Ayrshire , which claims to suppress appetite .
Impressed , she decided to invest in the company .
Embarassed : With Jordan in 2005 ; Michelle says working with underwear models made her self - conscious
One nutritionist warned they were no better than simple chalk pills while another said : ' There is no magic diet pill .
We should be maintaining our body size through exercise – diet not drugs . '
Now Mrs
Mone is launching a new ' double strength ' version of the supplement .
Dismissing critics , she said last night : ' I do n't see how they can say these things when you look at the amount of weight that I have lost .
' I was fat for 10 years .
Now all the time I get a kick out of feeling great .
I really believe in Trimsecrets .
I would n't put my name to it if I did n't . '
Having a little Sunday talk show fun .
It was reported by Steve Schmidt and others in the McCain camp that Sarah Palin could n't get Joe Biden 's name right and kept calling him O'Biden .
Palin had a reflexive tendency to refer to Biden as " O' Biden , " Schmidt revealed .
He says other people on the campaign staff came up with a solution .
" It was multiple people -- and I was n't one of them -- who all said at the same time , ' Just say , ' Can I call you Joe ? ' ' which she did . "
What 's funny is that she still called him O'Biden at the debate , so there 's that .
So when I heard Dick Cheney do the same thing on ABC's THIS WEEK , I could n't help but laugh for a while .
Cheney :
Of course , O'Biden and -- Obama and Biden campaigned from one end of the country to the other for two years criticizing our Iraq policy .
Biden explained what he meant on MTP when he used the word " success in Iraq " and it's not the way Cheney tries to frame his answer .
When , in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes ,
I all alone beweep my outcast state ,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,
And look upon myself , and curse my fate ,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope ,
Featured like him , like him with friends possess'd ,
Desiring this man's art and that man 's scope ,
With what I most enjoy contented least ;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising ,
Haply I think on thee -- and then my state ,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth , sings hymns at heaven 's gate ;
For thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
We are presented with a depressed point of view , the very attitude and frame - of - mind each of us know intimately .
It 's when we measure ourselves against others that we feel so inadequate .
The " outcast " state springs to mind because suddenly we 're fixated on our lack versus what others seem to possess naturally and have a sheer abundance of .
If only I had Richard 's talents , or Geraldine 's riches , or Samantha 's good looks , or Marko 's confidence . . . then I would be happy !
I know because my mind will often drift into this " sullen " sphere .
Before I met my girlfriend , I believed my luck with women was horrible .
There were so many men who " just had it " ; it was something I could n't define , but I was sure whatever it was I did not have it .
And I deeply resented this about my fate -- I was destined to watch women flock to other men .
When I contemplated my future , I was very much in the mind of Shakespeare 's discontented speaker .
I all alone beweep my outcast state ,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,
And look upon myself , and curse my fate ,
The shift in the speaker 's self - perception is remarkable because it represents the shift that occurs when we stop obsessing about ourselves and turn our thoughts to a loved one .
The shift in the speaker 's self - perception is remarkable because it represents the shift that occurs when we stop obsessing about ourselves and turn our thoughts to a loved one .
The fixed belief I had about my poor luck with women changed when I got a chance to spend a weekend with one woman in particular .
Then my thoughts were set on her - - not myself -- and I was able to hear , if not the " hymns at heaven 's gate " , then maybe the chorus of " Mother of Pearl " by Roxy Music .
The last line of the poem enacts a complete reversal of the first in sense while it mimics the precise meter of the first line in sound .
Between the first and last line , Shakespeare has given us a microcosmic demonstration of the self .
He dramatizes the process of self - reflection -- moving from an embittered , deflated ego to an elated , love - swept self that affirms the Beatles when they sing , " All you need is love / love / love is all you need . "
More writings by the author
of the flux that goes on in the human psyche , and how abruptly self - perception will shift from one extreme to the other .

A local business owner is flabbergasted after a shipment of 30 toy guns for his store was confiscated by ATF agents in Tacoma .
Brad Martin and his son , Ben , sell the Airsoft BB guns from their store in Cornelius where they ’ve been in business for seven years .
The Martins said they buy their stock from Taiwan because the merchandise is less expensive .
But the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives seized a shipment of 30 in October .
That shipment is worth around $ 12,000 and the ATF is promising to destroy the entire shipment .
Special Agent Kelvin Crenshaw said the toys can be easily retro-fitted into dangerous weapons .

Welcome to the Mammoth 2009 Tax Break post .
I am not a tax professional .
My goal in this post is to create summaries and supply links to IRS website pages which have comprehensive information .
To find out if you qualify be sure to check the IRS website ( linked in each area ) , conduct additional research , &/ or speak to a tax accountant .
This list also does not contain every tax deduction .
You may qualify for additional and less - common deductions or credits .
This post is so long that I came up with the following linked table of contents :
Home Tax Credits & Deductions
This year , homebuyers are eligible for some tax credits .
Homeowners will continue to be able to deduct their mortgage insurance .
First - Time Homebuyers – Credit up to $ 8,000
From the IRS Website :
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the first - time homebuyer credit by increasing the credit amount to $ 8,000 for purchases made in 2009 before Dec. 1 .
However , the new Worker , Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 has extended the deadline .
Now , taxpayers who have a binding contract to purchase a home before May 1 , 2010 , are eligible for the credit .
Buyers must close on the home before July 1 , 2010 .
[ Added Nov. 12 , 2009 ]
For home purchased in 2009 , the credit does not have to be paid back unless the home ceases to be the taxpayer ’s main residence within a three - year period following the purchase .
First - time homebuyers who purchase a home in 2009 can claim the credit on either a 2008 tax return , due April 15 , 2009 , or a 2009 tax return , due April 15 , 2010 .
The credit may not be claimed before the closing date .
But , if the closing occurs after April 15 , 2009 , a taxpayer can still claim it on a 2008 tax return by requesting an extension of time to file or by filing an amended return .
News release 2009 - 27 has more information on these options .
Non-First - Time - Homebuyers – Credit up to $ 6,500
For current homeowners buying replacement residences , there is a possible tax credit of up to $ 6,500 .
Though you do not have to have successfully sold your primary residence , the new home does have to be your primary residence and you need to have lived in your current residence for at least 5 consecutive years .
If you are married , then both spouses need to have lived there for 5 consecutive years .
FAQs can be found here .
Unlike the $ 7,500 2008 first - time homebuyer tax credit , which had to be repaid in 8 years , the $ 8,000 2009 homebuyer tax credits do not have to be repaid in most cases .
The biggest cause for repayment is moving within 3 years .
These are designed to get people buying primary residences , but they ’re not meant to encourage flipping or jumping from house to house .
Mortgage Interest Deduction
As in years past , current homeowners can often deduct the interest they paid on their mortgage .
Information about mortgage interest deductions can be found here .
Back to the Table of Contents
Higher Education Tax Credits & Deductions
Tax credits available to people pursuing higher education include the Hope & Life Time Learning Educational Credits , other tuition deductions , and the interest you pay on a qualified student loan ( like mortgage interest ) .
If anyone in your family is in college or even just taking a few courses at a community college , it ’s worth checking to see if you qualify .
This is a big one for us .
Even though Micah ’s almost through with his PhD and not taking classes , we still have to pay enrollment fees while he continues to work on his dissertation and the tuition for his dissertation ( it ’s framed as an independent study taught by his director ) .
It ’s not bad , but we appreciate what help we can get .
In the Fall of 2010 , I ’ll be starting a Master ’s in Library Science , and while I ’m not factoring it in when I weigh the costs of different programs it will make a tax difference to us over the next few years .

Car -Related Vouchers & Deductions
If you purchased a new car this year , whether as part of CARS or not , it ’s possible to get some tax deductions .
CARS program and taxes
The CARS program earlier this year does not affect your federal taxes .
It is treated as a trade - in would be .
The transaction may have been subject to state & local sales taxes .
You can check out the CARS FAQ here .
But any state & local sales or excise taxes you paid should be deductible , see below .
Deduct State and Local Sales and Excise Taxes on New Cars
If you purchased any qualified new car in 2009 , after February 16 , 2009 , you can deduct the state or local sales and excise taxes on the first $ 49,500 ( and depending on your income ) .
Details can be found on the IRS website and there ’s a summary below :
In 2009 , you can deduct the state or local sales and excise taxes imposed on the purchase of a qualified motor vehicle after February 16 , 2009 , and before January 1 , 2010 .
A qualified motor vehicle includes a passenger automobile , light truck , or motorcycle , the original use of which begins with that purchaser and that has a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less .
A qualified motor vehicle also includes a motor home , the original use of which begins with that purchaser .
The amount of tax you are able to deduct is limited to the tax that is imposed on the first $ 49,500 of the purchase price of the vehicle .
The deduction is phased out over a $ 10,000 range that begins when modified adjusted gross income is more than $ 125,000 ( $ 250,000 if married filing a joint return ) .
No deduction is allowed when modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than $ 135,000 ( $ 260,000 if married filing a joint return ) .
The new deduction can be used to increase the amount of your standard deduction or you can take it as an itemized deduction ( if you are not electing to take the state and local general sales tax deduction ) .
Business Use Deductions
If you used your car for un-reimbursed business driving , then you may be eligible to deduct that .
You can either use the IRS ’s calculator based on mileage or use your actual gas / maintenance / ( leasing ) receipts to come up with a number .
If you used the car for personal driving as well , you can only deduct for the business use .
I heard someone say that since she promotes her business wherever she goes ( true ) , she ’ll be deducting all her mileage .
I encourage you to think carefully about whether you ’d like to convince an auditor that you never used the car for anything but business before you decide to deduct all its use .
The IRS page has a lot more important detail to help you figure out whether or not your use qualifies and how to come up with a figure .
Back to the Table of Contents
Other Unreimbursed Business Expenses
If your company made you fly somewhere & did n’t reimburse you , you can deduct it .
Laundry and dry-cleaning you had to do while on a business trip — deductible .
50 % deduction of an unreimbursed business meal .
This has to be done in the itemized deduction section and must reach 2 % of your Adjusted Gross Income ( AGI ) , as must the business use of a car deductions above .
For more info on deducting unreimbursed business expenses see the pertinent IRS page .
Back to the Table of Contents
Making Work Pay Tax Credit
For most people , the Making Work Pay tax credit does n’t mean much at tax time .
Instead , throughout the year you should have received up to $ 400 in small increments your paycheck because your employer withheld less .
For some people who do n’t have withholding adjusted right or who are working multiple jobs , this can change the size of their tax refunds because they had too little withheld .
More information on Making Work Pay can be found at the IRS website , but for people working one job without social security income , pensions , or other special circumstances this will probably be a non-issue .

IRA Contributions – Deductible
Traditional IRA contributions should be listed on your taxes and are , in many cases , deductible .
Roth IRAs should also be included on your taxes , but contributions will be taxed ( and not taxed when withdrawn ) .
The maximum you can contribute to an IRA depends on your age and modified adjusted gross income .
The total you can contribute to any IRA may be divided between the Traditional and Roth IRAs or may be used to fund just one or the other .
For people under 50 years of age at the end of 2009 , the maximum combined IRA contribution is $ 5,000 .
For people who are 50 or older before 2010 , the maximum combined IRA contribution is $ 6,000 .
The maximum deductible contribution to a traditional IRA and the maximum contribution to a Roth IRA may be reduced depending on your modified adjusted gross income .*
The IRS ’s comprehensive IRA information can be found here .
If you are covered by a retirement plan at work , you can find information and tables about how your AGI affects your maximum IRA deduction here .
If you are NOT covered by a retirement plan at work , you can find information and tables about your how your AGI affects your maximum deduction here .
You may continue contributing to a 2009 IRA until April 15th , 2010 .
* From the IRS website : “ This general limit may be increased to $ 8,000 if you participated in a 401 ( k ) plan maintained by an employer who went into bankruptcy in an earlier year .
For more information , see Catch - up contributions in certain employer bankruptcies later . ”

Medical Expenses
If you paid for medical expenses out - of - pocket , you may include them as part of your itemized deduction , provided they meet the right criteria :
A deduction is allowed only for expenses primarily paid for the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness .
Medical care expenses include payments for the diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease , or treatment affecting any structure or function of the body .
The cost of drugs is deductible only for drugs that require a prescription , except for insulin .

Earned - Income Tax Credit
The EIC is available for low - income families , especially those supporting children .
The goal is to avoid taxing people too heavily if they ’re close to the poverty line .
2009 ’s EIC qualification and maximum credit numbers are as follows .
Earned Income and adjusted gross income ( AGI ) must each be less than :
$ 43,279 ( $ 48,279 married filing jointly ) with three or more qualifying children

Charitable Donations & Haiti Relief – Deductible
Donations of cash or property in 2009 ( pledging does n’t count until the year you follow - through ) to 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations ( and some religious organizations which are n’t required to obtain 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status ) can be deducted if you are itemizing your deductions .
Most organizations will display their 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status on their websites and in their materials .
Possible Extension on Charitable Giving
Congress is working on legislation which will make giving to charities through the end of February 2010 deductible on 2009 taxes as well as on 2010 taxes .
The legislation would apply to all charitable giving , but the goal is to give a faster reward to those who give to help Haiti .
Something similar was done in early 2005 after the December 2004 tsunami .
Even if it does n’t pass , donations would still be deductible in a year for 2010 taxes .
And if it does pass , you can hold off on claiming the deduction this year and claim it in 2010 instead ( just not both times ) .
Back to the Table of Contents
Moving Expenses – Deductible if Moving for Work
Did you move for a new job or a transfer ?
Did your company reimburse you ?
If not , then you may be eligible to deduct the cost of moving from your taxes .
There are certain conditions , including the distance of the move .
If you think you ’re eligible , you can check out the details on the IRS website .

Qualified Job-Hunting Expenses – Deductible
This wo n’t help if you ’re changing careers , but if you ’re searching for a new job or if you were just laid off and are hunting for a job in your field , you can deduct certain expenses from your 2009 job search .

In order to deduct job search costs , the expenses must be spent on a job search in your current occupation .
You may not deduct expenses incurred while looking for a job in a new occupation .
You can deduct employment and outplacement agency fees you pay while looking for a job in your present occupation .
If your employer pays you back in a later year for employment agency fees , you must include the amount you receive in your gross income up to the amount of your tax benefit in the earlier year .
You can deduct amounts you spend for preparing and mailing copies of a résumé to prospective employers as long as you are looking for a new job in your present occupation .
If you travel to an area to look for a new job in your present occupation , you may be able to deduct travel expenses to and from the area .

The amount of time you spend on personal activity compared to the amount of time you spend looking for work is important in determining whether the trip is primarily personal or is primarily to look for a new job .

Self - Employment Tax – 50 % Deductible
One of the downsides of certain forms of self - employment is having to pay a self - employment tax .
The good news is that you can deduct 50 % of your self - employment tax when calculating your AGI .
This was something I had not realized until reporting my blog earnings last year and paying the self - employment tax for the first time .
More on self - employment tax from the IRS website ,

Alimony – Deductible
The one good thing about alimony is that it ’s tax - deductible as part of an itemized deduction list .
After all , it ’s not money you get to spend and your ex will be taxed on it instead .
Property and gifts given to an ex-spouse are not tax deductible .
For more information about deducting your alimony , check out the IRS ’s alimony page .
Child support is never deductible .
The child is your responsiblity and therefore it ’s just like any other money you ’d spend to support your child if you were living together .

Energy - Efficient Tax Incentives – Partially Deductible
Make your home more energy - efficient in 2009 ?
Buy a plugin - in vehicle ?
You may be eligible for tax credits .
From the IRS Website :
The new law increases the energy tax credit for homeowners who make energy efficient improvements to their existing homes .
The new law increases the credit rate to 30 percent of the cost of all qualifying improvements and raises the maximum credit limit to $ 1,500 for improvements placed in service in 2009 and 2010 .
The credit applies to improvements such as adding insulation , energy efficient exterior windows and energy - efficient heating and air conditioning systems .
For more information and to check out the other things which qualify as energy - efficient you can visit the IRS website .

Jury Duty Pay Confiscated by Your Employer – Deductible
Jury duty pay must be reported as taxable income .
But some employers will continue to pay you while you ’re on a jury in exchange for the money you were paid for jury duty .
It ’s normally a good trade - off , jury duty pays pennies .
But come tax time , it can be deducted from your gross income so you ’re not taxed on it at all .
If your employer did n’t confiscate it , you ’ll still have to report it as other income and cannot claim it as a deduction .
More info from the IRS website .

Fee for Paying Your Taxes with Debit or Credit – Deductible
And , finally , if you pay your taxes using a credit or debit card , you can deduct the fees for the taxpaying transaction ( not all card fees , just fees for paying your taxes ) from your taxes .
This IRS page has the details .
It would be included with Miscellaneous itemized deductions ( line 23 of schedule A ) .
If your miscellaneous deductions do n’t add up to 2 % of your income ( and therefore are n’t eligible ) , then it ’s probably better to pay using another method .
Back to the Table of Contents
A Word on Itemized Deductions
Many ( but not all ) of the items listed above can only be claimed as deductions if you choose to itemize your deductions .
To be allowable as deductions , they may have to exceed 2 % of your Adjusted Gross Income ( AGI ) .
For medical expenses , it must exceed 7.5 % of your AGI , as mentioned above .
In most cases , it ’s worth looking into all the deductions you may be eligible for , finding out the rules about that each in particular , and then figuring out if you qualify .
The links I ’ve provided to the IRS website may help .
You can also use Google to search for detailed posts about specific deductions .
Just keep in mind that the IRS has the last word and any blogger can be wrong .

A Pakistani Sikh has been beheaded after being kidnapped in the country 's tribal north - west , officials say .
Jaspal Singh was seized while travelling in Khyber district a month ago .
His body was found on Sunday .
Earlier reports that a second kidnapped Sikh , Mastan Singh , had been beheaded are not confirmed , officials now say .
Unidentified gunmen demanded ransoms in both cases .
Sikhs are a tiny minority in Pakistan , but a sizeable community has lived in Khyber for over 200 years .
Khyber and neighbouring Orakzai region - where Mastan Singh was kidnapped - are home to crime syndicates involved in car - jackings and kidnappings and known to have links with extremist groups .
Pressure
Officials in Khyber say Jaspal Singh was among seven
Sikhs travelling in the tribal district a month ago .
He and two others were kidnapped by a group of armed men - four others in the party escaped .
Later , the family of Jaspal Singh received a ransom demand for 20 million rupees ( $ 235,000 ) to be paid by last Saturday .
His body was found when members of his family arrived in the area on Sunday to negotiate his release .
Two other Sikh men still remain in the custody of the kidnappers , officials say .
Mastan Singh was kidnapped from the Bezot area in the neighbouring region of Orakzai one month ago .
There was a ransom demand for his release which was not met , officials said .
Many of the Sikhs in the Orakzai and Khyber regions own businesses or farms .
But the community has come under increasing pressure as the influence of Islamist militants has grown in the area , BBC correspondents say .
Most of them have moved to Peshawar , and further east to cities in Punjab province .
There have been reports that Sikhs in the region have been subjected to jizya - an Islamic tax that is collected from non-Muslims .
When mega blockbuster “ Avatar ” mixes up with famous Hollywood movies then you can imagine some real fun .
Human imagination has unlimited faces and pictures to capture and think about .
Actual development of Avatar started from 1994 , when Cameron started writing an 80 page script of the movie .
The movie was supposed to release after Cameron ’s 1997 movie “ Titanic ” , but according to the director the technology at that time was not yet available to portray his vision of work .
We all loved Avatar , Hangover and other biggest movies from 2009 , but what did we actually learn from those movies ?

In an unusual move , the city of Portland has asked a federal judge to transfer the trial over the death of James P. Chasse Jr. out of state , saying potential jurors in Portland and the Willamette Valley have been tainted by " inflammatory and pervasive media coverage . "

Portland argued in documents filed in U.S. District Court that the trial should be moved to Seattle , Tacoma or Boise .
James
Rice , deputy city attorney , argues that
-- the only other U.S. District Court in the state capable of allowing witnesses to testify by video -- is also not suitable , citing its proximity to Portland .
" This unrelenting judgmental coverage of Chasse 's death in the media over the last three years has inflamed the community against the police and tainted the potential jury pool , " Rice wrote in a 16 - page legal memo filed in court this week .
" The city can't get a fair and impartial jury anywhere in Oregon that has the capability to handle this trial . "
Legal experts say a judge has some discretion .
" The standard is whether it 's convenient for the parties and the witnesses , and whether it's in the interest of justice , " said Juliet Stumpf , associate professor of law who teaches civil procedure at Lewis & Clark Law School .
The city requested oral arguments before U.S. District Judge Garr M. King .
Tom Steenson , the Chasse family attorney , did not return calls , but has until Feb. 1 to file a response .
A trial is set for June 1 .
Some who 've followed the Chasse case say they 're disturbed by the city 's request .
" I think it 's preposterous , unprecedented and an undue burden .
This happened here in Portland ; it should be tried here in Portland , " said Jason Renaud , a friend of Chasse 's who is a volunteer with the Mental Health Association of Portland and is running for a City Council seat .
Chasse , 42 , who had schizophrenia , died in police custody Sept. 17 , 2006 .
An autopsy by the state medical examiner showed he died of broad - based blunt - force trauma to the chest .
Police say they saw him acting oddly and possibly urinating in the street in the Pearl District , and when they approached , he ran .
Police chased Chasse , knocked him to the ground and struggled to take him into custody .
Paramedics called to the scene said Chasse 's vital signs were normal , but jail medical staff refused to book him .
Chasse died as police were driving him to a hospital .
The federal lawsuit contends police used excessive force and failed to provide adequate medical care to Chasse .
The motion for a change of venue includes defendants Chief Rosie Sizer , former Mayor Tom Potter ,
, Officer Christopher Humphreys and Sgt. Kyle Nice .
Rice urges the court to put the " interest of justice " above any inconveniences the move would cause to parties in the lawsuit or witnesses .
Further , Rice blames Steenson for creating a " media climate " that makes it impossible for the city to get a fair trial .
" To a large extent , plaintiff 's attorney has created this situation , " Rice wrote .
Rice submitted to the court print stories , editorials and letters to the editor from The Mercury , Portland Tribune and The Oregonian , as well as online comments and TV coverage , and a DVD of a teaser to a movie being filmed about Chasse called " Alien Boy . "
He wrote that stories , opinion pieces and letters referred to police as " goons " and " thugs , " commentators described police as " beating " Chasse to death and articles addressed Humphreys ' past use - of - force cases that would n't be admissible in trial .
The city hired a legal video specialist to compile the Internet media coverage of Chasse 's death for court review .
Roy Silberstein , president of the Mental Health Association of Portland , on Tuesday vowed to keep the spotlight on the case .
His agency is helping make a documentary film about Chasse , expected to be released after trial .
" Whether Chasse v. Humphreys happens at the federal courthouse in Portland or on the steps of Bhutan , " Silberstein said , " we 'll be there with cameras rolling . "
The city cited the federal trial of former Enron executive Jeffery Skilling , who unsuccessfully argued that he was a victim of vast community bias and his federal trial in Houston should have been moved .
The appellate court , though , said the District Court 's jury selection , " more than mitigated " any prejudice from community bias .
Skilling is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Judges can fashion an extensive jury selection to help avoid biased jurors , attorneys say .
In the Chasse case , the judge has already raised the idea of scheduling jury selection earlier , submitting written questionnaires to jurors , or questioning potential jurors one by one .
Usually , courts do n't decide on venue changes until after the voir dire examination of jurors .
But Rice asks this court to " not rely heavily on precedent " but to make a decision much earlier because of the case 's complexity .
Stumpf said a change of venue is usually sought by a defendant to make the trial more convenient for witnesses and parties to the case .
" But it can be a tool to increase the costs and inconvenience to the plaintiffs , " she said .

A POLICE dog - handler left his two devoted German shepherds to bake to death in the back of his car when he became distracted by paperwork , a British court heard .
The Sun reports Constable Mark Johnson , 39 , was suffering from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder which led him to forget his dogs on June 30 last year , it was said .
He returned to his car to find seven - year - old Jet and Jay - Jay , 18 months , lying dead in the trunk .
RSPCA prosecutor Paul Taylor told Nottingham Magistrates '
Court that " Jet and Jay - Jay suffered excruciating pain when their handler PC Johnson left them in the boot of his private car " .
" PC Johnson 's usual routine would have been to have transferred them to a police vehicle which had an air cooling unit but he did not transfer them and went about his business , " Mr Taylor said ..
" He had some paperwork which needed to be done and by the time he realised what had happened , seven hours had passed and he went out and realised the dogs had died .
" PC Johnson had always been devoted to animals and his dogs in particular - who would have saved his life or got him out of tricky situations on operations in the past .
" I can find no evidence that he harboured any malice towards his dogs or that he would have wished to harm them , but he made an error which nevertheless had fatal consequences for the animals .
" His failure in this case is an aberration of his normal high standards .
However his actions had catastrophic consequences for the two dogs in the car . "
The RSPCA alleges Johnson unnecessarily confined his dogs " in an environment that was detrimental to their wellbeing " .
He denies the charge .
The deaths happened on one of the hottest days of the year , when temperatures reached 29.3C .
Mr Taylor told the court that because dogs cannot sweat , the two German shepherds would have been panting to try to reduce their body heat .
This would have left them severely dehydrated .
Eventually they would have suffered severe kidney damage and cerebral haemorrhage .
The dogs could have died within 20 minutes .

TEMPE , Arizona — As a species of seeming feeble , naked apes , we humans are unlikely candidates for power in a natural world where dominant adaptations can boil down to speed , agility , jaws and claws .
Why we rose to rule , while our hominin relatives died out , has long been a curiosity for scientists .
The study of our human nature encompasses a variety of fields ranging from anthropology , primatology , cognitive science and psychology to paleontology , archaeology , evolutionary biology and genetics .
Representatives of each of these disciplines gathered February 19 - 22 at a workshop , " Origins of Human Uniqueness and Behavioral Modernity , " staged by Arizona State University 's Origins Project to discuss recent advances in their respective fields .
Led by ASU professors anthropologist Kim Hill and paleoanthropologist Curtis Marean , co-organizers of the event , the panel of scientists agreed to adopt a working definition that human uniqueness is the " underlying capacity to produce complexity , " and to think of behavioral modernity as " the expression " of those capacities .
The expression of capacities , Hill and Marean said , can be summed up , namely , as exceptional cognition , culture and cooperation .
Each of the three C's was a topic of focus for the scientists .
One of their goals at the conference was to pinpoint specific markers of these expressions , and then use them to identify the emergence of humans within the paleoanthropological record .
Cognition
The beginning of human cognition , for example , is the result of the development of a larger brain , which can be represented by artifacts — stone tools , weapons — or productions that signify greater abilities for thinking and innovation , said archaeologist and paleoanthropologist John Shea of Stony Brook University .
In addition , although the adaptation of a larger brain may separate humans from their primate relatives , it also came at a cost of increased fuel requirements .
A human brain uses at least 20 percent of an individual 's resting metabolism , said Jean - Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany .
Evidence of early humans ' use of fire could be used to mark how they overcame their energy needs , said primatologist and biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham of Harvard University .
Heat helps free up energy by softening foods , denaturing their proteins and breaking down toxins , Wrangham proposed , which is why cooking may explain human brain size as well as small canine teeth and small guts in comparison to other primates .
By the same token , evidence of coastal adaptation can also mark human activity and a strategy for meeting the brain 's growing energy needs .
Archaeological excavations along the coastline of South Africa , Marean suggested , show that early humans obtained energy - dense foods by adopting a diet of shellfish , which afforded strong nutritional benefits for the brain .
Culture
Accordingly , the researchers discussed how an oversized brain led to culture , a product of thinking and social learning facilitated by language , creativity and innovation .
The passing on of knowledge from generation to generation is metaphorically referred to as a cultural " ratchet effect , " which creates greater complexity of culture over time .
In the wild , a lone human would not be able to survive without culture , explained evolutionary theorist Rob Boyd of University of California , Los Angeles .
" Think about what is necessary to live in Alaska , " he said .
" You ’d need a kayak , a harpoon , a float to not sink .
Nobody invents a kayak .
People learn the proper way to make a kayak from others . "
Additionally , Boyd said culture gives humans a survival advantage that is beyond the capacity of other animals .
" Typical apes live in a particular habitat .
We can make the changes on timescales that are very fast , " he said .
According to Shea , who specializes in ancient use of complex projectile weapons , " it 's easy to imagine how complex projectile technology may have led humans to gain a broad and resilient human ecological niche . "
Cooperation
Whether demonstrated by situations of hunting , foraging , child rearing or migrating , humans with culture , in pursuit of shared goals , had much to gain through cooperation .
Cooperating humans would lead to greater survival , greater reproduction and colonization .
After all , other primates cooperate , said anthropologist Joan Silk of the University of California , Los Angeles , who specializes in reproductive strategies of old - world monkeys .
Communal breeding , for example , reduces stress on bonnet macaques creating greater reproductive success .
Developmental psychologist Felix Warneken of Harvard University added that the social skills of human children include the capacity to look beyond shared intentionality ( monkey see , monkey do ) at an early age .
They show an understanding of others ' beliefs , exhibiting a " theory of mind , " which inspires cooperation .
Describing how field work with the !
Kung people of southern Africa gave her insight into cooperation first hand , Polly Wiessner of University of Utah said hunter - gatherers used gifts as mnemonic devices across human groups and used personal adornment as an advertisement of marriage or social status .
Sequence of causal and timing factors
According to Hill , who has studied hunter - gatherers in South America for nearly 30 years , whether by shell beads , other kinds of gifts or through female transfer , the traits of cognition , culture and cooperation would eventually lead to specializations and government .
Stephen Shennan , a professor of archaeology at University College London , explained that as population size increases , culture increases exponentially : greater contact between human groups leads to much more copying of creative innovations .
Ultimately , the exponential cultural ratchet effect is demonstrated by humans ' domination of the world today , said Hill and Marean , who collected proposals from the gathered researchers for a possible flowchart and eventual timeline .
The proposals will be posted to a group Web site for further discussion .
In closing the workshop , Hill said , " Only by working together are we able to fully account for the emergence and timing of unique features of Homo sapiens and how humans , evolved through natural processes , resulted in a spectacular anomaly among living species . "

DAKAR , Senegal  Armed with guns , machetes , torches , and bows and arrows , Christian and Muslim antagonists in central Nigeria ’s religiously volatile city of Jos have been fighting for three days in sporadic clashes that have left dozens dead , witnesses and local news accounts said Tuesday .
It was difficult to ascertain the precise toll in Jos , the scene of frequent religious violence over the past decade .
Estimates ranged from 30 to 300 deaths , as the city was still consumed by mayhem Tuesday evening , with security forces descending on Jos in an attempt to contain it .
Gunshots could be heard throughout the city , and smoke from burning buildings was visible everywhere , witnesses said .
“ This morning there was smoke , and a lot of shooting by the military personnel , ” said Shimaki Gad Peter , director of the League for Human Rights , which is based in Jos , in a telephone interview .
The violence began Sunday when Muslim youths attacked a church , according to Mr. Peter , “ and they were resisted by church members . ”

You 're selling the latest version of a smartphone in used condition using a 10 - day duration .
You select a starting price of $ 199 , with a Buy It Now price of $ 400 , and you offer free shipping .
You 've already used your allocation of zero insertion fee listings this month , and you are meeting our performance expectations .
The item sells immediately for the Buy It Now price of $ 400 .
Since you are n't charging the buyer for shipping or any other costs , $ 400 is the total amount of the sale .

Each step in life is colorful and interesting .
Life is exciting ; and full of coincidences .
Some very minor , but at times – very amazing .
Here is a list of 15 of the most astonishing and incredible coincidences .
1. Historical Coincidence
The lives of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , two of America ’s founders .
Jefferson designed the Declaration of Independence , showing drafts of it to Adams , who ( with Benjamin Franklin ) helped to edit and hone it .
The Continental Congress sanctioned the document on July 4 , 1776 .
Amazingly , both Jefferson and Adams died on the same day , July 4 , 1826 – exactly 50 years from the signing of the Declaration of Independence .
2. Hotel Discovery
In 1953 , television reporter Irv Kupcinet was in London to attend the enthronement of Elizabeth II .
In one of the drawers in his room at the Savoy he discovered some items that , by their identification , owned by a man named Harry Hannin .
Coincidentally , Harry Hannin – a basketball star with the famed Harlem Globetrotters – was a good friend of Kupcinet ’s .
But the story has yet another twist .
Just two days later , and before he could tell Hannin of his lucky discovery , Kupcinet received a letter from Hannin .
In the letter , Hannin told Kucinet that while staying at the Hotel Meurice in Paris , he found in a drawer a tie – with Kupcinet ’s name on it .
3. Taxi
In 1975 , while riding a moped in Bermuda , a man was accidentally struck and killed by a taxi .
One year later , this man ’s brother was killed in the very same way .
In fact , he was riding the very same moped .
And to stretch the odds even further , the very same taxi driven by the same driver – and even carrying the very same passenger struck him !
4. Golden Scarab
From The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche : “ A young woman I was treating had , at a critical moment , a dream in which she was given a golden scarab .
While she was telling me this dream I sat with my back to the closed window .
Suddenly I heard a noise behind me , like a gentle tapping .
I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the windowpane from outside .
I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in .
It was the nearest analogy to the golden scarab that one finds in our latitudes , a scarabaeid beetle , the common rose - chafer ( Cetonia aurata ) which contrary to its usual habits had evidently felt an urge to get into a dark room at this particular moment .
I must admit that nothing like it ever happened to me before or since , and that the dream of the patient has remained unique in my experience . ”
– Carl Jung
5. Revenge Killing
In 1883 , Henry Ziegland broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who , out of distress , committed suicide .
The girl ’s enraged brother hunted down Ziegland and shot him .
Believing he had killed Ziegland , the brother then took his own life .
In fact , however , Ziegland had not been killed .
The bullet had only grazed his face , lodging into a tree .
It was a narrow escape .
Years later , Ziegland decided to cut down the same tree , which still had the bullet in it .
The huge tree seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with dynamite .
The explosion propelled the bullet into Ziegland ’s head , killing him .
6 . Twins
The twin brothers , Jim Lewis and Jim Springer , were separated at birth , adopted by different families .
Unknown to each other , both families named the boys James .
Both James grew up not knowing of the other , yet both sought law - enforcement training both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry , and each had married women named Linda .
Both had sons , one of who was named James Alan and the other named James Allan .
The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women – both named Betty .
And they both owned dogs which they named Toy .
7. Book Find
In 1973 , actor Anthony Hopkins agreed to appear in “ The Girl From Petrovka ” , based on a novel by George Feifer .
Unable to find a copy of the book anywhere in London , Hopkins was surprised to discover one lying on a bench in a train station .
It turned out to be George Feifer ’s own annotated ( personal ) copy , which Feifer had lent to a friend , and which had been stolen from his friend ’s car .
8. Photographic Coincidence
A German mother who photographed her infant son in 1914 left the film to be developed at a store in Strasbourg .
In those days some film plates were sold individually .
World War I broke out and unable to return to Strasbourg , the woman gave up the picture for lost .
Two years later she bought a film plate in Frankfurt , over 100 miles away , to take a picture of her newborn daughter .
When developed the film turned out to be a double exposure , with the picture of her daughter superimposed on the earlier picture of her son .
Through some incredible twist of fate , her original film , never developed , had been mislabeled as unused , and had eventually been resold to her .
9. Mystery Monk
In 19th century Austria , a near - famous painter named Joseph Aigner attempted suicide on several occasions .
During his first attempt to hang himself at the age of 18 , a mysterious Capuchin monk interrupted Aigner .
And again at age 22 , the very same monk kept him from hanging himself .
Eight years later , he was sentenced to the gallows for his political activities .
But again , his life was saved by the interference of the same monk .
At age 68 , Joseph Aigner finally succeeded in suicide , using a pistol to shoot himself .
Not surprisingly , the very same Capuchin monk – a man whose name Aigner never even knew , conducted his funeral ceremony .
10 . Falling Baby
In 1930s Detroit , a man named Joseph Figlock was to become a remarkable figure in a young ( and , apparently , incredibly careless ) mother ’s life .
As Figlock was walking down the street , the mother ’s baby fell from a high window onto Figlock .
The baby ’s fall was broken and Figlock and the baby were unharmed .
A year later , the selfsame baby fell from the selfsame window , again falling onto Mr. Figlock as he was passing beneath .
Once again , both of them survived the event .
11 . Royal Coincidence
In Monza , Italy , King Umberto I , visited a small restaurant for dinner with his adjutant , General Emilio Ponzia - Vaglia .
When the owner took King Umberto ’s order , the King discovered that he and the restaurant owner were virtual doubles , in face and in build .
Both men started talking about the outstanding resemblance between each other and found many more similarities .
a) Both men were born on the same day , of the same year , ( March 14th , 1844 ) .
b ) Both men had been born in the same town .
c ) Both men married a woman with same name , Margherita .
d ) The restaurateur opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto was crowned King of Italy .
e ) On the 29th July 1900 , King Umberto learnt that the restaurateur had died that day in a mysterious shooting accident , and as he expressed grief , an anarchist in the crowd then shot him dead .
12 . Poe Coincidence
In the 19th century , the famous horror writer , Egdar Allan Poe , published a book called ‘ The narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym ’ .
It was about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they determined to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker .
Some years later , in 1884 , the yawl , Mignonette , foundered , with only four survivors , who were in an open boat for many days .
Soon enough the three senior members of the crew killed and ate the cabin boy .
The name of the cabin boy was also “ Richard Parker ” .
13 . Twin Deaths
In 2002 , Seventy - year - old twin brothers expired within hours of one another after separate accidents on the same road in northern Finland .
The first of the twins died when he was hit by a lorry while riding his bike in Raahe , 600 kilometers north of the capital , Helsinki .
He died just 1.5 km from the spot where his brother was killed .
“ This is simply a historic coincidence .
Although the road is a busy one , accidents do n’t occur every day , ” police officer Marja - Leena Huhtala told Reuters .
“ It made my hair stand on end when I heard the two were brothers , and identical twins at that .
It came to mind that perhaps someone from upstairs had a say in this , ” she said .
14 . Poker Luck
In 1858 , Robert Fallon was brutally killed , an act of vengeance by those with whom he was playing poker .
Fallon , they claimed , had won the $ 600 pot through jockeying .
With Fallon ’s seat empty and none of the other players eager to take the now unlucky $ 600 , they got a new player to take Fallon ’s place and hazarded him with the dead man ’s $ 600 .
By the time the police made it to inspect the killing , the new player had quadrupled the $ 600 into $ 2,200 in winnings .
The police called for the original $ 600 to pass on to Fallon ’s next of kin – only to find out that the new player turned out to be Fallon ’s son , who had not seen his father in seven years !
15 . Childhood Book
While American novelist Anne Parrish was surfing local bookstores in Paris in the 1920s , she discovered a book that was one of her childhood favorites – Jack Frost and Other Stories .
She took the old book and showed it to her husband , telling him of the book she tenderly remembered as a child .
Her husband picked up the book , opened it , and on the flyleaf found the dedication : “ Anne Parrish , 209 N. Weber Street , Colorado Springs . ”
It was actually Anne ’s very own book !
Editor 's note :
This story has been corrected to reflect that the Michigan Marijuana Chamber of Commerce has not met with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration about the event .
Ypsilanti Township will play host to what 's being billed as the nation ’s largest cannabis competition next month .
The inaugural “ Caregiver ’s Cup ” Â invites medicinal marijuana growers to bring their buds to the Ann Arbor Marriott Ypsilanti at Eagle Crest Jan. 30 - 31 .
They 'll have the opportunity to be crowned the best pot grower by certified patients prescribed to use medicinal marijuana .

They are two of the organizers of the Caregiver 's Cup .
Tom Perkins | For AnnArbor.com
Organizers with the Michigan Marijuana Chamber of CommerceÂ expect nearly 30,000 guests throughout the weekend .
They 're using the competition to raise public and political awareness on the recent legalization of medicinal marijuana in the state . Â
They say that while legalization of the plant is a positive development , the industry burgeoning around it needs greater oversight .
“ There are so many gray areas in the law that there needs to be greater regulation , ” said Darrell Stavros , director of corporate sponsorship for the MMCC .
“ There have been caregivers who are taking advantage of patients . ”
Under the law , patients have the written approval of a doctor to use the plant for reliefÂ from cancer , multiple sclerosis , paraplegia or other medical conditions .
Caregivers are those licensed by the state to grow up to 12 plants for up to five patients .
But no oversight agency checks on where or how they grow the plant , which Stazros calls one of the problems .
StavrosÂ said the product suffers and safety risks increase if plants are grown in poor conditions by people uneducated in the process , leaving room for abuse of the law .
Anyone who does n't have a drug - related felony can complete a course and become a caregiver .
“ If you ’re in a neighborhood , would you want your neighbor ’s house full of weed ?
Probably not , but that ’s what ’s going on , ” Stavros said .
“ We are 100 percent pro-marijuana , but we do need to think there needs to be regulations involved . ”
The MMCC envisions designated growing zones where caregivers can grow their plants , while keeping them all in one spot to improve oversight .
It would also allow authorities to keep tabs on who is growing the plants .
StavrosÂ cited an example of a 55 - year - old Detroit woman who allowed a 21 - year - old man to be her caregiver .
The man promised to provide her with her medicine , but instead began demanding money and sex for it .
“ Situations like that happen all the time , and that ’s where there needs to be regulations on caregivers , ” he said .
“ Things like that should n’t be happening . ”
While discussion on the medicinal marijuana industry and how to shape it is one major component of the weekend , the competition is the big draw .
The 100 caregivers entering the contest are asked to provide 2.5 ounces of marijuana to the panel of 140 judges .
They 'll ingest , smoke or vaporize the pot in designated areas in or outside the hotel that are open only to patients .
Judges will be grouped according to their recognized illness , with the purpose of allowing doctors to examine them and ask questions about the effects .
Anthony Freed , executive director of the MMCC , said that 's unprecedented in this type of venue .
“ These questions are going to be asked and , with a little research , are going to be answered , ” he said .
“ It seems like such an inconsequential thing , but we can say for the first time physicians will be working one - on - one .
When you think about it , that ’s a big step away from where we were 12 or 24 months ago . ”
The information collected will be used to research the medical benefits of the plants and for pharmaceutical development .
Freed and Stavros expect the crowd to include a strange blend of tie - dye and suit - and - tie types .
Stavros said one prominent state Republican legislator may announce his candidacy for the U.S. Senate , but declined to say who .
The organizers are also working carefully to ensure law enforcement is on board .
The MMCC is soliciting support for the event from local and federal law enforcement officials .
Organizers are hoping some law enforcement officials will agree to be part of a panel discussion .
Â A meeting with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has not occurred , as earlier reported on AnnArbor.com .
Rich Isaacson , a representative from the DEA , said his agency does not typically meet with groups like the MMCC because marijuana is still illegal under federal law .
Â “ Our main point is we certainly are not supporting this initiative in any sense , ” he said .
Â “ In fact , marijuana is still a schedule 1 drug in the eyes of the federal government so that ’s the furthest thing we would be supportive of . "
Roughly 50 vendors will be on hand , and the weekend is filled with seminars on everything from hydroponics to accounting .
Freed and Stavros have invited politicians at all levels and are framing the event as more of a jobs fair , as they believe the economic impact of the industry ’s growth in the community could be significant .
“ One of our goals is making politicians realize that someone is going to do it , and if it ’s you , there is a financial windfall , ” Freed said .
Entry for two days is $ 25 and one day is $ 15 .

The pestering overlords have been repelled .
The despots of do - gooderism bested .
The phony saviors of proles and plebs are dazed and confused .
They ’ll be back for more , of coursevery soon .
But for the beleaguered , a fleeting respite .
Not so long ago , those of you who opposed nationalizing health care were accused of promoting death and sedition — or even worse , selfishness .
Today , Democrats are calling for patience and dialogue .
What ’s changed ?
The solution ?
The problem ?
Nah .
Principles ?
Those cheap things ?
The only thing more flexible than a political conviction is an Obama campaign promise .
For a case study on malleable values , take Colorado ’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet .
In December , CNN host John King asked him if “ every piece of evidence tells you , if you support that bill , you will lose your job , would you cast the vote and lose your job ? ”
Our hero answered , “ Yes . ”
The senator even commemorated his own gutsiness via press release .
He then voted for the Senate health care bill — a surprise to no one .
Well , this week , the political world , as it tends to , was upended .
And only hours after the president capitulated to the will of voters and called for a slowdown , Bennet — by mere happenstance , no doubt — chimed in that , you know what , he too believed Congress should slow down .
The voters of Massachusetts “ did n’t just elect a senator , ” he explained , “ they sent a message to Washington that I have heard all across Colorado . ”
Why , one might wonder , would a senator — willing to pass reform even if Colorado voters objected only a month ago — give one whit about the message sent by the Bay State or the Square State ?
Not very long ago , this guy was willing to lose his job , no matter what the consequences .
Coloradans might be telling Bennet something .
They may not .
They may be telling him something else completely tomorrow .
But , if left to him , Coloradans would have the federal government making their most private choices .
If it were up to Bennet , his constituents would be busy paying off dubious debts to Nebraska , Louisiana , California , unions — and anyone else clever enough to get their kickback .
Which makes the rest of Bennet ’s platitudinous non-sequitur even more curious .
The senator pledges to “ continue to fight against the backroom deals and special interest handouts ” and hopes “ the rest of Washington will join me . ”
Join him ?
This would be tricky if you bear in mind that Bennet has done absolutely nothing to fight backroom deals or special interest handouts .
The very bill Bennet staked his Senate seat on — by his own admission — is loaded with shady handouts .
Presumably by “ fight , ” Bennet meant that he once grumbled about the ugly process on the Senate floor .
When I asked a Bennet spokesperson how the senator had stared down evil in Washington and lived to tell about it , she explained that he “ was the first Senate Democrat to call out the deal struck on health care reform in December , to which a number of others followed and arguably led to a request that the deal be removed from the bill . ”
Arguable , indeed .
After all , using this logic , one could point out that Bennet ’s complaints followed a few dozen Republicans .
Was the GOP fighting special - interest handouts ?
Did Bennet join them ?
Bennet , like many others , had a magnificent opportunity to demonstrate independence by voting “ no ” on government - run medicine .
Bennet had a chance to overcome his ethical misgivings regarding transparency and fishy deals then .
Now , however , he is about political survival — the real message taken from Massachusetts .
The interesting thing about political grandstanding is that the neighborhood you pick to do it in better be one you ’re prepared to live in for a long while .

[ Jan. 11th , 2010 | 01:54 am ] wtf ?
that 's sexist !
wtf_sexism
[ rawkenr0ll ] let 's talk about this article .
it is best summarized as such : " wahhh , girls and gays are ruining science fiction by making less shit blow up and now cancer will never get cured and teleportation will never be invented !
1!11 !!!!
one !!11 !!" . i'm not even fucking kidding .
let 's dissect some direct quotes :
Science fiction traditionally is about men doing things , inventing new technologies , exploring new worlds , making new scientific discoveries , terraforming planets , etc .
READ : " Because it has been this way , it must continue to be this way forever and ever !
Because things that exist are always perfect and change is WRONG . "
Many men working in the fields of science , engineering , and technology have cited science fiction ( such as the original Star Trek ) for inspiring them when they were boys to establish careers in these fields ...
The current generation of boys will not have this inspiration from science fiction , at least from science fiction on television and in movies .
READ : " Since less shit is blowing up , BOYS WILL HATE SCIENCE . "
... the Sci-Fi channel became increasingly feminized losing many of its traditional male viewers in an attempt to go after women viewers .
READ : They wanted to gain popularity among all viewers instead of just half their potential viewing audience , and I will give you no statistics to prove that they lost viewers at all or that they failed in attracting a female audience that may have even surpassed the amount of male viewers they may have lost .
I WON'T GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION , THOUGH , BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL , AND THIS ARTICLE IS MASTERPIECE OF BIASED NONSENSE .
While the original series had its problems , it was more standard science fiction with men doing and accomplishing things .
The new series instead had lots of relationship drama , men whining , and men generally unable to find their way out of a wet paper bag .
READ : " if people have emotions , MEN CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THINGS .
LIKE BLOWING SHIT UP . "
This season three gay characters will be added to various shows on “ Syfy ” , one of which will be part of a “ communal marriage ” with “ heterosexual and homosexual couplings ” .
This will mean less programming where men actually do things and more relationship drama , driving away even more men from the channel .
READ : " This season three gay characters will be added to various shows on " Syfy " ...
This will mean less programming where men actually do things ... "
I honestly do n't even have to change these sentences to prove that this guys thought processes are flawed .
His honest - to - God , directly - quoted logic is , " if people are gay , man wo n't do things . "
Slash fiction is a form of fan fiction written primarily by women where characters in science fiction TV shows are gay and have homosexual relationships completely contrary to the established canon of the show .
READ : " Girls write stories about faggots that are obviously lies , because all characters on TV , like people in real life , are straight until proven otherwise !
If a man has sex with a women , or talks about it , or thinks about it , even one time , or even not at all , we must assume that this person is straight because they have never proven that they are n't , so crazy fangirls lie about them and slander their good name with slash fiction ! "
Of course the BBC gave Davies another show called Torchwood which is basically close to being “ slash fiction ” on television .
READ : " Gays ?
On my sci-fi TV shows ?
I will discredit this man 's entire career and bunch him in with amateur authors because he dares write about people like himself !!! "
Given that this is the BBC , all of this nonsense that alienates men for the benefit of women should n’t be surprising .
READ : " Catering to the desires of women !?
Are you kidding !?
We men need our television !
How dare you make it something other people would enjoy !
This is an outrage ! "
What has happened is that science fiction on television has for the most part become indistinguishable from most other television shows which are written for women filled with moronic relationship drama .
READ : " Anything interests other than my own are stupid , nah nah nah poo poo . "
And the the kicker , wherein the author attempts to make his argument a social issue and not just a self - indulgent bitchfest about how he does n't get to see enough explosions :
As we know science fiction has inspired boys to pursue careers in science , engineering , and technology as men .
With women killing science fiction on television , the current generation of boys wo n’t have this opportunity to be inspired to work in these fields .
However , many boys who would have gone on to make scientific discoveries and invent new technologies will not do so since they will never be inspired by science fiction as boys .
READ : " If boys do n't invent things , NO - ONE WILL !
AND THEN THE WORLD WILL END AND NO - ONE WILL EVER CURE CANCER OR INVENT LAZER GUNS THAT GO 'VEW VEW ' OR TELEPORTATION AND WE'LL NEVER MEET ALIENS BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER BUILD SPACESHIPS !
THE POTENTIAL FEMALE VIEWERS THIS CHANNEL BROUGHT IN AND INTRODUCED TO GENRE COULD NEVER INVENT THESE THINGS , BECAUSE GIRLS AND QUEERS ARE USELESS !
DON'T YOU WANT LASER GUNS AND NO MORE CANCER !? DON'T YOU ? "
pretty epic , honestly .
his fucking logic , omg .
Philippa Willitts writes about the treatment of women in the legal system compared to men , in relation to the conviction of Amanda Knox in Meredith Kercher ’s murder .
Amanda Knox has been convicted of the murder of Meredith Kercher , and if you were n’t paying attention , you might believe that she did it alone .
In fact , two men have also been convicted of the murder – one last night and one last year , but they are very much secondary to the story , even though , as far as I can tell , it has never been decided who did the actual killing .
Now , I have not studied the trial or the evidence , and I do not know whether Amanda Knox did or did not kill Meredith Kercher , but I do know that this is seeming to be another legal case where the woman involved is demonised to a degree rarely seen in male defendants .
And the fact that Amanda Knox appears to be a young woman with some confidence in her sexuality has certainly worked against her .
That she had condoms and a vibrator in a see - through bag has been widely reported , as some kind of proof that she was deranged enough to kill her housemate in a sex game .
That her nickname is Foxy Knoxy has been repeatedly mentioned , though very few reports tell you that that nickname apparently came about due to her skills on a football field rather than anything more salacious .
Because that would n’t fit the story quite so well .
With the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham , Maxine Carr has arguably been more slated by the press and public than Ian Huntley , who actually killed the girls .
Maxine Carr ’s crime was to lie to the police by giving Huntley an alibi , and there is no indication that she did so with any knowledge of what he had done .
Amanda Knox even got a longer sentence than Raffaele Sollecito , who was also convicted of Kercher ’s murder .
Issues which seem to have been used against Knox during the trial are so telling about what women are still up against compared to men in these situations .
1 . There was a youtube video showing her drunk .
2 . She sent an email to a friend saying she had had sex on a train .
3 . She wrote a story about a woman being raped and a photo of herself with a machine gun entitled ‘ the Nazi ’ .
4 . She did cartwheels in the police station while waiting to be questioned .
Now , while the third of these is certainly questionable , and the fourth somewhat odd , the first two are unremarkable , and are in no way legal evidence for murder .
According to the Guardian ,
Italians shrug off extramarital sex , yet they are prim in their attitudes to premarital sex , at least outside the stable context of fidanzamento ( engagement ) .
They use the same words for boyfriend and fiance .
So many were taken aback to learn that , by the time she was arrested at the age of 20 , Knox had had sex with seven men .
They were less outraged by how this information was obtained : Knox was told in prison she was HIV - positive and asked to write a list of her lovers .
Before she was told that a mistake had been made , the list was passed to investigators , one of whom passed it to a journalist .
The ethics around that ‘ mistake ’ are appalling , particularly if it was a tactic to obtain information about her sexual history to use against her during the trial .
Amanda Knox may or may not have committed this murder , and I certainly do not know whether she did .
However , two men have also been convicted and rarely even mentioned .
That Knox is a woman , and a woman with some sexual history , appears to have damned her .
Green Dragon ???
Like to get high ?
Tired of coughing shit out of your lungs ?
Wanna save money ?
Some pot smokers feel this way , but they 're turned off by the idea of cooking with pot for several reasons .
First of all , you can accidentally get too stoned and become paranoid .
This is because digesting food takes a long time , so at first you 'll think you 're not stoned enough , eat some more " special brownies , " and then later on it's too late and you have to go through a scary experience .
Nobody has ever died from a marijuana overdose , scientists cannot prove that it causes brain damage , and it 's unknown whether long - term heavy use has permanent effects ( see Erowid.org for more info ) .
Despite marijuana being a relatively safe drug , it 's still not very fun to accidentally get too stoned .
Another reason smoking is preferred : many people say that eating pot is a " different " experience , which is a polite way of saying " not as good " because these people usually choose to smoke it instead .
When the effects come on more quickly , like taking a hit off a bong , this can be a better high .
In other words , some people like to get really fucked up really fast !
Also , food might not deliver all of the psychoactive substances in pot .
And quite simply , some people just do n't like the taste of pot , or they like the feeling and social aspect of smoking something .
A green dragon soda can almost offer everything that pot smokers like , without the smoking part .
" Green dragon " is essentially a marijuana extract .
It 's a quick , controlled way to get high without tasting pot or putting carcinogens into the lungs .
Compared to other marijuana drinks , it 's relatively compact and easy to carry around in public , and it can be added to any type of drink or food .
If you make a large batch and strain out the weed , then you 'll know exactly how strong it is after the first sample .
Another advantage of green dragon : you wo n't smell like pot !
On an empty stomach you 'll reach a peak high at about 60 to 90 minutes , whereas a toke or a bong hit takes about 15 to 45 minutes to peak .
Stove Method
Supplies : Cooking pot , mug or measuring glass , candy thermometer , fork , coffee filter paper , rubber band , and a drinking cup .
Ingredients : 1 fluid ounce citrus extract ( lemon , lime , or orange ) and ½ gram of weed .
Cooking with alcohol is a fire hazard , but this is a less - dangerous variation using a water bath .
Never do this when you 're already stoned .
Always have good ventilation because concentrated alcohol vapors can explode !
The amount of pot shown here would work for most regular stoners if it's a high - grade marijuana ( " chronic " ) .
You would most likely get high enough that you would n't be disappointed , but not quite high enough that you would get a panic attack .
No guarantees , so each person has to experiment and figure out the right amount .
Somebody who has not been high in a really long time would be very sensitive , so they would need to use less pot or use cheaper stuff ( " schwag " ) .
A total pot - head would need to use more pot .
" Green dragon " is made with very - concentrated alcohol because the cannabinoid compounds ( the stuff that gets you high , including THC ) do not dissolve in water , but they do dissolve well in alcohol .
Everclear is ideal , but this is not available in some states .
For large batches , use liquor with the highest alcohol content that is available .
The more alcohol , the easier it is to extract the cannabinoids .
For small batches , citrus extracts are ideal because they have a high alcohol content ( 80 - 90 % ) , and they taste good when added to a drink .
Mint extract also has a high alcohol content but it 's incredibly gross to drink .
Rubbing alcohol or methyl alcohol will both make you go blind ( it 's not a myth ! ) , so nobody uses those .
Cannabinoids are also fat - soluble , but oils and fats take longer to digest , and it's kind of gross to drink vegetable oil , unless it is so concentrated that you can take a few drops under the tongue ( sublinguilly ) .
Step 1 : Microwave * dry * weed on medium 3 x 20 seconds with cooling time in between .
This converts THCA ( inactive ) to THC ( active ) .
This process is known as " decarboxylation . "
Do not put any alcohol into the microwave because that would be dangerous .
A common question : how much to microwave ?
Over -cooking may result in THC vaporization ( that 's bad unless you 're inhaling ) .
As a general rule , the decarb is complete when the weed is crunchy , but the plate should not be too hot to touch .
Here are some educational links about decarboxylation :
http://cannabisculture.com/articles/3037.html
http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/Library/studies/ledain/ldc2b.htm
[ ctrl ] + [ F ] and search for " THCA "
Step 2 .
Fill the cooking pot with a couple inches of hot tap water and place on a burner .
The water helps control the heat so that the temperature does n't change too fast .
And if you accidentally bump and spill the whole thing , it can help prevent a fire .
Remove any seeds .
Add the weed and extract into the mug or measuring cup , then clip the candy thermometer on the inside of the container so that the bulb is touching the bottom .
Place mug or measuring cup in the center of the cooking pot .
Step 3 .
Turn on the burner and set the heat to a low setting ( light the flame first if you 're using a gas stove ) , and watch the temperature slowly climb .
Carefully adjust the flame or electricity to keep the solution between 160 ºF and 165 ºF and maintain this for 20 minutes .
Ethyl alcohol boils at 173 ºF at sea level , so the candy thermometer helps to avoid an accidental boil - over .
If you see the alcohol boiling a little , then back off the heat a little .
This happens when the solution is heated unevenly .
You can fix this problem by putting something underneath the container so that it's not directly touching the bottom of the cooking pot , but it has to allow the vapor bubbles to escape without causing vibrations .
Alternatively , you can use a floating steel bowl instead of a glass measuring cup .
If the temperature goes above 165 ºF , and you turn down the heat , but the temperature is still climbing and getting close to 170 º F ... then just lift the cooking pot off the burner , let it cool down to 160 ºF , and then put it back on the burner .
While the solution is being heated , it 's important to stir with a fork once in awhile , just in case some of the weed is not completely covered by the liquid .
Some alcohol will inevitably evaporate .
How much is lost depends on surface area .
Step 4 .
Cool off the solution by slowly adding tap water into the cooking pot and repeating a couple times .
Step 5 .
Put coffee filter paper inside and around the drinking cup , wrap rubber band around the outside to keep it in place .
Pour the solution onto the filter paper and let it drip into the drinking cup .
Once it 's done dripping , grab the filter paper and the weed and squeeze out every last drop .
Step 6 .
Now you have " green dragon ! "
The high alcohol content makes it unpleasant to drink straight , so it 's better to add it to something .
For an exciting high , add to coffee .
For a relaxing high , add to chamomile tea .
With soda it tastes really good !
A marijuana drink is faster than eating marijuana in food , but not quite as fast as smoking it .
On an empty stomach you 'll get some immediate effects , with a peak high at 60 to 90 minutes .
This will slowly wear off over several hours .
If you make a large batch , then you 'll know how strong it is after the first time , and then you can easily decide how stoned you want to be the next time ...
Microwave : No !
NEVER USE A MICROWAVE FOR EXTRACTION !
Anything metal or reflective inside the microwave will spark and light the whole thing on fire and really fuck up the microwave !
If the fan is not working , then the vapors will concentrate , and an explosion might blow the door off the microwave and throw shrapnel in your face .
This recipe has been removed because it 's too dangerous .
It 's also the least efficient method and is wasteful of expensive weed .
However , it is safe to use a microwave for decarboxylation ( THCA conversion to THC , a.k.a. " drying the weed " ) .
Extraction is dangerous because it involves concentrated alcohol .
Cupboard Method
This is the easiest way to make " green dragon . "
First , dry the weed in a microwave on high for at least two minutes , then put it in a bottle of lemon extract , stick it in a warm cupboard , and wait two to four weeks .
Some people do n't have this kind of patience , and sometimes getting high is a spontaneous social thing : you 're at a party or a friend 's house listening to music or watching something funny and you just wanna get high .
( " Hey , let 's make something ! " not " Hey let 's wait three weeks and try this ! " )
Or sometimes people decide that after finishing a boring week of work they just wanna go home and have a mini-vacation on a Friday night .
Not everybody likes to plan their highs so far in advance .
The cupboard method is , however , the safest method .
Microwaving is the easiest method for decarboxylation , but it should never be used for extraction .
Solar Method →
The solar method is probably the best method because it's not as dangerous as cooking with alcohol , does n't take forever , and it 's very efficient so it does n't waste good pot .
In theory , it 's the best method .
The basic idea is to put a small black sealed container inside a clear container , then put the whole thing inside a reflective metal bowl and leave it outside on a hot sunny day .
The black container would need to be light - proof and have very strong threads to hold the pressure .
A baby food jar with metal threads would probably work , and it would easily fit inside a peanut butter jar .
Sunlight breaks down THC , but several coats of black spray paint primer might be enough to keep everything dark inside .
This method might only work in the summertime or for people who live in the desert .
The big downside is that it could get stolen or blown away by the wind .
Also , the whole thing could explode from vapor pressure and that would suck , so it 's important to use a strong container and a lid with strong threads .
In theory the pot could be dry - baked one day and extracted the next day .
To use the solar method for decarboxylation , it 's important to use a packet of salt to keep the humidity low .
Update : a very simple version of the solar method is to use an old container for water purifications tablets , place it inside a black glasses case ( light - proof ) , and place that on the dashboard of a car during the summertime .

A man described as the top Afghan Taliban military commander and named as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar has been captured in Pakistan , US officials say .
He was seized in a morning raid on a madrassa near Karachi by Pakistan 's ISI intelligence service on 8 February , a security source told the BBC .
The government has yet to confirm the arrest ; the Taliban have denied it .
The capture comes amid a major Nato - led offensive against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan .
While the raid on Madarassa Khuddamul Quran - near the Nooriabad Industrial Estate some 45 km ( 28 miles ) from Karachi - was led by the ISI , it is not clear at the moment whether US officials were involved .
Correspondents say Mullah Baradar is reported to be in charge of all long - term strategic military planning for the Taliban in southern Afghanistan and , if confirmed , his arrest will have a very big effect on the Taliban 's ability to conduct the insurgency there .
ANALYSIS Orla Guerin , BBC News , Islamabad A senior Pakistani military official says this was a joint US - Pakistani operation that was based on shared intelligence .
This suggests Pakistan is getting tough with Afghan Taliban leaders sheltering here - something that has long been a demand of the White House .
The arrest may also be linked to attempts to get the Taliban into talks with the Afghan government and coalition forces .
Mullah Baradar is believed to favour negotiations .
There 's some speculation here that his detention could be a bid to open channels of communication .
It may also be an attempt by Pakistan to influence any future talks .
Senior US officials said Mullah Baradar was " providing intelligence " .
" This operation was an enormous success , " one official told ABC News .
" It is a very big deal , " the official said .
The New York Times , citing US government sources , said the prisoner was the most significant Taliban figure to be detained since the US - led war in Afghanistan began in 2001 .
But a Taliban spokesman denied the reports , saying Mullah Baradar was still in Afghanistan actively organising the group 's military and political activities .
" He has not been captured .
They want to spread this rumour just to divert the attention of people from their defeats in Marjah and confuse the public , " Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters news agency , referring to the US - led Nato offensive in the Marjah area of Helmand province .
Guerrilla tactics Little is known about Mullah Baradar , but in terms of influence he is said to rank second only to the Taliban 's spiritual leader , Mullar Muhammad Omar , who has been hiding from Western agencies since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 .
MULLAH BARADAR Second - in - charge behind Taliban founder Mullah Omar
In charge of Taliban 's military operations and financial affairs Born in Dehrawood district , Uruzgan province , in 1968 Former deputy defence minister for the Taliban regime Source : Interpol , news agencies
Profile : Mullah Baradar
Is the arrest a breakthrough ?
NY Times explains news delay Senior intelligence officials voiced hope he would provide the location of Mullah Omar .
The BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell , in Washington , says Mullah Baradar is a " big fish " who runs the Taliban 's day - to - day operations , both military and financial .
He allocates Taliban funds , appoints military commanders and designs military tactics , our correspondent says .
Mullah Baradar was quoted last year as telling his troops not to confront US soldiers with their superior firepower , but to adopt guerrilla tactics .
He is said to be responsible for the Taliban tactic of planting " flowers " - improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) - along roadsides .

The New York Times , citing officials , said the Karachi raid was conducted by Pakistan 's Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and CIA operatives .
The newspaper said it had learned of the operation on Thursday , but delayed reporting it after a request by White House officials .
They said disclosing it would end a very successful intelligence drive .
US officials later acknowledged the news , saying it was becoming broadly known in the region .
According to Interpol , Mullah Baradar was born in 1968 and served as deputy minister of defence for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan before it was toppled in 2001 .
He has been subject to UN sanctions including a travel ban , an arms embargo and the freezing of assets .
Mullah Baradar was reported to have engaged in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek magazine in July 2009 , in which he vowed to " inflict maximum losses " on US forces in Afghanistan .
" In every nook and corner of the country , a spirit for jihad is raging , " the magazine quoted him as saying .

Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) walks onstage to address the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 19 .
Paul : CPAC win ' significant '
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) said Monday that his win in the Conservative Political Action Conference ’s straw poll was “ significant ” but that he is still undecided on another run for president .
Paul captured 31 percent of the vote in the annual straw poll — long viewed as a gauge of conservative sentiment — besting three - year winner and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who finished with 22 percent .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin finished third with 7 percent , followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6 percent and Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , who received 5 percent .

Asked about the results Monday on CNBC ’s “ Squawk Box , ” Paul said , “ it is significant , and it does get me excited . ”
Paul said he was “ a bit surprised ” by his straw poll win but said it is “ a good indication that maybe the sentiments are changing . ”
The 2008 insurgent GOP presidential candidate attributed his victory to his younger supporters for backing his fiscal and foreign policy views and for showing up to vote in the straw poll .
“ The young people are very interested in this .
They turned out , ” Paul said .
“ They generally turn out at CPAC meetings , but I think there ’s definitely been a shift in attitude . ”
“ It ’s not the conventional wisdom of the old Republican Party conservatism , ” he said of the sentiment among his supporters .
“ I think something new is coming along . ”
Paul said that he is “ undecided ” on another run for president in 2012 , but warned GOP leaders to pay more attention to those in the party who share his views .
“ The Republican Party and other leaders in this country need to wake up and find out exactly why the young people are sick and tired of what is being dumped on them politically and economically , ” he said .
On the one - year anniversary of the federal stimulus law , Minnesota counted its blessings and racked up money for another big project Wednesday .
The languishing Union Depot in St. Paul became the latest beneficiary of federal largesse , receiving $ 35 million .
The $ 787 billion program to get the nation back on its feet has injected at least $ 2.5 billion into Minnesota 's economy .
The biggest chunks of cash have gone toward people in need , with $ 967 million for Medicaid and $ 844 million for unemployment checks , according to state data through Dec. 31 .
Another $ 2.5 billion is yet to be spent in the state .
Figuring out how to count the jobs created by the stimulus has n't been easy , but Michelle Weber , statewide stimulus coordinator , said that more than 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter of 2009 were paid for with federal recovery dollars .
( That figure was determined by adding up the working hours funded by stimulus money during the quarter . )
State economist Tom Stinson said the stimulus program was designed for short - term and long - term gains .
" The hole that we were in was so deep that it 's going to take years to get employment back to the level that we were at in 2007 , even with this program , " he said .
" Without the program , it probably would 've taken a couple more years . "
Instead of reaching the 2007 levels in 2012 , he said , it might otherwise have taken until 2014 or 2015 .
Minnesota 's unemployment rate a year ago was 8.7 percent ; in December , it was 7.3 percent , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The most recent national figure was 10.6 percent in January .
Chugging to the Depot
While roads , bridges and transportation projects have been the most visible piece of stimulus in Minnesota , the dollars amount to only a small fraction of the total .
The first time I ever heard of former wingnut Congressman Ernest Istook ( R - OK ) was when I read a blurb in thelisting the most dangerous members of Congress to the gay community .
As time went on I noticed he was very aggressive in pushing a hate - filled anti-gay agenda ( which increased when he left the Baptist Church and became a Mormon ) .
Years later he wound up on another list -- as one of the most corrupt of the Abramoff co-conspirators in ripping off American Indian tribes .
Istook left Congress to run for governor and was the victim of the biggest gubernatorial history in many decades as he was swamped -- in the reddest state in the Union -- by Democrat Brad Henry .
Henry took 66.5 % of the vote and 74 of Oklahoma 's 77 counties .
Istook won in the state 's 3 most backward counties , the three that make up the Panhandle , Beaver , Cimarron and Texas .
It turned out one of his campaign staffers , Jordan Edmund , was one of the underaged male pages Republican Mark Foley had molested .
Still very much an obsessed homophobic sociopath , who bragged he would never hire a gay person to work for him , he never lets up demonizing gay people .
People wonder who the next Ernest Istooks are likely to be .
Unfortunately , just looking at the voting records of House Members does not tell the story .
ProgressivePunch scores all House members on a dozen roll call votes since 2004 that directly impacted gay people .
146 currently serving Republicans ( plus one Blue Dog , Travis Childers of Mississippi ) can boast ZERO scores !
Only 32 Republicanshave zeroes , including Ahn Cao ( who has a disgraceful 50 % , Mary Bono Mack ( with an event more horrible 33.33 % and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( also at 33.33 % ) , all of whom represent large gay populations , respectively , New Orleans , Palm Springs and Miami Beach / Key West .
The only gay closet case who does n't score a zero is Illinois Senate candidate Mark Kirk ( who scored a 25 % ) .
Closeted gays who voted against people every single time they had an opportunity to include David Dreier ( CA ) , Trent Franks ( AZ ) , Patrick McHenry ( NC ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( CA ) , Aaron Schock ( IL ) , and Adrian Smith ( NE ) .
So how do we define the worst of the worst ?
I may bear a particular animus toward lock - step anti-gay fanatics who represent large gay constituencies , like homophobic fanatic -- and zero-- John Culberson ( R - TX ) whose constituents include an awful lot of gay men and women in Houston 's Montrose area .
And I also harbor some animus towards closet cases -- even " everyone knows " types like David Dreier -- who vote against equality for gays in less favorable positions than they are .
Ironically , Dreier , a zero himself , was vetoed for the Republican House Leader position by Roy Blunt basedon the fact that he 's gay .
You'd think they guy would grok the concept of being discriminated against !
But I decided when researching this piece to leave all that stuff aside and just concentrate on members of Congress who are proactively anti-gay , over and above their dismal voting records .
Let 's take , for example , Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) .
Forget that he 's a zero ; they almost all are .
Instead , notice that on March 4 last year he authored and proposed a constitutional amendment targeting gays and lesbians .
As it turns out , his pernicious amendment , H.J. Res. 37 was referred to Jerrold Nadler 's Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties , where it died the death it deserved .
Forty Republicans rushed to co-sponsor it , including loudly bigoted gay - haters like Paul Broun ( R - GA ) , Lynn Westmoreland ( R - GA , traumatized at an early age for his transgender first name ) , Mike Pence ( R- IN ) , Steve King ( R - IA ) , closet queen Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) , Eric Cantor ( R- VA ) , Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) , John Mica ( R- FL ) , Dan Burton ( R - IN ) , Ken Calvert ( R - CA ) , a shameless congressman arrested fleeing in a parked car with his pants down around his ankles when caught with a junkie - hooker by the police , and Jason Chaffetz ( R - UT ) .
And speaking of Chaffetz ... Chaffetz has appointed himself spokesperson for the GOP 's anti-gay squad .
When the Washington DC City Council voted 12 - 1 to recognize same sex marriages legally performed in other jurisdictions , Chaffetz went to war .
" Some things are worth fighting for , and this is one of them , " said Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( Utah ) , the ranking Republican on a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee that oversees the District .
" It 's not something I can let go softly into the night ...
I recognize the Democrats are in the majority , but I represent the majority of Americans on this issue . "
Or at least the majority of Utah voters who do n't live inside the city limits of Salt Lake City .
Soon after , virulent gay - haters Jim Jordan ( R - OH ) and Dan Boren ( D - OK ) introduced a bill to force DC torecognize same - sex marriage .
A Pat Robertson front group filed an anti-marriage equality brief on behalf of 37 House members suing to stop the city from recognizing same sex marriages .
Some very familiar names on that list : Robert Aderholt , Todd Akin , Michele Bachmann , Gresham Barrett , Roscoe Bartlett , Marsha Blackburn , John Boehner , John Boozman , Eric Cantor , Jason Chaffetz , John Fleming , Randy Forbes , Virginia Foxx , Scott Garrett , Phil Gingrey , Louie Gohmert , Jeb Hensarling , Wally Herger , Walter Jones , Jim Jordan , Steve King , Jack Kingston , John Kline , Doug Lamborn , Robert Latta , Don Manzullo , Michael McCaul , Thaddeus McCotter , North Carolina closet case Patrick McHenry , Cathy McMorris Rogers , Jeff Miller , Jerry Moran , Randy Neugebauer , Mike Pence , Joe Pitts , Mark Souder , and Todd Tiahrt .
On October 21 the House voted -- overwhelmingly -- to pass Tom Harkin 's bill to amend title XXVI of the Public Health Service
Act to revise and extend the program for providing life - saving care for those with HIV / AIDS ( the Ryan White HIV / AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 ) .
For normal Americans , regardless of party , it was a non-controversial , bipartisan endeavor and it passed 408 - 9 .
All the Democrats ( including homophobic Blue Dogs who routinely vote against gay equality ) and 162 Republicans including every single GOP closet case in the House and most of the garden variety hatemongers , voted for it .
So who voted " no ? " A motley array of the most vitriolic , hate - filled Republican bigots who come crawling out from under their rocks to revel in this kind of thing , including two on our list of the worst of the worst , Virginia Foxx and Louie Gohmert .
Time for the list of the six worst , the ones who are always at the front of the line when it comes to kicking around gay people , the ones who scream the loudest and make the ugliest faces :-
Where do we start with this raving package of pure Satanic hatred ?
How about the sick , McCarthyite letter King wrote to President Obama demanding he fire Kevin Jennings , the Assistant Deputy Secretary at the Department of Education for the Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools .
( Co-signers , obviously , included the rest of the Dirty Half Dozen . )
Or maybe we should stick to Iowa and his classy reaction to the ruling by his state 's Supreme Court recognizing that all Iowans were entitled to marriage equality . -
Poor Foxx built her entire demented career around spewing hatred towards gay people , first in the North Carolina legislature and more recently on the floor of the U.S. Congress , where she is considered one of the two dozen least effective , least influential members .
Ironically she 's become a kind of " fag hag " for Republican closet queen Patrick McHenry and he's one of the only members of Congress willing to be seen in public with her , especially after her demented tirade directed at Matthew Shepard 's grieving mother .
( See video below . )
I do n't know if any gay people reador not but if you know any , please let them know that Blue America has endorsed Billy Kennedy , the progressive Democrat running against Foxx , and that he could use some help in the fundraising department , even if just a $ 10 or $ 20 contribution . -
Half of the Republican Party tag team of bigotry with Utah wingnut Jason Chaffetz , Gohmert was famously dubbed , by Rachel Maddow , Oscar the Grouch , popping out of his trash can to take aim at active duty military personnel who happen to be gay .
Watch the video of him annoying members of the House by talking about his perverted sexual fantasies .-
This one has decided his path to political ascendancy among the Mormons is through anti-gay demagoguery .
Mormons , whose victimization at the hands of the narrow - minded is n't so far in the past , should know better . -
The only closet case in the Bottom Six , Franks was driven out of the Arizona state legislature for his aggressive sexual behavior towards younger males .
Safely ensconced in the Republican congressional caucus he figures that as long as he can bray homophobic epithets loudly enough , no one will figure out what he does when the lights go out .
Best known for calling President Obama an enemy of humanity and claiming that African - Americans may have been better off when they were slaves , Franks is the definition of a kind of self - loathing homosexual that mostly went extinct in the early 1960s .-
Hoping to live up to his father 's reputation as the most hysterical homophobe in Congress , Junior is as dumb as a brick and Aaron Schock 's secret heartthrob .
Because he served in the Marine Corps the GOP has tasked him with speaking out against equality for gays serving in the military .
He does it badly and it is widely rumored that his confused statements about hermaphrodites stems from having been molested as a child .
He , like the other 5 , should see a psychiatrist and stop trying to victimize other taxpaying , law - abiding American citizens .
I just opened an ActBlue page to address homophobia .
Can you help ?

Like millions of others , I saw Avatar last weekend .
I loved it — despite the 3D , not because of it .
Admittedly , my seat was shitty and I wear eyeglasses , but if the experience is n't guaranteed , 3D will fail .
Updated

Even after arriving 40 minutes early and waiting in line , the only undefended territory left was right up in front .
You may say you 'd have stormed out and demanded a refund , but due to work and parenthood , I get a chance to see about three movies per year in the theater , and those have to be slated well in advance .
If I did n't see Avatar at that time and place , I 'd have had to wait for it to show up on Blu-ray — or at least wait till after CES .
And hey , at least the seats reclined way back , to avoid the stiff neck .
I have endured movies in the front row before , and yes , it 's annoying .
You can't take it all in , you have to look around .
But when you add 3D glasses into the mix , it 's not just " annoying . "
It 's " cerebrally disruptive . "
Any shift of your eyes has to reorient your brain , and since you 're constantly shifting your eyes , you get a series of fleeting illusions combined with a lot of image jolts and jerks .
Taking off my 3D glasses , I realized that the typical crappy front - row experience would have been peaceful and easy by comparison .
Get this straight : Front row for 3D is 10X worse than front row for other movies .
Advertisement
There was another problem .
I was wearing 3D glasses on top of my own glasses , which I need to see .
I am not the only person in the world who chooses to wear eyeglasses instead of getting contacts or Lasik surgery .
You'd think the 3D industry would plan for this sizable segment of the population .
But the light playing between my glasses and the Dolby 3D glasses created weird holograms , floating text and images .
I thought at first it was Cameron pulling a JJ Abrams and throwing a bunch of lens flare streaks into the mix , but no , if I adjusted the relative position of the two glasses , they images would move or disappear , at least momentarily .
It was reflections of the movie projection bouncing off of my glasses and back onto the inside of the 3D glasses .
An LA Times story mentioned that Dolby 3D glasses were particularly ill - suited for people who are already wearing eyeglasses — hopefully other 3D providers are smarter when it comes to their four - eyed little friends .

The Battle of 3D Glasses
There 's a format war you probably did n't even know was going on , right in front of your eyes .
It 's… Read more
As you can tell , I was encumbered with a lot to worry about besides the film , for which I had paid $ 15 .
I managed to sit through it all , and am glad I did , for the sake of having seen Avatar .
It was great , and what I got was worth , say , $ 10 of the money I spent , a testament to Cameron 's abilities as a filmmaker , no doubt .
Advertisement
So I do n't blame Jim for deliberately making me suffer .
All the reports from people who got good seats — including our own Mark Wilson — say that the experience is the best use of 3D ever , and I admire Cameron for pushing the limits .
( And also for releasing a 2D version at the same time . )
I will say that , like good music producers who listen to a near - final mix from the crappiest boombox they can find , Cameron should be aware of how miserable the 3D experience can be .
But he 's a busy man , and probably did n't get a chance to sit through two - and - a - half hours of blue people , from the shittiest seat in the theater .
Advertisement
The theater management , a financially challenged group if there ever was one , are probably most to blame .
They need to sell as many tickets as possible , and they 're not about to tape off the front section .
But they should , and there 's a precedent for this .
To get IMAX certification , theaters rip out some of their seats , reducing the capacity but enhancing the experience .
Even though people have criticized IMAX certification as BS marketing , they got results .
( I recall something similar a few years back with George Lucas , who used his influence to make sure only the best theaters could show his movies via digital projection . )
You would think that Cameron , Fox and Dolby could combined their might to ensure theater - goers a uniformly baseline enjoyable experience — especially in light of the more strenuous technical and physical requirements of watching a film in 3D .
Alas , they simply could n't .

Or did n't .
When your goal is to rake in over $ 200 million in two weeks , you can't be bothered with little things like the asshole who got stuck sitting in the front row .
Yeah , I said it , and you 're thinking it .
I 'm to blame for not marching out , voting with my wallet so to speak .
This is America , and corporations have the right to con us , because we have the right to complain .
If all the theater , and Fox , and Cameron , and Dolby , and Hollywood as a whole wanted out of me was $ 15 , they got it .
( Do n't spend it all in one place . )
I do n't complain in restaurants , I just do n't go back .
If something cheap breaks on me , I may not call the 800 number on the back of the box , but I sure as hell do n't buy another — or anything from that brand .
Next time there 's an event movie like this , I may skip 3D altogether .
Me and every other poor bastard with a pair of eyeglasses and somewhere to be other than the theater two hours before showtime .

Do all you can to guarantee me an experience , and I will gladly pay for it .
But leave me to understand that there 's only a 50/50 chance I 'm even going to like it , and you can play at - home proctologist with those 3D glasses , cuz I wo n't be needing them .
Update : Apparently at least one theater chain is willing to take a fiscal hit in order to serve a better experience to moviegoers .
A Giz reader named Garth just sent me this hopeful note :
I went to go see Avatar IMAX 3D on Saturday at the Regal 16 in Escondido , CA and they had blocked off the first three rows in front and the three seats on the extreme left and right of the front section with specially made seat covers that read " Not for 3D viewing . "

Good for Regal !
And thanks again , Garth .

David Nutt , the scientist sacked as a government adviser by the home secretary , today defiantly launched his own independent committee which he says will provide the definitive scientific verdict on the risks of drugs .
Nutt said his committee was willing to give advice to the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , from which he was sacked as chair .
He was dismissed from the post after criticising politicians for distorting research evidence and claiming alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than some illegal drugs , including LSD , ecstasy and cannabis .
The new committee – called the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs ( ISCD ) – includes a number of big names in the field and has the potential to embarrass the government , due to its determination to make public the evidence on the relative risks and harms of drugs without regard to political sensitivities .
Nutt portrayed the ACMD as something of a lame duck scientifically , following the resignations of five of its members in sympathy with him – four of whom have joined the ISCD .
" It is a body made up of drug treatment people , police and magistrates , " he said .
But the ACMD 's new interim chair , Les Iversen , who was appointed this week , had sent him " a very supportive email " , he said , " saying he welcomed the committee and hopes we can work together " .
The committee will pursue a similar agenda to that which Nutt was sacked for supporting .
" We will undoubtedly pull together an assessment of the science , which is likely to challenge some of the aberrations in the current act , " he said .
" There 's a lot of evidence that MDMA ( ecstasy ) and related compounds are not class A [ the most potentially dangerous drugs ] .
There 's the evidence we presented that cannabis should stay as class C – I think most people would support that .
Possibly the psychedelics are inappropriately positioned in class A .
And ketamine may be more dangerous than amphetamines – maybe it should n't be class C , " he said .
The ISCD is currently 14 - strong , and includes some very senior names in the field .
With Nutt at the launch were Dr Les King , who had a 30 - year career in the forensic science service , and Dr John Marsden of the Institute of Psychiatry , both of whom resigned from the ACMD , and Prof Val Curran , a psychopharmacologist from University College London .
It has funding for the next three years from a hedge fund manager , Toby Jackson , who " wants to give something back " , said Nutt .
In the long - term they hope for more donations and even contracts from the government to carry out scientific research .
" It will save them money , " Nutt said .
The committee has had its first meeting and decided on a plan of work .
Apart from assessing the relative harms of well - known drugs , it will look at the risks of new psychoactive substances – or " legal highs " – which can be obtained through websites , and it will focus on ketamine – also known as K or Special K – which is popular with university students .
Curran said there was concern about the effects on the bladder of frequent use , which had led to young people requiring transplants .
Nutt and Marsden said they felt more comfortable on their independent committee , where they can speak out freely , than on the ACMD .
They had been advocating an independent scientific advisory body – which the Dutch have – since 2005 , they said .
In a statement the Home Office left open the option for the ACMD to take scientific advice from Nutt 's committee .
" The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is a statutory body , advising the government on drug related issues .
Its functions are set out in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and there are no plans to change that , " it said .
" When reviewing drugs ... the ACMD routinely considers evidence and reports from a wide range of sources , including external experts .
The ACMD will continue to do so to ensure all its recommendations are based on the most up to date evidence . "

Last Saturday
I gave the first political speech of my life .
I spoke to the Manhattan Libertarian party and told them I planning a campaign for Governor of New York State .
I have not decided whether to seek the Libertarian party nomination or form my own party based on my platform ; legalization , regulation and taxation of prostitution , marijuana , and legalizing gay marriage .
When was the last time a candidate put forward this kind of honest , radical platform ?
When is the last time a politician offered the voters something different than higher taxes , more spending , greater debt and service cuts .
I will also run to highlight the inequities of our criminal justice system which discriminates against women , minorities and poor people , a system which sent me to jail while Eliot Spitzer broke the law and walked away free .
Eliot Spitzer is symptomatic of the problem we are dealing with in NY - dirty politicians who believe they are above the law – this precedent must be broken !
More importantly I would run as an advocate for real reform .
I have written extensively on my support for these three proposals on this website long before I thought about running for public office .
I have a business background , ran a hedge fund for ten years and built a multi-million dollar business from scratch .
Unlike any of the other candidates for governor I have created jobs and made a payroll .
I am certainly more qualified than the losers and hacks we have in Albany now !
I am in a unique position to understand the economics of sex .
I built a multi-million dollar escort service from scratch before pleading guilty to promoting prostitution .
Prostitution in New York is estimated to be a $ 5 Billion a year business .
Legalization and a reasonable tax rate could bring $ 1 Billion in new revenues to New York State each year .
Legalizing Marijuana would reap another $ 2 Billion a year .
Then New York could balance the budget and still cut property and income taxes .
If I run it will not be some publicity stunt or effort to help , or hurt any other candidate .
The publicity I have received in the past was not by choice - I was arrested !
Now , I plan on using this megaphone attribute to run as a advocate for women ’s rights and personal freedom .
I figured out I was libertarian by nature by going to the national libertarian party website .
I found myself in agreement with 80 % of their platform .
I am a member of no party .
They are all corrupt !
I am confident about my ability to raise $ 2 million for a real campaign .
I already have campaign contribution pledges from supporters as diverse as Northern California
Pot farmers , Hip - Hop artists , Gay and lesbian friends an even some conservative businessmen .
My friends at G - Unit , Penthouse magazine and High Times have both encouraged me .
I have retained Roger Stone , a well know political consultant to help me prepare for a campaign for governor .
I met Roger Stone after we were on a radio show together .
He helped expose the hypocrisy of Eliot Spitzer .
He is brilliant .
He knows how to get the 15,000 signatures I will need to get my name on the ballot .
He also shares my positions regarding legalization of prostitution , pot and gay marriage .
I am the one who will be running and putting my name on the ballot .
I am the one who will offer New York voters something different .
I am the one advocating using our voice to speak out against inequality and the one who is ready to take on the career politicians and expose them for who they really are !
I know the politicians and political reporters wont take me seriously at first .
Let ’s see if they are still laughing when my campaign files three times the number of signatures needed to get on the ballot .
New York voters will have a chance to vote to legalize prostitution , pot and gay marriage next November .
What could be more exciting ?
Andy Pag has dual British and Italian nationality
A British man who has been travelling the world in a bus powered by chip fat has been arrested in India on suspicion of terrorism , his family say .
Andy Pag , from Croydon , south London , was arrested in Ajmer , in the state of Rajasthan , in northern India .
His family said he was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly using a satellite phone without permission .
The 34 - year - old campaigner has been driving a biotruck to highlight the benefits of using low carbon energy .
Since leaving London in September 2009 the campaigner has driven his truck through Europe and the Middle East before reaching India .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it had not been involved in providing consular services to Mr Pag , who has dual British and Italian nationality .
It said it had not been informed of his arrest by the Indian authorities as Mr Pag had been travelling on his Italian passport .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Thrill - seekers in France tired of the usual array of white - knuckle sports are turning to a bizarre new service to get their adrenaline rush -- designer abduction .
For 900 euros ( $ 1,226 ) , clients of Ultime Realite ( “ Ultimate Reality ” ) , a firm in eastern France , can buy a basic kidnap package where they ’re bundled away , bound and gagged , and kept incarcerated for four hours .
Alternatively , they can opt for a more elaborate tailor - made psychodrama , involving an escape or helicopter chase for example , where costs can quickly escalate .
“ Basically , anything is possible .
I identify what the customer wants and then try to put it into action , ” said Georges Cexus , 28 , who set up the company in the middle of January .
Once the scenario has been established , clients sign a contract and liability waiver , but have no idea when the kidnappers will strike in order to maximize the surprise .
But Cexus said the maximum incarceration time is 11 hours , beyond which clients might find the novelty tends to wear off .
After just a few weeks in business , Ultime Realite says it is already getting up to two requests a day , the majority from top - level executives seeking an extreme alternative to bungee jumping or skydiving .
Others are hoping to confront deep - rooted phobias , such as one potential client who says he wants to be buried alive .
For those searching for the ultimate nightmare , the company is also hoping to branch out beyond kidnappings and is looking into options such as spending a night in a morgue , or attending your own funeral .
“ Let ’s say it will really be about bringing to life the client ’s worst fear , the thing that ’s lurking in the back of his mind and he ’s never dared talk about , ” said Cexus .
While paying “ victims ” might find the experience cathartic , however , there ’s little guarantee of how innocent bystanders might react to witnessing a kidnapping in broad daylight .
A spokesperson for the French police said they had no legal objections to the service , but the company would need to warn local authorities beforehand so they were prepared for any emergency calls .
“ With regard to the police and penal code , there ’s no reason for us to ban this service , as the victim is consenting which means there ’s no crime , ” the spokesperson said .
Composite structure of an edge element of the nuclear pore complex , coating the double - membrane that surrounds the cell ’s nucleus .
The elongated edge element is composed of several large proteins and traverses circular openings in the nuclear envelope like spokes , to form a lattice - like scaffold ( only one spoke is shown ) .
Photo - Image : Janet Iwasa , courtesy Nature
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Biologists led by associate professor Thomas Schwartz ( MIT ) have worked out a rudimentary architectural plan for the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) , the gatekeeper of the cell 's nucleus .
The massive NPC , which allows molecules such as RNAs and proteins , to move in and out of the nucleus , is one of the largest macromolecular structures in the cell ( containing about 5 million atoms ) .
Its structure has been considered a " holy grail " in structural biology for many decades .
Schwartz and his team found that the NPC scaffold forms an open lattice structure , similar to another membrane coating complex , called COPII .
That complex has far fewer components and is involved in a completely different cellular process , called vesicular transport , by which materials move in , out and around the cell enclosed in vesicles .
The finding reveals a remarkable evolutionary story .
The proteins that form the building blocks in the NPC and the COPII vesicle coats are so unique that they still have not been identified anywhere else in the cell .
Once the models of the proteins were complete , it became clear that these two cellular structures share a common ancestor , dating back over one billion years , which already contained the same building blocks connected in very similar fashion .
Second , discovering the specific relationship between the NPC and the much simpler , better understood COPII vesicle coat constitutes a significant step toward understanding the entire NPC assembly , which appears to be remarkably modular and most likely self - assembling .
Graduate student Stephen Brohawn created a complex of three nuclear pore proteins in bacteria and grew microscopic crystals of the complex .
Then he solved the structure of the complex by X - ray crystallography .
In general , complexes as large as this , especially nuclear pore proteins , are notoriously difficult to crystallize and solve the structure of , but strategies such as solving the structure of small pieces of the complex separately made the problem tractable .
Understanding structurally that the NPC and the COPII vesicle coat are evolutionarily related opens up a wide avenue of future research .
The structures available now are still only pieces within the entire nuclear pore complex puzzle .
However , unraveling the common architecture now serves as a guide to employ the next steps toward understanding the entire transport machine .
Also , several other ideas about the NPC architecture that were largely speculative can now be put to rest .
" A complete structure of the NPC is the project of a lifetime , but we have shown that it is feasible and worth it , and that many unexpected discoveries can be made on the road as well , " says Schwartz .

So , gone are the days when games esp. online games were monopolized by kids and men .
According to a recent survey report of video game industry ’s trade group , 40 % of gamers in US are women .
Another interesting trend is the average age of gamers which has gone upto 35 years ( Source : Womengamers.com , 18th July ’08 ) .
40 % women gamers , whoa that ’s an impressive figure esp .
when the general perception is that women prefer television or books more for entertainment as compared to anything else .
Gaming scene even back home for women is quite positive .
Many Indian gaming companies are launching games targeted esp. towards women .
Infact women ’s attitude towards entertainment is changing quite interestingly .
Unlike earlier days , not only women are seeking entertainment avenues to beat the stress of work and home but they are also open to trying out new platforms .
No more women are glued on to only television soaps or the saas bahu saga , today ’s women are trying it all , right from online music to movies to games .
Now online games and Indian women connection seem very intriguing esp .
when till few years back most of the Indian women used to forbid their kids from playing video games considering it be absolute waste of time and distraction from studies J.
Lots of Indian companies are launching women specific games especially to woo them considering women are the most important decision makers for most of the purchase decisions in a family .
Here are some of the observations to substantiate this further :
FX Labs recently launched its game named “ Agni ” in which the story revolves around a mother and a child .
Infact they are heavily promoting this game and Malaika Arora Khan is the brand ambassador for Agni .
Games2win has released close to 60 games targeted at women and has spent clore to Rs 4 crore on their development .
Onlinerealgames.com and neodelight.com have got more than 50 women centric games and more interesting is the statistics of women subscribers on onlinerealgames.com .
Approx 30 % if its overall subscribers are women .
Zapak has got a special section in its site for women known as zapakgirls.com and it has got different interesting games for women of different age groups .
Lastly and most importantly , I as a woman consumer find online gaming to be a huge stress buster and I am seriously glued on to some of the games on Zapak and Games2win J
Online gaming industry in India is growing encouragingly and is projected to touch $ 100 million in India by 2010 , which is already a $ 2.25 - billion market globally .
Women gamers are expected to double in this segment by 2010 .
Double in next 2 years and that too in such a non-conventional entertainment segment , way to go women !
“ District 9 ” is one of those films … the less you know the better .
So let me say to everyone reading this , if you ’d like to see a great sci - fi movie , something that ’s new , original , and fresh , go see “ District 9 ” this weekend .
Do n’t ask people what it ’s about .
Do n’t go reading the reviews .
Just buy a ticket and see it .
I promise you ’ll love the movie and you ’ll be so happy you did n’t know anything beforehand .
That ’s how I saw it and it was amazing .
Of course not everyone feels this way .
Some people do n’t care what they find out in advance and they actually want to learn as much as they can before they see a movie .
So while I ’d love to post this exclusive interview I did with director Neill Blomkamp after “ District 9 ” had opened , I realize the reason he did press was to get people into the theater this weekend .
So after the jump is a great conversation with Neill and he explains why he got into making movies , the marketing of “ District 9 ” , making the film , the style , what will be on the DVD / Blu-ray , would he go back to “ Halo ” if he was asked , Comic - Con , and a lot more .
Take a look :
Finally , if you ’d like to see a “ District 9 ” featurette and some clips from the film , click here .
And here ’s the synopsis for “ District 9 ” if you have n’t read it yet :
Over twenty years ago , aliens made first contact with Earth .
Humans waited for the hostile attack , or the giant advances in technology .
Neither came .
Instead , the aliens were refugees , the last survivors of their home world .
The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa ’s District 9 as the world ’s nations argued over what to do with them .
Now , patience over the alien situation has run out .
Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United ( MNU ) , a private company uninterested in the aliens ’ welfare – they will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens ’ awesome weaponry work .
So far , they have failed ; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA .
The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when an MNU field operative , Wikus van der Merwe ( Sharlto Copley ) , contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA .
Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world , as well as the most valuable – he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology .
Ostracized and friendless , there is only one place left for him to hide : District 9 .

Neill Blomkamp part 1
How did he get into filmmaking – talks about where he came from and what he did to get to be a director
Was it always the intention to keep the film more mysterious / marketing campaign
How difficult was writing the film and how long it took
We talk about the aliens being all CGI and I ask how did he do it
How did he pick the style of the film – how it goes from narrative to documentary to real footage
Neill Blomkamp part 2
What will be on the DVD / Blu-ray ?
Says some deleted scenes and how it was made
Is he a fan of extended cuts or director cuts ?
Would he be down with a District 9 video game
How interested is he in staying in the District 9 universe versus moving onto another project
Talks about another sci - fi idea he has for his next project
Working with Peter Jackson
Would he go back to Halo or is he really done with it
Comic - Con – did he geek out while there
He geeks out about Sideshow Collectibles

BUCHAREST , Romania —
As a young correspondent covering central Europe in 1989 , I vividly remember the terror that the Securitate , Romania ’s secret police , wreaked on ordinary Romanians in the last , harrowing months of the dictatorship .
In no country in the former Eastern Bloc was the reach and the power of the intelligence services so vast as in Romania , where the the Securitate held a uniquely tight grip .
The dictatorship ’s secret services commanded such an immense network of informers that no one felt safe speaking his mind , even among friends .
Since foreigners were persona non grata and even just conversing with them raised suspicion , I had only to seat myself in a public place , like at bar or in a railway station , to cause locals to scatter like birds .
I visited Romania with names and phone numbers written in code and stuffed in my shoes .
The price was high for those deemed uncooperative : Careers were made and unmade by the Securitate , to say nothing of the hundreds who perished in its prisons .
Yet since Romania ’s bloody Christmas revolution — an exception among the “ velvet revolutions ” of that year — no country in Eastern Europe has dealt less thoroughly with the legacy of its secret services under communism .
Romania never passed a lustration law like those in Germany , the Czech Republic or Poland that thoroughly vetted public officials .
It took until 10 years after communism ’s demise — under European Union pressure — for the Securitate archives to be opened , by then much purged or altered by the very people whose careers they threatened .
Not a single person has been tried and sentenced for killings during the 1989 revolution , when more than 1,000 people lost their lives .
“ Romania today is impossible to understand without understanding the networks that these people — Securitate officers , apparachiks — created for themselves , ” said Gabriel Andreescu , a former dissident and human rights activist .
“ They reach into politics , the business world , the media , and even the Orthodox Church . ”
Andreescu claimed that a younger generation is now also involved , the offspring of Securitate or people somehow indebted to them , who protect their interests in exchange for entry into the power structures .
These tightly knit networks , said Andreescu , are very difficult to crack .
“ These institutions , ” he said , “ are the very ones that should set lustration in motion .
No wonder it has n’t happened . ”
Romania ’s case is unique because the dictatorship of tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu was the fiercest in the Eastern Bloc .
Since it broached no dissent , there were only very weak reform - minded factions in the ruling Communist Party and nothing like the underground opposition movements that existed in Poland , Hungary and even East Germany .
Thus after the revolution , the second tier of the former communist apparatus took over :
There was no one else .
It is estimated that still today at least a third of the “ new ” intelligence service , the Romanian Information Service ( SRI ) , is made up of former Securitate officers .
Those in retirement received a pension three times that of ordinary Romanians .
After years of stalling , the new information agency finally released files of the estimated 1 million people persecuted by the regime .
But they are woefully incomplete .
The Romania - born German writer Herta Mueller , recently named Nobel Prize laureate for literature , said whole years are missing from her files .
" Ceausescu ’s secret service was n’t dissolved , ” she wrote , “ it simply renamed itself . ”
In the recent article in the German weekly Die Zeit , Mueller calls her file “ a botched creation of the SRI in the name of the Securitate . ”
“ They had 10 long years to ‘ process ’ it [ her file ] , ” explained Mueller .
“ You ca n’t say it was touched up , it was eviscerated . ”
By destroying the relevant files and undermining a lustration process in Romania , wrote Mueller , the former collaborators turn the Securitate into “ an abstract monster devoid of identifiable , human faces . ”
This way , the guilty are protected and a rational public debate is undermined .
The secret service today , Mueller wrote , still functions in much the same way it did before .
Even today , she claims , she is followed and her phone bugged when she is in Romania .
Her demands to get back all of her Securitate file have gone nowhere .
Romanian political scientist Alina Mungiu Pippidi said that Mueller ’s charges of continued persecution are not far - fetched , although it is probably not the SRI itself behind it .
“ The networks of the Securitate have been privatized into lucrative businesses , ” she said .
“ Their people fear anyone who can expose them the way Mueller does in her fiction .
The fact that they use familiar methods to intimidate is not surprising . “
Mungiu Pippidi thinks it is simply too late now to expect a full - scale lustration to be effective .
“ If I had my way , ” she said , “ I ’d just have [ the files ] all burned .
The whole system is too infiltrated for these archives to be useful , in a positive way .
Lustrstion is only valuable when it can affect the power structures it has been designed to vet .
There is no chance of this happening in Romania today . ”
I ’ll be at Dallas Comic Con this weekend .
Come say hi !
I wrote this comic after viewing the Star Trek TNG episode “ The Icarus Factor . ”
In it , Wesley Crusher throws Worf a surprise Klingon birthday party on the Holodeck , complete with a Painstick Pinnata .
Also Riker worked out his daddy issues by beating the crap out of his old man American Gladiators style .
What does this have to do with anything ?
Nothing .
I just like making comics about Star Trek .
The actual comic inspiration came from the fact that Wesley clearly did n’t realize that everyone on the ship was punking him when they encouraged him to sneak around and try to plan Worf ’s K’Plahmitzvah .
Geordi and Data encouraged
Wes to pry deeper into Worf ’s personal bid-ness despite his obvious increased aggression and agitation .
No doubt they were hoping that Worf would remove the young Ensign ’s spine through his nipples .
Genius he may have been , Wesley just did n’t fit in .
He was clearly too young and naive to be gallivanting through the galaxy on life and death missions with cynical space - adults that clearly did n’t have his best interests in mind .
The best line of the episode went to Papa Riker who pleaded with his emotionally blockaded son to “ Let your shields down , Wil . ”
Those are metaphorical shields he ’s talking about .
Heart shields .
The idea of using 24th century metaphors in family arguments lead to these tweets :
So , what ’s the best line of shitty space - soap opera dialog you can come up with ?
Also , I made some banner art for Denise ’s new food blog .
Americans are eager to see the economy move into higher gear in 2010 , but their personal financial struggles appear likely to temper a recovery .
Households are in financial - repair mode .
They are trying to rebuild savings accounts , pay down debts , or get by until the job market brings new opportunities .
In many ways , this puts the economy in uncharted waters .
Americans have never faced the challenge of bouncing back from such a deep recession while retaining such a high level of debt .
Can households get back on sounder financial footing while providing the fuel of consumer spending that typically drives an economic expansion ?
Many forecasters of­fer a “ yes , but ” answer .
Paring back debt burdens does n’t preclude a rise in consumer spending , they say .
But they acknowledge they could be wrong .
Even if they ’re right , recovery may be tepid , without quick relief in the jobless rate .
And the real test of consumer staying power may come later this year as government stimulus programs begin to fade .
" There ’s not a lot of gas in the consumer tank , " says Brian Bethune , an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Mass .
" In a process of deleveraging , the consumer is just going to be a very elusive individual to track down . "
Elusive or not , that individual will be someone to watch as a barometer of recovery .
Here in the working - class city of Revere , Mass. , the end of the holiday season has n’t brought shoppers to a halt .
But in this community north of Boston , belt - tightening is a common refrain alongside cautious optimism .
" I live very frugally , " says Glen Corriveau , who 's looking for work and getting by with a Veterans Affairs stipend and by subletting a bedroom in his apartment .
Like many Americans , he blends a can - do spirit with concern that recovery will take time .
" I see us becoming a subterranean society , " with many people so discouraged they ’ve stopped looking for jobs , he says .
He figures a lot of the jobs he ’s held before wo n’t come back .
Yet he says he ’s hopeful about finding work .
Alan Cohen , another Revere resident , is employed but is also watching his pennies – avoiding debt by owning no credit cards .
As a teacher of English as a second language , he has joined America ’s growing ranks of freelance or contract workers .
" We have to take responsibility for ourselves , " he says , contrasting his attitude today with the more complacent approach he took to personal finances when he worked at a computer company earlier in his career .
Polls suggest that a similar financial restraint – voluntary or not – is taking hold across much of America .
An Opinion Research Corp. survey last month asked Americans their top financial resolution for the new year .
“ Increase savings ” was the top answer , chosen by 33 percent of respondents .
A close second : paying off debt .
Already , the recession has resulted in a rise in the personal savings rate , which had fallen to historic lows .
And levels of household debt , which had risen to historic highs as a share of income , are shrinking .
By some estimates , de­leveraging is happening more because of defaults than because of people opting to pay down their debts .
A decline in credit - card debt , for example , closely tracks the rate at which banks are charging off delinquent card loans .
In some cases , job losses are leading to foreclosure or bankruptcy .
In others , borrowing has stalled because card issuers have reduced credit limits or raised interest rates .
One positive sign :
The " debt service ratio , " or the cost of debt payments as a share of personal disposable income , has fallen to 12.85 percent , from nearly 14 percent when the recession began .
That overall figure masks wide disparities – millions of households have no debt at all , while others are deep in debt .
But the trend is moving in a positive direction .
A sustainable level for US household debt payments is probably 11 or 12 percent of personal income , economists at Morgan Stanley estimated last year , adding that this target could be reached by 2011 .
Forecasters at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also say the great balance - sheet repair can occur alongside a modest growth in consumer spending and personal savings .
They note that household behavior may hinge on what happens to overall net worth , including the value of houses and stock portfolios .
If home prices stabilize and the stock market shows some gains , households will feel less pressure to pay down debts or default .
A big uncertainty is the flow of new credit .
Banks , hit by defaults , have their own financial repair to do and feel unable to make many new loans .
As Global Insight ’s Mr. Bethune sees it , the key challenge is not bringing household debt down to normal levels , but getting credit flowing in a normal way .

LONDON  Britain said Tuesday it was outlawing a radical Islamic group that had incited outrage by planning a protest march through the streets of a town made famous for its somber ceremonies honoring British soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
Alan Johnson , the British home secretary , said the move criminalizing membership in the banned group , Islam4UK , was a “ tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism . ”
The ban , which takes effect Thursday , also outlawed other names used by the organization .
Last week , the British prime minister , Gordon Brown , said he was “ personally appalled ” by the group ’s plans to march through Wootton Bassett , a town 70 miles west of London where residents have lined the streets for more than two years to pay respects to the passing hearses carrying the coffins of British soldiers flown home to a nearby military base .
Islam4UK decried Britain ’s action in a statement posted to its
Web site on Tuesday , saying that the prohibition of the group was “ a clear case of the oppressor and tyrant blaming the oppressed . ”
On Sunday , the group scrapped plans for the march , which had sought to highlight what it called the “ atrocities ” committed by British troops in Afghanistan .
Air America , the progressive talk radio network , said Thursday that it would cease broadcasting immediately , bowing to what it called a “ very difficult economic environment . ”
“ It is with the greatest regret , on behalf of our board , that we must announce that Air America Media is ceasing its live programming operations as of this afternoon , and that the company will file soon under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code to carry out an orderly winding down of the business , ” the chairman of Air America Media , Charlie Kireker , said in a memorandum .
His statement was published on AirAmerica.com .
The news did not come as a complete surprise to staff members .
The company , which was founded in 2004 , never found a substantial audience or sound financial footing .
It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006 , but managed to stay on the air at that time .
The network churned through several owners and several attempted reinventions , with little to show for it .
“ The fact of the matter was , it was always a very challenging business proposition , and it never had the right management , ” said Sam Seder , who hosted programs on Air America until last year .
The headwinds were enormous , he said , adding , “ Radio is a dying industry . ”
Nonetheless , the network was a launchpad for a small number of liberal media stars , most notably Rachel Maddow , who now anchors a prime - time program on MSNBC .
Several former Air America hosts , including Randi Rhodes and Thom Hartman , remain on the radio but apart from the network .
“ It would be a shame if the world sees the failure of Air America as representing the failure of progressive talk radio , ” said Michael Harrison , the editor of Talkers magazine .
Senator Al Franken , Democrat of Minnesota , hosted an Air America show from 2004 to 2007 before running for office .
In his statement , Mr. Kireker wrote :
At a critical time in our nation ’s history — when dissent on issues such as the Iraq war were often denounced as “ un- American ” —
Air America and its talented team helped millions of Americans remember the importance of compelling discussion about the most pivotal events and decisions of our generation .
Through some 100 radio outlets nationwide , Air America helped build a new sense of purpose and determination among American progressives .
With this revival , the progressive movement made major gains in the 2006 mid-term elections and , more recently , in the election of President Barack Obama and a strongly Democratic Congress .
Laws have changed for the better thanks to this revival … but all the same our company cannot escape the laws of economics .
So we intend a rapid , orderly closure over the next few days .
The shutdown of the network has essentially already taken place .
Starting at 6 p.m. Eastern on Thursday , listeners will hear encore programming until Monday , “ at which time Air America programming will end , ” Mr. Kireker said in the statement .

Non perdetelo d'occhio , dunque !
Nokia e Symbian S^3 : una nuova era ?
Dopo un periodo di breve ristagno per Nokia , iniziato dopo il lancio di N97 ed N900 , l'Azienda finlandese ha deciso di introdurre una sferzata di novità cercando di ridurre il gap tecnologico rispetto alle più recenti e più efficienti piattaforme concorrenziali Android .
Per questo , nasce il progetto Symbian S^3 , che Nokia ha intenzione di implementare , ad esempio , nel nuovissimo Nokia N98 di prossima introduzione sul mercato .
Finalmente , nel mondo Symbian è nata una nuova pietra miliare segnata da una nuova release che rende ancora più finger - friendly un sistema operativo ormai consolidato .
Tra le nuove feature dell 'OS che sarà implementato nei futuri terminali Nokia , segnalo la presenza dello scrolling cinetico , della tecnologia multitouch e pinch - to - zoom presenti perlomeno in browser e visualizzatore immagini , un'opzione " visual multi- tasking " che consente di tenere sotto controllo le applicazioni aperte , un elevato grado di customizzazione grazie alla Home Screen " multiple page " insieme a tantissimi nuovi widget .
Molto simile all ' interfaccia grafica Apple Cover Flow il nuovo media player di Symbian : ponendo il telefono in modalità landscape , infatti , sarà possibile sfogliare le cover degli album e con un doppio tap selezionare la canzone da acoltare .
Nuovo chip Samsung : foto e video HD per smartphone Samsung si appresta ad annunciare due nuovi sensori di immagini CMOS : il S5K4E2 ed il S5K5CA .
Il primo è un di chip da 5 MegaPixel che utilizza la tecnologia proprietaria Enhanced Energy Steering ed è in grado di catturare video fino a 15 frame al secondo .
L'Azienda ha lavorato a lungo per dotare tali sensori di una riduzione del rumore decisamente ottimale .
Inoltre , grazie alle dimensioni estremamente compatte , tali chip possono essere installati negli handset più sottili e compatti .
Il System on a Chip ( SoC ) S5K5CA integra invece un sensore da 3 MegaPixel che combina un ISP ( Image Signal Processor ) con un sensore immagine CMOS .
Si tratta di un chip più piccolo del 25 % rispetto ai convenzionali moduli da 3 MegaPixel ed inoltre vanta la capacità di catturare video in HD a 720 p .
Multitouch sui netbook Asus EEE PC Si chiama Eee PC T101MT ed è un nuovissimo ultraportatile Asus .
L'ennesimo solito della serie Triple E , direte voi ?
No , questo ha qualcosa di nuovo e decisamente interessante : il multitouch .
Dopo una prevendita tedesca , sembra che il nuovo netbook conquisterà anche il mercato francese , perlomeno secondo il sito web blogeee .
net .

Windows Mobile 7 : presentato a breve da Ballmer , ma la GUI è già stata individuata ...
Smascherata , almeno in parte , l'interfaccia grafica di Windows Mobile 7 , che sarà ufficialmente annunciato a breve al MWC da Steve Ballmer in persona .
A tradire la novità , dei banner parzialmente scoperti in alcuni padiglioni della fiera .
Riporto di seguito le immagini : Alle 14.00 di oggi 15/02/2010 la presentazione ufficiale del nuovo sistema operativo che , è ormai confermato , NON sarà compatibile con la tecnologia Flash ( almeno all ' inizio ... ) .
Xperia si evolve : da Sony Ericsson X10 Mini e X10 Mini Pro. Vivaz PRO con Symbian e video HD Sony Ericsson presenta Xperia X10 Mini e X10 Mini Pro , le versioni compatte di Xperia X10 , che introducono sul mercato cellulari potenti e ricchi di applicazioni .
Con questi dispositivi compatti e intelligenti , Sony Ericsson sfida le regole e propone una nuova offerta che integra funzionalità di alto livello con una versione potente della piattaforma Sony Ericsson UX , specificatamente studiata per i dispositivi più piccoli .
Inoltre , X10 Mini Pro si caratterizza per una tastiera QWERTY a scorrimento .
Entrambi offrono un’esperienza di communication entertainment aperta e intuitiva , integrando la filosofia di design “ human curvature ” introdotta per la prima volta dal Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 .
Il tutto combinando la piattaforma Android con applicazioni e una piattaforma UX personalizzabile .
I due nuovi cellulari integrano Sony Ericsson Timescape che unisce tutta la comunicazione in un unico posto così gli utenti possono vedere con un solo sguardo messaggi di testo , chiamate perse , aggiornamenti Facebook e Twitter , senza dover aprire diverse applicazioni .
Il music player interattivo utilizza anche il tasto “ infinite button ” per riunire tutti i contenuti musicali dallo store di musica e da YouTube – un modo intelligente per cercare nuovi brani dell ’artista preferito .
Prezzi davvero concorrenziali per questi prodotti Android 1.6 based con display capacitivo e cam da 5MPx , che saranno disponibile dal secondo quadrimestre del 2010 : si parla di soglie di prezzo molto vicine ai 200 € !
Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro , presentato oggi , combina una tastiera QWERTY allo schermo touch , offrendo una migliore esperienza d’uso per la messaggistica e l’intrattenimento .
La tastiera completa QWERTY consente agli utenti di comunicare in modo rapido ed efficiente tramite email , SMS o attraverso gli aggiornamenti dei social network .
Proprio come il modello Sony Ericsson Vivaz , presentato in Gennaio , Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro permette invece ai consumatori di creare e trasmettere le loro esperienze migliori in qualità HD .
Grazie alla piattaforma aperta , inoltre , è possibile personalizzare il telefono con il download di entusiasmanti applicazioni attraverso lo store PlayNow e la Symbian Developer Community .
Anche la versione Pro del Vivaz registra video in HD a 720 p , si basa su Symbian 5th Edition , ed integra uno schermo touch 16:9 da 3.2 ” .
Disponibilità dal Q2 del 2010 in diverse colorazioni .
Navigon MobileNavigator anche per Android Navigon allarga la sua offerta di software onboard per smartphone con MobileNavigator per il sistema operativo Android , disponibile da primavera 2010 .
MobileNavigator per Android ( versioni dalla 1.5 alla 2.1 ) equipaggia numerosi smartphone come il T - Mobile Pulse , il Nexus One o l’HTC Magic con la navigazione onboard .
Dato che le mappe sono salvate sul dispositivo , il sistema di navigazione non deve più connettersi alla rete dati mobile .
Ciò significa che non ci sono più i lunghi tempi di caricamento o i costi aggiuntivi di roaming .
Inoltre , le funzioni consolidate Navigon trasformano il cellulare in un compagno indispensabile .
La funzione di visualizzazione della mappa Reality View Pro mostra all ’utente le uscite autostradali e i relativi cartelli in modo realistico e 3D .
Il display cambia automaticamente la modalità giorno - notte e offre l’opzione di visualizzazione delle mappe in modalità panoramica o ritratto quando richiesto .
Allo stesso tempo il software raggiunge un frame rate di 8 fps ( frames per second ) nella modalità mappa per assicurare una visualizzazione chiara e senza scatti .
Oltre alle funzioni di visualizzazione , l ’Assistente di Corsia o l ’Assistente di Velocità offrono un supporto aggiuntivo per assicurare uno stile di guida sicuro .
Precisi annunci vocali spiegano il tragitto da seguire .
I dispositivi attualmente compatibili con il software di navigazione satellitare sono i seguenti : HTC Hero ; HTC Magic ; Google Nexus One ; Huawei U8220 ; Motorola Droid ; Motorola Milestone ; Samsung GT - i5700 Galaxy Spica ; Samsung GT - i7500 Galaxy ; Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 ; T - Mobile G2 Touch ; T - Mobile G1 ; T - Mobile Pulse .

Intel e Nokia uniscono le piattaforme software per i dispositivi del futuro Intel Corporation e Nokia stanno unendo le rispettive piattaforme di grande successo Moblin e Maemo , compiendo un passo importante nell ’ambito della convergenza delle comunicazioni e dell ’informatica .
Questa iniziativa creerà una piattaforma unificata basata su Linux che potrà funzionare su diverse piattaforme hardware attraverso un’ampia gamma di dispositivi informatici , inclusi computer mobile tascabili , netbook , tablet , televisori e sistemi di infotainment .
MeeGo accelererà l’innovazione del settore del time - to - market per numerose nuove applicazioni e servizi basati su internet con esperienze utente entusiasmanti .
Nokia e altri produttori presenteranno nel corso dell ’ anno i primi dispositivi basati su MeeGo .
MeeGo fonde le caratteristiche migliori di Maemo e Moblin per creare una piattaforma aperta per architetture multiple di processori .
La piattaforma si basa sulle capacità del sistema operativo core Moblin e sulla sua potenzialità di supportare un’ampia gamma di dispositivi , unita al successo di Maemo nel settore mobile , all 'applicazione
Qt ampiamente adottata , e al framework di interfaccia utente per gli sviluppatori di software .
MeeGo inoltre fonde i forti ecosistemi di applicazioni Maemo e Moblin e le comunità open source .
Per gli sviluppatori MeeGo amplia la gamma di segmenti di dispositivi target per le loro applicazioni .
L’utilizzo di
Qt per lo sviluppo delle applicazioni significa che potranno scrivere le applicazioni una volta sola e distribuirle su MeeGo e altre piattaforme , come ad esempio Symbian .
Ovi Store sarà il canale attraverso cui verranno commercializzati le applicazioni e i contenuti di tutti i dispositivi Nokia , inclusi quelli basati su MeeGo e Symbian , e il Forum Nokia fornirà supporto agli sviluppatori per tutte le piattaforme dei dispositivi Nokia .
Attraverso l’AppUpSM
Center di Intel verranno commercializzati i dispositivi MeeGo basati su Intel di altri produttori e il programma Intel Atom Developer Program fornirà supporto per le applicazioni per dispositivi di diverse categorie .
La piattaforma
MeeGo che funzionerà su dispositivi ad alto livello di performance proporrà tutta una gamma di esperienze utente internet , informatiche , e di comunicazione caratterizzate da una grafica ricca , da capacità multitasking e multimedia e dalla migliore performance delle applicazioni .
MeeGo funziona su diversi tipi di dispositivo consentendo pertanto agli utenti di mantenere le loro applicazioni preferite quando cambiano dispositivo in modo da non rimanere forzatamente legati ad un tipo di dispositivo o a un determinato produttore .
La prima release di MeeGo è prevista per il secondo trimestre di quest ' anno .
Acer Liquid e : nuova versione con Android 2.1 Al MWC 2010 Asus ha annunciato una nuova versione del suo smartphone Asus Liquid .
Il nuovo modello , contraddistinto da una " e " , integra Android 2.1 anzichè la precedente versione 1.6 , tuttavia la CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon continua ad essere undercloccata a 768MHz anzichè 1GHz .
Da segnalare il display WVGA da 3,5 pollici , una fotocamera da 5 MegaPixel con AutoFocus , GPS integrato , WiFi , Bluetooth 2.0 , 256MB di RAM , accelerometro , jack 3.5 mm e supporto per HSDPA a 7.2 Mbps .

Proprio negli istanti in cui sto scrivendo questo paragrafo , Microsoft sta mostrando in diretta ( al link che trovate appena qui sopra ) le potenzialità del nuovo sistema operativo Windows Mobile 7 , per i futuri smartphone " Windows Phone " .
Molto accattivante l'interfaccia grafica , completamente rivista e adesso dotata di gradevoli effetti e GUI simili a quelli di Zune HD , il player Microsoft attualmente disponibile soltanto per il mercato americano .
Probabilmente l'unica critica , a mio avviso , riguarda l'enorme somiglianza con molte delle feature software ed hardware offerte da Android ...
Microsoft ha deciso di integrare nei Windows Phone 7
Series un'esperienza web a tutto tondo , contando su aggiornamenti in tempo reale provenienti dai social network più famosi e riportati in appositi widget presenti in homepage .
E' stato Steve Ballmer , Microsoft CEO , a svelare la prossima generazione dei Windows Phone .
Con questa nuova piattaforma software , Microsoft offre un nuovo approccio al software per smartphone , che si distingue per un design elegante ed un'esperienza utente che racchiude navigazione web ed applicazioni .
I primi prodotti basati su Windows Mobile 7 saranno disponibili a partire da questa estate .
Ogni Windows Phone 7
Series integra tre pulsanti : " back " , " start " e " find " , quest ' ultimo collegato al motore di ricerca
Bing per effettuare ricerche locali o via web .
Microsoft ha focalizzato la sua attenzione sulla " social experience " , sulla visualizzazione di immagini , il videogaming , musica , video , marketplace e strumenti di ufficio ( tra cui Office , OneNote ed Outlook ) .
HTC Desire : il Nexus One " completo " con interfaccia Sense e Flash Ormai è noto : Google Nexus
One è uno smartphone che il colosso dei motori di ricerca ha commissionato ad HTC , inserendo al suo interno l'ultima versione del sistema operativo Google Android .
Nel frattempo , si vociferava circa l'uscita di un " Nexus " proprio di HTC .
Notizie vere , poichè la stessa HTC ha appena presentato al MWC 2010 il modello HTC Desire , che integra su Android l'interfaccia Sense e TouchWiz .
Desire è simile a Nexus One , anzi , più completo .
la CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon da 1GHz sarà lieta di mostrare sul display da 3,7 pollici AMOLED le brillanti animazioni scaturite da tocchi multitouch .
La trackball è stata rimpiazzata da un più elegante trackpad , tuttavia ciò che colpisce maggiormente è l'aspetto software : non solo la versione aggiornata dell ' interfaccia Sense ma anche il modulo Friend Stream , nonchè ( udite udite ) la compatibilità con il Flash 10.1 .
Il lato oscuro di questo terminale è la disponibilità : sarà presto acquistabile in Nord America , tuttavia il rilascio è un'incognita per l'Europa e l'Asia ( si parla del secondo quadrimestre del 2010 ) .
Resta adesso da capire cosa offrirà Supersonic , altro terminale di punta di HTC ( ancora più performante ) , e se tale prodotto verrà rilasciato prima in Europa .
Riporto , di seguito , il video promozionale di HTC Desire : Sony Ericsson annuncia ( ma non al MWC ) di aver rifiutato di progettare il Nexus One Da poco riportata su Engadget.com una notizia decisamente " pepata " che riguarda in prima persona Sony Ericsson e Google .
Bert Nordberg , CEO di Sony Ericsson , ha tenuto nella giornata di avantieri una interessante conferenza al MWC 2010 di Barcellona , spiegando quali novità l'Azienda che egli pilota vuole proporre , a partire dalle prossime settimane , sul mercato worldwide .
( Stranamente ) non al MWC ma durante un'intervista ad una rivista svedese , Nordberg ha rivelato una notizia - scoop : Google , infatti , si sarebbe dapprima rivolta a Sony Ericsson per la progettazione del suo Nexus One , ma l'Azienda avrebbe rifiutato sonoramente tale proposta .
Per questo Google ha deciso di " ripiegare " con HTC .
Un secco " NO " , quello di Sony Ericsson , derivante da politiche aziendali ben definite : " Sony Ericsson is committed to building only its own - branded hardware and will not be a subcontractor to anyone " , questo ciò che il CEO lascia trapelare .
Motivazione dunque derivante dal fatto di non voler essere " sotto a nessuno " nè " subappaltare " brand o prodotti di telefonia restando sempre fedele ai propri telefoni dal brand Sony Ericsson .
Scelta condivisibile , tuttavia a mio avviso non completamente ortodossa in termini di evoluzione di Sony Ericsson .
In primo luogo , infatti , la vicinanza ad un colosso come Google avrebbe fatto solo bene ( rafforzando i rapporti con chi offre Android , non dimentichiamolo ... ) .
Da tenere ben a mente , inoltre , proprio il discorso Android : senza Google , Sony Ericsson ha progettato Xperia X10 che tuttavia non offrirà assolutamente l'ultima versione dell 'OS in questione ( 2.1 ) bensì soltanto la versione 1.6 , così come confermatomi in QUESTA intervista rilasciata da Sony Ericsson ad InformaticaEasy .
net che probabilmente avrete già avuto modo di leggere .

HOLIDAY
Inn will trial a free five - minute human bed warming service - where a member of staff , dressed head to foot in an all - in - one sleeper suit , warms up the bed until it 's nice and toasty .
" Like having a giant hot water bottle in your bed " is how Holiday Inn spokeswoman Jane Bednall described the idea .
Dr Chris Idzikowski , director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre , said the idea actually could help people drop off to sleep .
" There 's plenty of scientific evidence to show that sleep starts at the beginning of the night when body temperature starts to drop , ” he said .
" A warm bed - approximately 20 to 24C ( 68 - 75 F ) - is a good way to start this process whereas a cold bed would inhibit sleep .
" Holiday Inn 's new bed warmers service should help people achieve a good night 's sleep , especially as it's taking much longer for them to warm up when they come in from the snow . "

White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs just responded to a letter sent today from House Republican Leader John Boehner and House Republican Whip Eric Cantor regarding the proposed bipartisan health care summit :
The President is adamant that we seize this historic moment to pass meaningful health insurance reform legislation .
He began this process by inviting Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House on March 5 of last year , and he ’s continued to work with both parties in crafting the best possible bill .
He ’s been very clear about his support for the House and Senate bills because of what they achieve for the American people : putting a stop to insurance company abuses , extending coverage to millions of hardworking Americans , getting control of rising premiums and out - of - pocket costs , and reducing the deficit .
The President looks forward to reviewing Republican proposals that meet the goals he laid out at the beginning of this process , and as recently as the State of the Union Address .
He ’s open to including any good ideas that stand up to objective scrutiny .
What he will not do , however , is walk away from reform and the millions of American families and small business counting on it .
The recent news that a major insurer plans to raise premiums for some customers by as much as 39 percent is a stark reminder of the consequences of doing nothing .

12:53 pm - 100 Words : It All Points to You
Officer , this is going to sound nuts but let me explain .
For two years , I ’ve been working on a project for the military to store small inanimate items in an extra- dimensional space , so soldiers on the battlefield do n’t have to carry everything with them .
Food , flashlight , gun : all stored in No - Space until needed .
But I had a little accident with the prototype and now it ’s activating randomly .
So while I ’m not saying I did n’t shoot all those people , I * am * saying it ’s not exactly my fault .
The gun keeps phasing back in , firing , then disappearing off into …
** BANG **
… Officer ?
Shiiiiiiiit .

For consideration : " The gun 's in my hand and I know it looks bad but believe me I 'm innocent "
La Nina – The Underappreciated Portion Of ENSO
Guest post by Bob Tisdale
Perform a Google Scholar search for documents including “ El Nino ” in quotes and there will be more than 200,000 results .
On the other hand , “ La Nina ” will only raise 26,000 +.
Granted , the formal name of the coupled ocean - atmosphere phenomenon in the tropical Pacific is “ El Nino - Southern Oscillation ” , but that in quotes only returns 28,000 + results .
So it appears that El Nino events do get much more “ press ” from the scientific community than La Nina events .
Figure 1 is a time - series graph of NINO3.4 SST anomalies from January 1979 to January 2010 .
El Nino events are a warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific so they are displayed as a Positive SST anomaly , where La Nina events are a Negative .
Visually , is the eye drawn to the upward spikes more than it is to the downward troughs ?
El Nino events are viewed as being larger in magnitude than La Nina events .
NINO3.4 SST anomalies peaked at approximately 2.8 deg C during the Super El Nino events of 1982/83 and 1997/98 , while the La Nina events that followed them failed to reach - 2 deg C . But the La Nina events of 1988/89 and 2007/08 were stronger than the El Nino events that preceded them .
( Refer to the note about base years at the end of this post . )
http://i48.tinypic.com/dpikxz.png
Figure 1
El Nino events release heat from the tropical Pacific , and through ocean currents and changes in atmospheric circulation , they raise surface temperatures outside of the tropical Pacific .
These upward spikes in global temperatures , Figure 2 , call attention to El Nino events during periods when global temperatures are rising .
During La Nina events , the tropical Pacific releases less heat than normal , and global temperatures decline , which does n’t have the same visual impact .
http://i45.tinypic.com/28wjsdy.png
Figure 2
La Nina events are a vital portion of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation coupled ocean - atmosphere process .
La Nina events recharge the heat released from the tropical Pacific during the El Nino .
Figure 3 is a graph of Tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content compared to scaled NINO3.4 SST anomalies .
Note that most La Nina events do not fully recharge the heat released by the El Nino events .
From 1976 to 1994 , tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content dropped almost continuously , with occasional major dips and rebounds as an El Nino discharged heat and the subsequent La Nina partially recharged it .
Then , the 1995 / 96 La Nina event , one that was not particularly strong , replaced all of the heat that had been released ( plus some ) over that 18 - year stretch .
http://i46.tinypic.com/2vja1z5.png
Figure 3
THE 1995/96 LA NINA PROVIDED THE FUEL FOR THE NEXT EL NINO
During a La Nina event , tropical Pacific trade winds rise above normal levels .
The increase in trade winds reduces cloud cover .
Reduced cloud cover allows more Downward Shortwave Radiation ( visible light ) to warm the tropical Pacific .
These coupled ocean - atmosphere processes associated with La Nina events were discussed in the post More Detail On The Multiyear Aftereffects Of ENSO – Part 2 – La Nina Events Recharge The Heat Released By El Nino Events AND … During Major Traditional ENSO Events , Warm Water Is Redistributed Via Ocean Currents ” .
As noted above , the 1995 / 96 La Nina was not a strong event , yet it recharged all of the ocean heat that had been released in almost two decades of El Nino events .
In “ Genesis and Evolution of the 1997 - 98 El Niño ” [ Science 12 February 1999 : Vol. 283. no. 5404 , pp. 950 – 954 , DOI:10.1126/science.283.5404.950 ] , Michael McPhaden explains , “ For at least a year before the onset of the 1997 – 98 El Niño , there was a buildup of heat content in the western equatorial Pacific due to stronger than normal trade winds associated with a weak La Niña in 1995 – 96 . ”

Link to NOAA copy of McPhaden ( 1999 ) :

So there was a short - term recharge of tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content in 1995 / 96 , which is very evident in Figure 3 .
And this short - term buildup of heat content provided the fuel for the 1997/98 El Nino .
Contrary to the beliefs of anthropogenic warming proponents the 1997/98 El Nino was NOT fueled by a long - term accumulation of heat from manmade greenhouse gases .
AND THAT 1997/98 EL NINO WAS CALLED THE EL NINO OF THE CENTURY
The 1997/98 El Nino was strong enough to temporarily raise Global Lower Troposphere Temperature anomalies ~0.7 deg C , as illustrated in Figure 4 .
Note :
The period of 1995 to present was used in the following graphs because there have been no explosive volcanic eruptions since 1995 to add unwanted noise to the data .
http://i47.tinypic.com/21nnu4z.png
Figure 4
And referring to Figure 5 , Lower Troposphere Temperature anomalies of the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere rose , but remained at elevated levels that varied well above the value in late 1996 .
This upward step ( and a similar but smaller one caused by the 1986 / 87/88 El Nino ) was discussed in the post “ RSS MSU TLT Time - Latitude Plots … Show Climate Responses That Cannot Be Easily Illustrated With Time - Series Graphs Alone ” .
http://i48.tinypic.com/33p6nbn.png
Figure 5
Sea Surface Temperature anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere also rose and remained at an elevated level .
Refer to Figure 6 , which compares that dataset to scaled NINO3.4 SST anomalies .
The latitudes used for the SST anomalies in this illustration are 20N - 65N , which are latitudes that have little impact from polar ice .
This upward step in the Sea Surface Temperature anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere will be discussed in a future post .
I have , however , discussed the impacts of El Nino events on the North Atlantic in the post There Are Also El Nino - Induced Step Changes In The North Atlantic .
And the North Atlantic is also impacted by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation , but that appears to have peaked in 2005 .
http://i46.tinypic.com/2ylpix3.png
Figure 6
And for those wondering how well the SST and TLT anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere correlate , I ’ve prepared Figure 7 .
The SST anomaly data were scaled by a factor of 1.8 .
There are divergences from year to year , but keep in mind that the coverage areas are very different ; the TLT anomalies also include data over continental land masses .
One thing is certain ; the 1997/98 El Nino caused upward steps in both datasets .
http://i49.tinypic.com/2uo2o8y.png
Figure 7
And there are the impacts of the 1997/98 El Nino on the East Indian and West Pacific Oceans ( 60S -65N , 80E - 180 ) , which I first discussed in a series of posts more than a year ago .
The 1997/98 El Nino shifted Sea Surface Temperature anomalies upward in this area of the global oceans , too .
Refer to Figure 8 .
The cause of this was discussed in the posts Can El Nino Events Explain All of the Global Warming Since 1976 ?
– Part 1 and Can El Nino Events Explain
All of the Global Warming Since 1976 ?
– Part 2 .
http://i48.tinypic.com/2qamu88.png
Figure 8
Basically , the warm water that was built up during the 1995 / 96 La Nina collected below the surface of an area in the western tropical Pacific known as the Western Pacific Warm Pool ( to depths of 300 meters ) .
During the 1997/98 El Nino , the warm water contained in the Western Pacific Warm Pool sloshed east and spread across the surface of the central and eastern tropical Pacific .
The warmer - than - normal waters raised Sea Surface Temperatures and changed atmospheric circulation .
Then , as the La Nina of 1998/99/00/01 progressed , the trade winds , Pacific Equatorial Currents , and a phenomenon known as a Rossby wave returned the remaining surface and subsurface warm water to the western Pacific .
Some of the warm water returned to the Pacific Warm Pool , but a major portion of it remained on the surface and was redistributed by ocean currents to western North and South Pacific , and a portion of the warm water migrated to the Eastern Indian Ocean .
BLAME THE 1995/96 LA NINA FOR THE RECORD TEMPERATURES DURING THE 2000s AND IN 2010
So , if you ’re wondering why the present moderate El Nino event of 2009 / 10 is raising global temperatures to record levels , you have to go back in time .
The 1995 /96 La Nina provided the build - up of warm waters that was then discharged by the 1997/98 El Nino and redistributed by the 1998/99/00/01 La Nina .
The end results were upward steps in SST anomalies and TLT anomalies for major portions of the globe .
One of the methods anthropogenic global warming advocates ( scientists and bloggers ) use to illustrate the assumed effects of greenhouse gases on global temperatures is to illustrate the divergence between the linear trends of global temperatures and a scaled ENSO index such as NINO3.4 SST anomalies .
Refer to Figures 9 and 10 .
But the upward steps illustrated in Figure 5 and 6 bias global temperature data upwards .
http://i46.tinypic.com/2vsl2mr.png
Figure 9
##############
http://i50.tinypic.com/2d7j0ux.png
Figure 10
And the biases created by those step changes in the SST and TLT anomalies of the Mid- To - High Latitudes of Northern Hemisphere are responsible for much of the differences between NINO3.4 SST anomalies and global temperature anomalies .
We can illustrate this looking at the data for the rest of the world ; that is , by comparing the linear trend of NINO3.4 SST anomalies with the linear trends the TLT and SST anomalies for the tropics and the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere .
Refer to Figures 11 and 12 .
As shown , the linear trends of the NINO3.4 SST anomalies are slightly negative , but the linear trends for the SST and TLT anomalies of the tropics and Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere are relatively flat–much flatter than the global datasets .
http://i50.tinypic.com/vsn97q.png

Figure 12
That would mean the ENSO - induced step increases in SST and TLT anomalies of the Mid- To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere caused the vast majority of the positive linear trends for the global SST and TLT anomaly datasets .
See Figures 13 and 14 , which show the strengths of the positive trends for those areas of the globe .

Figure 14
Figures 15 and 16 compare the SST and TLT anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere to the Global data and to the SST and TLT anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere .
It should now be clear that the majority of the rises in Global SST and TLT anomalies since 1995 were caused by the 1997/98 El Nino - induced upward steps in the SST and TLT anomalies for the Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere .

Figure 16
In short , the effects of the La Nina - and El Nino - induced step changes in the SST and TLT anomalies of Mid-To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are mistaken for , and misrepresented as proof of , anthropogenic global warming .
A BRIEF LOOK AT AN EARLIER LA NINA EVENT
The 1972/73 El Nino was a strong ENSO event .
NINO3.4 SST anomalies , referring to Figure 17 , peaked above 2 deg C .
There were only two El Nino events stronger than the 1972/73 El Nino in the second half of the 20th Century , and they were the two Super El Nino events of 1982/83 and 1997/98 .
http://i46.tinypic.com/29krqd2.png
Figure 17
But the 1972/73 El Nino shares another superlative with the 1997/98 El Nino .
Both El Nino events were followed by La Nina events that lasted through not one ENSO season , not two ENSO seasons — they lasted through three consecutive ENSO seasons .
The La Nina event of 1998/99/00/01 recharged the heat content released by the 1997/98 El Nino and returned the tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content to the new higher levels established during the 1995 / 96 La Nina .
Refer to Figure 18 .
The La Nina event of 1973/74/75/76 recharged the heat released from the Tropical Pacific by El Nino events during the decade of the early 1960s to the early 1970s .
And it also added to the Tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content .
http://i46.tinypic.com/2vja1z5.jpg
Figure 18
The Pacific Climate Shift of 1976 /77 is a much - studied phenomenon .
Trenberth et al ( 2002 ) discussed the differences in the evolution of El Nino events before and after the shift , and Trenberth et al ( 2002 ) referenced other papers that discussed effects of the Pacific Climate Shift on ENSO .
Link to Trenberth et al ( 2002 ) :
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/papers/2000JD000298.pdf
El Nino events became stronger after the Pacific Climate Shift .
The frequency of El Nino events and El Nino Modoki increased .
As noted in an early post , The 1976 Pacific Climate Shift , there were notable shifts in the SST anomalies and linear trends of Pacific Ocean basin subsets .
But I have yet to find a paper that attributes the Pacific Climate Shift of 1976 / 77 to the La Nina event of 1973/74/75/76 or one that even suggests that the 3 - year - long La Nina played a role .
Yet through known coupled ocean - atmosphere processes , the 1973/74/75/76 La Nina increased the warm water available for the additional El Nino events after 1976 and for the significant El Nino events of 1982/83 and 1986/87/88 .
The explosive volcanic eruption of El Chichon may have counteracted the Super El Nino of 1982 / 83 , but the 1986/87/88 El
Nino was strong enough to cause upward shifts in the SST and TLT anomalies of the Mid- To - High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , and the SST anomalies of the East Indian and West Pacific Oceans , similar to the shifts caused by the 1997/98 El Nino illustrated in this post .
A NOTE ABOUT BASE YEARS
Note :
The relative strengths of El Nino versus La Nina events discussed early in this post would of course depend on the base years chosen for anomalies .
And as illustrated in Figure 17 there is a minor difference depending on whether the base years of 1950 to 1979 or 1979 to 2000 are used .
The significance of the difference would depend on how the data is being used .
Example : A scaled running total of NINO3.4 SST anomalies will reproduce the basic global temperature anomaly curve as illustrated in Reproducing Global Temperature Anomalies With Natural Forcings if the base years are 1950 to 1979 .
If the base years of 1979 to 2000 are used , the result will not be similar to the global temperature curve .

Figure 19
CLOSING COMMENT
The La Nina event of 1973/74/75/76 provided the tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content necessary for the increase in strength and frequency of El Nino events from 1976 to 1995 .
The 1995 /96 La Nina furnished the Ocean Heat Content that served as fuel for the 1997/98 El Nino .
And the 1998/99/00/01 La Nina recharged the tropical Pacific Ocean Heat Content after the 1997/98 El Nino , returning it to the new higher level established by the La Nina of 1995 / 96 .
It would appear that La Nina events do all of the work , while El Nino events get all the glory — and the research .

ExxonMobil ’s acquisition of XTO only seems dramatic to those who have not paid attention to the company ’s strategy and change in project mix over the past decade .
Its portfolio consisted of 75 % unconventional resources before the XTO acquisition ( Figure 1 ) with a strong emphasis on tight , acid and sour gas , LNG , and heavy oil projects .
Tim Cejka , President of ExxonMobil Exploration Company , told The Wall Street Journal last year that his company has been “ bullish ” on shale plays since 2003 ( Wall Street Journal , July 13 , 2009 ) .
David Rosenthal , ExxonMobil Vice President of Investor Relations recently said , “ It ’s not a strategic shift ” ( Houston Chronicle , February 2 , 2010 ) .
Most analysts believe that the ExxonMobil acquisition of XTO Energy ( XTO ) represents a dramatic shift in strategy by the premier exploration and production ( E&P ) company , and a validation of shale plays .
It is neither .
The move represents a considered and deliberate choice that acknowledges diminished opportunities for the oil giant to add and replace reserves .
The acquisition acknowledges that natural gas is the only viable short - term solution to North America ’s energy needs , and that demand will grow .
It implies that ExxonMobil believes that higher natural gas prices will be part of that energy future .
It presumes that the company can improve on the flawed manufacturing model that has dominated the way that U.S. shale plays have been pursued .
The Company has pursued tight gas plays in Colorado ’s Piceance basin and in Hungary ’s Mako Trough for many years .
It announced its entry in a shale play in Canada ’s Horn River basin in 2009 .
It leased 20,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale play in 2008 , and now has a joint venture with Pennsylvania General Energy that covers 290,000 acres in that play .
ExxonMobil also maintains an ongoing commitment to oil sands in Canada .
Reserves
The main driver for the XTO acquisition was reserves , particularly in natural gas .
Increasingly , ExxonMobil has had difficulty replacing reserves along with most major oil companies .
The worst years ever for reserve replacement were 2007 , 2008 and 2009 ( Figure 2 ) .
While 2008 additions were officially 103 % of production , without the contribution of oil sands , which the SEC does not consider reserves , replacement was only 27 % ( LaVine , 2009 ) .
Two - thirds of 2009 reserve replacement came from LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea that were discovered years ago , but completion of processing facilities allowed the additions last year .
The truth is that unconventional gas is the only scalable resource that exists for E&P companies that need large annual reserve additions to support their stock price .
New SEC definitions allow more latitude in booking reserves especially in the proved undeveloped category for natural gas .
International Risks
Another important motive for the acquisition is the company ’s belief that overseas opportunities now carry too much political risk .
These projects are too costly and competitive , and the prize no longer justifies the effort .
The XTO purchase , therefore , represents another stage in the transformation from an integrated oil company to a capital and service provider .
Integrated majors traditionally produced oil and added value by refining it into petroleum and chemical products .
In recent years , they have focused increasingly on providing services like building plants and processing LNG for exporting nations , where they add value by providing capital and efficiency .
ExxonMobil ’s entry into the North American unconventional gas sector moves the focus of the capital and service provider another important step away from the international arena .
Demand Growth and Gas Price
XTO has important acreage in all shale gas plays , but it would be incorrect to overstate its position as a shale gas producer .
Eighty - three percent of its production is from tight gas , conventional gas and coal - bed methane reservoirs , with the remaining 17 % from shale gas .
It has positions in all major natural gas basins in the U.S. ( Figure 3 ) .
The Powder River , Green River , Uinta - Piceance and San Juan basins contain no current shale plays .
The Permian , Anadarko , Arkoma , East TX - Arkla , and Gulf Coast basins contain both shale and conventional plays .
Only the Appalachian - Marcellus is exclusively a shale play basin .
ExxonMobil expects that natural gas demand will increase in the future , and much of the corresponding supply growth will come from unconventional gas ( Figure 4 ) .
I assume that the company also believes that prices will be higher -- perhaps much
higher -- in the future .
This is because the current marginal cost of gas production is at least $ 8 / Mcf , and prices will eventually rise to meet that cost ( Figure 5 ) .
If shale gas reserves have been overstated , that unit cost will rise accordingly .
The price of oil , moreover , is likely to increase substantially as oil - exporting countries use more of their subsidized production at home to meet the needs of developing economies and growing populations .
While oil and gas prices are not always linked , higher oil costs will drive North America to rely increasingly on indigenous natural gas supplies .
This will probably mean higher prices as more costly unconventional resources are tapped to balance this market .
Growing emphasis on clean energy sources will further reinforce these supply , demand and cost imperatives .
Carbon tax schemes will also push the price higher .
Supply Reality
The widespread belief that there is 100 years of natural gas supply in the U.S. because of shale plays is incorrect .
Claims that shale gas has resulted in 100 years of supply are based on circular references without underlying documentation , and also do not take high decline rates or anticipated future demand growth into account .
The Potential Gas Committee ( PGC ) estimated 1,836
Tcf of technically recoverable gas resources for the U.S. in its report released in June 2009 .
Along with proved reserves of 238 Tcf , there are 2,074 Tcf or 85 years of total supply based on current demand of 25 Tcf per year ( EIA ) .
The contribution of shale gas is 661 Tcf , or about one - third of the total technically recoverable resource ( Figure 6 ) .
The PGC estimate of probable resource volume is 441 Tcf , or about 18 years of supply .
Shale gas accounts for one - third of that amount , or 147 Tcf , which is about 6 years of supply at current U.S. demand .
Winner ’s Curse and a Return to Basics
ExxonMobil ’s approach to evaluating and entering unconventional gas plays was antithetic to the manufacturing model .
I believe it was comprehensive and systematic , and involved evaluation of major risk elements of the total petroleum system for all North American basins .
The Company revealed its North American emphasis in 2007 when Kurt Rudolph , Chief Geoscientist , gave a keynote address at the AAPG Annual Meeting in Long Beach , California .
Rudolph ’s talk , “ Current Exploration Trends : Prudent Investments or Irrational Exuberance , ” described his company ’s world view that there were few attractive international opportunities that had not already been captured .
State oil companies held all the cards , and were offering concessions that had been recycled over the past 25 years of exploration .
Remaining prospects in the international arena were relatively small , because most available blocks were in their second or third phase of appraisal , and fiscal terms were unattractive .
Rudolf called this the “ winner ’s curse , ” because if you win a bid round in today ’s environment , you lose because the prize does n’t justify the cost ( World Oil , April 2008 ) .
ExxonMobil decided to focus its petroleum - system and basin - analysis evaluation methods and technologies in North American basins where risks and costs were lower , and where financial returns were more immediate .
The result was a deliberate and comprehensive assessment and ranking of both conventional and unconventional natural gas opportunities .
When XTO approached ExxonMobil about a merger ( Form S - 4 Exxon Mobil Corp , February 1 , 2010 ) , its existing production and exploration positions must been deemed a good fit based on ExxonMobil ’s study .
Multi Zone Fracture Stimulation Technology ( MZST ) and Piceance Basin Tight Gas
ExxonMobil has developed proprietary technologies that allow them to do 50 individual fracture stimulations in a vertical hole on one run called MZST .
It has found other technologies to accelerate the drilling and zone perforating processes ( Figure 7 ) .
The Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado has been the laboratory for this technology where ExxonMobil has about 3,000 acres in the Piceance Creek - Love Ranch Field area .
Gas production in the Piceance Basin is from low permeability Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs .
If ExxonMobil can successfully drill and complete vertical shale wells with comparable or better results than with horizontal wells , this would indeed be a breakthrough .
The Fallacy of the Manufacturing Model
Operators represent shale plays as low - to no-risk ventures in which gas is ubiquitous , and success can be achieved and repeated through horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation .
They have developed a manufacturing model for these plays in which the fundamental elements of petroleum geology - - trap , reservoir , charge and seal - - are not critical .
This appealing model has not been supported by production results .
ExxonMobil probably sees a competitive advantage in taking a different approach than competitors who embrace the manufacturing model .
The manufacturing model developed in the Barnett Shale play ( Fort Worth basin , Texas ) , where almost 14,000 wells have been drilled .
The greatest number of commercially successful wells are located in two core areas or " sweet spots , " and results are not uniform or repeatable even within these core areas ( Figure 8 ) .
The Barnett Shale play is largely non-commercial because the controls on production are complex and difficult to predict .
The absence of well - defined structural traps greatly increases risk .
Core areas in the Fayetteville and Haynesville shale plays have strong structural control , and have been identified with far fewer wells than in the Barnett play ( Figures 9 and 10 ) .
The overriding problem with most U.S. shale plays is the lack of any elements of natural reservoir rock .
Shale typically has no effective ( connected ) porosity , and have permeabilities that are hundreds to thousands of times less than the lowest permeability tight sandstone reservoirs .
Unless siltstone or sandstone interbeds are present within the shale that have better matrix porosity and permeability , all reservoir is artificial -- it must be created by engineering brute force .
Much progress has been made with completion methods , but unless stimulation produces an extensive , micro- fractured rock face , long - term production at commercial volumes is unlikely .
Different fracture methods must be developed to achieve this result with greater certainty .
Conclusions and Implications
The mainstream belief that shale plays have ensured North America an abundant supply of inexpensive natural gas is not supported by facts or results to date .
The supply is real but it will come at higher cost and greater risk than is commonly assumed .
The arrival of ExxonMobil and other major oil companies on the shale gas scene is positive because they will not follow the manufacturing approach , and will do the necessary science that should make shale plays more commercial .
This does not , however , ensure success .
ExxonMobil has come late to the domestic shale party .
They may have overvalued XTO 's existing wells without fully taking high production decline rates into account .
It is also possible that XTO has already drilled the best areas in more mature shale plays , while the potential of newer plays has not yet been established .
It is unclear how ExxonMobil ’s enormous overhead structure and its associated cost will fit with operating thousands of relatively low - rate gas wells .
ExxonMobil will undoubtedly learn a lot about unconventional plays and operations from XTO staff .
It may be difficult , however , to absorb these employees into the company ’s culture and structure , and retain them , another indication that ExxonMobil may have paid too much .
Despite the new technologies and expertise that they bring , ExxonMobil ’s unconventional project in Colorado has not achieved commercial success , and the company has abandoned its Hungary play after drilling a water - producing well ( Oil and Gas International , February 19 , 2010 ) .
Also , environmental opposition to shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing is gaining momentum especially in the Marcellus Shale play , and the entrance of ExxonMobil will provide activist groups with a large and familiar target .
Shale gas plays will , nonetheless , become a permanent and important part of the E&P landscape .
ExxonMobil ’s acquisition of XTO Energy was based on a deliberate and conscientious evaluation of remaining resource potential in North American basins .
Instead of viewing the XTO acquisition as a validation of shale plays , it should be seen as a repudiation of the wasteful manufacturing approach that has characterized these plays thus far .
I believe that ExxonMobil understands the technical risks and uncertainties in these plays , and has made realistic projections of reserves and costs .
ExxonMobil ’s bet is that efficiency , science and technology will result in commercial success .
They bring abundant capital and little debt to plays that have been dominated thus far by highly leveraged companies .
Inherent in their assessment is the belief that demand will grow and gas prices will rise eventually to meet the marginal cost of production .
It not clear that they fully appreciate the business risks that arise from competitors who will over - produce and keep prices low as long as an undisciplined capital market continues to provide them with money .

Love ‘em or hate ‘em , BioWare is famous for their story heavy RPGs full of conversations , detail and moral choices .
Combine this with a solid third person shooter style of play , some RPG elements and a sci- fi setting and you have Mass Effect .
This style of game play returns in Mass Effect 2 , the sequel to BioWare ’s first critically acclaimed installment in this developing series .
The only difference is almost everything in Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor .
Commander Shepard returns to take on yet another impossible mission .
Hired by the pro-humanity extremist group , Cerberus , Shepard is tasked to find out why a new group of aliens is kidnapping humans by the thousands and stop them .
However , in true Shepard fashion he first has to recruit a rag tag team of misfits to help him on this so called “ suicide mission . ”
There are a few twists to keep you on your toes and there is almost never a dull moment .
What really makes this story great is n’t the over arching storyline , but the huge attention to detail BioWare gives to the Mass Effect universe .
Every character that joins Shepard ’s squad has their own story as well as their own specific mission .
Even the characters
Shepard only briefly interacts with and the planets the team only looks at from orbit have their own back - stories .
This attention to detail is what makes the Mass Effect universe a living , breathing entity instead of just a place to put the action .
When I first started playing Mass Effect 2 I was blown away by how great it looked .
The characters and environments are all very detailed and early on in the game I found myself walking around Omega and the Citadel just looking at everything .
All of the civilized and populated areas are sleek and shiny while all the run down locales look dirty and broken , but still look like they ’re a part of a sci- fi universe .
On rare occasions I noticed when Shepard was talking to someone he would disappear for a few lines only to reappear a little later like nothing has happened .
This happened with a couple other characters as well .
There were also a couple instances of slowdown during cut scenes .
Other than that , the graphics and overall design of this game are nearly flawless .
Like the graphics , the audio in Mass Effect 2 is fantastic .
The soundtrack is made up of a variety of sci - fi themed music depending on where you are .
Whether you ’re in a nightclub listening to the pounding bass , in an epic fight scene with fast paced , high octane music , or just walking around a city listening to the ambience , the music and sound effects fit the game well and are enjoyable to listen to .
What really makes the audio stand out is the voice acting .
Actors from the first game like Mark Meer ( Shepard ) , and Seth Green ( Joker ) return and newcomers like actor , Martin Sheen , who voices the mysterious leader of Cerberus , lend their talents .
The script is extensive with all of the conversation topics available , and every line I came across in the game was well done and believable .
If you played the first Mass Effect , the game play will be mostly familiar to you .
Players are still thrown into high action shooting scenes where , depending on their class , they can gun down enemies or use biotic and tech powers to take them down .
However , things such as managing weapons , armor and side quests have been changed and streamlined .
First off , the shooting works like any competent third person shooter .
The cover system is easy ( and quite useful ) , and at any point during combat you can pause the game to bring up the rotary wheel similar to the one used in Dragon Age : Origins .
This lets you switch out your guns as well as plan biotic and tech attacks for you and your team members to use against your enemies .
There are times when the AI stands out in the open and does absolutely nothing , but luckily it does not happen too often and it is easy enough to tell them to get to cover and continue fighting .
The main difference in the gunplay mechanics from the first Mass Effect is the use of ammunition instead of the guns just overheating when they are used too much .
The limited supply of ammo gives you more incentive you use Shepard ’s and his teammates ’ biotic and tech powers instead of just shooting everything until you ’re the only thing left standing .
That being said , the biotic and tech powers in Mass Effect 2 are infinitely more useful than they were in its predecessor .
Targeting enemies is easy and you can mix and match powers to use together to form strategies for battle .
For example , one teammate can use biotics to pull an enemy out of cover , another teammate can use their tech ability to overload their shields , and Shepard can shoot them down all while they ’re hanging helplessly in the air .
As far as equipment goes , you no longer have an inventory menu .
Instead , the guns you gather throughout the game are only changeable in between missions and sometimes in the middle of a mission .
The armor works in a similar way .
Instead of managing everyone ’s armor , you only have Shepard ’s to worry about .
Throughout the game you will pick up new pieces of armor like shoulder pads or chest plates which all have different power ups , and you can mix and match them to whatever fits your fighting style the best .
This streamlines the tedious act of rummaging through your armor and weapons and gives the game a more realistic feel of only having what ’s on your back as opposed to bringing your entire cargo hold with you on every little side mission .
Speaking of side missions , remember the Mako ?
If not , do n’t worry about it because Shepard and his crew opt not to use it in this game .
Instead , you fly around to different planets in the Normandy and scan them from orbit .
When you find an anomaly on the planet it means a side quest is waiting for you and you only land on the planet to complete the side quest .
Unlike the first game , the side quests are varied and bring you to many different locales .
Other than that , you excavate resources used for upgrades from orbit by sending probes down to the planet .
This can get a little tedious because the scanner moves rather slow , and there seems to be an over - abundance of one type of resource while the other three are relatively difficult to find in comparison .
The resources you find can be used for upgrading your weapons , armor , teammates and the Normandy .
Most of the upgrades are your standard fair like dealing more damage , taking less damage and holding more ammo .
Some of them apply to everyone , but others only apply to Shepard or other specific team members , so you can choose your upgrades depending on who you want to use in your team .
In addition to the upgrades system you can also level up .
The leveling system is also pretty straightforward and all you have to do is drop skill points in the specific skills you want to level .
The only difference is there are considerably less skills to choose from than there were in the original Mass Effect .
This might seem bad for veteran RPG players , but having fewer skills per character makes each character a valuable addition to your team .
I think what I enjoy most about Mass Effect 2 is its import feature .
This lets you import your Shepard from Mass Effect into Mass Effect 2 .
Doing this gives you a small level boost and a pretty good amount of credits to start off with .
However , what makes this feature great is the fact that you can import your old Shepard ’s look instead of going through the character creator to find the options you chose and it carries over the decisions you made in your play through of Mass Effect .
For example , certain characters may be alive or dead and minor characters from the first game will be around offering their thanks or their scorn depending on what you did to help them or hurt them in the first game .
This adds immense replay value not only for Mass Effect 2 , but for the original as well .
Games as thorough as Mass Effect 2 are few and far between .
The sheer amount of detail that went into the story is phenomenal and with the exception of a few minor technical glitches , the graphics and sound are fantastic .
The new , streamlined style of play makes party management much less tedious and most fans will rejoice in the fact that there is no needless driving around empty planets looking for one random base .
Mass Effect 2 is a complete joy to play and I see myself replaying it a few more times while I wait for Mass Effect 3 .

" But although the Inner Mongolia wall is more modest , it carries the same significance . "
God is Everywhere Hot Cross Spuds and Holy Rollers
Tis the season to see a holy vision .
And not just at church .
Reports of crosses in potatoes and Jesus in a pickup truck have made news around the world .
But religious images on everyday objects , that once made good money for their owners , have lost value as the number of apparent apparitions increases .
RICHMOND , Va. 
Over the last few years , the tiny College of Saint Rose in Albany has seen applications increase at least 25 percent annually , minority admissions rise and its standing in the U.S. News and World Report rankings climb more than 20 rungs .
Its secret ?
Lifting a page from the marketing playbook of credit card companies .
Last fall the college sent out 30,000 bright red “ Exclusive Scholar Applications ” to high school seniors that promised to waive the $ 40 application fee , invited them to skip the dreaded essay and assured a decision in three weeks .
Because the application arrived with the students ’ names and other information already filled in , applying required little more than a signature .
More than 100 other colleges and universities paid the same marketing company to send out variations of these fast - track applications last fall , more than a five - fold jump since 2006 .
Some have spent upward of $ 1 million on their application campaigns , and many have seen their applicant pools double or even triple in the last two years .
Theirs is a roster that includes well - known institutions like Marquette ( which promised a free baseball cap to the first 250 respondents to its “ Advantage Application ” ) ; Rensselaer Polytechnic ( the “ Candidate ’s Choice Application ” ) and the University of Minnesota ( “ the Golden Gopher Fast Application ” ) .
Others that have regional reputations  like the University of the Pacific in Stockton , Calif . ( the “ Distinctive Candidate Application ” )  are hoping to raise their national profiles .

Message claims that attached photographs depict giant works of art created by growing different coloured rice plants in Japanese rice fields .
The information in the message is true .
Although the images may look as if they have been digitally created in an image manipulation program , they are in fact genuine and are indeed created from rice plants as described in the message .
Subject : Rice art
Stunning crop art has sprung up across rice fields in Japan .
But this is no alien creation – the designs have been cleverly planted .
Farmers creating the huge displays use no ink or dye .
Instead , different colours of rice plants have been precisely and strategically arranged and grown in the paddy fields .
As summer progresses and the plants shoot up , the detailed artwork begins to emerge .
A Sengoku warrior on horseback has been created from hundreds of thousands of rice plants , the colours created by using different varieties , in Inakadate in Japan
The largest and finest work is grown in the Aomori village of Inakadate , 600 miles north of Toyko , where the tradition began in 1993 .
The village has now earned a reputation for its agricultural artistry and this year the enormous pictures of Napoleon and a Sengoku - period warrior , both on horseback , are visible in a pair of fields adjacent to the town hall .
More than 150,000 vistors come to Inakadate , where just 8,700 people live , every summer to see the extraordinary murals .
Each year hundreds of volunteers and villagers plant four different varieties of rice in late May across huge swathes of paddy fields .
Detailed Analysis
This set of images circulates via email social media
The message that accompanies the images claims that they depict giant living works of art made by the careful planting of different varieties of rice .
Although the images may look as if they have been digitally created in an image manipulation program , they are in fact real and are indeed created from rice plants as described in the message .
According to an August 2009 article published on Telegraph.co.uk , the rice field art tradition began in the Japanese village of Inakadate in 1993 but has now spread to other areas of Japan .
Villagers and volunteers help plant four varieties of rice that grow in different colours .
The farmers use computers to plan their art before planting so that they know exactly where to place the different coloured rice plants in order to create the giant images .
Planting generally takes place in May and the images look their best by September .
The article notes :
A " disgruntled claimant " was responsible for a fire attack on an insurance office in Darwin that left 15 people injured , police say .
They have described the incident as isolated and terrorism has been ruled out .
Police say a 44 - year - old man wheeled a shopping trolley containing three jerry cans and fireworks through the front door of the TIO ( Territory Insurance Office ) premises in Cavenagh Street about 11:00 am ( ACST ) on Wednesday .
They say he has previously made threats against the company .
" There was a rapid burning fire in the TIO building caused by a male person who entered the office , " Commander Colleen Gwynne said .
" I can confirm he was a dissatisfied claimant .
" This is not a terrorist incident .
Later , she said : " There has been some history between this person that we have in custody and TIO .
" He 's a dissatisfied claimant and there has been involvement with police just recently and TIO to try and work together to deal with some of the issues arising out of some of the threats that he 's been making .
" This particular individual has carried out threats , not only in relation to TIO , but other individuals and agencies as well . "
Fifteen injured people have been treated at the Royal Darwin Hospital .
Five people are in the high dependency unit , but head of the Trauma Response Centre at the Royal Darwin Hospital , Len Notaras , says none are critical .
" All of them are awake , but by the same token they 've been through a very traumatic experience , " he said .
The injured include a policeman who entered the smoke - filled office to rescue people .
He is suffering from smoke inhalation .
' Acts of heroism '
" With these incidents your instinct is to save lives , " Commander Gwynne said .
" And it does n't get more serious than an incident such as this when you have innocent people that are taken by surprise .
" So you always get acts of heroism and that 's what we did hear . "
Police say the alleged attacker surrendered to them after the incident .
" I can tell you he is a Darwin resident , " Commander Gwynne said .
" As I said , he is dissatisfied with TIO .
" For whatever reason I do n't know .
" He seemed to respond by carrying out what seemed to be a very callous act . "
Dr Notaras said the victims suffered burns ranging from superficial to serious .
" We expect that their condition will remain stable , and they may well need to have additional oxygen to assist in their breathing , " he said .
" And in at least one , possibly two , cases they may need to go to theatre , the operating room , to have the burns of the upper limbs , the arms , cleaned . "
The TIO office is inside Darwin's CBD Woolworths complex .
The bomb squad was on the scene shortly after the incident .
The entire shopping complex was evacuated as were neighbouring properties .
' Lit it up '
Emmanuel Gerakios , whose cousin works at TIO , said his cousin suffered smoke inhalation during the incident .
" Someone came in , they were probably distraught or displeased with what happened , " he said .
" They brought in two jerry cans in a shopping trolley and they actually poured it all over the floor and lit it up and they walked outside , they ran and everything went up in smoke . "
A witness who was in the car park said his relative saw the events take place .
" My son - in - law came out , he turned around and saw this tall skinny guy walk in with a trolley full of fuel and firecrackers and set it off .
" He said he stood there for a minute and watched it catch fire and then took off . "
Witness Charmaine Burton was in a meeting nearby when the attack happened .
She told the ABC that she heard " 15 to 20 repetitive ( bangs ) almost like gunshots " .
She said the smoke inside the TIO office was " completely black " and there was a strong smell of diesel or kerosene .
She described how people inside the building had to follow each other 's voices to safety because they were unable to see because of the smoke , with one man calling out " if you can hear me follow my voice " .
TIO 's chief executive , Richard Harding , says details about the man 's motive are not yet known .
" Of course it 's absolutely concerning that he 's a disgruntled complainant .
" At the moment though , we need to work with the police to make sure that [ they ] understand fully what the background to his actions is . "
Five ambulance vehicles were on the scene and Darwin hospital 's burns trauma unit was put on standby .
Louisa Ainsworth was shopping when she heard the explosion .
" I was shopping at Woolworths and then just started hearing all this crashing and banging , sort of like a roof was collapsing and sort of like a little explosion , " she said .
" We just went outside and saw all the smoke and people screaming and running out of TIO . "
The Northern Territory Chief Minister , Paul Henderson , said he was shocked by the incident .
" Darwin remains a tight - knit community and the shock from this incident has reverberated around our city , " he said .

P redictions about future technology law and policy developments are always fraught with uncertainty , yet identifying the key players is a somewhat easier chore .
Although Parliament is not scheduled to resume until March , the following 10 are likely to lead the way in Canada in the coming year :
• Tony Clement , federal Industry Minister .
From anti-spam legislation to the national copyright consultation , Clement demonstrated a keen interest in technology issues during his first year as industry minister .
This year should be no different with privacy reform legislation , a new copyright bill and rules for another wireless spectrum auction all on the agenda .
To top it off , Clement has sent strong signals that he wants to forge ahead with a long - overdue national digital strategy .
• James Moore , federal Heritage Minister .
Young , bilingual , and tech - savvy , Moore broke the mould for a minister of Canadian heritage .
This year will present Moore with at least two highly contentious issues likely to leave many unhappy : copyright reform and fee - for - carriage for television broadcast signals .
• Stockwell Day , federal International Trade Minister .
The link between international trade and tech policy is not immediately obvious , yet two trade initiatives mean that Day may dictate policy ultimately to his cabinet counterparts Clement and Moore .
The anti-counterfeiting trade agreement and the Canada - European Union trade agreement both fall under his mandate and feature detailed intellectual property provisions .
• Peter Van Loan , federal Public Safety Minister .
Van Loan is responsible for Bills C - 46 and C - 47 , the controversial lawful access legislation that died last week with the decision to prorogue Parliament .
Part security , part privacy and part Internet , the legislation likely will be reintroduced and face stiff opposition when it comes before a House of Commons committee in 2010 .
• Charlie Angus , NDP digital affairs critic .
The only opposition member to make the list , Angus is frequently the sole voice on digital policy issues on Parliament Hill .
With the Liberal Party seemingly unable to muster a coherent digital policy , Angus has filled the void by introducing net neutrality legislation , injecting himself into the copyright debate – and providing a consistent voice for artists ' concerns .
• Konrad von Finckenstein , chair of the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
Coming off a busy year , von Finckenstein will remain in the spotlight in 2010 .
The CRTC 's fee - for - carriage decision will become an immediate lightning rod for praise or criticism ( likely both ) , while the commission 's enforcement efforts on the do - not - call registry and net neutrality guidelines will face intense scrutiny .
• Jennifer Stoddart , Privacy Commissioner of Canada .
Stoddart enters the final year of her seven - year term with an opportunity to leave her mark on privacy in Canada .
Her Facebook decision garnered international attention in 2009 , leaving Stoddart with considerable capital to play an influential role on lawful access , privacy reform and anti-spam legislation .
• Ron Kirk , U.S. Trade Representative .
Kirk is the leading figure on U.S. trade policy .
U.S. trade officials will undoubtedly claim that Canadian laws are inadequate and Kirk will therefore maintain maximum pressure on Canada on behalf of U.S. lobby interests .
• David Jacobson , U.S. Ambassador to Canada .
Jacobson had scarcely unpacked after being confirmed to the post this fall before he was criticizing Canadian intellectual property laws .
Working together with Kirk , Jacobson will provide ample evidence that a change in administration does not mean a change in attitude on digital policy .
• Thousands of online Canadians .
Last year demonstrated that Canadians are keenly aware of digital issues and willing to actively voice their views .

Social : power to the people
We 've been thinking about some people we 're proud to know .
People like John Wood , the founder of Room to Read .
John quit Microsoft in 1998 .
Eight years later , he ’s building libraries in rural villages in Nepal with the " scalability of Starbucks and the compassion of Mother Theresa . "
John has written a book about his journey called Leaving Microsoft to Change the World .
Environmental : love your mother
One book that really got us thinking was The Ecology of Commerce , by Paul Hawken .
Paul argues that a true economy mimics ecology in its circular no - waste systems and healthy fecundity of niches .
In a perfect world , we 'd package your books in edible bamboo pouches and load them into Willie Nelson 's biodiesel bus , where he'd hand deliver them with a song .
We ’re not quite there , but we 've got some things we think you 'll like .
Economic : true accounting
As this is the end of the page , it 's a good time to talk about our last bottom line .
We understand the importance of running a profitable enterprise .
But while most businesses answer only to their shareholders , we answer equally to all of our key stakeholders : our employees , our customers , our literacy partners , our investors and the environment .
They provide real time statistics for the amount of money they have raised , and the number of books they 've saved from landfills .
At the time of publication of this post , $ 7,549,897.98 in funds was raised for literacy programs , and 31,860,486 books were saved from landfills .
As someone who advocates the power of stories and their impact on social justice , I am truly inspired by what they are doing .
Take a look around their Web site , they buy used books , and encourage people to set up book drives .
You are reading this because you have been taught to read .
Imagine your world if that never happened .
You understand the power of the written word , and the impact that that words have in the course of life .
Now thanks to BetterWorldBooks you can honor the storied legacy of literacy by sharing it with those who lack access to it , while contributing to the environment and supporting the success of a social business .
After all , the power of the written word has been a force in the history of social change , and now thanks to the internet , it can and will continue to do so in a very progressive way .

KABUL — I was one of the hundreds of young photojournalists who came to this distant country in 2001 to photograph my first war ; naïve , a little reckless , and mostly unprepared .
At the time , the Taliban ruled most of the country .
Only a thin slice of mountainous territory in the north , between Tajikistan and the Panjshir Valley , was controlled by the opposition , the Northern Alliance .
My travel companions were Matthew McAllester , who was then a foreign correspondent for Newsday , and Tyler Hicks , a photographer for The New York Times .
Moises Saman
We rented a Soviet vehicle with four - wheel drive on the Tajikistan border , driven by an Afghan who was chain - smoking hashish , and journeyed south towards the front lines that were just north of Kabul .
As we traversed this rugged country , we seemed to be traveling back in time .
Small roads , deep gorges and ragtag people , one wearing sunglasses with a lens missing , others missing an arm or leg ; homemade checkpoints of just a rope stretched across the road .
No electricity , no telephones , no Internet .
Pitch black at night , the stars the brightest I had ever seen .
Moises Saman
The Afghanistan I know is a land of clashing contrasts , of raw beauty ; its landscape scarred by centuries of wars fought against foreign armies and with itself .
Since 2001 , I have returned over and over again , with the hope of documenting the promise of peace and prosperity made by the latest invading powers .
I soon realized the fragility of this promise and found Afghanistan staring at a precipice , its free fall toward anarchy gaining strength throughout the country , no longer confined to the Pashto - speaking provinces where the Taliban was born and remains entrenched .
The deteriorating security situation is evident all around me on each subsequent visit .
One less safe road to travel on , a labyrinth of blast walls surrounding Kabul , the hostile stare of an innocent child .
For the local population , peace and stability have become a fleeting dream , not a sustainable promise in which their sense of hope finds refuge .
Still , I continue to find myself drawn to this remarkable place and its people , to their unmatched sense of pride on being Afghan , and the hint of dignity and spirit that I find in most of the people I meet here , determined to carry on — however battered their existence .
Moises Saman
This series of photographs represents Moises Saman ‘s personal journey through Afghanistan , witnessing the devastation of the country .
Some of these pictures appeared in “ Afghanistan : Broken Promise ” ( Charta , 2007 ) , by Mr. Saman , with text by Rory Stewart .
The Orion Nebula reveals many of its hidden secrets in a dramatic image taken by ESO ’s new VISTA survey telescope .
The telescope ’s huge field of view can show the full splendour of the whole nebula and VISTA ’s infrared vision also allows it to peer deeply into dusty regions that are normally hidden and expose the curious behaviour of the very active young stars buried there .
VISTA — the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy — is the latest addition to ESO ’s Paranal Observatory ( eso0949 ) .
It is the largest survey telescope in the world and is dedicated to mapping the sky at infrared wavelengths .
The large ( 4.1 - metre ) mirror , wide field of view and very sensitive detectors make VISTA a unique instrument .
This dramatic new image of the Orion Nebula illustrates VISTA ’s remarkable powers .
The Orion Nebula [ 1 ] is a vast stellar nursery lying about 1350 light - years from Earth .
Although the nebula is spectacular when seen through an ordinary telescope , what can be seen using visible light is only a small part of a cloud of gas in which stars are forming .
Most of the action is deeply embedded in dust clouds and to see what is really happening astronomers need to use telescopes with detectors sensitive to the longer wavelength radiation that can penetrate the dust .
VISTA has imaged the Orion Nebula at wavelengths about twice as long as can be detected by the human eye .
As in the many visible light pictures of this object , the new wide field VISTA image shows the familiar bat - like form of the nebula in the centre of the picture as well as the fascinating surrounding area .
At the very heart of this region lie the four bright stars forming the Trapezium , a group of very hot young stars pumping out fierce ultraviolet radiation that is clearing the surrounding region and making the gas glow .
However , observing in the infrared allows VISTA to reveal many other young stars in this central region that can not be seen in visible light .
Looking to the region above the centre of the picture , curious red features appear that are completely invisible except in the infrared .
Many of these are very young stars that are still growing and are seen through the dusty clouds from which they form .
These youthful stars eject streams of gas with typical speeds of 700 000 km / hour and many of the red features highlight the places where these gas streams collide with the surrounding gas , causing emission from excited molecules and atoms in the gas .
There are also a few faint , red features below the Orion Nebula in the image , showing that stars form there too , but with much less vigour .
These strange features are of great interest to astronomers studying the birth and youth of stars .
This new image shows the power of the VISTA telescope to image wide areas of sky quickly and deeply in the near - infrared part of the spectrum .
The telescope is just starting to survey the sky and astronomers are anticipating a rich harvest of science from this unique ESO facility .
[ 1 ] The Orion Nebula lies in the sword of the famous celestial hunter and is a favourite target both for casual sky watchers and astrophysicists alike .
It is faintly visible to the unaided eye and appeared to early telescopic observers as a small cluster of blue - white stars surrounded by a mysterious grey - green mist .
The object was first described in the early seventeenth century although the identity of the discoverer is uncertain .
The French comet - hunter Messier made an accurate sketch of its main features in the mid-eighteenth century and gave it the number 42 in his famous catalogue .
He also allocated the number 43 to the smaller detached region just above the main part of the nebula .
Later William Herschel speculated that the nebula might be “ the chaotic material of future suns ” and astronomers have since discovered that the mist is indeed gas glowing under the fierce ultraviolet light from young hot stars that have recently formed there .
Wikileaks , the whistleblowers ' home , has been temporarily shut down while its management tries to raise funds .
Its tremendous success has meant the site has often struggled under the volume of users .
It has faced down governments , investment banks and the famously litigious Church of Scientology but paying its operating costs ( circa $ 600,000 ) has proved its undoing .
As of today instead of reading government secrets and details of corporate malfeasance all visitors to the site will see is an appeal for cash .
Anyone who cares about freedom of expression should dig deep .
Wikileaks , with its simple " keep the bastards honest " ethos , aims to discourage unethical behaviour by airing governments ' and corporations ' dirty laundry in public , putting their secrets out there in the public realm .
The site won Index on Censorship 's 2008 freedom of expression award because it's an invaluable resource for anonymous whistleblowers and investigative journalists .
Among Wikileaks ' recent triumphs are its publication of top - secret internet censorship lists .
The blacklists from Australia , Thailand , Denmark and Norway demonstrate exactly how censorship systems are abused to suppress free expression .
The Thai list featured sites criticising the country 's royal family and the Australian blacklist turned out to include a school canteen consultancy .
Despite its child porn mandate , less than half of the Australian blacklist were linked to paedophilia .
Also on the list were satanic and fetish sites , anti-abortion websites , and sites belonging to a kennel operator and a dentist .
Publication highlighted the lack of transparency in the process and gave impetus to the " No Clean Feed " campaign which opposes the Australian government 's internet filter proposals .
But Wikileaks is not just a tool for journalists , it allows ordinary Kenyans to read a confidential report detailing the billions their former president allegedly siphoned from the country 's coffers .
Its repository includes controversial military documents including the US rules of engagement in Iraq and an operating manual issued to army officers in Guantánamo Bay .
It has put corporations on notice that the costs of unethical behaviour are immeasurable in PR terms because it amplifies the Streisand effect , the social media phenomenon that punishes those who use the courts to suppress or censor information , by ensuring it has a much wider reach .
Some have dismissed the site as a snooper 's charter .
Many were outraged by its publication of Sarah Palin 's hacked emails which included private email addresses and Palin 's family photographs .
These critics tended to overlook that the emails also provided clear evidence that Palin was using private email accounts for state business .
Wikipedia democratises news and information , allowing the public to access secret information that once would have been limited to the chateratti .
Had the Trafigura case occurred five years earlier , most journalists would have been able to access the secret report at the heart of the case , but Wikileaks enables everyone to read it .
The superinjunction taken out by Trafigura was so comprehensive that of 293 articles about the suppressed report , only 11 dared to link to it or told the public where they could access it .
If Wikileaks did n't exist , it is possible that Trafigura 's management may have clung to their injunction .
For fear of compromising its integrity Wikileaks does n't accept funding from corporations or governments .
Instead , it relies on the public .
If you want to read the exposés of the future , it 's time to chip in .

In Mumbai , trucks delivering water to those who can pay are common
The heat is scorching as the young woman knocks on the window of my taxi , though rather than begging for cash she points at my water bottle , then to her mouth .
In a city where clean water has become a commodity that is delivered to the highest bidder , the poor often have to go without .
Yet those who have money can easily get enough .
In Mumbai 's wealthy suburbs , large tankers delivering water are commonplace .
Every day more than 5,000 tankers deliver some 50 million litres of water to people who can pay , according to unofficial estimates cited by the newspaper Mumbai Mirror .
Water shortages
But even if the wealthy were to go without such top - up deliveries , there would probably not be enough water to go around .
Access to clean drinking water is limited for many in India Mumbai 's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) delivers some 90 litres of water per day to the city 's residents .
That is far short of the 135 litres of water the World Health Organization ( WHO ) says they require for their basic needs .
So in Mumbai , there is growing anger over the water shortages .
Last month , BMC hydraulic engineers ' office was vandalised by activists .
Over the weekend , a man died after violent clashes in the city between police and protestors who demanded better access to water for the disabled .
Global problem
But the lack of access to clean water is by no means merely a problem facing those who live in India 's biggest cities .
This is opening up a complete new market
Tata Chemicals ' managing director R. Mukundan
Tata makes water filter for poor
In the central Indian city of Bhopal , people who live in some of the slums pump drinking water from groundwater contaminated by industrial pollution .
Children who live in the slum play by the filthy and rubbish - strewn river that runs past .
Head out into rural India , and three - quarters of the population does not have access to safe drinking water .
As the population continues to grow the problem is getting worse .
India 's water needs are set to double over the next two decades , according to consultants McKinsey .
Production of rice , wheat and sugar is set to push up demand from Indian agriculture , the consultancy warns .
And the problem is growing , both in India , as well as in China , South Africa and Sao Paulo state in Brazil .
By 2030 , the four areas will account for more than two fifths of the world 's water demand , largely thanks to a sharp rise in food production , McKinsey says .
By then , demand for water will be 40 % higher than it is currently , the consultancy predicts .
Huge market Many in India are looking to the industrialist Ratan Tata for a solution .
For many , filthy rivers provide their only source of water
There are high hopes that he has delivered after Tata Group launched a water purifier that helps curb the spread of water - borne diseases such as cholera , typhoid or diarrhoea .
Tata 's purifier will cost less than 1,000 ( $ 21.50 ; £ 13 ) rupees to buy , half the price of the popular Pureit purifier already being sold by Hindustan Unilever .
Tata Chemicals ' managing director R. Mukundan insists its purifier is unique .
" It does n't compete with any existing product . "
Moreover , he says , " this is opening up a complete new market " - one that is huge and growing .
Although limited access to safe drinking water is a huge problem in India , this is a global problem that affects about a billion people , according to the WHO .
" For the vast majority ... today 's water crisis is not an issue of scarcity , but of access , " the WHO says .

Video : Insect architecture
Fit for the environment ( Image : Image Source / Rex Features )
IN THE heart of Africa ’s savannah lies a city that is a model of sustainable development .
Its buttressed towers are built entirely from natural , biodegradable materials .
Its inhabitants live and work in quarters that are air - conditioned and humidity - regulated , without consuming a single watt of electricity .
Water comes from wells that dip deep into the earth , and food is cultivated self - sufficiently in gardens within its walls .
This metropolis is not just eco-friendly : with its curved walls and graceful arches , it is rather beautiful too .
This is no human city , of course .
It is a termite mound .
Unlike termites and other nest - building insects , we humans pay little attention to making buildings fit for their environments .
“ We can develop absurd architectural ideas without the punishment of natural selection , ” says architect Juhani Pallasmaa of the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland .
As we wake up to climate change and resource depletion , though , interest in how insects manage their built environments is reawakening .
It appears we have a lot to learn .
“ The building mechanisms and the design principles that make the properties of insect nests possible are n’t well understood , ” says Guy Théraulaz of the CNRS Research Centre on Animal Cognition in Toulouse , France .
That ’s not for want of trying .
Research into termite mounds kicked off in the 1960s , when Swiss entomologist Martin Lüscher made trailblazing studies of nests created by termites of the genus Macrotermes on the plains of southern Africa .
It was he who suggested the chaotic - looking mounds were in fact exquisitely engineered eco-constructions .
Specifically , he proposed an intimate connection between …

The space shuttle program is on its way out , but the core of people who built and maintained it will live on .
To honor them , NASA gave its employees the chance to design the patch that will commemorate the shuttle program , which is slated to end in September , after STS - 133 flies .
From the designs of 85 current and former employees , the Shuttle Program Office has selected 15 finalists .
The prospective patches , presented here , will be voted on internally by NASA employees and judged by a small panel .
The program patch will help mark the end of the shuttle era .
Begun rather enthusiastically in the late 1970s , the program almost did n't have mission patches , said Robert Pearlman , the space history and memorabilia enthusiast who brought the internal contest to the public eye .
" In 1976 , the Space Shuttle program designed a patch , called the Space Shuttle Program logo , which was a single triangle , blue and white .
It 's very iconic , " Pearlman said .
" And the original idea was that since the space shuttle as of 1976 was going to fly so many times and so often — every couple weeks — you would n't want or need crew mission patches any longer .
The idea was we'd do away with mission patches . "
But astronauts and other mission members dissented .
By then , the patches had become a popular tradition within NASA , even though they 'd only been used for a little more than a decade .
In the wake of NASA 's 1965 decision not to allow astronauts to name their own vehicles , one astronaut decided that his Gemini V mission needed a patch .
" Gordon Cooper , looking for a way to keep a personal touch to the mission , borrowed something from the military , and created and fought for a patch , " Pearlman said .
His design , prominently featuring a covered wagon , became the first of hundreds of NASA patches .
So , after some wrangling , NASA decided the shuttle missions could have their own patches after all .
The first patch , for STS - 1 , was designed by Robert McCall , a well - known space artist , Pearlman said .
Subsequent works have come together in a variety of ways .
Some have been drawn by the astronauts themselves , others by hangers - on or friends .
Together , they form an odd pictographic record of a program that has been at the center of the world 's premiere space agency for more than 30 years .
One of the 15 entries you see here will be the final installment in the series .
In the patch design at the top of this post , the sunrise / sunset represents the start and finish of the shuttle program , and the stars honor the astronauts who died on Challenger and Columbia .
The artist wrote , " I picked the most dramatic angle of the Shuttle I could find to highlight the magnificence of the most complicated space vehicle in the world . "

Image : NASA
This patch is shaped to reflect the original program 's patch .
Where the original patch showed the shuttle launching toward the top of the triangle , this patch has the shuttle coming in for its last landing .
The 14 white stars serve as a reminder of the astronauts who lost their lives on Challenger and Columbia .
The artist wrote , " The lone gold star at the top of symbolized the excellence achieved by the STS system , its people and the technology developed during this time .
It reminds us to strive for that same kind of excellence in the future of technology development as well as space exploration . "

Rethinking the basis for the Australia Day holiday
In anticipation of tomorrow ’s Australia Day holiday here in Australia , this guest post by John Carmody examines whether or not 26 January is really the most appropriate date for Australia Day .
John Carmody is a Sydney - based writer on medical and cultural history and ( in the interests of full disclosure ) is closely related to the Stubborn Mule .
January 26 is a nettlesome date for the official celebration of the Australian nation and as a commemoration of our colonial foundation .
Apart from the significant nuisance that it falls so close to the end of the holiday season when our minds and emotions are trying to deal with more pressing obligations , it really asks a serious philosophical and moral question .
For indigenous Australians , conscious of their fraught history since 1788 , it is no cause for celebration at all .
Understandably , they consider that it was the beginning of an invasion and see no reason to rejoice in it .
White Australians and , indeed , all immigrants can only respect that attitude ; but we must do that reflectively .
The fact is that there are several distinct reasons to discard 26 January as that festive occasion .
The first point is that the date is not when the founding fleet arrived in Terra Australis : that was , rather , at Botany Bay on 19 - 20 January , 1788 .
It was only because the officers were so disillusioned by how little resemblance that coast bore to Joseph Banks ’s glowing descriptions and because of an indifferent water supply , that Governor Arthur Phillip made a reconnaissance to Port Jackson ( which Captain Cook had not entered ) that the venture was transferred to Sydney Cove .
Even then , in the afternoon of 26 January there was little time for formalities or any grander celebration than hoisting a flag and drinking the health of the King and the success of the colony with a few glasses of Porter , followed by the flourish provided by a round of rifle fire .
Just as members of Parliament do not become ministers when the Premier announces a new Cabinet , but only when sworn - in by the Governor , so it was not until 7 February that the Colony of New South Wales officially began .
This was when the Judge - Advocate , David Collins , publicly read the commission to Phillip which King George III had issued on 25 April 1787 .
At least by early February tents had been erected and the marines ’ band could provide some music and , when the official readings were completed , could intersperse a few bars of “ God save the King ” into the three rifle volleys which the marines produced .
Then , extending that festive atmosphere , as Manning Clark described it in his History of Australia , “ After the ceremony , Phillip invited the officers to celebrate the occasion at a cold collation in his canvas house ” .
It all has a wonderfully Australian improvisatory feel about it , though for many of us that might not of itself be sufficient reason to change the date of the national day .
The real reason , I think , is far more fundamental to our sense of our ethical selves .
This stems from what was included in Phillip ’s royal instructions .
Apart from requiring that there be a public reading of the commission which invested the governor with his considerable powers and at the same time gave detailed orders for the setting up of a court system , the King laid down some remarkable procedures covering the treatment of the native Australians .
“ You are to endeavour by every possible means to open an intercourse with the natives , and to conciliate their affections , enjoining all of our subjects to live in amity and kindness with them .
And if any of our subjects shall wantonly destroy them , or give them any unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several occupations , it is our will and pleasure that you cause such offenders to be brought to punishment according to the degree of the offence ” .
Thus , in June 1790 , Phillip could report to the British government that , “ the settlers have little to apprehend from the natives , against whom I have never thought any defence necessary ” .
Immensely regrettable though it was that so many later settlers were ignorant of that royal command ( perhaps feeling secure in their distance from Sydney , let alone from London ) , and even though there is no denying that those colonists considered that the land was theirs to usurp , official policy was benign in its general intent .
There was none of the official barbarity of the Spanish South American colonies , for instance .
It could be the case , therefore , that a change of our celebration to 7 February might not only be a recognition that this is , historically , the more apt day but it might also be morally beneficial for us all .
It should remind indigenous Australians of what might have been .
Even more important , it could be a regular stimulus to our collective national conscience , an annual reminder of the sentiments which the Prime Minister expressed in Parliament in February 2008 , and a spur to us all to a humbler and more worthy view of our history .

LONDON : British public conviction about the threat of climate change has declined sharply after months of questions over the science and growing disillusionment with government action , a leading poll has found .
The proportion of British adults who believe climate change is '' definitely ' ' a reality has dropped from 44 per cent to 31 per cent in the past year , according to the latest survey by Ipsos Mori .
Overall , about nine in 10 people questioned still appear to accept that some degree of global warming is happening .
But the steep drop in those who have no doubts may mean it will be harder to persuade the public to support action to curb the problem , particularly with higher prices for energy and other goods .
The poll also found a significant drop in those who said climate change was caused by human activities .
A year ago this number was one in three , but this year just one in five people believed global warming to be caused by people , according to Edward Langley , Ipsos Mori 's head of environment research .
One of the world ’s top music trade bodies warned today that the fight against UK BitTorrent tracker OiNK wo n't end with the recent acquittal of its creator and administrator , Alan Ellis .
John Kennedy , chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , said the industry is considering civil proceedings against Ellis in a second bid to collect the £ 180,000 it claims he made from running the invite - only file sharing website .
Speaking at a press conference to launch the IFPI ’s annual Digital Music Report , Kennedy called the verdict a “ terrible disappointment ” and indicated that UK legislation is “ out of touch with where life is these days , ” according to The Guardian .
“ We will find other ways of going about it , ” he said , adding that he “ ca n’t sleep at night ” when he thinks about the money Ellis allegedly gleaned from music freetards .
OiNK was shut down in Oct. 2007 , after police raids in the North of England and the Netherlands , code - named ‘ Operation Ark Royal ’ .
During the case , Ellis argued that he was only offering an indexing service — not unlike Google — and was not responsible for what content the website ’s members were sharing with each other .
The IFPI 's latest annual report tallies that over a quarter of all recorded music industry revenues now come from digital sales , and trade revenues from digital music were up 12 per cent to an estimated $ 4.2 bn in 2009 .
But the report stresses that illegal file - sharing and other forms of online piracy are causing “ severe damage ” to local music industries around the world such as France , Spain , and Brazil .
In France , it claims , a quarter of internet users download songs illegally , causing the number of local album releases to fall from 271 in the first half of 2003 to 107 in the same period of 2009 .
And while sales from burgeoning markets like Apple ’s iTunes and Spotify are promising , they have thus far failed to counter damage from illegal downloads .
“ It would be great to report that these innovations have been rewarded by market growth , more investment in artists , and more jobs .
Sadly , this is not the case , ” said Kennedy in a statement .
“ Digital piracy remains a huge barrier to market growth and is causing a steady erosion of investments in local music . ”

SACRAMENTO — Medical marijuana is a promising treatment for some specific pain - related medical conditions , researchers from the University of California ’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research reported Wednesday .
State - funded studies conducted over the past decade have found marijuana effective by itself or in combination with other drugs for conditions such as nerve pain associated with HIV and muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis .
Although California was the first of 14 states to legalize marijuana ’s medical use , it remains the only state to have spent public money on researching the drug ’s efficacy .
It has been 20 years since the last results of U.S. clinical trials of smoked marijuana .
“ This study confirms all of the anecdotal evidence ” of suffering eased by marijuana , said state Sen. Mark Leno , D - San Francisco .
Leno was joined at a Capitol news conference by researchers and by former state Sen .
John Vasconcellos , D - Santa Clara , who authored the 1999 legislation commissioning this $ 8.7 million worth of research following the 1996 passage of Proposition 215 , which legalized marijuana for medical purposes .
The center ’s director , Dr. Igor Grant , said two more studies are still in progress , to be finished by sometime next year with the $ 400,000 left from the Legislature ’s original appropriation .
After that , he said , the center will remain as an “ administrative entity ” to interact with federal agencies about its research results and to consult with other researchers .
Drug companies have n’t been interested in funding the center ’s research , he said .
Leno said there wo n’t be any more state money coming .
“ I think there was a window of opportunity when Senator Vasconcellos was here , ” he said , but now , even appropriating a few million dollars from the cash - strapped state budget for further research “ would mean something else gets cut even further . ”
But Leno said results from research already conducted should help Congress reopen the debate over “ why the federal government is coming between a doctor and his or her patients ” regarding a drug for which there ’s now more scientific evidence of efficacy .
Red tape
Grant said the research took a long time mostly because of all the federal bureaucracy involved in obtaining marijuana for studies .
“ It ’s just a very cumbersome system and it takes a while to get anything done , ” he said .
California law permits use of marijuana for “ anorexia , AIDS , chronic pain , spasticity , glaucoma , arthritis , migraine , or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief .
Grant acknowledged Wednesday that the center ’s studies touched on only a few of these areas .
“ There may well be other uses , but those should be subject to scientific investigation , too , ” he said , adding that he does n’t believe the research will have any bearing on this year ’s coming battles over a ballot measure and legislation that would legalize marijuana for recreational use .
“ Our focus really has been on medical applications , ” he said .
“ The issue of social and recreational use ?
That ’s for somebody else . ”
Later Wednesday , Drug Policy Alliance California State Director Stephen Gutwillig called the research “ significant and worthwhile . ”
“ But it does n’t fill the enormous vacuum created by the federal government ’s monopoly on the supply of marijuana that can be used in clinical research , ” Gutwillig said .
The only legal source of marijuana for these and other studies is the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which oversees a farm at the University of Mississippi .
More than 80 million Americans live in the 14 states with medical - marijuana laws , Gutwillig noted .
“ That alone cries out for a vast acceleration in research , ” he said .
Short on volunteers
Researchers did n’t find enough participants for a proposed study on combining marijuana with narcotic painkillers for cancer pain relief because it would have required either nine days of hospitalization or 16 weeks without driving .
Another proposed study , on using marijuana to quell nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy , could n’t begin because researchers “ could not identify a sufficient number of patients with sufficiently severe nausea , ” the report says .
“ It appeared that current anti-nausea treatments are often highly effective . ”
And another study , of marijuana use for advanced cancer pain that ’s unresponsive to all other painkillers , had to be scrapped because most patients referred through local hospices “ were often already smoking cannabis for pain control ” without the clinical controls necessary for proper research .

The land around New York City is worth a lot .
A 2008 analysis estimated prices for land , not counting buildings etc. , for most ( ~80 % ? ) of the nearby area ( 2750 square miles , = a 52 mile square ) .
The total New York area land value ( total land times ave price ) was 5.5T$ ( trillion ) in 2002 and 28T $ in 2006 .
The Economist said that in 2002 all developed nation real estate was worth 62T $ .
Since raw land value is on average about a third of total real estate value , that puts New York area real estate at over 30 % of all developed nation real estate in 2002 !
Whatever the exact number , clearly this agglomeration contains vast value .
New York land is valuable mainly because of how it is organized .
People want to be there because they want to interact with other people they expect to be there , and they expect those interactions to be quite mutually beneficial .
If you could take any other 50 mile square ( of which Earth has 72,000 ) , and create that same expectation of mutual value from interactions , you could get people to come there , make buildings , etc. , and sell that land for many trillions of dollars of profit .
Yet the organization of New York was mostly set long ago based on old tech ( e.g. , horses , cars , typewriters ) .
Worse , no one really understands at a deep level how it is organized or why that works so well .
Different people understand different parts , in mostly crude empirical ways .
So what will happen when super - duper smarties wrinkle their brows so hard that out pops a deep math theory of cities , explaining clearly how city value is produced ?
What if they apply their theory to designing a city structure that takes best advantage of our most advanced techs , of 7gen phones , twitter - pedias , flying Segways , solar panels , gene - mod pigeons , and super - fluffy cupcakes ?
Making each city aspect more efficient makes the city more attractive , increasing the gains from making other aspects more efficient , in a grand spiral of bigger gains .
Once they convince the world of the vast value in their super - stupendous city design , wo n’t everyone flock there and pay mucho trillions for the privilege ?
Could n’t they leverage this lead into better theories enabling better designs giving far more trillions , and then spend all that on a super - designed war machine based on those same super insights , and turn us all into down dour super - slaves ?
So is n’t the very mostest importantest cause ever to make sure that we , the friendly freedom fighters , find this super deep city theory first ?
Well , no , it is n’t .
We do n’t believe in a city - ularity because we do n’t believe in a super - city theory found in a big brain flash of insight .
What makes cities work well is mostly getting lots of details right .
Sure new - tech - based cities designs can work better , but gradual tech gains mean no city is suddenly vastly better than others .
Each change has costs to be weighed against hoped - for gains .
Sure costs of change might be lower when making a whole new city from scratch , but for that to work you have to be damn sure you know which changes are actually good ideas .
For similar reasons , I ’m skeptical of a blank - slate AI mind - design singularity .
Sure if there were a super mind theory that allowed vast mental efficiency gains all at once , but there is n’t .
Minds are vast complex structures full of parts that depend intricately on each other , much like the citizens of a city .
Minds , like cities , best improve gradually , because you just never know enough to manage a vast redesign of something with such complex inter-dependent adaptations .

State Sen. David Parks still faces hurdles in Nevada Despite 12 years of service , gay state senator has yet to be completely accepted by electorate
Jacob Kepler
Sun Coverage Sun politics coverage
Satan , execution , public schools , marriage , protests :
This is the stuff of the gay - rights battle as it is manifested around the world right now .
California 's Prop 8 marriage ban is being debated in U.S. District Court — Sen. John McCain 's wife and daughter joined the NOH8 campaign this week , supporting gay marriage , making some gay Obama supporters wonder if they 'd picked the wrong candidate .
Halfway around the world , Uganda is considering executing homosexuals ; in Moscow this week , the mayor called the gay pride parade " satanic . "
But here in Nevada — progressive , human - rights oriented Nevada ? — more than 1,400 same - sex couples have taken advantage of the partnership law that became effective last October , which helps gay couples achieve some of the legal benefits of marriage .
The measure was sponsored by the state 's first openly gay lawmaker , State Sen .
David Parks , D - Las Vegas , an even - keeled , buttoned - up legislator who 's now changing his focus to the Clark County Commission .
He 'll run for Rory Reid 's seat in District G .
When Parks was asked to run for his first elective position in 1996 , an assembly seat , he 'd served four years in the U.S. Air Force , closeted , at Nellis , finished his MBA at UNLV and worked in government finance and computing .
He had no interest in politics .
His neighbor Dina Titus — now Congresswoman Titus — and the UNLV area district's then - retiring assemblyman Larry Spitler sought him out .
He told them , " As you 're well aware , I tote a little excess baggage . "
Titus laughed and said , " Is that what you call it ? "
The group discussed the possibility of him denying his sexual orientation , but to Parks , it was not an option .
" No. Absolutely not . "
So he decided to run openly .
Shortly into the campaign , Parks ' opponent Tony Dane sent out a mailer attacking Parks : an article about a 10 - year - old boy who raped two other boys , wrapped around an endorsement of Parks by a local gay newsmagazine .
Dane lost to Parks , but in subsequent elections , Dane campaigned against Parks even though he was n't running against him — including one year when Dane found a traveling salesman named David Parks and added him to the ballot to try to confuse voters , unsuccessfully .
Will Dane , who now runs an auto - dialer business used in campaigns around the nation , work against Parks in the commission race ?
" I have n't decided yet , " Dane says .
" It all depends on the stances he takes . "
That is , Dane says he does n't oppose the man — " I am not homophobic " — but opposes pro-gay legislation .
" When I ran against him , he was endorsing the gay and lesbian agenda 100 percent , " which , if left unchallenged , Dane says , would eventually boil down to teaching in public schools that being gay " is a natural lifestyle . "
Parks , 66 , has been called a harvest of slurs , had doors slammed in his face and had foul messages left on his answering machine .
One such caller left an anti-gay diatribe on Parks ' voice mail but forgot to block his telephone number , so Parks called him back .
" I said , ' This is David Parks , and I 'm just responding to your call . '
And the man became very agitated and said , ' How 'd you get my number ! ? ' and I explained that it's on caller ID .
And he said , ' Well , at least you know how I feel then , ' and he hung up . "
Another time Parks was campaigning door - to - door when a man ran him off , saying , " I know what you are , and I 'd never vote for your type ! "
The next day , Parks was knocking on doors across the street , when the man who'd chased him off waved him back over , and said he'd changed his mind because he'd found out Parks had a good rating from the National Rifle Association .
Several times in the last decade , anti-gay legislation has been used to drive conservatives to the polls in Nevada by activist Richard Ziser and backed by various religious organizations and a majority share of the public , including a successful 2002 constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage .
That came after Parks ' 2001 bill that would 've provided " reciprocal benefits " for domestic partners failed .
Ziser opposed a similar bill in 2007 , again noting the fear that that it would trickle down to public schools teaching that homosexual relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships .
Sitting in a coffee shop near UNLV in a suit and tie and eyeglasses , Parks cuts a tremendously average impression .
He 's pleasant .
Open , well - spoken .
He waves politely at someone he knows across the room .
He cites regulation of " radio frequency ID " as one of the bills he 's proud of passing last legislative session .
He 's an unlikely villain , or hero .
All the better .
In the 12 years since first elected , Parks ' nonconfrontational but steady demeanor parallels the state 's advances in gay rights legislation , and , given what 's happening in other reaches of the world , makes Nevada seem slightly less arcane .
Last fall , a statewide group of gay and lesbian leaders , including Parks , started meeting monthly to discuss other civil rights issues ; another step forward in organizational power .
It will be no surprise if Dane and his robo - calling business turn out against Parks in the commission election —
" It 's obviously an obsession for him , " says Parks , nonplussed .
He responds with bits of his own résumé , rather than the war drum : 27 years of local government experience — 13 years at the City of Las Vegas , six at the county and nine at the Regional Transportation Committee , in addition to his service as a legislator .
In his last legislative session , he sponsored 16 successful bills , only one of them tied to the issue of gay rights .
The landscape for gay rights issues is vast and bizarre — a few weeks ago a church in Kansas planned a Las Vegas protest of security officer Stanley Cooper 's funeral , saying that the deaths of federal officers is God 's punishment for the U.S. 's tolerance of gays .
And yet in Houston a few months ago , an open lesbian was elected mayor .
It 's not that David Parks will or should necessarily win the county seat ; he has competition from his own party in former school board member Mary Beth Scow and county planning commissioner David Esposito , and who knows where the campaign will turn .
But the fact that , in the ongoing battles over gay rights , Nevada has had a persistent figure such as Parks is fortune worth noting .

Steven Strogatz on math , from basic to baffling .
Like anything else , arithmetic has its serious side and its playful side .
The serious side is what we all learned in school : how to work with columns of numbers , adding them , subtracting them , grinding them through the spreadsheet calculations needed for tax returns and year - end reports .
This side of arithmetic is important , practical and — for many people — joyless .
The playful side of arithmetic is a lot less familiar , unless you were trained in the ways of advanced mathematics .
Yet there ’s nothing inherently advanced about it .
It ’s as natural as a child ’s curiosity .
In his book “ A Mathematician ’s Lament , ” Paul Lockhart advocates an educational approach in which numbers are treated more concretely than usual : he asks us to imagine them as groups of rocks .
For example , six corresponds to a group of rocks like this :
You probably do n’t see anything striking here , and that ’s right — unless we make further demands on numbers , they all look pretty much the same .
Our chance to be creative comes in what we ask of them .
For instance , let ’s focus on groups having between 1 and 10 rocks in them , and ask which of these can be rearranged into square patterns .
Only two of them can : 4 and 9 .
And that ’s because 4 = 2 × 2 and 9 = 3 × 3 ; we get these numbers by “ squaring ” some other number ( actually making a square shape ) .
A less stringent challenge is to identify groups of rocks that can be neatly organized into rectangles with two rows that come out even .
That ’s possible as long as there are 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 or 10 rocks ; the number has to be “ even . ”
All the other numbers from 1 to 10 — the “ odd ” numbers — always leave an odd bit sticking out .
Still , all is not lost for these misfit numbers .
If we add two of them together , their protuberances match up and their sum comes out even ; Odd +
Odd = Even .
Yet when it comes to rectangles , some numbers , like 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 , truly are hopeless .
They ca n’t form any sort of rectangles at all , other than a simple line of rocks .
These strangely inflexible numbers are the famous “ prime ” numbers .
So we see that numbers have quirks of structure that endow them with personalities .
But to see the full range of their behavior , we need to go beyond individual numbers and watch what happens when they interact .
For example , instead of adding just two odd numbers together , suppose we add all the consecutive odd numbers , starting from 1 :
1 + 3 = 4
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
The sums above , remarkably , always turn out to be perfect squares .
( We saw 4 and 9 in the square patterns discussed earlier , and 16 = 4 × 4 , and 25 = 5 × 5 . ) A quick check shows that this rule keeps working for larger and larger odd numbers ; it apparently holds all the way out to infinity .
But what possible connection could there be between odd numbers , with their ungainly appendages , and the classically symmetrical numbers that form squares ?
By arranging our rocks in the right way , we can make this surprising link seem obvious — the hallmark of an elegant proof .
The key is to recognize that odd numbers can make L - shapes , with their protuberances cast off into the corner .
And when you stack successive L - shapes together , you get a square !
This style of thinking appears in another recent book , though for altogether different literary reasons .
In Yoko Ogawa ’s charming novel “ The Housekeeper and the Professor , ” an astute but uneducated young woman with a 10 - year - old son is hired to take care of the Professor , an elderly mathematician who has suffered a traumatic brain injury that leaves him with only 80 minutes of short - term memory .
Adrift in the present , and alone in his shabby cottage with nothing but his numbers , the Professor tries to connect with the Housekeeper the only way he knows how : by inquiring about her shoe size or birthday and making mathematical small talk about her statistics .
The Professor also takes a special liking to the Housekeeper ’s son , whom he calls Root , because the flat top of the boy ’s head reminds him of the square root symbol , .
One day the Professor gives Root a little puzzle : Can he find the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10 ?
After Root carefully adds the numbers and returns with the answer ( 55 ) , the Professor asks him to find a better way .
Can he find the answer without adding the numbers ?
Root kicks the chair and shouts , “ That ’s not fair ! ”
But little by little the Housekeeper gets drawn into the world of numbers , and she secretly starts exploring the puzzle herself .
“ I ’m not sure why I became so absorbed in a child ’s math problem with no practical value , ” she says .
“ At first I was conscious of wanting to please the Professor , but gradually that feeling faded and it had become a battle between the problem and me .
When I woke in the morning the equation was waiting :
1 + 2 + 3 + … + 9 + 10 = 55
and it followed me all through the day , as though it had burned itself into my retina and could not be ignored . ”
There are several ways to solve the Professor ’s problem ( see how many you can find ) .
The Professor himself gives an argument along the lines we developed above .
He interprets the sum from 1 to 10 as a triangle of rocks , with 1 rock in the first row , 2 in the second and so on , up to 10 rocks in the 10th row :
By its very appearance this picture gives a clear sense of negative space .
It seems only half complete .
And that suggests a creative leap .
If you copy the triangle , flip it upside down and add it as the missing half to what ’s already there , you get something much simpler : a rectangle with 10 rows of 11 rocks each , for a total of 110 .
Since the original triangle is half of this rectangle , the desired sum must be half of 110 , or 55 .
Looking at numbers as groups of rocks may seem unusual , but actually it ’s as old as math itself .
The word “ calculate ” reflects that legacy — it comes from the Latin word “ calculus , ” meaning a pebble used for counting .
To enjoy working with numbers you do n’t have to be Einstein ( German for “ one stone ” ) , but it might help to have rocks in your head .
NOTES :
As I hope I ’ve made clear , this piece owes much to two books — one a polemic , the other a novel , both of them brilliant .
The rock metaphor and many of the other ideas and examples above have been borrowed from : Paul Lockhart , “ A Mathematician ’s Lament : How School Cheats Us Out of Our Most Fascinating and Imaginative Art Form ” ( Bellevue Literary Press , 2009 ) .
The final example is from : Yoko Ogawa , “ The Housekeeper and the Professor ” ( Picador , 2009 ) .

The war must have seemed very far away from Monticello on those evenings in 1779 when Thomas Jefferson joined a Hessian prisoner of war in a violin duet , with Martha Jefferson accompanying them on the pianoforte , while Baroness Riedesel , the regal wife of the captive Hessian commander , led the party in dances .
Jefferson that January had welcomed the arrival in the Charlottesville , Va. , area of nearly 4,000 British and Hessian prisoners taken in the Battle of Saratoga , believing they would provide a boost to the local economy .

Ben Bernanke is making sure the Fed 's exit strategy goes as easily as a camel can pass through the eye of a needle .
Instead of choosing to just sell assets and unwind the amount of securities it holds , the Fed chairman is seeking to be creative once again — as he was in the buildup of its balance sheet -- and increase the amount of interest it pays on excess reserves .
He said this in a prepared statement for the House Financial Services Committee that was released on Wednesday , “ It is possible that the Federal Reserve could for a time use the interest rate paid on reserves , in combination with targets for reserve quantities , as a guide to its policy stance , while simultaneously monitoring a range of market rates . ”
But in order to prevent intractable inflation , the Fed must at some point shed most of the $ 1.43 trillion worth of housing debt it will own by the end of March .
The Fed ’s balance sheet has increased to $ 2.25 trillion from $ 925 billion at the start of 2008 and excess reserves in the banking system now total more than $ 1 trillion .
Commercial bank deposits placed with the Fed that are not required to be held against loans are considered excess reserves .
By paying interest on these central bank deposits , the Fed can raise the interest rate on interbank lending because loans to other banks are intrinsically more risky than loans given to Mr. Bernanke .
But there are major flaws to this strategy .
The Fed pays interest on reserves with yet more deposits held at the central bank .
Therefore , paying interest on reserves further increases commercial bank deposits held at the Fed , and those new deposits will accrue interest as well … and so on .
As a result , by choosing to not sell assets and drain liquidity from banks , the unwinding of their balance sheet will take many years .
Projections from the St. Louis
Fed are that it will take 5 - 7 years for the Mortgage Backed Securities ( MBS ) to be paid off and unwound from the Fed ’s balance sheet .
That means Ben Bernanke is betting banks will not make more profitable loans to consumers and enterprises during those years and will instead opt for the lower return garnered from receiving interest on deposits .
Another risk that arises from deciding not to sell assets comes through the process know as sweeping .
Banks currently have the ability to sweep money into Money Market Funds and time deposits .
Those types of deposits do not have any reserve requirements .
That means commercial banks do not need a large amount of excess reserves to create a tremendous amount of loan growth and new money .
By concentrating on paying interest on reserves , the Chairman not only ignores the crucial action of dramatically reducing the Fed ’s balance sheet but also fetters his ability to increase the level of interest rates to a level that would attenuate rampant loan growth .
In other words , since paying interest on reserves also increases reserves , there is a limit on how high the Fed can pay on deposits .
Mr. Bernanke also made it completely clear that any such future disposal of assets would come at a snail ’s pace .
In regard to the speed of asset sales he said , “ Any such sales would be at a gradual pace , would be clearly communicated to market participants and would entail appropriate consideration of economic conditions . ”
The most import factors in keeping inflation and money supply growth quiescent are to remove most of the excess reserves held at the central bank and to raise interest rates to keep the demand for loans in check .
And it is the cost of money that is the most import governor for inflation .
After all , it was not a massive build up in reserves that caused the housing bubble .
It was the exceptionally low interest rates for an extended period of time that caused consumers to dramatically increase their debt load and for banks to substantially boost the availability of credit .
By focusing primarily on increasing the interest rate on deposits held at the Fed to keep prices in check , Mr. Bernanke misses the key factors behind money supply growth and inflation .

In this tutorial we ’re going to put together a cool grungy poster design for the upcoming Vancouver Winter Olympics .
We ’ll go over several basic Photoshop techniques and combine some basic image manipulation with some grunge text treatments to create some cool effects .
This is an easy step - by - step tutorial that even Photoshop beginners should have no problem with .
Final Image Preview
Let ’s take a look at what we ’ll be creating .
Just in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics , a grunge snowboarding poster emphasizing the pressure that Olympic athletes often face : The World Will Be Watching .
Download Final Poster ( 897 KB .jpg )
Gathering Materials :
We need to round up a few pieces before we begin .
Go out and download the following materials :
Step 1
Create a new document sized to 1280 px x 1024 px .
Open up the snowboard photo in photoshop and drag into your new comp .
Resize the photo to fit into your work area .
Name the layer ‘ BG . ’
Step 2
Next we need to remove the snowboarder from the background .
Grab the pen tool and set it to paths mode and trace around the snowboarder .
A new path will be generated in the paths panel .
Step 3
Command - Click the new path from the paths panel to create a selection from the path .
Copy the snowboarder and paste in a new layer .
Repeat the selection process to remove the sky between the legs of the snowboarder .
Rename the new layer ‘ Snowboarder ’ .
Step 4
Next we need to get a little creative with the snowboarder .
Add an Outer Glow via the layer style menu .
Set the color to light blue ( # 06A4 FF ) .
Match the Settings in the diagram .
Apply a dry brush filter ( Filter > Artistic > Dry brush ) .
Match the settings in the diagram .
Step 5
Next we need to add the streak effects .
Create a new layer called “ Streaks ” and open up the Light Strangs Brush Set .
Select the streaky brush ( the first one in the set ) .
Bring down the brush size to around 1200px and rotate the angle to match up with the snowboarder .
Paint a few streaks using various shades of blue .¬†
Use an eraser to clean up excess streaks around the snowboarder and outside his direct flight path .
Duplicate the layer to create more vivid streaks .
Step 6
Let ’s create the sunburst in the background .
On a new layer drag out the rectangular marquee tool to make a large streak down the image .
Fill the rectangle with a light gray color using the fill bucket .
Alt - drag this selection to create several bars across the screen ( adjust the width and spacing to give some variation ) .
Step 7
With the layer selected , apply the Polar Coordinates Filter ( Filter > Distort > Polar Coordinates ) .
Resize and position the center behind the snowboarder .
Change the Sunburst layer ’s blending mode to Overlay and drop it ’s opacity to 45 % .
Step 8
Open up Concrete Texture .
Resize and rotate so that the crack is positioned where you want it .
Set the layer ’s blending mode to Color Burn and drag the layer immediately above the original photo ( BG layer ) .
Step 9
Using the Shape tool , draw out two black boxes below the snowboarder for a background for the text .
Step 10
Select both layers and merge them ( right click and select “ merge layers ” ) .
Set the opacity of the merged layer to 80 % .
Step 11
Open up the Burnt Negatives Brush Set .
With the black bars layer selected , grab the eraser tool and select several brushes to rough up the edges .¬†
You may need to rotate and resize ( using the bracket keys ) the brush to get your desired effect .
Step 12
Now we can begin adding our text .
Using the text tool , type out “ VANCOUVER ” and “ 2010 ” .
I ’m using News Gothic Bold set to a light blue color ( # 33AEDF ) .
Position the text over the boxes and resize to your preference .
Step 13
Create a new text layer and type out “ THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING ” using the same font settings .
Place the text at the top of the page and resize to fit the width of the poster .
Decrease the leading to bring the lines closer together .
Step 14
Rasterize your type layers and using the eraser tool grab some more Burnt Negative brushes to rough up the text .
Decrease the opacity of your eraser to around 80 % and use the same technique we used on the text background boxes .
Step 15
Open the Olympic Rings Logo and drag it next to the main title .
Apply a color overlay via the layer styles menu to match the color of the text .
Step 16
Use the Burnt Negative brushes at 80 % to rough up the Olympic Logo .
Step 17
Let ’s create a little more movement in the image by adding some faded versions of our snowboarder .
Duplicate the Snowboarder layer twice .
On the first layer , change the blending mode of the bottom snowboarder to multiply and drop the opacity to 45 % .
Drag and rotate the snowboarder into place .
Take the second snowboarder layer and decrease it ’s opacity to 50 % .
Rotate and position between the other two snowboarders to achieve the look below .
Step 18
Finish up by tweaking the curves of the BG layer .
With the BG layer selected , choose Image > Adjustments >
Curves .
Slightly modify the curves for the RGB channel to match the diagram .
We ’re Done !

The answer is yes . :o)
However , with many groups , they consider that women ( and lesbians in particular ) have gotten short shrift over the years , and put them first .
In the 70s and 80s , many groups started out " Gay and Lesbian . . . " if they remembered to mention lesbians at all .
So this is a move towards equality .
But the terms are equivalent at their core .
If you ’re on Facebook , you ’ve seen the meme going around the past couple of days .
Women the world over are posting colors to their status updates .
Lots of black , some pink , some white , a virtual rainbow .
It ’s a game that several of my circles ( high school , local friends , blogging friends ) are playing right now , and it looked cute if harmless .
I wanted to play .
I tracked the game back a couple hours and figured it out — they were writing their bra colors !
I put hands to keyboard and wrote … nothing .
Truth is , I did n’t know what to write .
I wanted to frivilously play along — the boys had gone to bed , and this was MY time , after all — but I could n’t .
And why could n’t I ?
If you know me , you do n’t have to ask .
But if you ’re new here , I could n’t play along by posting the color of my bra because I do n’t have one .
I do n’t own one .
Two years ago this month , I underwent surgery , you see .
I had a double mastectomy to remove the cancer that was trying to kill me .
In my right breast , Stage III inflammatory breast cancer , a fast - moving , deadly cancer that kills more than 60 % of women in the first five years .
( Statistics have improved somewhat since my diagnosis , but it ’s still the second - deadliest cancer , second only to prostate cancer . )
In my left breast , potential .
Potential that the same cancer would recur , as it was in my lymph system , coursing through my body , even as we tried to kill it with six months of tri-weekly , then weekly chemotherapy .
We had been through hell .
First the cancer , then the chemo tried to kill me , and both of them almost succeeded .
I was in bed for months , too tired to move .
I could n’t leave the house for fear of infection during flu season — and we had to take my oldest out of preschool , to keep those germs at bay .
At one point , the taxol had ravaged my nervous system so much that I lost the use of my legs .
After all that , we had to wait for my body to rally after the last chemotherapy treatment and become strong enough to survive the surgery .
As each day went by , I would grow stronger — but so would the cancer .
and if it grew faster than my white blood cells rebounded , then the surgery might not happen , and the tumor would be inoperable again .
It was terrible .
But eventually the day came , January 23 , 2007 , and I was able to have my breasts removed .
I ’ve never felt so relieved in all my life .
This was my one big shot at getting rid of ( most of ) the cancer in my body , and starting life anew .
This was it .
This HAD to work .
And it did .
I made it through surgery just fine ( twittering when I woke up , and blogging about it the same day ) .
I went through the gory aftermath of breast removal , and the difficulty of explaining it to my children .
We found out that the second breast was not innocent at all , but fostering its own little type of cancer , Paget ’s disease .
If I had not removed it preventatively , I could have been back in chemo within the year — if it were found in time .
So I have some history here .
But I tried to shrug it off and play along .
I wrote “ None — In fact , I do n’t even OWN one ! :-) ” and watched my friends play along in their own way , hoping I did n’t make anyone uncomfortable .
But what I saw was nothing short of amazing .
I ’d forgotten for an instant that this was n’t about my story .
This was about our story , and the Mothers With Cancer were coming out to play too .
Here ’s what they wrote :
“ Nude . ”
“ Nothing . ”
“ White , with pockets . ”
And then , in the comments , some amazing things began to happen .
Their friends came out to support them , cheering them on .
Friends engaged me on FB and twitter too , talking about it , asking why I felt left out , and letting me know that the whole meme was staged by some women in the midwest urging awareness of breast cancer .
Really ?
Awareness ?
Are n’t we aware by now , people ?
Do n’t we know that we need to understand our own bodies , take notice of changes in one breast but not the other , and call the doctor when we see that something ’s changed ?
Do n’t we know that we need to talk to our doctor about thermography or mammograms ?
Do n’t we know ?
As I talked to friends on twitter about it last night , a single message came through from my friend and fellow survivor @stales .
She said something that struck me to the core .
She wrote to all : “ Time for a little less “ awareness ” and a whole lot of “ action ” : the time to act is now : address the causes ! ”
She ’s smart , that @stales .
Other cancer survivors joined in , telling me that they felt left out too .
After all , this was ostensibly an effort to raise awareness of breast cancer — but one in which breast cancer survivors themselves could not participate , and were reminded ( as if we needed a reminder ) that we did n’t need bras anymore , that most basic undergarment of women everywhere , that symbol of sexuality , for the simple reason that we had already sacrificed our breasts in a hail mary attempt to keep the rest of our bodies from dying of cancer .
That ’s what it is , you know .
It ’s not a choice .
It ’s not just another treatment option .
Women have mastectomies , double mastectomies , reconstruction ( or not ) because we have no other choice remaining that will give us a shot at life — life with our children , our partners , our families , and our friends .
And so we tearfully bid our breasts goodbye .
We submit to surgery , weeks of the aftermath , drains and gashes where our breasts once were .
We submit to doctors and nurses and students gawking with surprise when we disrobe for exams ( not the oncologists , of course , but we still need regular checkups like everyone else , you know ) .
We submit to months of physical therapy to rip the scar tissue off the muscles that stretch to cover our ribcage .
We submit to lymphedema therapy , taking up precious time , time that we fought for , time that we sacrificed for , but time that nonetheless much be used for even more medical treatment , to deal with the aftermath .
And then we go shopping .
Clothes that fit just a few months previously do n’t fit anymore , you see .
Every . single .
shirt .
is stretched out over the chest , and most new ones do n’t fit right either .
Princess seams , sewn to flatter the big - busted and small - busted alike only serve to remind us , the no-busted , that we are no longer princesses .
V - necks are flattering , but only if they are not too deep , cut to show no cleavage , as our cleavage has been taken from us as well .
And , for a while , the reminders are everywhere .
Every TV commercial with the Victoria ’s Secret angels rankles .
Every low - cut shirt sparks the tears .
Every nightgown cut to flatter falls — flat — and we cry into our pillow .
We are aware , you see .
We are all too aware , and we work to escape the reminders .
Our friends dance around us for a while .
They do n’t invite us to the pool ( have you ever gone swimsuit shopping without your breasts ? ) .
They are gentle , and careful , and form a wall of support around you .
But eventually , life moves on , and the wounds scab over , and the scars begin to form .
Until one day , one day , when a harmless meme rips them off , and you realize once again that you will never be the same .
Edited to add : Well , this struck a nerve .

It is not glib or inaccurate to invoke Oklahoma City in this context , because the acrid stench of 1995 is back in the air .
Two days before Stack ’s suicide mission , The Times published David Barstow ’s chilling , months - long investigation of the Tea Party movement .
Anyone who was cognizant during the McVeigh firestorm would recognize the old warning signs re-emerging from the mists of history .
The Patriot movement .
“ The New World Order , ” with its shadowy conspiracies hatched by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission .
Sandpoint , Idaho .
White supremacists .
Militias .

Barry Blitt
Barstow confirmed what the Southern Poverty Law Center had found in its report last year : the unhinged and sometimes armed anti-government right that was thought to have vaporized after its Oklahoma apotheosis is making a comeback .
And now it is finding common cause with some elements of the diverse , far - flung and still inchoate Tea Party movement .
All it takes is a few self - styled “ patriots ” to sow havoc .
Equally significant is Barstow ’s finding that most Tea Party groups have no affiliation with the G.O.P. despite the party ’s ham - handed efforts to co-opt them .
The more we learn about the Tea Partiers , the more we can see why .
They loathe John McCain and the free - spending , TARP - tainted presidency of George W. Bush .
They really do hate all of Washington , and if they hate Obama more than the Republican establishment , it ’s only by a hair or two .
( Were Obama not earning extra demerits in some circles for his race , it might be a dead heat . )
The Tea Partiers want to eliminate most government agencies , starting with the Fed and the I.R.S. , and end spending on entitlement programs .
They are not to be confused with the Party of No holding forth in Washington  a party that , after all , is now positioning itself as a defender of Medicare spending .
What we are talking about here is the Party of No Government at All .
The distinction between the Tea Party movement and the official G.O.P. is real , and we ignore it at our peril .
While Washington is fixated on the natterings of Mitch McConnell , John Boehner , Michael Steele and the presumed 2012 Republican presidential front - runner , Mitt Romney , these and the other leaders of the Party of No are anathema or irrelevant to most Tea Partiers .
Indeed , McConnell , Romney and company may prove largely irrelevant to the overall political dynamic taking hold in America right now .
The old G.O.P. guard has no discernible national constituency beyond the scattered , often impotent remnants of aging country club Republicanism .
The passion on the right has migrated almost entirely to the Tea Party ’s counterconservatism .
The leaders embraced by the new grass roots right are a different slate entirely : Glenn Beck , Ron Paul and Sarah Palin .
Simple math dictates that none of this trio can be elected president .
As George F . Will recently pointed out , Palin will not even be the G.O.P. nominee “ unless the party wants to lose at least 44 states ” ( as it did in Barry Goldwater ’s 1964 Waterloo ) .
But these leaders do have a consistent ideology , and that ideology plays to the lock - and - load nutcases out there , not just to the peaceable ( if riled up ) populist conservatives also attracted to Tea Partyism .
This ideology is far more troubling than the boilerplate corporate conservatism and knee - jerk obstructionism of the anti-Obama G.O.P. Congressional minority .

Bridgestone will keep its tyre options two steps apart again for most of 2010 in a bid to try and improve the racing .
With the refuelling ban set to put more emphasis on teams and drivers looking after their tyres in the race , F1's official supplier has confirmed its plans for this season .
" Like 2009 , Bridgestone intends to take two dry compounds which are a step allocation apart to most races : Hard and Soft or Medium and Super Soft for example , " explained Bridgestone 's F1 technical manager Tetsuro Kobayashi
" This will not be possible at some races however , such as Monaco , where it is important to have consecutive soft compounds to ensure maximum grip on the street circuit .
" The compound allocation will again be determined by Bridgestone , based on our experience of previous years and the data received from the teams . "
Early experience of the tyres from testing at Valencia in Spain this week has shown no hints of there being any problems with the 2010 tyres coping with the heavier cars that will be a feature of racing this year .
" Certainly , with the cars being potentially 100 kgs heavier this year at the start of the races than last year , the longer stint lengths with greater amounts of fuel will place additional loads on the tyres , " explained Kobayashi .
" But our 2010 casing should be much more durable in comparison to the 2009 casing : the strengthened rear construction in particular ; will help the cars accommodate this new rule .
" We will also keep monitoring and analysing the data very carefully at the coming winter tests and races because the downforce created by the 2010 cars will keep improving throughout the season .
We have already noted that much higher downforces are being produced in comparison to last season . "
Kobayashi has also confirmed that green sidewall markings will again be used this year to visually differentiate the two different tyre compounds .
" We will mark the softer of the two compounds available at each race weekend with green bands on the outer edges of the sidewalls .
We tested many different alternatives and this location gave the best visibility , from the side and also a head - on view .
We have used the colour green as it shows our support of the FIA 's Make Cars Green campaign . "
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has become a bad play .
It is obvious that all the parties are just acting out the same old scenes , with the same old tired clichés  and that no one believes any of it anymore .
There is no romance , no sex , no excitement , no urgency  not even a sense of importance anymore .
The only thing driving the peace process today is inertia and diplomatic habit .
Yes , the Israeli - Palestinian peace process has left the realm of diplomacy .
It is now more of a calisthenic , like weight - lifting or sit-ups , something diplomats do to stay in shape , but not because they believe anything is going to happen .
And yet , as much as we , the audience , know this to be true , we can never quite abandon hope for peace in the Holy Land .
It is our habit .
Indeed , as I ranted about this to a Jordanian friend the other day , he said it all reminded him of an old story .
“ These two guys are watching a cowboy and Indian movie .
And in the opening scene , an Indian is hiding behind a rock about to ambush the handsome cowboy , ” he explained .
“ ‘ I bet that Indian is going to kill that cowboy , ’ one guy says to the other .
‘ Never happen , ’ his friend answers .
‘ The cowboy is not going to be killed in the opening scene . ’
‘ I ’ll bet you $ 10 he gets killed , ’ the guy says .
‘ I ’ll take that bet , ’ says his friend .
“ Sure enough , a few minutes later , the cowboy is killed and the friend pays the $ 10 .
After the movie is over the guy says to his friend , ‘ Look , I have to give you back your $ 10 .
I ’d actually seen this movie before .
I knew what was going to happen . ’
His friend answers : ‘ No , you can keep the $ 10 .
I ’d seen the movie , too .
I just thought it would end differently this time . ’ ”
This peace process movie is not going to end differently just because we keep playing the same reel .
It is time for a radically new approach .
And I mean radical .
I mean something no U.S. administration has ever dared to do :
Take down our “ Peace - Processing - Is - Us ” sign and just go home .

A giant composite image of the Milky Way 's center has been taken by NASA 's three great observatories — the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
The image , unveiled by NASA today , was made to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy , 400 years after Galileo first turned his telescope to the heavens .
The pictures of our galaxy 's hub combines a near - infrared view from the Hubble Space Telescope , an infrared view from the Spitzer Space Telescope , and an X - ray view from the Chandra X- ray Observatory into one multiwavelength picture .
SLIDESHOW :
The best space images of the week
Experts from all three observatories carefully assembled the final image from large mosaic photo surveys taken by each telescope .
This composite image provides one of the most detailed views ever of our galaxy 's mysterious core .
More than 150 planetariums , museums , nature centers , libraries , and schools across the country have received a giant 6 - foot - by - 3 - foot print of the stunning image .
Participating institutions also will display a matched trio of Hubble , Spitzer , and Chandra images of the Milky Way 's center on a second large panel measuring 3 feet by 4 feet .
The composite image features the spectacle of stellar evolution : from vibrant regions of star birth , to young hot stars , to old cool stars , to seething remnants of stellar death called black holes .
This activity occurs against a fiery backdrop in the crowded , hostile environment of the galaxy 's core , the center of which is dominated by a supermassive black hole nearly four million times more massive than our Sun .
Permeating the region is a diffuse blue haze of X - ray light from gas that has been heated to millions of degrees by outflows from the supermassive black hole as well as by winds from massive stars and by stellar explosions .
Infrared light reveals more than a hundred thousand stars along with glowing dust clouds that create complex structures including compact globules , long filaments , and finger - like " pillars of creation , " where newborn stars are just beginning to break out of their dark , dusty cocoons .
What happens when a really gargantuan star -- one hundreds of times bigger than our sun -- blows up ?
Although a theory developed years ago describes what the explosion of such an enormous star should look like , no one had actually observed one -- until now .
An international team , led by scientists in Israel , and including researchers from Germany , the US , UK and China , tracked a supernova -- an exploding star -- for over a year and a half , and found that it neatly fits the predictions for the explosion of a star of over 150 times the sun 's mass .
Their findings , which could influence our understanding of everything from natural limits on star size to the evolution of the universe , appeared recently in Nature .
' It 's all about balance , ' says team leader Dr. Avishay Gal - Yam of the Particle Physics and Astrophysics Department .
' During a star 's lifetime , there 's a balance between the gravity that pulls its material inward and the heat produced in the nuclear reaction at its core , pushing it out .
In a supernova we 're familiar with , of a star 10 - 100 times the size of the sun , the nuclear reaction begins with the fusion of hydrogen into helium , as in our sun .
But the fusion keeps going , producing heavier and heavier elements , until the core turns to iron .
Since iron does n't fuse easily , the reaction burns out , and the balance is lost .
Gravity takes over and the star collapses inward , throwing off its outer layers in the ensuing shockwaves . '
The balance in a super - giant star is different .
Here , the photons ( light particles ) are so hot and energetic , they interact to produce pairs of particles : electrons and their opposites , positrons .
In the process , particles with mass are created from the mass - less photons , and this consumes the star 's energy .
Again , things are thrown out of balance , but this time , when the star collapses , it falls in on a core of volatile oxygen , rather than iron .
The hot , compressed oxygen explodes in a runaway thermonuclear reaction that obliterates the star 's core , leaving behind little but glowing stardust .
' Models of ' pair supernovae ' had been calculated decades ago , ' says Gal - Yam , ' but no one was sure these huge explosions really occur in nature .
The new supernova we discovered fits these models very well .'
An analysis of the new supernova data led the scientists to estimate the star 's size at around 200 times the mass of the sun .
This in itself is unusual , as observers had noted that the stars in our part of the universe seem to have a size limit of about 150 suns ; some had even wondered if there was some sort of physical constraint on a star 's girth .
The new findings suggest that hyper - giant stars , while rare , do exist , and that even larger stars , up to 1000 times the size of the sun , may have existed in the early universe .
' This is the first time we 've been able to analyze observations of such a massive exploding star , ' says Dr. Paolo Mazzali of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics , Germany , who led the theoretical study of this object .
' We were able to measure the amounts of new elements created in this explosion , including approximately five times the mass of our sun in highly radioactive , freshly synthesized nickel .
Such explosions may be important factories for heavy metals in the Universe . '
This massive supernova was found in a tiny galaxy -- only a hundredth the size of our own , and the scientists think that such dwarf galaxies could be natural harbors for the giant stars , somehow enabling them to surpass the 150 sun limit .
' Our discovery and analysis of this unique explosion has given us new insights into just how massive stars can get and how these stellar giants contribute to the makeup of our Universe ' , says Dr. Gal - Yam .
'
We hope to understand even more when we find additional examples from new surveys that we have recently begun to carry out , covering large , previously unexplored areas of the Universe . '
Dr. Avishai Gal - Yam 's research is supported by the Nella and Leon Benoziyo Center for Astrophysics ; the Peter and Patricia Gruber Awards ; William Z. & Eda Bess Novick New Scientists Fund ; the Legacy Heritage Fund Program of the Israel Science Foundation ; and Miel de Botton Aynsley , UK .

The banks are mad as hell and they 're not going to take it anymore .
They paid back their TARP , which they did n't need anyway , and every dime they 're making now is because of their own brilliance , not taxpayer subsidies .
So they can pay themselves whatever they want and the hell with anyone who has a problem with that !
That 's a common attitude on Wall Street these days .
And the part about the TARP being paid back is true ( and it 's surprising how fast it happened ) .
And the bankers certainly are n't doing anything that any good capitalist would do when offered free money and gifts :
Take them .
So this is n't about bankers being bad people and other taxpayers being good people .
( It 's about government policy ) .
But that bit about how banks are n't being subsidized anymore is just a crock of sh$ % .
Reggie Middleton at Zero Hedge has an excellent rant on this subject , in which he distills the 10 ways banks are still getting rich and drunk at a taxpayer subsidized bar :
What was the value for bank charter , to get cheap access to the Fed 's funds ?
did they pay back this value yet ?
No !
How about the payment of interest on the banks ' excess reserves at the Fed .
Have the banks repaid that yet ?
No !
The Fed and the Treasury have purchased hundreds of billions of dollars of Agency debt , Agency mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and related securities through Treasury purchase programs .
Have the banks paid back the capital behind those purchases yet ?
No !
How about the Term Auction Facility ?
Has the capital behind the benefits of that program been paid back ?
No !
Then there is the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) , has this been paid back ?
No !
Do you remember the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) ?
Have the funds behind that been paid back ?
No !
What about the PPIP ?
No !
Hey , there 's the Foreign Exchange Swap programs ( the currency swap lines , that saved not only our banks but out banks facing counterparties who were short on dollars ) , has that been paid back ?
No !
There 's the Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) , have the funds behind that been paid back ?
No !
Most importantly , the opportunity cost of ZIRP [ Zero Interest Rate Policy ] , which hurts those who do not speculate ( or have not speculated ) with near free money !
How do you pay that back to grandma and her .017 % CDs ?
The last one 's a killer .
David Stockman estimated this week that our zero interest rates have taken $ 250 billion from the pockets of savers and put it into the pockets of Wall Street .
Low interest rates have been used for years to stimulate economic activity and secretly recapitalize banks .
So they 're nothing new .
But they are a huge subsidy that hurts savers and rewards banks ( right now ) for doing nothing more than buying Treasuries .
So at the very least it 's disingenuous for Wall Street to argue that it 's through being subsidized .
And that 's before you get to the 9 other gifts and subsidies Reggie Middleton outlines >
Oh those family values Republicans :
The Scott County court clerk confirms a felony complaint has been filed against former Missouri House Speaker Rod Jetton for an incident that allegedly took place Nov. 15 in Sikeston , Mo .
The complaint alleges Jetton " recklessly caused serious physical injury to ------- by hitting her on the head , and choking her resulting in unconsciousness and the loss of the function of part of her body . "
UPDATE , 3:50 : The affidavit attached to the probable cause statement alleges Jetton went to the home of the victim Nov. 15 , where he and the victim drank wine and watched a football game .
The victim claims Jetton hit her on the face and choked her , leaving bruises that the police department photographed .
The affidavit claims the assault occurred during the night and into the morning of Nov. 16 .
It says Jetton and the victim agreed on a " safe word " " to use as a stop word during intercourse . "
The safe word was allegedly " green balloons . "
The next day , Jetton allegedly told the victim : " You should have said green balloons . "
Read on ...
Brutal .
Jetton is the former Missouri House Speaker , but his biggest claim to fame was working as a political adviser to Mitt Romney during his failed presidential campaign in 2008 .
Known as " jedijetton " on Twitter , Rod tweets about attending CPAC -- and here 's a photo of him with everybody 's favorite conservative battle axe , Phyillis Schlafly .

Rahm Emanuel apologizes for ' retarded ' remark
Updated 4:21 p.m.
By Michael D. Shear
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has apologized for referring to liberals as " retarded " during a strategy session last summer .
A White House official said Emanuel called Tim Shriver , the CEO of the Special Olympics , last week after his comments were reported in a Wall Street Journal article and prompted Shriver to write him to express " dismay " over Emanuel 's word choice .
" Rahm called Tim Shriver Wednesday to apologize and the apology was accepted , " a White House aide said .
" The White House remains committed to addressing the concerns and needs of Americans living with disabilities and recognizes that derogatory remarks demean us all . "
The apology gained new attention just hours after former Alaska governor Sarah Palin posted a scathing critique of Emanuel 's comments on her Facebook page and called for President Obama to fire him .
Palin 's son , Trig , was born with Down Syndrome .
" Just as we'd be appalled if any public figure of Rahm 's stature ever used the ' N - word ' or other such inappropriate language , Rahm 's slur on all God 's children with cognitive and developmental disabilities -- and the people who love them -- is unacceptable , and it's heartbreaking , " Palin wrote .
Emanuel 's comment was reported in a story that recounted a summer strategy session in which liberal groups said they might run ads attacking conservative Democrats for refusing to back Obama 's health care plan .
His apology was first reported last week by Disability Scoop , an online news organization .
" F---ing retarded , " the Journal reported Emanuel as saying during the meeting .
A report last August recounted Emanuel as having said " f--- ing stupid " at the meeting with liberal Democrats .
Emanuel has a reputation for foul language in private conversations and is known for his love of bare knuckle politics .
The Special Olympics has launched a campaign called " spread the word to end the word , " which is aimed at eliminating the use of the word " retard " in reference to people with special needs .
A Republican won in Massachusetts  and suddenly it ’s not clear whether the Senate will confirm Ben Bernanke for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman .
That ’s not as strange as it sounds : Washington has suddenly noticed public rage over economic policies that bailed out big banks but failed to create jobs .
And Mr. Bernanke has become a symbol of those policies .
Where do I stand ?
I deeply admire Mr. Bernanke , both as an economist and for his response to the financial crisis .
( Full disclosure : before going to the Fed he headed Princeton ’s economics department , and hired me for my current position there . )
Yet his critics have a strong case .
In the end , I favor his reappointment , but only because rejecting him could make the Fed ’s policies worse , not better .
How did we get to the point where that ’s the most I can say ?
Mr. Bernanke is a superb research economist .
And from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009 his academic expertise and his policy role meshed perfectly , as he used aggressive , unorthodox tactics to head off a second Great Depression .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the whole story .
Before the crisis struck , Mr. Bernanke was very much a conventional , mainstream Fed official , sharing fully in the institution ’s complacency .
Worse , after the acute phase of the crisis ended he slipped right back into that mainstream .
Once again , the Fed is dangerously complacent  and once again , Mr. Bernanke seems to share that complacency .
The news that Goldman and other banks got paid hundreds of millions of dollars to help Greece hide its huge debts from the EU overseers has now gone mainstream .
Louise Story , Landon Thomas , and Nelson Schwartz at the NYT :
In 2001 , just after Greece was admitted to Europe ’s monetary union , Goldman helped the government quietly borrow billions , people familiar with the transaction said .
That deal , hidden from public view because it was treated as a currency trade rather than a loan , helped Athens to meet Europe ’s deficit rules while continuing to spend beyond its means ...
Instruments developed by Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and a wide range of other banks enabled politicians to mask additional borrowing in Greece , Italy and possibly elsewhere .
In dozens of deals across the Continent , banks provided cash upfront in return for government payments in the future , with those liabilities then left off the books .
Greece , for example , traded away the rights to airport fees and lottery proceeds in years to come .
[ Greece paid Goldman ] about $ 300 million in fees for arranging the 2001 transaction , according to several bankers familiar with the deal .
In other words , Greece was just like many American homeowners , who hit their home - equity ATMs every year to remodel their kitchens and buy SUVs they could n't afford .
And Goldman , et al , were just like WaMu and Countrywide .
It was all perfectly legal , of course .
When you 're beginning a relationship , is it reasonable to ask your partner not to watch porn ?
A couple of weeks ago , I wrote a column here about porn .
I was writing in response to an advice column by Scarleteen , an answer to a letter from a young woman who was upset because her boyfriend watched porn .
I posed the question , " In a monogamous relationship , is it reasonable to expect your partner not to watch porn ? "
And I concluded that it was not .
I concluded that people have the right to watch whatever they want when they 're by themselves and on their own time , and that asking a partner not to watch porn is no more defensible then asking them not to watch reality TV or read true crime .
I concluded that trying to regulate your partner 's private cultural pleasures -- pornographic or otherwise -- is like trying to regulate their imagination .
But some readers thought I 'd misread Scarleteen 's advice .
They said Scarleteen 's point was n't that people have the right to ask their existing partners not to watch porn ... but rather that if someone objects to porn , they should spell that out at the beginning of a relationship .
And on re-reading the Scarleteen column , I think they 're right .
In my defense , the situation I was writing about was , in fact , the situation described in the letter -- dealing with an existing partner who watched porn , and trying to decide what to say to them .
But I do think I misread Scarleteen 's intention in their response , and for that , I apologize .
So now I 'm going to address the position Scarleteen took : that people who object to porn and are beginning to date someone should spell out their position early , and should state clearly that they do n't want to be involved with someone who watches it .
And I 'm basically going to stand by my original position .
Which is that this is an unreasonable , overly controlling thing for an adult to ask another adult .
*
That 's an excerpt from my new piece on the Blowfish Blog , Porn , Relationships , and What It 's Reasonable to Ask For .
To find out why I think it 's unreasonable to ask your partner not to watch porn on their own private time -- even early on in a relationship -- read the rest of the piece .

COPENHAGEN , Denmark , Jan. 3 ( UPI ) --
A man charged with trying to kill a Danish cartoonist was arrested last year in an alleged plot to harm U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , officials said .
The 28 - year - old Somali suspect , whose name has not been released , was arrested late Friday for allegedly breaking into the home of Kurt Westergaard , a cartoonist in Aarhus , Denmark .

Westergaard , 74 , had angered many Muslims with a series of cartoons of the prophet Mohammed , including one with a bomb sticking out of a turban .
The suspect was one of four people arrested last summer in Nairobi in an alleged plot to harm Clinton during her tour of African countries , the newspaper Politken reported .
The suspect was released from a Kenyan jail in September because of a lack of evidence and returned to Denmark , where he had been living , Sky News reported Sunday .
The man , who was wounded by police Friday at Westergaard 's home , may have had links to a Somali terror group and al - Qaida leaders in East Africa , Danish intelligence officials said .
MOUNT OLIVE --
A snow plow truck burst into flames Thursday afternoon as it made its way down Kevin Drive in Mount Olive .
John Larocco , of Hackettstown , was driving the commercial plow when he smelled something burning and exited the vehicle , according to Mount Olive police officer Eric Anthony .
Larocco saw flames shooting from the engine of the truck , which is owned by J&R Tree Service .
Larocco tried unsuccessfully to put the fire out , Anthony said , but the flames soon engulfed the vehicle .
Flanders Fire Department arrived on scene within minutes and put out the blaze .
No one was injured .
The cause of the fire remains under investigation .

when quacks kidnap einstein ’s ghost …
Alt med practitioners decided that the one of world 's simplest and most famous formulas is their friend because they clearly do n't understand it .
There ’s something really evil about taking the profound work of scientists who spent years finding solutions to some of the complex and pressing problems faced by humans in our pursuit of knowledge , then mangling everything it represents to justify self - serving and profitable pseudoscientific beliefs .
While these introductions usually invoke the Victorians ’ distortions of Darwin ’s theory of natural selection , the scientist I have in mind for this example is actually Albert Einstein and the most famous formula in the world today .
By showing the math behind how matter and energy are related , he gave other physicists new ways to think about the dynamics of our universe .
And unfortunately , he gave quacks an idea for defending their quasi-religious medical beliefs …
You see , homeopaths , naturists and faith healers like reiki practitioners , reject or just ignore the modern germ theory of disease , the whacky notion that microorganisms like bacteria and viruses attack your body and make you sick in the process .
Instead , they focus on ideas dating back to ancient times .
Your body has a balance so whenever you get sick , it means your balance has been tipped and must be restored with touching , needles , magical water or just plain old faith healing .
Makes perfect sense , right ?
I mean it ’s not as if antibiotics and an advanced understanding of microorganisms save millions of lives on an annual basis and were responsible for nearly doubling the average life expectancy of people in the developed world along with sanitary conditions and better nutrition …
Oh wait .
they were ?
And the disruptions of the four humors … ?
Really ?
No such thing ?
So the whole thing about restoring natural balances is just taking a 300 year step back in medicine ?
Now that we got the snark out of our system , let ’s consider the position of today ’s medical quacks .
Clearly , the references to toxic miasmas and the “ dis-eases ” caused by either the disturbances in the balance of our four humors , the bad alignment of our chakras , or a drop in our qi , are n’t going to do it since they ’re covered in any history class as outdated ideas which held sway only due to the lack of proper equipment and sound science .
If they ’re going to be effective , they need something that sounds more scientific and this is when Einstein and a famous , instantly recognizable equation of his are abducted by the forces of woo and subjected to the kinds of verbal torment that would ’ve probably made poor Albert swear off science for good .
As we ’ve seen before in a terrifying example of physics abuse by Charlene Werner , the correlation between energy and mass is used to justify that we ’re all just energy and by manipulating this energy , we can cure disease , live longer , healthier lives and even prevent illness , in a manner similar to this …
“ I ’m a Reiki Master , ” she told the crowd .
“ I use energy to heal .
I was skeptical , too .
My father ’s a doctor , my brother ’s a doctor , my husband ’s a doctor .
I was actually a little contemptuous of Reiki at first .
But life is energy .
The difference between those body organs over there and you is energy .
Everything is energy . ”
Using Einstein ’s world - changing equation to make her point , Mrs . Oz said , “ Physics has evolved .
It ’s not the old mechanistic model anymore .
But medicine has n’t . ”
If you ’re wondering who this Mrs .
Oz is , you may be in for a little surprise .
She ’s the wife of Oprah ’s TV doctor Mehmet Oz , a surgeon who plunged deep into the profitable world of woo .
So while Mrs .
Oz is trying to give a scientific backing for her beliefs that faith healing that combines Christianity with Eastern mysticism into a few touching exercises and breathing methods , is somehow as effective as modern medicine , she takes a rather bold plunge into the inane territory so richly mined by the aforementioned Charlene Werner .
Note that if those who trot out the “ everything is energy ” argument to justify their woo actually spent even a few minutes doing a little math using the very formula they want to shout from the rooftops , they would know that a rather average , 75 kilogram person would put out around 6.7 EJ , or exajoules , i.e. the equivalent of 1.6 billion tons of TNT .
Applying this fact across the global population of almost 7 billion people would yield roughtly 4.6 × 1028 J or if you prefer , 11 billion gigatons , enough to turn the surface of our planet unto an uninhabitable wasteland if we were to release it in one , huge blast .
Which we ’d have to if we ’re all just energy as is being claimed here .
The kind of power wielded by a reiki practitioner should strike fear into the hearts of generals because it would be measured in hundreds of megatons and could wipe entire cities off the map .
Then again , it could all just be a flimsy excuse for making a few ritualized gestures and telling patients that this will heal them from everything under the sun before handing them an invoice for providing nothing but technobabble and a mental placebo .
I would certainly lean towards the second scenario considering what the very equation they use as proof of the great energies they control say about their claims .
Here ’s the simple moral of the story .
If you ’re going to talk about religious notions of mystical auras flowing in and around human bodies , it ’s a very bad idea to confuse them with the energy described by modern physics , that is the ability of a system to do work .
All you ’ll end up doing is throwing out an equation which could easily prove that you ’re clueless on the topic , or explain that your remedies are actually radioactive hazmat , while blissfully unaware of what you ’ve just done in your quest to justify the woo that pays your bills …
Throughout the German occupation of Greece , the square in front of my home was taken over by the Wehrmacht .
Streaming into Athens on the morning of 27 April 1941 , the tanks , motorbikes and cars of the 6th Armoured Division headed for the city centre and , in particular , the ancient Plaka district .
Within an hour , the swastika had been hoisted from the Acropolis .
It was thus that the square was turned into an army depot , German guards posted at each of its four corners .
My neighbour , Lina , who was 12 at the time , remembers German officers taking over the top floor of the building next to the neoclassical house she lives in – which happens to be my home .
On the floor below lived Mr and Mrs Michaelides , with their three children .
" Incredibly , they stayed throughout the war , " she recalled .
" I was always scared for them , my mother always made sure I called them by their first names , because they were Jews . "
Last week those memories returned with the outbreak of a very different sort of war .
" Economic Nazism threatens Europe , " proclaimed one newspaper , lashing out at German media jibes that the Greeks , being " cheats " , should pay for allowing their debt - ridden country to reach the point of bankruptcy .
" Racist frenzy and calumny against Greece , " railed another after a German weekly saw fit to cover its front page with an image of Venus de Milo gesturing obscenely under the headline " frauds in the Euro - family " .
The war of words has worsened not so much as a result of an impending invasion but an interview given by Theodore Pangalos , the Greek deputy prime minister , to the BBC .
When my colleague Malcolm Brabant went to see the septuagenarian , he intended to discuss the mounting hostility Greece 's debt crisis has triggered towards the EU .
He did not think he would be treated to a tirade about the devastation Nazi Germany had wrought on the Greek economy .
But after declaring " we do n't want to open the chapter of the Second World War , " Pangalos could not help himself : " There is an issue that stands there , " he said , before lunging into a vitriolic description of the role Hitler 's forces had played in plundering Greece " of gold and money " .
There was the issue of war reparations , too ; after borrowing the money " using violence " they had failed to return the ill - gotten gains and the Greek economy was still suffering : " They should n't complain much about [ us ] stealing and not being very specific about details . "
This is not the first time Pangalos has upset Germany .
In 1993 , as foreign minister , he declared that it behaved as " a bestial giant with a child 's brain " .
But , although prone to the odd clanger , Pangalos also has his finger on the pulse of the nation .
For older Greeks last week , his only crime was that he did not go far enough .
It was n't just the stolen loot , plundering of homes and factories , crippling of the economy , or destruction of the countryside and burning of villages and schools .
It was the sheer brutality of a regime that allowed some 300,000 to die from starvation after it requisitioned food , killed at least 100,000 in reprisals following mass resistance , and with frightening efficiency virtually wiped out Greece 's entire Jewish community .
Like so many others of her generation , Lina , my neighbour , is still haunted by the howls of the hungry .
In 1941 , when famine took its biggest toll , they would line the streets , hands outstretched over swollen stomachs .
" My father died of famine , " she says matter - of - factly .
" The Germans kept all the food . "
The bravery of the Greeks was not lost on the Führer – or Winston Churchill , who would famously pronounce that " the heroes fight like Greeks " after their extraordinary defeat of Mussolini 's forces in 1940 .
Not long ago I had the honour to shake the hand of Manolis Glezos , who as an 18 - year - old tore down the swastika from the Acropolis in the first act of defiance .
A lifelong fighter with leftist ideals , he would go on , after the war , to spend nearly three decades in prison under authoritarian right - wing rule .
" Removing the swastika was an act of resistance for all of Europe , " he said , eyes glinting .
" Please do n't ask me any more . "
Today it is not the Wehrmacht but German tourists outside my door .
Ever chipper , the white - haired Glezos is the first to say they should be here .
But , like so many others , he is also living proof that the wounds of Hitler 's Greece have not fully healed even after so many years .
Homecoming Queen
The story of Shellie Eyre is of a life lived with courage , determination and unrestricted love for everyone she meets .
She was born in 1979 with Down syndrome and is the second child of a family of four children .
At three years of age she experienced a major setback in the form of a stroke that left her paralyzed on her left side .
But her optimistic outlook and her boundless perseverance made it obvious to all who knew her that she would succeed in overcoming whatever obstacles would be presented to her .
Her school years were a wonderful time of learning a gaining many friends .
This culminated in her senior year at Murray High School in Utah when she was selected as the 1997 Homecoming Queen .
She had been one of the most popular girls in school because of her easy smile and loving heart .
Her landslide victory was due in part to a wonderfully accepting student body that embraced unselfish inclusion , and to Shellies attitude toward all her classmates .
When asked why everyone liked Shellie so much , one of the students said ,  It s hard not to love Shellie when you know how much she loves you . 
The evening she was selected as Homecoming Queen was an experience that few will ever forget .
Even the other Homecoming Candidates felt that there were no losers that night , but that they , and all who were there , had participated in an event where every person had won .
Shellies inspirational life is an example of what true beauty can be and where love , acceptance , and inclusion can triumph over any disabilities .
Note : Becca Winegar is the name of the actress that portrayed Shellie Eyre in this spot .

There ’s a reason Milbury beat a man with his loafers , he ’s certifiably bat - shit crazy .
First , how a man can ever get a job speaking to millions after going into the crowd during a game and beating a man with his shoe is beyond me .
Amazingly , that is n’t even how he acquired the nickname “ Mad Mike ” .
Yes , beating someone with their own shoe is n’t the craziest thing this man has done .
In 1998 , Milbury thought the woeful Islanders needed a good solid veteran on the decline , rather than promising youngsters , so he traded both Bryan McCabe and Todd Bertuzzi ( plus a 3rd round pick ) to the Canucks for Trevor Linden .
He is also the man who not only drafted Rick DiPietro first overall in 2000 ahead of both Dany Heatley and Marian Gaborik , but decided after one good year that Rick was worthy of a 15 - year extension .
DiPietro is n’t necessarily a horrible pick , but it prompted Milbury to trade Roberto Luongo to the Panthers .
Mad Mike decided Mark Parrish and Oleg Kvasha were worth so much that not only did he trade Roberto Luongo to the Panthers for them , but he decided to throw in Olli Jokinen as well .
This whole scenario is nonsensical .
Why draft a goalie number 1 when you already posses a franchise goalie ?
Luongo was drafted fourth overall in 1997 , played one more year in junior and then joined the Islanders AHL affiliate in 1999 .
He played 26 games in the AHL , posting a .906 save percentage and 2.93 GAA .
He was promoted to the Islanders later that year and played 24 games with a .904 save percentage and 3.25 goals against on a brutal Islanders team whose leading scorer was the Polish Prince , Mariusz Czerkawski .
Then they draft DiPietro and trade Luongo !
It 's not like Luongo toiled in the minors making absolutely not progress .
He made the NHL at 20 years old !
Why not use the first overall pick to grab a sniper like Heatley , which would actually complement the areas the team is already set in ( like goal ) .
This obviously made too much sense .
Milbury defended the move by saying , “ as dangerous as this may be , we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him . ”
You know you ’re crazy when you refer to yourself by your crazy nickname in the third person .
Then , almost as baffling , he says , “ Roberto Luongo is going to be an excellent goaltender in this league .
He is a class act and a kid I know we would have been happy to ride with .
But hell , I 've gotta send him off . "
I do n’t really understand , but then I would n't beat someone with my shoe .
Islanders ’ fans can weep now because at this point in time , without Milbury ’s stupidity , the Islanders would have employed an impressive core consisting of Roberto Luongo , Tim Connolly , Kenny Jonsson , Olli Jokinen , Zdeno Chara , Eric Brewer , plus whoever they drafted with the number 1 pick in 2000 ( either Heatley or Gaborik , the consensus top picks ) .
Unfortunately , only Kenny Jonsson would start the 2001 season with the Islanders as Milbury sacrificed the team ’s future for brief short - term success .
To build off the success of the 2000 draft , Milbury decided his draft luck could n’t be any better , so why bother even selecting .
He traded the number two pick ( Jason Spezza ) along with Zdeno Chara for team - cancer Alexei Yashin .
This is the same Alexei Yashin who demanded a new contract three separate times during his brief five - year stint in Ottawa ; the same Yashin who the Senators rather allow sit out an entire season than damage the team anymore ; the same Alexei Yashin who promised to donate a million dollars to a Ottawa art museum , only to renege after they would n't pay his parents a $ 400,000 consulting fee .
This is the player Milbury thought would turn his team around ?
Instead of resting on his mad ways , Mike thought it ’d be better to up the insanity by signing Yashin to a 10 - year , $ 87.5 million deal .
Why assure a player with major commitment and effort issues such a monstrous deal ?
Well , because your name is Mad Mike and your reputation is at stake ( only one mad move in one whole year ! ) .
Yashin was bought out in 2007 and will not be off the Islander ’s cap until 2015 .
Amazingly , the deals Milbury made actually worked ( for one brief year ) .
Yashin , Mike Peca ( acquired for Tim Connolly ) , and Roman Hamrlik ( acquired for Eric Brewer ) propelled the Islanders to an amazing 44 point turnaround that placed the Isles 5th in the Eastern conference .
Unfortunately , the Islanders faced the Leafs in the first round and lost in 7 tough games ( it was basically a street fight ) .
Looking back the Islanders probably win the series if Gary Roberts does n’t run Kenny Jonsson from behind , injuring him , and if Darcy Tucker does n’t take out Mike Peca ’s legs in a hit that becomes dirtier with time .
As a Leafs fan I was happy those things happened .
When your team has n’t won in 40 + years you ’ll accept advancing a round by any means .
Obviously the success did n’t last ( because we ’re talking about Alexei freakin ’ Yashin here ) and the Islanders went back to their losing ways .
Somehow after all these horrendous moves Milbury kept his role as GM until 2006 , even as Luongo and Jokinen became stars ; even as Bertuzzi developed into a dominant power - forward in Vancouver ; even as Eric Brewer played for Team Canada at the Salt Lake Olympics ; even as the Alexei Yashin trade single - handedly turned the Senators into a powerhouse .
How can a man make so many stupid decisions in his hockey career and actually be allowed to voice his opinions on hockey ?
Mike Milbury makes JFJ look like a mutant hybrid of Ken Holland and Lou Lamoriello .
We should end this cautionary tale with the man 's own words .
" It ’s unbelievable that after more than 30 years in the game , pummeling a guy with his loafer will be my legacy .
But I guess it 's better than having no legacy at all . "
Or maybe we can just check google
As if the leaked screenshots had n't already confirmed it , it does indeed appear that the still - unannounced Xbox LIVE Arcade port of Sega 's Sonic Adventure is headed our way .
Destructoid reader Damon sent along word that the XBLA version of the title was recently reviewed in the latest issue of the UK magazine , 360 Gamer .
According to the review , the game is a " no frills " port of the main game featured in Sonic Adventure DX , the enhanced GameCube update of the original title .
The reviewer was mostly unimpressed by the port of the game that originally appeared on the Dreamcast back in 1998 , saying it " really has n't aged well . "
" It 's not all bad , " writes reviewer Mark Podd , who gave the game a 5 out of 10 , " but if your idea of a decent Sonic game is watching the Blue Spiky One charging across a 2D landscape , you 'd be best advised to give this one a miss . "
The review 's details list a " to be confirmed " price and release for the XBLA title , which has yet to be announced by Sega at the time the magazine hit newsstands .
[ Thanks , Damon ! ]
In the Loop was one of my favorite flicks last year , so I was pleasantly surprised to see it get an Oscar nod for adapted screenplay .
IFC Films has just posted that screenplay online , so if you 'd like to see any witty lines you may have missed , hop to it .
( Writer / director Armando Iannucci posted this note as an introduction . )
Speaking of Oscar - nominated flicks , most of the screenplays are floating around on the Internet .
Wanna act out Crazy Heart at the dinner table tonight ?
Here you go .
You can also check out scripts for A Single Man , A Serious Man , Inglourious Basterds , Avatar , An Education , The White Ribbon , Precious , The Last Station , Coraline , The Hurt Locker and The Blind Side .
Obvious reminder : Oscar night is March 7 on ABC .
The awards are being hosted by Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin , and I 'm hoping for a snazzy opening musical number .
New research on college dating violence investigates male victims , a perspective that acknowledges instigation of aggression as a gender - neutral behavior .
The view is necessary , says Sandra Stith , a Kansas State University expert on intimate partner violence .
Stith says most research has looked at men as offenders and women as victims .
“ In the research on college students in particular , we ’re finding both men and women can be perpetrators , ” she said .
“ In our growing - up years , we teach boys not to hit their sister , but we do n’t teach girls not to hit their brother . ”
She and a K - State research team are looking at the impact that being a victim of violence has on male vs. female college students in heterosexual relationships .
“ Most research shows female victims having higher levels of depression , anxiety and school problems than nonvictims , ” Stith said .
“ Our research indicates that both male and female college students are being victims of violence , and we want to see how it affects both . ”
In 2008 , Stith and her former student at Virginia Tech , Colleen Baker , published research in the Journal of Aggression , Maltreatment and Trauma that found the biggest predictor of whether male and female college students would use violence against a partner was whether the partner was violent toward them .
“ It ’s a dramatically more important factor than anything else , ” Stith said .
“ If your girlfriend hits you , that dramatically increases the likelihood that you ’re going to hit her , and vice versa . ”
In general , Stith said there are lower levels of violence among college couples than among married or cohabiting couples , and the violence is more likely to involve shoving and pushing by both men and women .
“ Previous research indicates that as young people grow up , the violence may become less frequent or severe or it may be eliminated , ” Stith said .
“ Sometimes it ’s about immaturity . ”
Although alcohol is often a factor in violence among older couples who are married or in long - term relationships , Stith said drinking — particularly binge drinking — plays a big part in college student violence .
Other factors include a lack of anger management skills and having grown up with parents who are violent with one another .
“ When students get angry with their boyfriend or girlfriend , violence sometimes seems to be the normal thing to do , ” she said .
Stith said when researching alcohol problems , she found that college students often had different standards for themselves when it came to what constitutes a drinking problem .
Whereas they see themselves as just partying and participating in normal college life , they would say an older , professional adult behaving the same way has a problem with alcohol .
“ I think they might be normalizing their aggressive behaviors , too , ” she said .
“ They may think that when they ’re drinking and get angry and she slaps him and he grabs her , that it ’s not domestic violence .
They may think that domestic violence is what happens in married people ’s lives . ”
Stith said one of her basic philosophies is that society needs to work toward ending all violence , not just male violence .
“ We need to address female violence , too , ” she said .
“ We need to say that when you ’re in a relationship with someone you care about , you do n’t hit and you do n’t kick . ”

Female Domestic Violence
Tampa , Florida ( CNN ) --
The unusually cold weather that struck Florida in January did more than damage crops and citrus trees .
It has also caused an unprecedented number of deaths among Florida 's beloved residents , the endangered West Indies manatees .
Twisting and flopping in the shallow water , Baby Coral probably does n't realize just how lucky she is .
When this 3 - year - old female manatee was brought into Tampa 's Lowry Park Zoo last month , she was 300 pounds underweight , unable to eat .
Her skin was covered with small white , blister - like lesions known as " Florida frostbite , " the result of exposure to cold temperatures .
Lowry Park
Zoo is one of the three facilities in the state that provide medical treatment and a place for manatees to recover from cold stress , as well as other injuries .
" It 's an exceptionally bad year for the manatee , " said Dr. David Murphy , the zoo 's veterinarian .
So far this year , a record 280 or more manatees have died from cold stress - related illnesses .
That 's estimated to be 5 percent of the total population in Florida .
Add that to last year 's record mortality rate of 429 deaths from boat strikes and other causes , and that number may be as high as 10 percent .
Marine biologist Andy Garrett says he 's never seen anything like this before .
The full impact of the cold weather on the manatee population is still unclear , according to Garrett , who works for Florida 's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .
He says that when water temperatures dip below 68 degrees Fahrenheit , these subtropical animals simply can't cope with the cold .
Last month , Florida 's water temperatures dropped as low as the 40s .
While manatees are round and plump like seals and other marine mammals , their fat is not designed to insulate them from the cold , Garrett said .
West Indies manatees roam the warm waters of the Caribbean , and in the summer have been known to migrate as far north as the New Jersey , and as far west as Texas .
But those wintering in Florida are at the marginal edge of their habitat , and are always susceptible to the cold .
On the other side of Tampa Bay , manatees have found a practical solution : Hundreds gather in a canal warmed by water discharged from a Tampa Electric Co. power plant .
There , they are able to escape the cold , floating in waters that stay around 78 degrees .
The carcasses of manatees who were n't able to find a warm water refuge have been turning up daily .
Most end up at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 's necropsy lab in St. Petersburg .
The lab has been busy in recent weeks , at times examining a dozen manatees a day .
There , Dr. Martine de Wit and her staff determine cause of death .
It 's normally the young manatees that are most stressed by cold weather , but this year , full - size adults are dying .
" That is a very bad sign , " she said .
The cold water shuts down their internal systems .
Many were unable to eat ; others drowned because they were unable to breathe .
Garrett and de Wit believe that this may just be the beginning .
They fear that more manatees will die during the spring , unable to recover from the trauma of Florida 's deep freeze .

| || Er du bekymret for EUs datalagringsdirektiv , med krav til norske nettleverandører om å langtidslagre informasjon om hvem du snakker med på telefon , hvem du kommuniserer med via epost og hvor du befinner deg når du gjør det , samt din IP - adresse og tidspunkter for på- og avlogging på nettet ?
Da vil du kanskje ha interesse av å vite at direktiv 2006 / 24 / EF bare er blåbær sammenliknet med det man har på tegnebrettet i
unionen .
Utvidet monitorering av borgernes atferd , både på nett og i den fysiske verden , er høyt på agendaen .
To storstilte forskningsprosjekter kan være begynnelsen på en ny æra for EU som høyteknologisk overvåkingssamfunn .
Forskningsprosjektet ADAPTS ( Automatic Detection of Abnormal Behaviour and Threats in crowded Spaces ) er et forsøk på å utvikle et system for helautomatisk overvåking som kombinerer levende bilder , lydopptak og sensorer i jakten på « unormal » atferd i det offentlige rom .
Ved hjelp av avansert informasjonsteknologi skal systemet gjøre det enklere å ta voldsmenn , fotballpøbler og andre med uønsket atferd på offentlig sted .
AT SYSTEMET i jakten på den « abnorme » atferden nødvendigvis vil måtte følge og evaluere alle oss andre , gir gufne assosiasjoner til dårlig science fiction og orwellianske dystopier .
Men det kan alts å bli virkelighet , med norske SINTEF og Detec AS som bidragsytere , ifølge bransjenettstedet Digi.no .
Nylig kunne samme nettsted også fortelle om EU - prosjektet INDECT , som skal bruke 100 millioner på å utvikle teknologi for overvåking av offentlige internettressurser .
Forum , nyhetsgrupper , filtjenere , fildelingsnettverk og individuelle datamaskiner skal overvåkes ved hjelp av teknologi som skal avsløre « trusler og gjenkjenne unormal oppførsel eller vold » , for å sitere prosjektets nettsider .
De « unormale » og « farlige » blant oss skal alts å jaktes ned , både inne på nettet og ute i det fysiske rom , gjennom storstilte , automatiserte og høyteknologiske overvåkingssystemer .
IKT - Norges Torgeir Waterhouse er profilert motstander av datalagringsdirektivet , og mener direktivet ikke kan sees isolert fra prosjekter som ADAPT og INDECT .
Det har han trolig rett i.
Innføres datalagringsdirektivet , er politikernes barrierer lavere den dagen forskerne leverer nye , nøkkelferdige systemer for såkalt « intelligent » overvåking av oss alle i jakten på de få , farlige .
Det er kanskje noe å tenke på for Erna Solberg og Høyre , som er på vippen i datalagringssaken i Stortinget ?
Etter at Oslo
Høyre sa et klart og tydelig nei til direktivet , håper motstanderne nå at partiets stortingsrepresentanter vil bli stilt fritt i saken .
Det ville nok en gammel partifelle av Solberg i Fredrikstad satt pris på .

The crowd inside Lincoln Center ’s Walter Reade Theater on January 9 is awaiting what is being billed as “ An Evening With Jeff Bridges . ”
And officially , that ’s how things are going to unfold : A brief set of highlights from the actor ’s 40 - year career will unspool , after which Bridges will take the stage for a Q&A , to be followed by a screening of his 1971 breakthrough , The Last Picture Show .
It ’s all been skillfully designed to permit film buffs to pretend that they are not participating in an Oscar campaign .
The only problem is , nobody ’s buying it , least of all the audience , which fills the air with gossip about the Academy Awards chances of Bridges ’s new film , Crazy Heart .
“ This is all part of his Oscars push , ” the woman behind me tells her friend .
“ If Jeff Bridges were n’t in the running , I would be all for Colin Firth for A Single Man .
But it ’s Jeff ’s turn . ”
“ Did you see Brothers ? ” her friend ventures .
“ Tobey Maguire in that movie made me cry . ”
“ It ’s not his turn . ”
“ But he was wonderful ! ”
“ It ’s not his turn . ”
“ Is that the way it works ? ”
“ In my mind it works that way . ”
It would be fun to report that the nominations for this year ’s Academy Awards , which were announced February 2 , were the result of brilliant maneuvering or diabolically clever stratagems , of masterstrokes and counterthrusts carefully planned in studio war rooms .
But despite often justifiable skepticism about the process , Oscar nominations — one of which , of course , went to Bridges — ca n’t be bought .
Not exactly , anyway .
There is a reason why they call the run-up period to the Academy Awards the “ Oscar campaign . ”
It is , to use a familiar analogy , like an election , with an electorate of 5,777 people ( the size of McKenzie County , North Dakota ) , unwilling to be influenced by anything but their own opinions , yet still , perhaps , more swayable than they ’d like to admit .
There is no war room , per se , but there are early front - runners that fade , grassroots insurgencies , even primaries .
Ultimately , most of the nominees emerge from a combination of good planning , good movies , and good luck : Crazy Heart ’s distributor , Fox Searchlight , had the smarts first to acquire the film in July , and then , when it sensed an opening in this year ’s Best Actor field , to accelerate its release from the spring of 2010 to December .
The gambit was shrewd ; writer - director Scott Cooper ’s small - scale debut , in which Bridges plays a country singer seeking redemption , opened to strong reviews just as some of Bridges ’s potential competitors ( Nine ’s Daniel Day - Lewis and The Lovely Bones ’ Mark Wahlberg ) were cratering with critics .
That Bridges gives a beautifully lived - in , eminently praiseworthy performance in Crazy Heart was n’t just important ; it was crucial .
But it ’s also not enough .
And that ’s where an Oscar campaign comes in .
No effort or expense can make any of the Academy ’s members vote for an actor , director , or screenplay they do n’t like .
But what a smart Oscar campaign ( like a successful political campaign ) can do is to make someone or something part of a larger story , and Crazy Heart had a good one to tell : Bridges , a well - liked frequent nominee who just turned 60 , has never won an Oscar .
In other words , it ’s his turn .
A good Oscar narrative makes voters feel that , by writing a name on a ballot , they ’re completing a satisfying plotline .
Only a few of these stories are effective , and every campaign season , movies scramble to own them .
The best are reused year after year : for example , The Little Movie That Could , the tale of a low - budget indie , a David among studio Goliaths , that often appeals to voters who hate Hollywood ’s bigger - is - better aesthetic .
Searchlight ( which , as an arm of 20th Century Fox , hardly qualifies as an underdog ) has worked this for years — first with Little Miss Sunshine , then Juno , then last year ’s Slumdog Millionaire .
This year , however , that story line was grabbed early by Lionsgate for Lee Daniels ’s Precious , which also claimed an appealing narrative for acting contenders , The Cinderella Story , thanks to its first - time star , Gabourey Sidibe .
It ’s no accident that all the movies that lead this year ’s newly expanded ten - film Best Picture race have seized other , equally useful Oscar - season story lines .
There ’s always a tussle over The Movie That Speaks to This Moment : Last year , Milk had it from the day Proposition 8 passed in California , and this year , Jason Reitman ’s layoff - era tragicomedy Up in the Air edged out both The Hurt Locker ( Look !
Finally , an Iraq War movie that works ! ) and Avatar ( Look !
It ’s antiwar and pro-environment ! ) for that label .
Each of those movies also boasts an Oscar narrative : Kathryn Bigelow could be the first woman to win the Best Director Oscar , giving The Hurt Locker The Chance to Make History , while Avatar gets to be The Big Gamble That Paid Off as well as , of course , The Popular Favorite .

For actors , other narratives include The Foreigner We ’re Discerning Enough to Single Out ( that ’d be Inglourious Basterds ’ Christoph Waltz ) , The Kid With a Future ( Up in the Air ’s Anna Kendrick ) , and The Comeback ( unused this year — perhaps The Wrestler ’s Mickey Rourke is still holding on to it ) .
But only one is bulletproof :
It ’s Time .
This year , the owner of It ’s Time was supposed to be Firth , who gave one of 2009 ’s most admired performances .
But with Crazy Heart , possession shifted to Bridges , who is seen as having been more unfairly ignored ( an essential element of It ’s Time ) , having lost the Oscar four times , whereas Firth has never been nominated and therefore has never lost .
Get control of It ’s Time and make it sing ( rather than whine ) to voters , and , whether you are Kate Winslet for The Reader or Martin Scorsese for The Departed , you have the Oscar in your hand .
At Lincoln Center , a smiling Bridges strides onto the stage .
He speaks with mellow affability about how his father taught him to act .
He mentions that he ’ll soon take on John Wayne ’s role in a Coen brothers ’ remake of True Grit ( a part for which , incidentally , Wayne won one of the most debatable It ’s Time Oscars ever ) .
He explains that his acting is not “ effortless ” — a word frequently applied to him — and that sometimes the hardest parts to nail are those that seem to be the most natural fits .
He is so calmly charming that tonight , he may be the only star in the business who can make George Clooney look like he ’s trying too hard .
During the talk , his Oscar prospects are never mentioned ; Lincoln Center , after all , is above such West Coast crassness .
Well , at least above admitting to it .
But there ’s little doubt that when the evening ends , the attendees — in whose ranks I can spot several Academy voters — are firmly on Team Jeff .
Do these campaigns actually work ?
After all , they represent an insane per capita expenditure designed to do nothing more than influence a tiny pool of undecided film - industry voters in a contest that often has only a negligible effect on the box office and a transient one on winners ’ reputations .
So why bother ?
Because winning is the only thing in Hollywood other than money that reassures the studios ( though almost never the winners themselves ) that they did something better than everyone else .
And in an era in which a dozen bloggers chronicle every who ’s - up - who ’s - down microtwitch , the Oscar race has become a year - round phenomenon .
Maybe even longer :
This season arguably began seventeen months ago , when the fledgling indie Summit Entertainment acquired The Hurt Locker after the 2008 Venice Film Festival and made this campaign ’s first good call :
They sat on the film for the rest of the year , keeping it out of last season ’s Slumdog - juggernaut awards contest .
“ With choices like that , you really never know , ” Bigelow tells me .
“ It turned out to be a great decision . ”
But this year ’s competition was already highly charged by the time The Hurt Locker opened in June .
It amped up the minute the Academy announced that , for the first time since 1943 , ten movies would compete for Best Picture .
The decision , made in response to last year ’s omission of the hugely successful Dark Knight , occasioned instant complaints about the devaluing of a nomination and the apparent underlying mandate to pander to popular taste .
But when the ten nominees were revealed — however debatable you may find some of the choices — one thing became instantly clear : Barring something completely unexpected , this change is here to stay .
Consider the lineup :
The “ top five ” of the top ten — meaning the five that also received Best Director nominations — includes one big- studio blockbuster ( Avatar ) , two indies ( The Hurt Locker , Precious ) , Inglourious Basterds ( a big - budget indie with a big - studio movie star right at the center ) , and Up in the Air ( a studio movie with some of the traits — quirky supporting casting , ambiguous ending — of an indie ) .
It ’s an appealing mix — and one that ’s preserved and even deepened by the expansion to ten movies .
The studios can cheer the spreading of the wealth ; the movies come from ten different companies .
Old - guard populists can point to big hits like Up ( only the second animated film to score a Best Picture nomination ) and The Blind Side ( a groaner , but no more so than a lot of past nominees ) .
Lovers of quality over commerce can cheer the low - grossing An Education and A Serious Man .
Pretty much everyone can delight at the inclusion of District 9 , an independently made sci-fi–horror mockumentary that turned into a studio blockbuster .
And ABC , which airs the show on March 7 , can celebrate a Best Picture roster that boasts five movies that took in more than $ 100 million .

In the context of a race this crowded , The Hurt Locker ’s staying power with voters has been astonishing — even more so because it seems impervious to backlash , the biggest landmine ( so to speak ) of the whole Oscar process .
It hung in from the summer , when The Hangover , Star Trek , and Julie & Julia were bandied about as potential contenders , all the way into winter , when , for a while , anticipatory noise about typical looks - good - on - paper year - end Oscar bait like Invictus , Nine , and The Lovely Bones threatened to drown everything else out .
The Hurt Locker is precisely the sort of movie some people feared the push for a more populist Oscars would marginalize .
Yet it strengthened its hand when , over a few weeks in December , it took a vast number of prizes from the 27 critics ’ groups that were handing them out .
And it may even survive the onslaught of Avatar , which spent most of last year as an unseen grandiose joke , yet by early January was the big - footed behemoth about to obliterate the competition .
Which brings us to the moment , two weeks before balloting for nominations ends , when things get really rough - and - tumble .
In the strange etiquette of Oscar competition , a hard - core , balls - out campaign to get Academy Award nominations is permissible , under the justification that everyone is just helping their movies , whereas pushing hard for an actual win not only looks narcissistically needy but also may be pointless , since most voters decide whom they want to win before the nominations are even announced .
So the real work happens during a mid-January sprint , when actors , writers , and directors suspend their lives to embark on an ego - bruising bi-coastal nightmare carnival of awards and lunches , brunches and teas , screenings , Q&As and tributes , diving into the soul - depleting madness of what Evelyn Waugh long ago called Hollywood ’s “ continuous psalm of self - praise . ”
Movies that do n’t join the fight get lost in the shuffle .
And that ’s why Bridges is the sheepish but willing star of “ an evening with … ” himself , a service he will repeat the very next day at another venue .
A week later , in Los Angeles , I ask Bridges about how it feels to spend more time selling Crazy Heart than he did making it ( the film was shot in 24 days ) .
“ And not getting paid for it , by the way , ” he says with a grin , “ which is funny , because this is harder work !
The acting … that ’s something I would pay them , at least a little , to let me do . ”
He makes these comments while standing on a red carpet , a location in which he will find himself four times in two weeks .
“ Is all this a good thing ? ”
He squints bemusedly at the exploding cameras .
“ It ’s a weird thing .
I guess I do n’t love the show - business aspect , the barker - at - the - carousel side .
But with a movie you ’re pleased with , and you want people to see , I ’m enjoying it . ”
Bridges is an Oscar voter , and when I ask if he ’s caught up on the dozens of DVD screeners that are vying for his vote , which he has to cast in just a few days , he laughs .
“ No way , ” he says .
“ I ’m way behind . ”
There are actually some Best Actor awards Bridges has n’t won .
The Monday after his weekend doubleheader , the New York Film Critics Circle hands its prize to George Clooney .
( The Hurt Locker wins Best Picture and Director , and other acting citations go to Meryl Streep , Waltz , and Mo’Nique . )
The Circle dinner is traditionally a lively , alcohol - lubricated convergence of two alien species — moviemakers and critics — and the mood can range from that of a convivial summit meeting to a grudging cease - fire .
Tonight , it ’s tilting toward sourness .
The group ’s chair is Armond White , the severe and iconoclastic critic for the New York Press , who opens by giving the room a stern talking - to about the decline of art , morality , literacy , cinema literacy , and journalistic integrity .
He makes some disparaging comments about the Internet .
No applause .
“ We are all that stands between the viewer and advertising , ” he says .
Silence .
Well , it ’s expecting a lot to ask movie people to applaud critics , even critics who give them awards .
If White seems grouchy , it may be because the narrative of the evening is running away from him .
“ There are too many awards , ” he insists to the crowd .
“ This one is the real deal . ”
But even the winners and presenters can’t seem to stop mentioning one particular set of prizes .
When Christian Berger accepts his Best Cinematography certificate for The White Ribbon , he makes the night ’s subtext hilariously explicit by remarking , “ I hope it ’s a little kick to an Oscar nomination . ”
( And in fact , it is . )
The grimness peaks with the presentation of Best Supporting Actress .
The winner , Mo’Nique , is absent — she ’s expected in Atlanta the next morning to resume her BET talk show .
Her failure to change her plans has served as the final helping of red meat in a notably ugly anti–Mo’Nique Internet campaign that suggested the actress was not only refusing to campaign but even demanding money to promote Precious .
“ Teach her a lesson ” by denying her the Oscar , snarled one website .
Another criticized her “ diva fit . ”
There ’s no evidence that this tiny tempest influenced a single Oscar voter , but the noise level spooked Lionsgate .
“ Oscar campaigners , ” says a veteran of the process , “ are , like , the Three Stooges of overreacting .
They went into damage control over Mo’Nique before there was even any damage — and it happened because they were dumb enough to read these blogs and think there was an actual crisis !
Suddenly , they were like , ‘ We need triage !
We have to fly reporters down to Atlanta ! ’ ”

White — no fan of Precious — takes the podium .
“ Mo’Nique could not attend tonight , but the award is hers . ”
He shrugs and moves on without a word of praise for her .
It ’s an ungallant reminder of why critics and moviemakers do n’t get together more often .
Bigelow accepts her prizes with elegant understatement , and Waltz winningly tells the critics , “ I ’m so grateful to get to stand up in front of you who I hoped to fear one day . ”
But it ’s up to Clooney to save the evening , and he does it twice , as presenter and accepter , both times judging the room with uncanny perceptiveness .
Presenting an award to Fantastic Mr. Fox ’s shy and rabbity director Wes Anderson , Clooney leans into the lectern and decides to terrorize him , merrily announcing , “ I ’m like , Mariah Carey fucked up right now ! ” Hoots and cheers .
“ I was talking to Wes , and he told me , ‘ George , tonight , when I give my acceptance speech , I ’m gonna blow the roof off this fuckin’ place ! ’
I said , ‘ Wes , there are people who are really good at this — Meryl Streep is here ! ’
He said , ‘ Fuck her ! ’ ” Roars from the room , and from Streep , who gives Anderson a standing ovation .
Clooney concludes his own acceptance by noting that he ’s a sincere fan of print journalism , reminding everyone that his dad was a newspaper guy and saying , “ I really do wish you all the best of luck . ”
Well played .
Clooney is honored again the next night — this time in a tie with Morgan Freeman — at the National Board of Review Awards dinner at Cipriani .
The NBR is a somewhat mysterious organization with a voting process that is , in its murkiness , halfway between the College of Cardinals and a Florida election .
These days , its claim to fame is that it announces winners before any other group — the news came way back on December 3 , allowing information - starved Oscar handicappers to sift the group ’s choices obsessively even while insisting that they are a harbinger of nothing .
But five weeks later , the NBR ’s decision to go heavily for the indifferently received Invictus — giving it Best Actor and Best Director — seems like a bad guess , a case of failed futures trading .
News of the earthquake in Haiti has just broken , and as the long evening unfolds , BlackBerrying starts — first surreptitiously , then with impunity .
( Some are scanning the news , although in truth , many more are relishing the gleeful Schadenfreude of reading about Jay and Conan . )
But others are watching the acceptance speeches closely .
Perhaps too closely .
It ’s easy for people in the thick of the process to believe that even the smallest moment can pivotally affect the Oscars — that whether through emotionalism or wit or galvanic skin response , someone is always acquiring momentum or losing it .
Even 30 seconds at a microphone becomes overburdened with portent .
From the back of the vast room , a publicist watches The Hurt Locker ’s “ Breakthrough Actor ” winner Jeremy Renner , a soft - spoken guy who gives the intriguing impression that at any moment he could ricochet in an unexpected direction , accept his prize and remark with a wry smile , “ It feels cool to still be breaking out at 39 … I ’m okay with that . ”
“ There could have been more money spent on our campaign .
It ’s depressing that [ there was n’t ] — and depressing that it ’s necessary at all . ”
“ Ugh ! ” the publicist says , as adrenalized as someone in a presidential - debate spin room .
“ Did you see him up there ?
He was comatose !
We ’re going to have to wake him up or he ’s not going to win anything . ”
That panic feels symptomatic of a recession year during which , uncharacteristically , nobody has overspent on trade advertisements or lavish parties — yes , even during a period of record - breaking box office .
The electorate , perhaps even the Oscar electorate , seems surly , and no company wants to look Marie Antoinette–ish .
( Not that things will ever go back to the days of mid-nineties Miramaxian campaign excess ; according to Academy regulations , studios can’t even have quotes from critics on the DVD packages they send to voters . )
So Campaign 2010 is leaning heavily on “ free media , ” from online interviews to large - scale coups like the hour 20 /20 devoted to The Blind Side to the holy grail of an embrace from Oprah ( who , besides serving with Tyler Perry as co–fairy godmother of Precious , has bestowed her show ’s largesse on Avatar , Nine , and Up in the Air ) .
An acceptance speech is free media , even if only a few dozen Oscar voters are listening .
You better work it , Renner !
Later in the evening , a few people actually express disappointment when Best Actress winner Carey Mulligan fails to weep at the podium .
It ’s a good night for Up in the Air , which also wins Best Adapted Screenplay ( Reitman ’s and Sheldon Turner ’s awkward , have - we-met ?
acceptance speeches look like exactly what they are — the result of a Writers Guild credit arbitration ) and Best Picture .
Presenter Michael Douglas praises the movie for “ its ability to blend social commentary with good old - fashioned entertainment . ”
That is , in one sentence , the pitch — the sell that the backers of Up in the Air want to resonate with Oscar voters — and very much the argument they do not want Avatar to hijack over the coming week , when the action moves to Los Angeles .
Avatar has , by this point , bolstered its other narratives by shocking the conventional wisdom and opening to stellar reviews .
If the Oscars are all about story line , the skepticism that preceded Avatar ’s first screenings was the best thing that could have happened to it .

It ’s known in L.A. as “ Globes Weekend , ” but for the players involved , the Golden Globes — presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , a group known for its susceptibility to bad musicals , big stars , free food , and the charming imprecations of Harvey Weinstein — is just the final stop in three days of force - fed festivity .
Contenders like Mulligan , Sidibe , Kendrick , Renner , and Reitman are the new faces of the season , and they ’re expected to hit every event of this giddy love - in .
( “ I just go where I ’m told , ” says one .
“ They even told me how many changes of clothes to bring . ” )
It ’s a roaming party made especially intense by how quickly heat can dissipate ; if form holds , out of the twenty Oscar nominees for acting this year , only one or two will be invited back next year .
Eat , drink , and be merry , for in 2011 , you will only be presenters .
The first stop is the American Film Institute luncheon , at which ten movies are honored ( full disclosure : I was one of this year ’s jurors ) .
The films , each of which presents a clip , range from sure Oscar bets like The Hurt Locker to worthy left - field choices like Sugar and Coraline to a couple of movies — Tom Ford ’s A Single Man and Oren Moverman ’s The Messenger — hoping to break into Oscar ’s top ten .
The Messenger , which has grossed only about $ 800,000 , is probably the least - seen movie that has a shot at a Best Picture nomination ; after the AFI ceremony , in the driveway of the Four Seasons Hotel , I hear a publicist for a rival film mutter grimly into his cell phone , “ I do n’t know if that movie is on the radar or not , but that clip killed . ”
The Messenger is distributed by Oscilloscope , a New York–based indie run by Beastie Boy Adam Yauch and David Fenkel .
“ You never know how these things will shape up , ” says Fenkel .
“ Every couple of weeks , films that you thought were contenders turn out not to be , so you ’re constantly revising your expectations .
And what we found was that in early December , Woody Harrelson ’s performance started getting a lot of traction . ”
For movies without a huge campaign budget , that kind of break is critical : Actors form the Academy ’s largest branch , and a talked - about performance like Harrelson ’s can lead voters to watch the DVD and perhaps consider other long - shot choices — like the screenplay ( which does , in fact , get nominated ) or even the film itself ( which does n’t ) .
Oscilloscope sent screeners to voters early , a real gamble for a company without even a small studio budget , where even a single “ For Your Consideration ” ad page , which commands between $ 13,000 and $ 30,000 , requires a cost - benefit analysis .
But even in a season of relative austerity , money still matters , and it ’s hard to argue that the playing field is level when you ’re driving from one studio party to another through a city in which every other billboard ( price : $ 50,000 and up for four weeks ) seems to be touting Inglourious Basterds or Up in the Air .
( At least Up in the Air is still trying to sell movie tickets .
The billboards for Basterds , long gone from theaters , are clearly meant for Academy voters only — Harvey Weinstein , who released the movie , being Oscar ’s most remorseless campaigner . )
At some ceremonies , more is at stake for the givers than for the recipients .
Over the last decade , the Broadcast Film Critics Association Critics ’ Choice Awards have bounced from E ! to the WB to VH1 , where the ratings are reportedly “ lower than [ the network ] would like . ”
( How low do ratings have to be to disappoint VH1 ? )
The show ’s producers have wisely tagged the banquet at the Hollywood Palladium onto the Friday of Globes weekend , praying that stars will show up .
And except for Clooney , who is working on the coming Friday ’s just - announced Haiti telethon , they do .
By this evening , the crisis in Haiti is being taken more seriously , even within the celebrity bubble .
Tobey Maguire comes out to make a plea for people to send money .
People nod and look away thoughtfully as if they just remembered they left something in the glove compartment .
Then Maguire presents Best Supporting Actress — it ’s Mo’Nique !
Now they ’re awake .
Partial standing ovation .
Is she actually there ?
She is , looking awards -y in a dark gown , and thus ends the “ Mo’Nique is n’t showing up ” story , not with a bang but with a VH1 appearance .
After her tremulous acceptance speech , she and her husband , Sidney Hicks , are walked through a short outdoor alley into the press room — actually a makeshift tent in a parking lot — which harbors an awesomely unbridled combination of hostility and sycophancy .
A white British journalist yells something at her about “ backlash from the black community . ”
Mo’Nique turns toward him coolly .
“ There was backlash in the black community ? ” she says .
“ I did n’t know nothing about that , baby .
Did you see the first - weekend box office ? ” Question No. 2 is about her purported refusal to campaign .
She calmly replies that all business topics will be handled by her business manager — who is also her husband .
( Uh - oh , I think — historically , the phrase “ business manager who is also my husband ” does not inspire confidence . )
Hicks joins her for some awkward remarks about business paradigms and how Mo’Nique is a “ self - sustaining entity , ” but he ends strongly by saying , “ She ’s a mother , she ’s a wife .
She ’d rather play a bad mother in the movies than be one in real life . ”
As she ’s being escorted back to the Palladium , a side door bursts open and a man rushes out .
“ Mo’ Nique ! ” a familiar voice yells .
“ There she goes !
I was lookin’ for you ! ”
It ’s Tracy Morgan .
Mo’Nique breaks into a grin as Morgan bear - hugs her and says , “ In Precious , you left me all over the floor ! ”
For the first time , she looks genuinely relaxed .

Best Actress is next , which is a tie .
The first winner is , as expected , Streep .
The other nominees listen to her speech with smiles of frozen expectancy .
The second winner — announced after what seems an eternity — is Sandra Bullock .
Carey Mulligan looks slightly crestfallen .
Everybody braces themselves to lose , but nobody is really prepared to do so twice in three minutes .
For most of the room , it ’s a shocker , and a sleepy race wakes up .
You can almost feel it going viral — even though it ’s happening on a show no one is watching ( and , indeed , a clip of Streep and Bullock fake - insulting each other , then fake– French kissing , is soon on YouTube ) .
Bullock , who has never come anywhere near an Oscar nomination but is riding a wave of big box office and positive press for The Blind Side , is almost as good as Streep at the podium :
She gives the kind of emotive , funny , ingratiating speech that makes people say , “ Maybe she should win , ” just because it seems like fun .
All at once , we have a contest — and the most interesting acting face - off of the season , since the excellent narrative behind Streep ( namely , There Is No Way on God ’s Green Earth That This Woman Should Have Fewer Best Actress Oscars Than Hilary Swank ) must now fight off Bullock ’s , the much simpler Who ’da Thunk It ?!
Bullock and Streep walk off arm in arm and head back to the press tent .
A roar of approval can be heard from the theater as The Hurt Locker wins Best Picture and Director ( the vibe was that Avatar would kick - start its awards momentum here , but no ) .
Bullock does the first press conference as Streep watches ; then , looking genuinely stunned , she walks off straight into Streep ’s embrace , saying , “ Oh , my blood sugar !
Okay , now it ’s your turn . ”
The first question to Streep : “ You have n’t won an Oscar for 26 years , and you ’ve deserved so many .
How does it make you feel to go to these shows ? ”
“ Oh , it makes me feel fantastic , ” she says , a microscopic edge to her voice before she explains — convincingly , of course — that it ’s actually delightful .
She ’s asked about what she thinks of Bullock .
Streep turns to her .
“ You have an amazing gift .
You really do , ” she says .
“ There are things that look effortless that are the hardest things to do . ”
I ’m close enough to see tears in Bullock ’s eyes .
Streep and Bullock , whispering and giggling , are about to leave together when their ultrapowerful CAA agent Kevin Huvane — three - way hug !
— arrives , followed by Bigelow .
Streep and Bigelow are introduced , and for a moment , you think that if these two women have made it to the center of this race , Hollywood might actually be doing something right .
The Kathryn Bigelow story has turned out to be , in many ways , the apex of Oscar excitement during this relatively quiet season ; although she and James Cameron were amicably divorced in 1991 and talk about each other with unfailing respect , there is undeniably a gossip - ravenous appetite for this year ’s voting to be coarsened into The Revenge of the Ex - Wife and decided as a kind of California joint - property settlement in which he walks away with the grosses but she gets the statuettes .
And Bigelow ’s principled refusal to play into this , or to present herself as anything resembling a scorned underdog , only makes people root for her harder .
As she enters to warm applause from the press , Bullock and Streep go into the alley outside the tent to hang out .
The show ’s over , and in a remarkable only - this - year moment , a trophyless Cameron is heading for the parking lot at the very minute his ex-wife is answering questions in the press room .
He spots Bullock and Streep and stops to talk .
Handlers quickly signal for photographs .
Cameron introduces himself to Streep , saying , “ I just thought , you know , we should meet before they take our picture . ”
And so they do .
During the long wait for limousines , I ask Bigelow if she was surprised at the Best Picture win .
The director , a lithe 58 , is being treated like a star ( and sometimes a starlet ) everywhere she goes .
After more than 30 years of hard work , she seems touchingly abashed by the tide of goodwill flowing her way .
“ I do n’t ever think that something like this is going to happen , ” she says , looking unsure that it actually did .
The Saturday before the Globes offers a fourteen - hour run of parties , all designed to sell the impression that everyone is having a wonderful time , although in reality , this treadmill of clamor and Chardonnay and mini-sliders on silver trays serves primarily to instill in almost everyone the fear that they are somehow failing to do the good for themselves that God and their publicists intended .
At a brunch given by the Independent Spirit Awards at a steakhouse , some smaller - scale contenders — from Precious , A Single Man , The Messenger , ( 500 ) Days of Summer , A Serious Man — get to mingle with one another and with past winners like Jodie Foster .
A few manage to cocoon themselves within a Zen calm .
“ I started on [ The Hurt Locker ] three and a half years ago , ” says Renner .
“ I have n’t seen it in a very long time — it ’s difficult for me to watch .
But no , this is not hard .
After three years , what ’s another three months ?
Just do it . ”
But others are struggling to find brave faces .
“ I feel that I ’ve gone through at least three of the stages of grief , ” says the producer of one awards hopeful .
“ A month ago , I felt like we were going to be in it .
We never would have been in the top five , but with ten , there was a real possibility .
And then I realized , no , we were only going to be in the top fifteen , which is not good enough .
You see the winds of change in everything from reading the blogs to watching the other nominations come in .
And then you second - guess , and you get angry .
There could have been more money spent on our campaign , and to think that if that had happened , we would have had a better shot — it ’s depressing that it did n’t happen , and depressing that it ’s necessary at all . ”
In the afternoon , the celebration moves to the BAFTA tea , an immense party with crustless sandwiches and creamy desserts that ’s held by the British Academy at the Beverly Hills Hotel .
Pete Docter , the talented co-writer - director of Up , has taken this ride before ( he ’s won four previous Oscar nominations ) , but he still seems unnerved .
“ The biggest thing I learned is that there ’s basically nothing I can do , so I should stop worrying about it , ” he says .
“ But of course I ’m worrying anyway .
I come to these parties and I think it feels better because at least I ’m trying to do something , but I can never remember what that is supposed to be . ”
And then James Cameron goes too far .
He does the one thing no winner should ever do :
He disses Meryl Streep .
At this point , the talk has turned almost entirely to the Best Picture race .
Avatar is on everybody ’s lips , and , in the reading of the tea leaves that provides a constant background hum , it ’s a gainer , not a waner .
Today ’s waner seems to be Up in the Air , which is enduring unwelcome speculation about perceived tension between Reitman and Turner .
But is it actually waning ?
Nobody knows if it ’s true , or just what people are saying , or if the mere fact that people are saying it makes it true .
At the InterContinental Hotel that night , the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards are doled out .
Wes Anderson , sighting the modest red carpet , lowers his head , darts through the doors , never to return .
“ I told him to go have a drink and come out again as soon as he feels relaxed , ” says a publicist .
“ Huge mistake . ”
But everyone else walks the line , and why not ?
They ’re aglow with the knowledge that they ’ve already won .
“ This is nothing to get jaded about or slack off from , ” says Best Supporting Actor winner Waltz .
“ This is fantastic !
And honestly , who knows if I ’ll get to participate ever again ? ”
A night after her Critics ’ Choice win , Mo’Nique works the carpet with enthusiasm .
When I ask if she can imagine taking on another heavyweight role , she laughs and says , “ I ’m an entertainer , baby ! ” ( Anyone in conversation with Mo’Nique gets tagged “ baby , ” “ mama , ” “ brother , ” or “ sister . ” )
“ I love to entertain .
Now , what will come under that umbrella , I do n’t know … but of course ! ”
She glides into the hotel , in a sweet groove .
Thanks to a couple of angry bloggers and a surge of support in response , she ’s copped her narrative : Mo’Nique is The Comeback , 2010 edition .
Globes day arrives with torrential rain .
Red - carpet catastrophe !
Actresses who look like they ’ve survived on Tic - Tacs for three days edge tentatively toward the entrance , encased in dresses they can’t move in , ornamented with jewelry they do n’t own , and protected by umbrella - wielding publicists .
“ You know what was really great about today ? ” an actress in attendance says later .
“ The rain .
Seriously .
Because I spent the weekend doing this , like everyone else , and suddenly , in the middle of all this acclaim for all these people , I found myself feeling greedy and insecure .
You start to feel that if you ’re not winning , you must be losing .
If you ’re not ‘ the best , ’ maybe you ’re not any good .
And then it rained , and I was on the red carpet , and suddenly everybody looked a little worse for wear .
Everybody was wet , with shit in their hair .
It was a relief .
We were human again .
Mostly . ”
If the spirits of many of the nominees have flattened somewhat , it ’s not just the weather , or that another set of wins for Bridges , Mo’Nique , and Waltz is starting to feel like a horror - movie version of Groundhog Day for the other nominees .
The tragedy in Haiti , now filling the front pages , has made many of them self - conscious about the whole fiddling - while - Rome - burns excess of this weekend .
Tonight Avatar finally steps up .
A pair of wins for Best Picture and Best Director provide the first hard evidence that the sheer scope of the movie ’s success just might stop The Hurt Locker in its tracks .
For most of the evening , the mood in the pressroom has been bored — lots of “ What are you wearing ? ” questions , and one single - minded reporter beginning an inquiry with , “ There is a reluctance tonight to talk about Tiger Woods … ” Some journalists are already packing up when a triumphant Cameron walks in , his cast in tow .
“ I would ask you not to be humble , ” the first questioner begins .
No problem .
Cameron quickly advances what amounts to a three - pronged case for why Avatar should win the Oscar .
Ebulliently , he muses that the film ’s technological leaps could “ give permission to other filmmakers ” to take 3 - D out of the ghettos of “ high - end animation and lowbrow live - action ” ; he points out that the movie , which he envisioned as a “ shameless engine of commerce , ” is only the second sci - fi film to take this prize ; and he notes that it ’s “ very interesting that a major Hollywood commercial film is in some way controversial , whether it ’s the environmental theme or some of the political themes . ”
It ’s an aggressive sell : Tonight , he wants all of the Oscar narratives — The Chance to Make History , The Popular Favorite , The Movie That Speaks to This Moment .
And then , he goes too far .
He keeps talking .
And he does the one thing that no winner should ever do in a roomful of journalists :
He disses Meryl Streep .
A reporter asks him why Avatar ’s motion - capture performances have n’t gotten more respect from actors .
“ I ’m going to give you an example , ” Cameron says , clearly recalling the encounter I witnessed with the actress after the Critics ’ Choice Awards .
“ I had always wanted to meet her — and I was talking about the performance - capture stuff and I was mentioning how all the actors love doing it .
And she said , ‘ Oh , yes , I know .
I had such a great time doing Fantastic Mr. Fox . ’
I thought ‘ Oh , my God , this is a perfect example of what ’s wrong ! ’
She did n’t perform the character physically over a period of months .
She did a voice performance maybe for a day , maybe for two days , on a lectern ! ”
From far away , I can feel Fox executives emitting psychic beams : “ Stop talking now . ”
“ It ’s almost like Asperger ’s with him , ” a producer tells me later .
“ How many years has it taken him to live down ‘ I ’m the King of the World ! ’?
When he shifts into that mode of talking about how great his movies are and how other people just do n’t get it , he is literally incapable of understanding how he sounds .
And I say that as a fan !
He makes it incredibly hard to vote for him . ”
Five different distributors have staked out various spots in the Beverly Hilton for Globes after - parties , which range from the buoyant , everybody - wants - in Warner Bros. / InStyle fête to the NBC Universal non-celebration , which thins out fast .
Even Tina
Fey splits by 9:30 , saying , “ I am turning the corner into foot pain .
These shoes are taking me to Buniontown . ”
And then the stars disappear , back to the hills or the canyons or New York or London .
The rain continues for five more days , and when the contenders reconvene the following weekend for the Screen Actors Guild Awards , they look like foot - weary marathoners .
Homegrown Day of the Locust types wait hours in order to scream names from the bleachers .
But by now , the movie people have developed self - preserving selective deafness and just march by .
The SAG Awards start at 5 p.m. PST — the exact minute that Oscar - nomination voting ends — and the sense of exhaustion and relief is palpable .
Whatever they can do , they ’ve done it .
And now , one more time , Vera Farmiga and Kendrick and Renner and Harrelson and Mulligan must watch politely as prizes go yet again to Bridges , Waltz , Mo’Nique , and Bullock — who , for the first time , tops Streep in a head - to - head contest .
Who ’da Thunk It ?! , as an Oscar narrative , appears to be working out well for her .
But , this time , she is n’t quite as beguilingly shocked .
And a few days later , when The Blind Side scores an unexpected ( to put it kindly ) Best Picture nomination , the first stirrings of the enough - already backlash are felt .
Her road to the Oscars now becomes trickier , since holding onto your status as an appealing underdog is hard once you actually start to win .
The night ’s other winner , of sorts , is George Clooney .
When SAG ’s president Ken Howard commends him for his work on the previous evening ’s Haiti telethon , it becomes clear that Clooney ’s status in Hollywood has been transformed in the last two weeks .
There ’s always one actor who the industry wants representing it — not necessarily the highest grosser or the hottest star , but the most natural leader , the guy who figures out what Hollywood should be doing .
For fifteen years , that ’s been Tom Hanks .
This year , the mantle may have been passed .
He ’s probably not going to win next month , but in the last couple of weeks , osmotically but unmistakably , George Clooney has been elected the industry ’s new class president .
Ironically , all of the prize frenzy of the preceding week has boiled down to what feels like a two - movie race .
An Oscar for Avatar , which became the highest - grossing film in U.S. history the very day the nominations were announced , would represent a chance for Hollywood to reassert its cultural centrality in dire times .
An Oscar for The Hurt Locker would be a forceful assertion that when it comes to rewarding a singular and uncompromising vision at the Academy Awards , the bottom line does not always have to be about the bottom line .
Avatar would shatter precedent by becoming the first Best Picture winner since 1933 to take the prize without any acting or writing nominations .
The Hurt Locker , which has taken in just under $ 13 million at the U.S. box office , would shatter precedent by becoming the lowest - grossing winner since the fifties .
As the usual suspects gather for the next night ’s Producers Guild Awards at the Hollywood Palladium , gossip is that , of the ten nominees ( eight of which make the eventual roster of Oscar contenders ) , Avatar is a shoo - in .
Nobody doubts this .
And then — nothing more gratifying can happen during Oscar season — everybody turns out to be wrong .
The Hurt Locker wins .
“ It was beautiful , ” a veteran executive says the next morning .
“ Kathryn Bigelow had to walk right by Cameron ’s table .
I know they ’re friendly .
Whatever .
But still , the look on her face was so wonderful .
It was surprise , and it was affection for him , but maybe there was just a little defiance too .
You know , like ‘ Not so fast , Jim . ’ ” One week later , she does it again , beating Cameron for the Directors Guild of America Award .
By all reports , the room , and even her competitors , approved .
And it ’s easy to imagine what many of them were thinking :
It ’s her turn .
It ’s time .
How to make an artificial shark uterus
So , apparently some Australian scientists are attempting to create artificial shark uteruses — so that they can prevent fetal sharks from eating each other in the womb .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Here ’s the deal :
The average female grey nurse shark begins her pregnancy with about 40 embryos in her two uteruses .
But it takes a year for the baby sharks to gestate , and by the time they ’re ready to be born , there are only two left — one in each uterus .
Why ?
Because by four months they ’ve developed a full set of teeth , and the strongest begin cannibalizing the weaker ones .
Ay yi yi .
I ’d heard of wild dingos getting into deathmatches right after being born , but this takes the whole red - in - tooth - and - claw stuff up to the next level .
Anyway , the grey nurse shark population is apparently critically endangered , and since they ’re the top predators in the oceanic food chain , the ecosystem could be unpredictably unbalanced if they all vanish .
So the scientists are trying to develop an artificial shark uterus so they can capture a pregnant female , flush out the embryos , and raise them independently so they can all be born .
Of course , as Slate wondered , maybe this attempt to tinker with Mother Nature is doomed to failure .
Maybe the embryo sharks need to feed on one another to survive long enough to be born ; and maybe the pre-birth contest serves to winnow out sharks that would n’t prosper in the wild anyway .
Scientists are n’t sure , as an AFP story notes :
No accepted explanation has been established for why the grey nurse sharks take sibling rivalry to such extreme lengths .
“ It would seem logical that the intra-uterine cannibalism does confer some sort of evolutionary advantage , somewhat similar to the survival of the fittest , but it may be the luck of the draw because even the biggest could be attacked , ” Otway said .
Well , that ’s gotta be a conversation - stopper at cocktail parties .
“ So , what do you do for a living ? ” “ Oh , I design artificial shark uteruses to prevent inter-uterine embryo cannibalism . ”
