RFID passport logo ( or " mark of the beast " ? )
How can you tell if your passport contains an RFID chip ?
Look for this logo on the label :
If there 's an RFID chip in your passport , identity thieves , terrorists , direct marketers , data aggregators , malicious governments , or anyone else with a radio receiver within 10 meters ( 30 + feet ) or more whenever your passport is read at a border crossing , airport , etc. can secretly and remotely track you , log your movements through the unique " collision avoidance " ID number sent by the chip , and intercept and decrypt all the data ( including your digital photo and , in some countries , your digitized fingerprints ) needed to " ' clone " a perfect copy of your passport , forge other identity credentials , or impersonate you .
All passports that contain ICAO standard ( ICAO document 9303 ) RFID chips ( ISO standard 14443 ) are supposed to have this logo on the front cover , printed or embossed in such a manner that it can't readily be effaced or removed without leaving conspicuous traces .
Border guards and immigration inspectors need to be able to distinguish quickly and reliably between a ( valid , for the time being ) passport that never contained an RFID chip , and an invalid ( under current USA regulations and , I expect , similar regulations in other countries that are putting RFID chips in passports ) passport that contains a defective or disabled RFID chip .
A visible logo is needed because the RFID chip might not otherwise be readily or reliably detectable .
When I felt the sample RFID passports passed around at CFP 2005 by Frank Moss , director of the Passport Office of the USA Department of State , I could ( just barely ) detect the RFID chip embedded in the cover by its stiffness when I bent the cover sharply and rolled the bend back and forth across the width of the cover page .
But if I were a government agency , I would n't want to rely on that .
The chip or antenna might fail if the cover was bent sharply every time the passport was checked .
And the Passport Office reportedly has been shopping for smaller chips less prone to breakage in the laminating and binding machinery , which would also be harder to detect by feel .
The RFID passport logo was prominently printed or embossed on the cover of all of Moss ' sample RFID passports , immediately below the words , " United States of America " -- but without any indication , anywhere in the passport , even in the finest print , that would tip off those not already in the know as to what the logo means .
The ICAO technical documents include an entire paper on the RFID passport logo , the need for standard RFID indicia on passports , and the discussion of which of several proposed logos to adopt .
But none of those proposed logos , much less which one was ultimately adopted as the standard , are reproduced in the file on the public ICAO Web site .
The USA State Department mentions the logo in its " FAQ on RFID Passports " , and even includes a hyperlink to an image file -- that does n't exist at the specified location .
But I found an image file with the same name , which I recognized and remembered from Moss 's sample RFID passports at CFP , in another public directory elsewhere on the State Department Web server .
Here 's how the Passport Office describes the logo and its use :
What is the Electronic Passport logo and what does it mean ?
The Electronic Passport logo ( shown at the right above ) is the international symbol for an electronic passport .
It signifies that the passport contains an integrated circuit or chip on which data about the passport and passport bearer is stored .
The logo will be displayed at border inspection lanes at all airports and transit ports equipped with special data readers for Electronic Passports .
RFID has acquired deservedly negative connotations with the public .
In response , the USA State Department , ICAO , and European proponents of RFID chips in identity cards all use the Newspeak " electronic passport " or " e- passport " for passports containing embedded RFID chips , and " contactless integrated circuit " for the ISO 14443 standard RFID chips themselves .
The State Department will probably say that the broken link to the logo in it 's FAQ is an innocent error .
They have n't returned my phone calls seeking comment on this as well as on what , if anything , they plan to do in response to the news of Dutch experiments in which similarly - encrypted RFID passport data was remotely intercepted , the encryption scheme cracked , and the data recovered .
But it appears that they want to be discreet with the public about the meaning of this logo .
Why ?
Some people think RFID chips are the mark of the beast mentioned in the Christian bible .
I suspect that the State Department , and perhaps others , are afraid that some of these people might interpret the RFID logo as its own sort of " mark " of the Beast , and object to having to carry it on their passports .
Whatever you think of their beliefs , they might pose a problem for a government that claims to be faith - based and Christian and that has been steadily enlarging the exceptions from government regulations for the " free exercise of religion " , especially if that religion is Christian .
There 's even some interesting case law to support religious objections to displaying government " marks " , most notably Wooley vs. Maynard ( 430 U.S. 705 ) , the 1977 case in which the Supreme Court upheld the right of a religious pacifist to cover over the " Live Free or Die ! " slogan on their New Hampshire motor vehicle license plates .
Coincidentally , both the National Passport Center in Portsmouth -- probably the site of the USA 's first production line for standard RFID passports -- and one of the most active chapters of CASPIAN -- the leading opponents of non-consensual RFID use in the USA -- are located just a few miles apart in southeastern New Hampshire .
[ Addendum , 17 May 2006 : Some more recent information suggests that the first standard RFID passport production line in the USA may be at the second , but expanding , National Passport Center in Charleston , SC .
But we wo n't really know until we start seeing them .
Passports issued either in Portsmouth or Charleston say only " national Passport Center " as the place of issuance , so take note of the postmark on the envelope in which you receive your new passport . ]
In a recent report on this , Boing Boing said that , " The US State Department has said that RFID - chipped passports will not be issued to travelers ' until privacy - related concerns have been addressed . ' "
That 's what the State Department said when it first published its proposed regulations .
But do n't get the mistaken idea that RFID deployment in USA passports is on hold -- except to the extent that it has been delayed by the unreliability of the chips and readers -- or that privacy concerns have actually been addressed .
The State Department put the final regulations into effect later last year with only minor and ineffectual changes -- such as the addition of the " Basic Access Control " encryption scheme for some of the data ( but not the unencrypted unique ID number ) that has already been cracked .
So what can you do if you get a new passport with an RFID chip ?
( Did I mention that you have no choice about whether you 'll get chipped passport , and no way to tell when you apply if you 'll be one of the guinea pigs ? )
You can't disable the RFID chip without voiding your passport : " Any passport which has been materially changed in physical appearance or composition , or contains a damaged , defective or otherwise nonfunctioning electronic chip , or which includes unauthorized changes , obliterations , entries or photographs , ... may be invalidated . "
You can carry your RFID passport in a tin-foil hat :
At least one company is already selling RF - opaque wallet inserts to hold credit cards or similarly sized items with RFID chips , and they 've told me their next product will be a similar but larger optically transparent RFID shielding passport cover .
As one of its " concessions " to critics , the State Department is adding RF shielding to the outer cover of the passport .
But that wo n't protect it from RF interrogation and reading whenever the cover is opened for visual inspection of the data page .
With an add - on sleeve like a book cover that the passport cover slips into , the passport could be opened for visual inspection of the inside data page without exposing the chip in the cover to RF reading .
Even that , however , wo n't protect against the attack used in the recent Dutch cracking demonstrations : eavesdropping on the radio exchange between the chip and a legitimate reader at a border crossing or airport , where you are forced by government order to allow the RFID chip in your passport to be read .
There 's no apparent " technical fix " to the security risks of RFID chips in passports ; the problem requires a legislative fix to prohibit use of RFID chips in identity credentials or their nonconsensual or undisclosed commercial use , and to enact a comprehensive data privacy law in the USA to prohibit the use , sale , rental , or sharing of personal data about us acquired ( through use of RFID chips , in the course of commercial transactions , or otherwise ) by " private " entities , without our permission , without our knowledge , or for purposes other than those for which we originally provided it .
That 's what the law requires in Canada and the European Union , and what it should require in the USA .
And none of those countries , or any others , should be endangering their citizens by putting RFID chips in passports .
In the meantime , if you do find this " mark " on your passport , please let me know about it .
It would help others to know when and by which Passport Offices these start being issued .
And I know several technical experts who would be very interested in testing RFID passports " in the wild " , to see if the attacks demonstrated against Dutch passports with RFID chips will also work against similar USA passports , and what other vulnerabilities they may have .
[ Addendum , 2 February 2006 : The link on the State Department Web site for holders of USA passports is still broken .
But once I knew more about what to look for , I found smaller images of the logo on a Department of Homeland Security Web site on passport requirements for visitors to the USA , and in a later version of one of the ICAO technical reports .
I also found high - resolution photos of Australian passports with RFID chips ( note that the Australian passports have the chip embedded in an inside page , rather than in the cover as in the prototype chipped USA passports ) , and several smaller images of the RFID logo and its use on chipped Thai passports .
But still no pictures of the cover of an RFID - chipped USA passport . ]
[ Further addendum , 3 February 2006 : Blank RFID - chipped passports that could be used to forge passports with " cloned " RFID chips are already in criminal circulation : AllAfrica.com and This Day newspaper report today that more than 2,000 RFID - chipped Nigerian passport blanks were stolen from the headquarters of the Nigeria Immigration Service ( NIS ) in the capital city , Abuja , even before the NIS had its own equipment in place to issue the first " e- passports " using these blanks .
Some of the stolen blanks were reportedly seized and recovered while being shipped to Europe , but it 's not clear if all of the stolen blanks were recovered .
And there 's no reason to think there wo n't be , if there have n't been already , more thefts elsewhere . ]
[ Further addendum , 6 February 2006 : I guess the USA State Department reads this blog :
Now that I 've let the cat out of the bag by posting the logo , they 've fixed the link to the image of the logo on their Web page about RFID passports . ]
[ Further addendum , 1 August 2006 : See pages 29 - 31 ( 31 - 33 of the PDF file ) of the 2006 inaugural issue of the Machine - Readable Travel Documents Report for ICAO 's specifications and explanation of what it calls " the ChipInside symbol " . ]
[ Furher addendum , 1 August 2008 : Here 's a photo of the RFID logo on the cover of a new chipped USA passport . ]

Two policemen dressed as Batman and Robin captured a suspected drugs offender - in a bizarre sting operation .
The Dynamic Duo - Sgt Tony Smith and PC Mike Holman - pulled on the superhero outfits in a bid to unsettle the suspected baddies .
They pretended to be drunks looking for a fancy dress party and knocked on the door of the suspect 's home .
Those inside refused to answer the door to the loud , comically dressed visitors - which was what the officers wanted .
Batman and Robin then went around the back of the property in Weymouth , Dorset , while seven uniformed officers went to the front door .
Those inside the house were PLEASED to see the policemen and complained to them about the fancy dress drunks .
They then invited the officers in .
However , one of the men inside the house ran out of the back door on seeing the policeman - to where the superheroes were waiting for him .
Batman - Sgt Smith - gave chase , jumped over a fence and BIFF , POW , THWACK , arrested him .
PC Kevin Eames , said : " The people opened the door immediately and said that they had been alarmed by some drunken people in fancy dress in their garden .
" So the ruse was successful and we were let in . "
Sgt Smith added : " Last year police officers dressed up as carol singers , which worked well .
" This was my first costumed acting experience .
" The Batman costume was quite comfortable and not too restricting .
I still managed to jump over the fence .
" But it was difficult finding somewhere to put my CS spray .
There was nowhere for the handcuffs , but then Batman does not need handcuffs . "
PC Eames said : " The bad thing about the operation is that we had to endure hours of terrible puns from PC Holman . "
A man aged 22 has been arrested and charged with a drugs offence .
He is bailed to appear before Weymouth magistrates .
There were no charges against two other men found at the property .
Encouraging signs from the Wikipedia project , where co-founder and überpedian Jimmy Wales has acknowledged there are real quality problems with the online work .
Criticism of the project from within the inner sanctum has been very rare so far , although fellow co-founder Larry Sanger , who is no longer associated with the project , pleaded with the management to improve its content by befriending , and not alienating , established sources of expertise .
( i.e. , people who know what they 're talking about . )
Meanwhile , criticism from outside the Wikipedia camp has been rebuffed with a ferocious blend of irrationality and vigor that 's almost unprecedented in our experience : if you thought Apple , Amiga , Mozilla or OS / 2 fans were er , ... passionate , you have n't met a wiki - fiddler .
For them , it 's a religious crusade .
In the inkies , Wikipedia has enjoyed a charmed life , with many of the feature articles about the five - year old project resembling advertisements .
Emphasis is placed on the knowledgeable articles ( by any yardstick , it 's excellent for Klingon , BSD Unix , and Ayn Rand ) , the breadth of its entries ( Klingon again ) , and process issues such as speed .
" We do n't ever talk about absolute quality , " boasted one of the project 's prominent supporters , Clay Shirky , a faculty tutor at NYU .
But it 's increasingly difficult to avoid the issue any longer .
Especially since Wikipedia 's material is replicated endlessly on the web : it 's the first port of call for " sploggers " who create phoney sites , spam blogs , which created to promote their clients in Google .
Wales was responding to author Nicholas Carr , who in a dazzling post on the transcendent New Age " hive - mind " rhetoric that envelops the " Web 2.0 " bubble , took time out to examine the quality of two entries picked at random : Bill Gates and Jane Fonda .
He was n't impressed by what he saw .
" This is garbage , an incoherent hodge - podge of dubious factoids that adds up to something far less than the sum of its parts , " he wrote .
Something that aspires to be a reference work ought to be judged by the quality of the worst entry , he said , in response to the clock - stopped , right - time defense of the project , not by the fact it 's got some good articles .
" In theory , Wikipedia is a beautiful thing - it has to be a beautiful thing if the Web is leading us to a higher consciousness , " writes Carr .
Only it is n't .
" An encyclopedia ca n't just have a small percentage of good entries and be considered a success .
I would argue , in fact , that the overall quality of an encyclopedia is best judged by its weakest entries rather than its best .
What 's the worth of an unreliable reference work ? "
Why , as an Emergent Phenomenon ™ it provides a subject that can be used for countless hours of class study for people like Clay Shirky , of course .
Good for him - but what about the rest of us ?
One advantage of test - driven development I ’ve rarely seen emphasized is that it enables experimental programming .
This was recently brought home to me while I was working on XOM .
Steve Loughran had requested the ability to use a NodeFactory when converting from a DOM document .
It was a reasonable request so I set off to implement it .
My first iteration satisfied Steve ’s use - case .
It was actually a fairly major rework of the code , but the test suite assured me that it all worked and I had n’t broken anything that used to work .
However , Wolfgang Hoschek quickly found a real bug in the new functionality I had added ; and things got a little sticky here .
To satisfy John Cowan , the DOMConverter uses some fancy non-recursive algorithms .
This enables it to process arbitrarily deep documents without stack overflows .
However the algorithm is far from obvious ; and even though the code is well - written it ’s hard to come back to it a couple of years later and figure out just how it works .
But this is where test - driven development really shines : I do n’t have to understand the code to fix it .
All I need is a test case for the new functionality and the bug .
Once that test is passing , I ’m done .
Rather than trying to understand what the code is doing and exactly how the bug is triggered , I just start making changes and running the tests .
The changes are n’t random ; but they ’re based more on intuition and guess work than on detailed analysis of the code paths .
In this case , my first attempt to fix the problem was hitting a NullPointerException .
I could tell from the stack trace that the exception was thrown by this line :
parent.appendChild(children.get ( i ) ) ;
I was pretty sure the parent variable was the offending null object since children had already been used in the immediately preceding line .
The question then becomes why is parent null ?
The most likely candidate seemed to be this line :
parent = parent.getParent ( )
I was n’t absolutely sure of that , but it seemed likely .
I did n’t check it with a debugger or a System.err.println ( ) statement ; but given what else was going on with the code that was the obvious place to look .
Now how to fix it ?
Here I got really confused .
There was no obvious fix .
I was thinking deeply about the problem , and I thought I was going to have to rewrite the entire method from scratch with a totally new algorithm .
But then I stopped thinking for a minute .
“ What ’s the simplest thing that could possibly work ? ” I asked .
This was the simplest thing I could come up with :
if ( parent.getParent ( ) != null ) parent = parent.getParent ( ) ;
The traditional way of approaching this problem would have been to think carefully about the algorithm , and consider exactly how this change would affect that .
What would the parent variable be when the parent was null , and so forth ?
I could have done that , and if I had done that I would have rapidly concluded that this fix would n’t work .
Just looking at it , I really thought this would fail .
But instead I went ahead and ran the test anyway .
Damned if the test did n’t pass !
I ’m done .
I saved myself hours of hard mental effort trying to understand this code .
In fact , I do n’t need to understand the code .
I only need to understand what the code is supposed to do , and have test cases that prove it does it .
This is a radical rethinking of how we program , but I think it ’s essential for modern programs .
XOM is small enough that one person could understand it , but many programs are n’t .
Does anyone really know all the inner workings of Apache ? or Mozilla ? or MySQL ?
Maybe , but I doubt it ; and I know no one really understands everything that ’s going on inside Linux or Windows XP .
The only way we can have real confidence in our programs is by testing them .
Practical programmers long ago gave up on the fantasy of proving programs correct mathematically .
Increasingly I think we ’re going to need to give up on the fantasy of even understanding many programs .
We ’ll understand how they work at the low scale of individual lines , and we ’ll understand what they ’re supposed to do , but the working of the whole program ?
Forget it .
It ’s not possible .
This sounds scary .
This sounds like a radical idea ; and to a computer scientist , it is .
But that ’s only because until relatively recently computer scientists have only dealt with very simple systems .
In the rest of the sciences–physics , chemistry , economics , and so forth–this is how all real problems are handled .
We identify the low level basic principles like Schrodinger ’s equation or Newton ’s Laws that define how the world works ; but when we do actual engineering we use approximations to those laws and we experiment to find out which approximations work in which domains .
Chemists do n’t start with Schrodinger ’s equation when trying to understand the properties of a complex molecule .
They experiment with it .
They poke at it and they prod it , and hit it with electricity , light , heat and a thousand other things , until they ’re confident they know how it behaves .
In many cases , chaos theory tells us we can’t even theoretically hope to solve the underlying equations .
Experiment is all we ’ve got .
Computer science has really avoided experiment of this nature .
Programmers do experiments but they do n’t trust the results , unless they can understand them and rationalize them .
I think that ’s going to have to change .
The systems are getting too big .
While there will always be simple programs and simple systems that can be understood in toto , the more interesting systems are too big .
The only way to manage and understand them is empirically , by experiment and by test .
The good news is that experiments do work .
Test driven development works .
It produces demonstrably more reliable , more robust , less buggy code .
You do n’t need to understand why or how the program works as long as the tests prove that it does .

Introduction …
Although this is artist Mark
Ho ’s first large project , we felt it exhibited such good design and craftsmanship that visitors to this museum would like to see it .
We usually honor established craftsmen who have paid a lifetime of dues in learning their craft , but Mark has taken an interesting path and done a lot of learning in a short time to create this single piece .
He shows much promise to move into new and even more creative areas with his work .
His first artwork , ZOHO Artform 1 took over six years to create .
The use of hard , shiny and decidedly “ non- human ” materials to replicate the delicate and subtle movement of human body presents an interesting contrast , and the actual execution is stunningly done .
About the craftsman …
Mark Ho is from Amsterdam , Netherlands .
He got his early training in film making as a director and script writer .
During his second year at the academy he worked on an animation project that required the building of a puppet that was capable of many movements .
He designed and built the puppet in metal and learned much about working with the materials .
The project also got him started thinking about making the “ ultimate puppet ” that could duplicate the grace and range of human movement .
As he continued to work in film he found it was n’t really what he wanted to do .
Mark notes , “ I finished my study and doubted my future as a director or scriptwriter .
I learned that I like to work alone and to have total control .
In the film industry you are dependent on crew , budget , producers etc .
I decided to learn everything about metalwork .
When I work with metal creating something from a to z , making even the tools myself , it is the ultimate work for me .
It is a beautiful mix of precision , patience , skill and designing , and also that feeling to give shape to a material like metal . ”
ZOHO ARTFORM No. 1 can take any number of natural human poses due to the large number of moveable joints paralleling human form built into its structure .

Making the prototype
Mark found a metalworking artisan who was willing to work with him and show him the techniques of machining metal .
He does n’t have a sculptural or metal education background .
He says , “ I am self - taught , but I did learn a lot from a craftsman , which was very much like a mediaeval master / workman relation .
At first I was visiting him almost every day at his magnificent workshop .
I was learning by watching him work .
Then he told me I could use his metalworking machines .
I stayed there for more than two years . ”
Mark
Ho at work in his well - equipped metal shop .
His drill press , lathe and Cincinnati milling machine can be seen .
( Click on either photo to view a larger image . )
He began by making the hands , with the idea of making them as small and detailed as possible .
The rest of the puppet is made up of other individual projects taken on one at a time .
Regarding quality of work , Mark says , “ If the first project ( the hands ) turns out to be very good , you ’ll have to continue at that level . ”
Once he was half done , there was no turning back .
The rest of the parts had to be made to the level of quality of what he had already started .
He was now too curious to see how it would turn out when finished and never considered giving up , although he says he did have a few “ difficult moments . ”
The entire project took six years before Mark had a prototype that he was satisfied with .
At this point he said , “ No more adjustments . ”
Now that the period of development is over and every part is documented he expects it will take about five months to build a second one .
What the future holds
Every part is shaped out of solid pieces of bronze and stainless steel .
Many parts are made with tools that Mark had to make himself .
He mainly uses two metalworking machines : a lathe and a milling machine .
Mark says his future designs ( ZOHO ARTFORM No.2 , 3 , etc ) , might be other puppets , but not on this scale .
They will contain mechanic parts but will be hand - made in limited editions .
Specifications of ZOHO ARTFORM No.1
Height : 16.93 ” ( 43 cm )
Weight : 13.2 lb ( 6 kg )
Number of parts : 920 ( of which 101 are found in each hand )
Number of mobile parts : 85
Material : Bronze and stainless steel
Details :
The parts are all handmade .
The object comes with a magnetic base which can be de-activated .
All joints are adjustable and easy to remodel , allowing the object to take on any position .
This offers a challenge for those who continually seek to create a new , authentic , original and unique sculpture .
Exclusivity :
ZOHO ARTFORMS No.1 will be limited to a maximum of 25 original , handmade metal sculptures .

Here is my exclusive interview this morning with Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean and founder of the Los Angeles - based Simon Wiesenthal Center — an international Jewish human rights organization dedicated to preserving the memory of the Holocaust by fostering tolerance and understanding through community involvement , educational outreach and social action .
The rabbi was speaking by telephone from Israel , where he said his organization was distributing funds for aid and shelter to people all over Israel , including to Israeli arabs .

( Click here for my UPDATED : Hollywood Reacts To Gibson . )
Q : So what are your feelings about this Mel Gibson story ?
A : Look , the issue with Mel Gibson is very simple .
Mel Gibson is driving under intoxication .
There are no Jews in sight .
He can blame his car , he can blame his liquor , he can blame the sheriff .
But he ca n’t blame any Jews because there are none around .
That ’s precisely who he blames .
Yet that ’s the problem .
That shows he has a problem with Jews .
And there ’s an old Yiddish saying , which loses a lot in translation , “ What someone drunk has on his tongue comes from his conscience when he is not drunk . ”
My point is that , even if you look at his apology itself , in the nature of the apology he knew exactly what he ’d said .
And though does n’t specially address anti-Semitism , you can see that long apology he has it in mind he knows he said that .
Q : Are you convinced Gibson is anti-Semitic ?
A : What does Mel Gibson want from the Jews ?
It ’s amazing to me he previously denies he shares any of his father ’s beliefs .
But his father says the Holocaust is a hoax , and its numbers are exaggerated .
Now it turns out he also has an issue with Jews .
It ’s not just his father that is a problem .
Q : And you ’re calling on him to drop plans to produce a Holocaust movie for ABC ?
A : It seems inconceivable that he should given these cirumstances to make , in the future , a film about the Holocaust .
That would be like getting somebody that has a past association with the KKK to do a film on African - Americans .
The African - Americans would be up in arms .
That ’s the way Jews feel .
If you do n’t like the Jews , do n’t do a film about the central issue of modern Jewish history , the Holocaust .
It ’s insensitive to their feelings , especially if you do n’t like them .
That ’s why I think he should drop out .
This is not a film he could do .
Q : Is there anything Gibson can do now , or in the future , to make amends ?
A : He has two problems .
First , to take care of his abuse of alcohol .
And , second , he should take care of his deep feelings of bigotry apparent towards Jews .
That you ca n’t wish away in a day or a week .
That you ca n’t issue a publicist statement how he ’s seen the light .
It does n’t work that way .
Q : What if he donates money ?
A : What is donating money ?
He has a problem with Jews .
Donations wo n’t solve that .
It ’s an attitudinal problem .
Q : Would you assist him in changing that ?
A : I know what I am and I know what I ’m not .
I ’m not a psychiatrist or a psychologist .
He should n’t come to me .
How to cure him is not what I do .
If he wanted to learn about the Holocaust or to take sensitivity training , then he could go through the Museum of Tolerance [ which is part of the Simon Wiesenthal Center ] .
Earlier in the day , Hier issued a statement made available to me .
“ It appears that Mel Gibson launched into a drunken diatribe against Jews during a DUI arrest this weekend .
In his statement , Mr. Gibson ackowledged a longstanding drinking problem and apologized for his behavior without a specific reference to his anti-Semitic statements .
We hope Mr. Gibson will get help for his problems .
But , in the meantime , he should drop any plans to produce a movie on the Nazi Holocaust .
Anyone spouting the canard that Jews are “ responsible for all wars ” — a lie touted by bigots from Nazis to Hezbollah — does not have the legitimacy to make a film about Jewish martyrdrom and suffering during the Nazi era . ”
Hier was referring to an ABC nonfiction mini-series that Gibson ’s TV company late last year announced he was developing for ABC based on the self - published memoir of a Dutch Jew whose gentile neighbors hid her from the Nazis but who lost several relatives in concentration camps .
In addition , ABC ’s parent company Disney , through Buena Vista , is distributing the Oscar winner ’s upcoming movie Apocalypto , an action epic about the bloody decline of the Mayan civilization .
Hier is not only an international religious and political figure of note , but also a central and revered figure within Hollywood which helps support the Simon Wiesenthal Center both financially and substantively .
In 2003 , a year before Gibson ’s The Passion of the Christ was released , Hier co-wrote a Los Angeles Times opinion piece worrying whether the movie would stir anti-Semitic sentiments .
“ It ’s true that the final script has n’t been made available , and there is currently no release date , or even distributor , for the film .
Still , there are reasons for concern , ” Hier wrote .
He was even more outspoken against the film once it began screening , reiterating his belief that the film denigrated Jews and could spark anti-Semitism abroad and in the U.S. .
Dissidents criticise the leadership of AFL - CIO president John Sweeney
The Teamsters and the Service Employees unions say the AFL - CIO neglected the movement 's loss of members and influence in favour of politics .
Another two unions are boycotting the current AFL - CIO convention in Chicago .
Correspondents say the US labour movement now faces one of the biggest splits in its history .
The breakaway unions have already set up a rival organisation .
Service Employees ' International is the largest and fastest - growing union in the US , with more than 1.8 million members , while the Teamsters call themselves " the world 's most powerful union " .
The rebels are among seven dissident unions representing a third of the AFL - CIO 's 13 m members - and $ 35 m ( £ 20 m ) in dues .
Experts say a split in US labour could hurt the Democratic party , which generally gets strong union backing .
Simmering tension
The split came at a convention meant to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations .
Anna Burger said the AFL - CIO had not done enough to change
AFL - CIO president John Sweeney criticised the rebels at the start of the convention .
" At a time when our corporate and conservative adversaries have created the most powerful anti-worker political machine in the history of our country , a divided movement hurts the hopes of working families for a better life , " he said to a standing ovation .
Long - simmering tension between the dissidents - part of a coalition called Change to Win - and AFL - CIO burst into the open on Sunday .
" Today , we have reached a point where our differences have become unresolvable , " coalition chair Anna Burger said in a statement on the eve of the convention .
About 1,000 supporters of Mr Sweeney rallied on Sunday under the slogan United to Win , the AFL - CIO said .
The dissident unions are unhappy with Mr Sweeney 's leadership .
He is expected to win re-election without challenge at the convention .
The US labour movement has long been in decline .
According to government statistics , 12.5 % of all US workers - and 8 % of private - sector workers - are union members .
In the 1950s and 1960s , about a third of workers were unionised .
My introduction to what is generally referred to as the " libertarian " philosophy did not begin , as Jerome Tuccille wrote it usually does , with Ayn Rand .
Lane Lancaster — my undergraduate professor of political theory — was the first to introduce me to philosophers with a decided preference for individual liberty .
I later received an introduction to free market economics from one of my law school professors , the late Aaron Director .
And in 1960 , friends introduced my wife and me to Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged , a novel that challenged the underpinnings of political systems .
In following years , I read a number of Rand ’s works , and took courses on her philosophy through what was then the Nathaniel Branden Institute .
While I never considered myself an " Objectivist , " I found Rand ’s writings a significant catalyst in the development of my thinking .
After persistent questioning of Ms. Rand ’s conclusions about the nature of government — views that cannot stand up to critical analysis — I managed to get myself " excommunicated , " as it were from any further course work at the Objectivist sanctum sanctorum .
I did find it amusing that a philosophy that espoused " reason " as its highest virtue , was apparently unable to withstand a questioning mind .
Rand insisted upon obedience to her every pronouncement , a trait hardly worthy of anyone espousing individualism and liberty .
Nonetheless , I continued to find her ideas a useful sounding board for my own inquiries .
I have long had mixed feelings about Rand and her ideas .
On the one hand , she has undoubtedly been a major figure in the development of modern libertarian thinking , even though she would not have identified herself with any philosophy for which Objectivism was only a part .
Her greatest contribution , I believe , was to confront the underlying assumptions of collectivist thinking at a time when it was considered unsophisticated to entertain such a challenge .
Furthermore , she helped to rescue philosophy from the Byzantine labyrinths of academia , encouraging ordinary people to regard principled inquiries into the nature and meaning of life .
She helped to give wider meaning to what Socrates praised as the need for the " examined life . "
While I found her questions quite refreshing , I had numerous doubts as to her conclusions .
Had she confined her life ’s work to writing novels — with their important messages about the role of the individual in collective societies — her work would have had a far greater impact on the cause of liberty .
Men and women could then have incorporated her fictional accounts into their own experiences , and used both to synthesize a powerful personal philosophy .
But Rand insisted on putting together an abstract philosophic system — cobbled together from varied sources — which she declared to be objectively " true " principles .
Her epistemology — the base of her philosophy — is wholly untenable to anyone with an understanding of how the mind actually functions .
While I believe that we live in an objective universe , none of us can ever know the nature of that reality other than through the subjective processes by which our mind organizes its experiences .
We do not learn about the world in the mechanistic fashion of a video camera recording sensory impressions .
Rather , we interact with our world , organizing our experiences into categories and concepts by which we make comparisons and contrasts .
It is the mind , alone , that creates these categories ; they do not exist beyond the boundaries of our mind .
What we think of as the world is simply that : thoughts about the world .
In the words of Arthur Eddington : " mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience ; all else is remote inference . "
We are seekers of information .
The word " inform " means to give shape within .
Within what , other than the mind ?
Gregory Bateson defined " information " as " differences that matter . "
Matter to whom ?
Who is it that notices the differences , and by what criteria — and where located — are distinctions and similarities to be evaluated ?
One of Ms. Rand ’s strongest invectives was to call one a " social metaphysician , " a phrase that overlooks the fact that most of what we know about the world derives from what others have taught us .
Language is undoubtedly the greatest invention of mankind — the tool through which we understand and communicate with others .
The rich content of our varied languages — as well as our differences over meanings — derives from the subjective interpretations we place on words .
Are avocadoes and tomatoes " fruits " or " vegetables " ?
The answer to that question depends on whether you inquire of a botanist or the produce manager of your local supermarket .
To imagine that there is an " objectively " correct answer to that question , is to fail to appreciate the complexity of languages that have no substantive existence beyond our minds .
We deal with the universe abstractly , as images and concepts created by our mind .
We organize our lives around ideas , words , and other abstractions that never equate with reality .
Alfred Korzybski’s admonition that " the map is not the territory " ought to remind us that , because abstractions are about the world but not of it , they are always subject to interpretation , a process unavoidably dependent upon how our subjective mind has organized its accumulated experiences .
Rand ’s belief in objectively determined " values " is equally unsupportable , as any first year student of microeconomics will quickly attest .
Dictionaries inform us that to " value " something is to " appraise " or to " rate or scale " or " to regard highly . "
To " estimate relative worth " or " degree of excellence " or to speak of " attributed or assumed valuation , " are other definitions reflective of the subjective nature of all values .
While it may be comforting to pretend that the universe is organized around my belief system , the values that I espouse as " principles " are , I believe , nothing more than reflections of my subjective , inner sense of proper ways of living .
They are not external to me , but come from deep within my very being , as expressions of what it means to be a human being .
They relate to an internally - derived estimate of worthiness of both myself and you , and of the social conditions I regard as essential to that sense of worthiness .
On the basis of a peculiar mix of our emotions , experiences , genetic predispositions , formalized learning , reasoning , and other factors that energize our inner sense of being , we evaluate and make judgments about the world , other people , and social practices .
So strong is this subjective sense that , when we put it into words , we mislead ourselves into believing that we have discovered some universal truth , whereas what we have really discovered is our sense of self .
Those who speak of their principles as the outgrowth of " reason , " forget that , to reason , is but to enunciate " reasons " for one ’s choices .
But what are the influences that lead some to rationalize one set of principles while others rationalize an opposing set ?
Objectivists are fond of defending logical methods of reasoning , forgetting that the underlying premises of their philosophy as well as Marxism can each be logically extended to opposite conclusions .
Rand understood this in her oft - quoted admonition to " check your premises . "
But what are the factors that produce different underlying assumptions in different people ?
Are these not to be explained in terms of subjective forces ?
Rand ’s attempt to extend her sense of " objective " values into the realm of aesthetics became a give - away to the fallacy upon which her philosophy was built .
What she extolled as " objective " artistic taste came down to nothing more than the kinds of music , paintings , literature , sculptures , and architecture , that appealed to her eyes and ears .
She apparently even elevated a popular dance step to the realm of objective correctness .
That she could delude herself into believing that her subjective preferences equated with objective truth should have been a red flag to her ardent followers , who were busily buying up Victor Hugo and Mickey Spillane novels , Rachmaninoff recordings , and miniatures of Michelangelo ’s statue of " David . "
We are not simply the seekers , but the creators of our material , moral , and aesthetic measures by which we live .
We are , as the poet Seamus Heaney expressed , " the hunters and gatherers of values . "
He might have added that we are also traders of values , as we negotiate in social relationships for the boundaries of propriety in our dealings with one another .
Whether in terms of our understanding of the physical world , or of our value judgments , the Objectivist philosophy seems immune to the insights of Heisenberg ’s " uncertainty principle , " which tells us that the observer is the observed ; that the act of observing influences what it is we see .
No matter how honest and accurate we try to be in our reporting , we can only " see " the world through so many lenses , filters , decodings , and translations , all of which have been constructed in our subjective mind from prior learning .
The world does not inform us of its meaning — if , indeed , there is " meaning " to existence .
Rather , we project onto the world the patterns we have put together in our separate minds that best explain our experiences in the world .
In the words of Anais Nin , " we do n’t see things as they are , we see them as we are . "
An awareness of the inevitable information loss between our abstractions and the reality they are supposed to represent , should be sufficient to exchange an arrogant hubris for a more tolerant humility regarding our understanding of ourselves , one another , and the world that we seem intent on destroying .
After tens of thousands of years of varied and contrary belief systems that have dominated human thought and behavior — each of which carried with it a certitude of undeviating truth , and many of which have later been rejected in favor of more fashionable models — how can any of us have the arrogance to insist that our beliefs correlate with an objective reality ?
Is it possible for us to act in the world on the basis of focused , philosophic principles while , at the same time , retaining a sense of healthy skepticism arising from an awareness of our lack of omniscience ?
The belief in absolute truths — unburdened by doubt or skepticism — fuels the self - righteousness that is destroying mankind .
There appears to be no lacking of men and women prepared to forcibly destroy some people and their social systems , and to impose new ones that satisfy their own visions of how the world should perform .
Such efforts have always been undertaken by persons who are smugly self - assured that their purposes and understanding of the world are grounded in objective truth .
These sentiments have driven wars , religious persecutions , inquisitions , heresy trials , Stalinist purges , genocides , witch trials , lynch mobs , holy wars , holocausts , race riots , and all other forms of organized violence and murder .
Having no doubts as to the certainty of their views , absolutists exhibit little tolerance for nonconforming behavior or beliefs .
And why should we expect otherwise ?
If " truth " and " moral principles " reside beyond the individual , why should those of absolutist persuasion not want to mandate uniform , standardized social systems and practices to forcibly direct people to comply with such external and transcendent principles ?
Why should such people be expected to show any tolerance for those whose ideas or conduct differ from the alleged objective truths ?
One would have hoped that the Objectivist philosophy — with its stated emphasis on " reason , " " individualism , " " liberty , " and hostility to " collectivism " and " statism " — might have provided a base for understanding and resisting the collective insanity of our politicized world .
But such , alas , has not been the case , for Rand ’s philosophy is infected with the same virus as other destructive belief systems : the insistence upon the doctrine of absolute truth .
Being " objectively " true , Rand ’s philosophy has shown little tolerance for alternative views .
Those who differed with Ms. Rand ’s conclusions were labeled " irrational . "
Those who saw in a given situation the possibility of various courses of action might be tarred as " whim worshipers . "
Those who believed their subjective minds capable of comprehending reality and providing moral insights were called " mystics , " a strange characterization for a philosophy allegedly devoted to individualism !
It has been in response to events of 9/11 that the contradictions inherent in Objectivism became most evident .
For a philosophy with a basic tenet of opposition to the " initiation of force , " and considering that Saddam Hussein ’s regime was never a threat to America , one might have expected to find Objectivists in the forefront of opposition to the war against Iraq .
But Yaron Brook , the executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute , co-authored an article criticizing America for its " self - effacing and compassionate " war against the Iraqis .
" Soldiers have strict orders to avoid the risk of killing civilians , " while " military operations have been timed to avoid alienating Muslim pilgrims on holy days .
By confessing doubt about its moral right to defend itself , America has encouraged further aggression . "
( Italics added . )
An Op - Ed piece on the Ayn Rand Institute ’s website illustrated just how the processes of " reason " can be employed to " rationalize " self - contradictory conclusions .
Titled " Peacenik Warmongers , " the article declared that anti-war protestors " are acting to make war more frequent and deadly . "
The writer then asks : " what should the United States do to obtain a peaceful relationship with the numerous hostile regimes , including Iraq , that seek to harm us with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction ? "
When statements regarding Iraq ’s alleged threats to America are contradicted by the facts , one can only wonder how an epistemology grounded in " objectively " derived truths can have so failed to inform this man ’s judgments .
How do people who profess a reality - based philosophy manage to synthesize their stated beliefs with the fact that the war against Iraq was grounded in a cascade of lies and deceptions ?
When does reality come into play in all of this ?
Another very prominent devotee of Rand recently wrote that " voting for George W. Bush is the most libertarian thing we can do , " and that " a continued Bush presidency . . . might well succeed in preserving Western civilization . "
Kerry " will weaken our military establishment , " he went on , quoting favorably from a statement made by Rand , in 1962 , to the effect that paying 80 % for taxes was justified " if you need it for defense . "
Such a statement on behalf of the state ’s confiscation of the bulk of one ’s income is a remarkable contradiction , coming from a woman who professed support for the private ownership of property !
By far , the greatest voice for the irrelevance of Objectivism to the cause of peace and liberty has come from the founder of the Ayn Rand Institute , Leonard Peikoff .
Following the attacks of 9/11 , Peikoff ran a full - page ad in the New York Times in which he stated the following :
A proper war in self - defense is one fought without self - crippling restrictions placed on our commanders in the field .
It must be fought with the most effective weapons we possess ( a few weeks ago , Rumsfeld refused , correctly , to rule out nuclear weapons ) .
And it must be fought in a manner that secures victory as quickly as possible and with the fewest U.S. casualties , regardless of the countless innocents caught in the line of fire .
These innocents suffer and die because of the action of their own government in sponsoring the initiation of force against America .
Their fate , therefore , is their government ’s moral responsibility .
There is no way for our bullets to be aimed only at evil men .
( Italics added . )
What better defense of collectivist thinking could be made than this ?
The " innocents suffer and die " because of what their governments do ; Americans have no " moral responsibility " for the death and suffering they inflict upon such innocents .
Furthermore , Peikoff conflates an individual ’s right to self - defense with a collective authority exercised by the state against innocents .
As I stated at the beginning , Rand ’s greatest contribution to the cause of individual liberty was to confront the dehumanizing idea of collectivism , and yet here is one of her closest spokesmen defending the proposition that men and women may rightfully suffer because of their collective identity with an offending state .
" The risk of a U.S. overreaction , " Peikoff continues , " is negligible .
The only risk is underreaction . "
He then adds : " Mr. Bush . . . must send our missiles and troops in force , where they belong .
And he must justify this action by declaring with righteous conviction that we have discarded the clichés of our paper - tiger past . "
( Italics added . )
There are doubtless many men and women of Objectivist persuasion who see the contradictions between their philosophy and the state ’s most ambitious program of power , namely the war system .
But that so many other Randians can eagerly — and with " righteous conviction " — defend such butcherous practices is revelatory of the dangers implicit in any philosophy purporting to rest on objective truth .
Such absolutist thinking makes it understandable why so many Objectivists support Bush : each finds comfort in simplistic propositions such as dividing the world into " good " and " evil , " or asserting that " if you ’re not with us , you ’re against us . "
Such playground reasoning befits minds troubled by the complexities and uncertainties inherent in life itself .
Our institutionalized world has about played out the simplified model of vertically structured social systems , wherein human behavior is presumed capable of being organized and managed by centralized authority .
The collapse of the Soviet Union was , perhaps , the most dramatic example of how our world is becoming increasingly decentralized .
The Internet ; on - line and on - demand book publishing ; blogs , with their immediate responses to news events ; political secession and other separatist movements ; decentralized systems of business management ; cell phones ; alternative systems of schooling and health care ; cable and satellite television and satellite radio ; and the rapid growth of documentary film production , are other expressions of the social centrifugation now challenging traditional top - down systems .
The modern " libertarian " movement is the most focused philosophic expression of this undercurrent of change , for it is grounded not only in a distrust of power , but in the confidence that a free and peaceful social order can arise only out of the spontaneous and autonomous behavior of individuals .
Libertarian thinking also reflects the pluralistic assumption that a condition of liberty will produce a variety of tastes , ideas , social practices , and behavior ; and that only a respect for the inviolability of the lives and other property of individuals can produce such ends .
My wife expressed the point very well : " libertarianism is the only philosophy that respects each person . "
Unlike the lockstep thinking that Rand tried to enforce upon her followers , libertarian thinking is far more open .
Religious and anti-religious views are tolerated ; differences of opinion are heard on the question of whether political action is an acceptable way of depoliticizing our world ; while discussions abound as to how various services — now dominated by the state — might be provided through voluntary , rather than coercive , means .
Above all , one finds among libertarians a sense of confidence that free men and women will do a much better job of providing for their individual and social needs , once they learn to trust their own authority .
There is , however , a threshold point whose transgression can never be tolerated by those who value peace and liberty : support for wars .
To defend the war system is to defend statism in its most vicious and dehumanized manifestation .
" War is the health of the state , " declared Randolph Bourne ; and those who are aware of the dynamics of how political systems actually operate — instead of spending their time making logical deductions from unexamined premises — will , if peace and liberty concern them , make no concessions to such practices .
Indeed , the post - 9/11 responses of self - styled " libertarians " became a watershed for testing the depths of their commitments .
Many , it is sad to report , immediately caved without much struggle .
I cannot pretend to know the thought processes these various people went through in deciding to support the Afghan and / or Iraqi wars .
Human beings express their opinions and other preferences from a variety of perspectives , a fact that makes a condition of unfettered liberty both creative and enjoyable .
But I suspect that much of the backing for these wars — and certainly that coming from acknowledged Objectivists — derived from the kind of self - righteous and absolutist thinking provided by Ayn Rand .
As I write this article , I am informed that the British medical journal , The Lancet , is reporting that as many as 100,000 Iraqis — many of them women and children — have thus far been slaughtered in America ’s war of " liberation . "
Nor does this account for the more than 1,100 American soldiers killed and many thousands more wounded in a war that should rightfully be named " The War of the Third Law of Motion . "
As I read this news story , I am reminded of the comments of Ayn Rand ’s confidante , Barbara Branden , who condemned libertarians for being critical of Bush ’s " war on terror . "
She notes the " sick irony " of America — which she calls " the most decent and generous nation that has ever existed " — being damned by " most of the countries of the world , " when it is " the one country that has invaded other countries only in order to free them . "
There is little hope to be found in a philosophy that can generate the kind of twisted thinking that so many leading Objectivists openly express .
Collectivist assumptions that readily accept the systematic slaughter of so many innocent people need to be confronted by a sentiment rarely voiced by Objectivists : love for the humanity of which we are all part .
Perhaps , deep within their subjective beings — if they are willing to explore there — may be found a kind of love for others that need not be justified as " shared rational values " nor condemned as " altruism . "
As I stated at the outset , Objectivism provided a valuable catalyst for those of us interested in individual liberty .
In the questions it raised — inquiries that were previously unasked in polite society — it helped many thousands of people to transform their thinking .
But to men and women of individualistic persuasion , an autocratically dictated philosophy was bound to be troublesome .
At a time when the processes of decentralization confront the institutional forces bent on resisting change ; and when the state transfuses our blood into its war machinery in an effort to preserve its health ; it is time for those who cherish liberty to abandon the monster Objectivism has become .
If libertarians are to become catalysts for the further decentralization of society , and are to help transform destructive and murderous social systems into those based upon peace and liberty , they must free their minds from the albatross of Objectivism , whose moralistic self - righteousness has turned it into everything it purported to oppose : irrationality , collectivism , state violence , and disregard for truth .
Its absolutist doctrines no longer inspire , but only embarrass , those whose minds and spirits insist upon individual liberty ; men and women who are unable to rationalize the dehumanized and violent political models willingly embraced by so many leading Objectivists .
The Best of Butler Shaffer
There had been speculation the general would step down
He is thought to be one of the first senior officials associated with the war to leave his post .
His resignation , which the Israeli army says it has accepted , comes at a time of continuing public criticism about the way the conflict was handled .
Israel has launched a probe on the role of government and military in the war .
There had been widespread speculation the general would step down as head of the Northern Command after he was sidelined at the height of the conflict .
Critics say many mistakes were made , including a misjudgment of Hezbollah 's capability and a failure to free the two Israeli soldiers whose capture sparked the fighting .
On Tuesday , Hezbollah 's leader Hassan Nasrallah said the two soldiers held by his group would only be released if Lebanese militant Samir Qantar , who has been held by Israel for 27 years , was also freed .
Mounting debate
Maj Gen Adam has decided to retire " when the last soldier returns from Lebanon " , which is expected next week , the Maariv daily newspaper reported on Wednesday .
Such an announcement by a general cannot be ignored
Defence Minister Amir Peretz
Who are the prisoners ?
He had faced criticism in the Israeli media and among defence analysts that he was too cautious .
He was a key military figure in the conflict , in command of the north of Israel when militants entered from Lebanon and captured the two Israeli soldiers .
Once war started , Gen Adam was the officer on the ground in charge of the campaign .
During the conflict , the army chief of staff Lt Gen Dan Halutz appointed his own deputy , Maj Gen Moshe Kaplinski , as commander of operations in Lebanon , with a key role in securing the Israel - Lebanon border .
The move was widely seen as a decision to sideline Gen Adam who was thought to have disagreed with the chief of staff about strategy .
" The state of Israel definitely owes [ Adam ] a great debt , " Defence Minister Amir Peretz told Israeli radio on Wednesday .
" No doubt we need to examine the meaning of the [ move ] , why he decided to do it ...
Such an announcement by a general cannot be ignored . "
Pressure on others
The general 's resignation is not entirely surprising , but it is significant at a time when many in Israel are still calling on their leaders , both military and political , to take responsibility for the way the war was handled , says the BBC's Jill McGivering in Jerusalem .
Debate about failures in military strategy - and intelligence - is persisting .
Many still say the war failed in its objectives - to free the captured soldiers and chasten Hezbollah militants .
A month after the ceasefire started , that process of self - examination and holding to account has barely begun , our correspondent adds .
Debate is continuing about how far - reaching and how powerful official inquiries should be .
Gen Adam 's resignation may increase the pressure on other figures , also central to the campaign , our correspondent says .
A group of US physicists funded by the US Department of Energy have made a material capable of making light travel backwards , at speeds " that appear faster than the speed of light " , at the smallest wavelength ever .
The work , led by Costas Soukoulis at Iowa State University , could pave the way for a " perfect lens " , and could even have implications for the basic laws of physics .
Soukoulis himself says : " Snell 's law on the refraction of light is going to be different ; a number of other laws will be different . "
No natural material is capable of refracting light negatively , so scientists working in this area have to use so - called metamaterials , which can be engineered to have a negative refractive index .
Normal materials have positive refractive indices , meaning that light bends to the right of an incident beam .
Metamaterials can have a negative index , bending light backwards , to the left of the incident beam .
( Some background on metamaterials here for those who are interested . )
The ultimate goal is to make one that works at visible wavelengths , which would make it possible to build a perfect , flat lens .
This is some way off , and in the meantime researchers must learn to build materials capable of refracting light at shorter and shorter wavelengths .
So far , the best researchers have been able to manage is microwave or far - infrared radiation .
Soukoulis ' material can negatively refract electromagnetic radiation at 1.5 micrometres , or in the near - infrared part of the spectrum .
This makes it potentially useful for telecommunications , he says .
" When we have a metamaterial with a negative index of refraction at 1.5 micrometers that can disperse , or separate a wave into spectral components with different wavelengths , we can tune our lasers to play a lot of games with light .
" We can have a wavepacket hit a slab of negative index material , appear on the right - hand side of the material and begin to flow backward before the original pulse enters the negative index medium . "
The pulse flowing backward also releases a forward pulse out the end of the medium .
Thus , the pulse entering the front of the material appears to move out the back almost instantly .
" In this way , one can argue that that the wave packet travels with velocities much higher than the velocities of light , " said Soukoulis .
" This is due to the dispersion of the negative index of refraction ; there is nothing wrong with Einstein 's theory of relativity . "

O ut of the mouth of babes : L inux is Better
by Mark Rais , Senior Editor ReallyLinux.com
I t was hard to believe , but early Saturday morning my kids snuck downstairs , grabbed my laptop out of the bag and started using it for fun and games .
What was more surprising was the fact that they chose my laptop running Fedora , rather than the family PC running Windows with all of the kids games and edutainment packages .
When I asked my son why he had snatched my laptop instead of using the family PC , he replied without hesitation : " Because Linux is better . "
After some more fact finding , I learned what was the underlying reason .
I had recently installed the latest K12ltsp.org release on the laptop .
This is a full fledged Fedora combining the extensive work of the LTSP ( linux terminal server project ) as well as the added resources and programs included for use by Kindergarten through 12th grade acedemics .
This release allows other PCs to run as terminals connected to a single Linux server and has been used world - wide to setup Linux classrooms .
I must also give substantial credit to the teams of folks who write the many tools and applications for the KDE desktop .
But frankly , my kids could n't care less about these tidbits .
Instead , what really attracted them to the laptop were those countless unique educational games and tools specifically tailored for their ages .
Just a hop off the main menu to use over 20 educational programs
Preloaded to the Max
There are over fifty educational programs that come pre-installed .
Also included are over one hundred fifty popular programs and applications such as OpenOffice.org , Firefox , Evolution and X - CD - Roast .
Just slip in the CDs , install the k12ltsp.org distro and in less than 45 minutes you 're done !
And all it took was some minor effort , primarily for walking over to the kitchen to refill your cup while it all automatically installed .
Below is a basic overview of some of the applications that come pre-loaded .
Accessories , Graphic programs , and Sound & Video tools among other goodies
But kids using Linux has a lot to do with the simplicity of the interfaces , how menu items and icons convey information , and the categorization .
What my son so poignantly declared was also a testimony to these GUIs available for Linux .
Whether I had default boot set to Gnome or KDE , to my kids , they were both completely understandable and useable .
I know this may shock the Linux purists , but to me this is a strong confirmation that the GUIs are substantially easier to use than I had even contemplated .
Here was a five year old , traversing the directories , finding applications and opening them without any hesitation .
He had no issue figuring out how to open and close screens , move them around , or change their size .
The tool bars , menus and icons were all intuitive to these kids .
The Real Screaming
What caused the real screaming was n't me asking for my laptop back so I could get some work done .
Instead , it was the shock of returning to Windows .
They went to the living room and ended up throwing fits .
I noticed that my son had more trouble trying to find and load his games on the WindowsXP machine for several reasons .
The interface is far more cluttered for one .
The interface get 's in - your - face as well .
Every ten seconds one of those damn useless taskbar " alerts " appears .
Then there 's the one second lag time for opening start menu items , which I found does n't just irritate me , but also my kids !
In many ways the Linux interfaces proved easier and more versatile than Windows , and not just for adults .
It became readily apparent when my kids were started screaming in frustration .
The final moans occurred when I told them they needed to go back to using the family PC , because my laptop was for work .
This resulted in a revolution .
When I finally reminded them that all of their games were loaded on the family PC , they both responded with intensity : " we do n't want those , we like the little Tux ! "
Apparently not only was Linux easier for them to load .
Not only were Gnome and KDE easier to traverse and simpler to use .
Now they were declaring the attraction to the Linux mascot !
I guess I can understand , looking at a cuddly Penguin certainly beats looking at the hard edged corporate logos that fill most of the Windows desktop icons and graphics .
Applications Perfect for Kids
Tux paint had become a favorite .
It was wisely designed for young kids with an easy to learn tools and options that offered even a 5 year old a lot more than just basic graphical skills .
I noticed that my kids were concentrating on another favorite called the Gcompris educational suite , which comes with math , reading and experience based activities that are interesting and instructive .
The kids love the puzzles that not only challenge the mind but offer entertainment without the intensity you may find with similar commercial software .
The Only Real Choice
In an effort to appease them , reduce the tantrums , and to get my laptop back as a work tool , I ended up connecting the family PC to the network and running it as a dumb terminal off the Linux Fedora LTSP laptop .
That 's right , a full fledged Windows PC was now simply a network extension of my Linux laptop .
Now the kids get to use all of those Linux based games and tools they love , without keeping me from my work !
And as peculiar as this may seem to some , they 've not since asked for or cared about any of their Windows programs .
Instead , they continue to learn and enjoy Linux -- " because its better . "
Experts who have studied the US navy 's cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying ' toxic dart ' guns .
Divers and surfers risk attack , they claim , from a species considered to be among the planet 's smartest .
The US navy admits it has been training dolphins for military purposes , but has refused to confirm that any are missing .
Dolphins have been trained in attack - and - kill missions since the Cold War .
The US Atlantic bottlenose dolphins have apparently been taught to shoot terrorists attacking military vessels .
Their coastal compound was breached during the storm , sweeping them out to sea .
But those who have studied the controversial use of dolphins in the US defence programme claim it is vital they are caught quickly .
Leo Sheridan , 72 , a respected accident investigator who has worked for government and industry , said he had received intelligence from sources close to the US government 's marine fisheries service confirming dolphins had escaped .
' My concern is that they have learnt to shoot at divers in wetsuits who have simulated terrorists in exercises .
If divers or windsurfers are mistaken for a spy or suicide bomber and if equipped with special harnesses carrying toxic darts , they could fire , ' he said .
' The darts are designed to put the target to sleep so they can be interrogated later , but what happens if the victim is not found for hours ? '
Usually dolphins were controlled via signals transmitted through a neck harness .
' The question is , were these dolphins made secure before Katrina struck ? ' said Sheridan .
The mystery surfaced when a separate group of dolphins was washed from a commercial oceanarium on the Mississippi coast during Katrina .
Eight were found with the navy 's help , but the dolphins were not returned until US navy scientists had examined them .
Sheridan is convinced the scientists were keen to ensure the dolphins were not the navy's , understood to be kept in training ponds in a sound in Louisiana , close to Lake Pontchartrain , whose waters devastated New Orleans .
The navy launched the classified Cetacean Intelligence Mission in San Diego in 1989 , where dolphins , fitted with harnesses and small electrodes planted under their skin , were taught to patrol and protect Trident submarines in harbour and stationary warships at sea .
Criticism from animal rights groups ensured the use of dolphins became more secretive .
But the project gained impetus after the Yemen terror attack on the USS Cole in 2000 .
Dolphins have also been used to detect mines near an Iraqi port .
Roberto Macchiarelli and colleagues ( 2006 , link ) have published data regarding molar crown formation times in Neandertals .
Here is their abstract :
Growth and development are both fundamental components of demographic structure and life history strategy .
Together with information about developmental timing they ultimately contribute to a better understanding of Neanderthal extinction .
Primate molar tooth development tracks the pace of life history evolution most closely , and tooth histology reveals a record of birth as well as the timing of crown and root growth .
High - resolution micro-computed tomography now allows us to image complex structures and uncover subtle differences in adult tooth morphology that are determined early in embryonic development .
Here we show that the timing of molar crown and root completion in Neanderthals matches those known for modern humans but that a more complex enamel - dentine junction morphology and a late peak in root extension rate sets them apart .
Previous predictions about Neanderthal growth , based only on anterior tooth surfaces , were necessarily speculative .
These data are the first on internal molar microstructure ; they firmly place key Neanderthal life history variables within those known for modern humans .
The ScienceNOW article by Ann Gibbons stresses the fact that the study involves sectioned teeth instead of external perikymata counts .
The result is a lack of any significant difference between the timing and duration of crown formation compared to modern humans :
When the researchers sliced thin sections of the molars , they noticed important similarities between Neandertals and modern humans .
The dark birth line emerged at about the same time in dental development as in modern humans , indicating that Neandertal teeth developed at the same rate as modern human teeth do around the time of birth , the team reports online today in Nature .
The researchers also found that the crowns and roots of the Neandertals grew at the same rate of those of modern humans , with root growth complete by age 9 as in modern children .
" This all points to a dental developmental schedule that was most like that in modern humans , " says anatomist and lead author Christopher Dean of University College London , who also is a dentist .
The tooth development story is becoming a bit complicated to follow .
As applied to Neandertals , Guatelli -Steinberg and colleagues ( 2005 ) , and Ramirez Rossi and Bermudez de Castro ( 2004 ) assessed dental maturation rates from anterior teeth ( incisors and canines ) , while the current paper by Macchiarelli and colleagues ( 2006 ) is about molar development .
Additionally Dean and colleagues ( 2001 ) examined early Homo and Australopithecus samples , and Ramirez Rossi and Bermudez de Castro also considered earlier Spanish Homo samples .
The notable finding by Guatelli -Steinberg and colleagues ( 2005 ) was that modern human samples are themselves hugely variable in their enamel formation times -- at least , as interpreted through enamel tissue characters .
This is a very serious problem for interpreting any past population characteristics , because in fact the variation among modern sample means -- without even considering the within - sample variation -- encompasses most fossil samples of Homo and many australopithecines as well .
Here 's what I wrote about this last year :
[ T ]he Neandertals are far from the most interesting part of this perikymata problem .
Can we tell a human from an australopithecine from these data ?
If so , why do some of the earliest humans have the lowest ( i.e. sub-australopithecine ) counts ?
The early human specimen that stood out ( considering their anterior dentition ) was KNM - ER 15000 , and it is not clear from the available papers whether it is actually outside the extant modern sample ranges .
Otherwise , early Homo specimens are entirely humanlike in their crown formation times , and this observation is confirmed by Macchiarelli and colleagues ' present work on Neandertal molars .
In short , early Homo enamel formation times ( and for that matter , non-robust australopithecines ) fall entirely within the range of variation of living humans , with most specimens within the range of human population means .
The null hypothesis in this case is that enamel formation times did not differ between fossil and living humans .
That hypothesis is not refuted by the available data -- and given the wide variation in enamel formation times among living human populations , it seems likely that further sampling of fossil Homo will arrive at the same result .
The issue is not sample size for the fossils , in other words , it is the intrinsic variability among living people , which remains unexplained .
The variation among living humans raises a thornier problem , also .
The reason why many people are interested in molar enamel deposition is the idea that enamel formation is linked to somatic maturation in general .
But the great variability in enamel formation times in recent humans would seem to disprove a strong link between somatic and dental maturation .
The idea that somatic and dental maturation rates should be tightly linked comes mainly from interspecific comparisons .
For example , Ramirez Rossi and Bermudez de Castro ( 2004:938 ) draw out the following logic :
Dental growth is a good proxy for the overall rate of maturation in a species ( Smith 1989 ) .
Short crown formation time in fossil Homo species therefore indicates that somatic development was not as long as in H. sapiens .
Importantly , Neanderthals apparently also had a faster pace of somatic development than their ancestor , H. heidelbergensis .
...
A prolonged life - history in hominids has previously been related to a reduction in the mortality rate of adults , and in turn low mortality rates have in the past been associated with an increase in brain size .
Metabolic rate has also been linked to brain growth and has been implicated as a primary determinant of variation in life history .
However , developmental changes are most probably related to fundamental changes in the timing and frequency of reproduction .
Results presented here suggest that brain growth and brain size are not primary determinants of life - history re-scheduling in hominids ; rather , it seems that high adult mortality rates are most likely to have driven such rescheduling among Neanderthals .
A clearer picture of Neanderthals emerges here -- as a species of Homo adapted to particular environmental conditions , when a high - calorie diet and a high metabolic rate were able to fuel fast somatic growth , as well as to grow and sustain a large brain .
This last conclusion was rejected by Guatelli - Steinberg et al. ( 2005 ) -- after all , their data showed that Neandertals did n't have short enamel development compared to living Africans .
And reflecting on the balance of data from Neandertals , an especially rapid rate of development seems quite implausible .
For instance , if Neandertals had no problem fueling a 3000 - 5000 kcal per day energy expenditure , then why did their kids have so many enamel hypoplasias ?
If Neandertals had a limitless tap of food to enable their rapid somatic development , then what killed them so young ?
Guatelli -Steinberg et al. ( 2005 ) posit that dental development does not provide an adequate correlate of somatic maturation , and suggest that adult brain size makes a better yardstick :
It has also been suggested that if Neandertals suffered high adult mortality rates , then they might be expected to have had abbreviated periods of childhood growth ( 10 , 15 ) .
Adult mortality rates directly select for the timing of maturation across mammals ; a larger risk of dying selects for rapid maturation ( 9 , 30 , 31 ) .
However , Smith ( 32 ) notes that if Neandertals had accelerated life histories , then this would leave them with a " peculiar " relationship between brain size and maturation , " two variables that are rarely of step [ sic ] . "
Because large brains require extended periods of childhood growth ( 1 - 7 , 33 ) , the presence of large brains in Neandertals suggests that their adult mortality risks were not high enough to have prevented them from evolving prolonged growth periods .
The logic is that a given adult brain volume is linked to maturation schedule because of learning .
Crudely , a larger brain takes longer to fill with information .
Or more properly ( in causal terms ) , selection for more information processing tends to increase brain size ( relative to body size ) , information processing ability is constrained by learning , so that brain size is correlated to maturation schedule by indirect causal mechanisms .
But I would question even this relationship .
For one thing , it does n't seem to work very well within a population .
Or at least , not within the population of living humans , where variation in brain sizes show no clear relationship to skeletal maturation schedules .
For another , brain sizes have shrunk in recent humans , but there is no particular evidence that maturation times have reduced , or that humans have less to learn .
Some of the smaller brain sizes may be explained by smaller body size , but smaller body size also ought to be correlated with faster maturation .
It seems to me that comparing Neandertals to living people for developmental rates is misleading .
Living people are different from other primates in their very low rates of adult mortality ( and consequent long period of post - reproductive senescence ) .
And we know that Neandertals were more similar to other primates in this respect : they died younger than humans .
But that is n't a new development in Neandertals -- instead , the long lifespans typical of recent people are the new development .
There has as yet been little integration of the literature on human growth with these fossil - related questions .
For instance , many nutritionally - limited human populations respond by delaying growth .
Sometimes such delays can be resolved by rapid growth later in development , sometimes they lead to reductions in adult body size .
This kind of plasticity in growth schedules and ultimate body size ought to have characterized ancient humans , which would have increased their variability ( in both maturation schedule and adult body size ) compared to any single living human population .

Somewhere in your third year of being a manager , the Management Pixies will appear in your office in a puff of sweet smelling black smoke .
There will be three of them and one will be carrying a gorgeous black top hat .
“ Are you LeRoy McManager ? ”
“ I am . ”
The Pixies laugh .
“ Congratulations , you have passed successful through three years of management and we ’re here to reward you , but first , one question : Have you seen Spiderman ? ”
“ The first one or the sequel ? ”
“ The first one . ”
“ I have . ”
The Pixies laugh again .
“ What do you think the primary theme is in Spiderman , LeRoy McManager ? ”
“ Um , hmmmm … life ’s a bitch ? ”
Strangely , the Pixies do n’t laugh .
“ No , try again .
It ’s important . ”
“ Ok , well .
Hmmmm … Peter ’s Uncle said something they kept yammering about …
OH I KNOW … With great power comes great responsibility . ”
The Pixies cheer and the one carrying the top hat flutters over to you and drops it in your lap .
It ’s soft and strangely warm .
The hat - bearing Pixie looks up at you and grins , “ You wear this hat when you want people to know who you are . ”
“ And who am I ? ” You look down at the hat and notice massive white block letters on the front , they read :
I ’M THE BOSS .
A slow grin stretches across your face and you realize the hat has the vague smell of your Mom ’s fresh baked bread .
That smell has always given you a strange sense of confidence and you know that whenever you wear that hat , you ’ll been infused with that sense of confidence .
All three Pixies leap into the air giggling , “ Good luck LeRoy McManager , use your hat well ! ”
More laughing .
Another puff of black smoke and they ’re gone .
You lift the hat slowly in front of your face , staring at the white block letters , soaking in the sense of power the hat gives you , and you put it on .
You stride out of your office never once wondering why the Pixies were giggling so much because , well , you ’re the boss .
The first person sees you walk by in your cloud of confidence and , once you walk around the corner , you do n’t hear them snicker because , again , you ’re the boss .
They ’re laughing because while they know you ’re the boss , they can see the other side of the hat and it reads .
… FOR NOW .
Managers can lose it .
I mean it .
There are managers out there who are absolutely punch drunk with power and if you ’re working for one of these folks , I ’m really sorry .
You ’re a resident of Crazy Town and that means you never know what random crap is going to happen next and that sucks .
Manager ’s do n’t start crazy .
It ’s an acquired trait and this article explores what I consider the single best tact you can take to avoid a trip to Crazy Town .
Let ’s tackle it first with a story from an employee ’s perspective .
You ’re merrily typing way at your keyboard , hard at work at the next great feature when your boss walks in and says , “ Hey , can you work on a Gizzy Flibbet ? ”
“ Uh , is n’t the Flubjam the key feature ?
I ’ve barely even started it .
It ’s going to take awhile ”
“ Oh yes yes , we ’re still doing Flubjam , but I need you to prototype the Gizzy Flibbet and I need it in two days for a meeting with the Execs . ”
“ Oooooooook , you ’re the boss . ”
“ That ’s right , I am the boss . ”
Two days pass and you pour your soul into the prototype feature .
Like all investigations , you discover each step of discovery takes three times as long as expected .
The final prototype coveys the idea , but the process to create that result has left you drained and pretty sure finishing the remaining work is going to take a really long time .
When your boss walks into your office , you summarize , “ Here it is .
It looks good , it ’ll take awhile and I ’m now very behind on my Flubjam work .
Can I please get back to it ? ”
Squinting her eyes , she runs her fingertips along the front rim of her top hat .
She nods and stares , “ Ok , THIS IS GREAT .
Let ’s do this AND Flubjam AND let ’s hit the same schedule !
Go us ! ”
She turns and leaves the room leaving your office with the faint smell of bread .
I ’ll recap .
Your boss has just picked the one scenario that involves the most work and has the least chance of succeeding .
You ’re screwed and while you might think your boss has lost it , you are a co-conspirator in this disaster because you did n’t do one simple thing , you did n’t Say No .
Losing It
Manager do n’t lose it simply because the Pixies showed up with the top hat , they lose it because those they work with forget to look at the back of of the hat .
Remember :
Front : I ’M THE BOSS
Back : … FOR NOW
Management is myth… just like the top hat .
We , as employees , believe it ’s there , so we treat these management types different .
Yes , they sign the checks and they write the reviews , but , in a perfect world , those events are a function of your performance and not theirs , so it ’s your job to not screw that up .
I realize that ’s a big fat stretch , but stick with me .
What is the real source of a manager ’s perceived power ?
It ’s the idea that they can make decisions .
When the the team is stuck on a problem , they gather up in the manager ’s office , present their case , and the manager nods and says , “ Go that way ! ”
More often than not , everyone is so happy to be past the logjam , they do n’t even question whether it ’s the right decision or not .
“ He ’s got the top hat , so he must be right ! ”
No no no no .
Also .
No .
Managers lose it when they are no longer questioned in their decisions .
When the team stops questioning authority , the manager slowly starts to believe that their decisions are always good and while it feels great to be right all the time , it ’s statistically impossible .
The most experienced managers in the world make horribly bad decisions all the time , the good ones have learned how to recover from their decisions with dignity , but , more importantly , help from the team .
Let ’s take a look at Saying No from the manager ’s perspective without any Pixies .
Back at the start - up , we were considering the move to a hosted model for our web application .
I , in my third year of management , was in charge of presenting the pros and cons of such a move to the Executive Staff .
We were in the middle of three huge deployments , so I decided to not put the necessary work into the presentation .
I wrote it the night before and did n’t vet it with anyone .
The end result asked more questions than it answered .
It was a mess .
The Executive Staff went pretty easy on me .
It was clear from their questions that they were n’t happy with my half - baked ideas and I left the room thinking I ’d blown it .
The first person I saw after the meeting was Doug , one of my managers .
Doug , “ Rands , way to go !
You hit it out of the park , man !
When do we get started ? ”
In my state of depression , Doug ’s enthusiasm for my crappy presentation was intoxicating .
Maybe I was being too hard on myself ?
Maybe it was a good presentation and I ’m just being too sensitive ?
Yeah , that ’s the ticket .
The second person I found was Randy , my other manager .
His comment , “ Ouch .
That stung .
What ’s our recovery plan ? ”
Sure , I wanted to punch Randy , but he was spot on .
I ’d blown it and any other conclusion was a load of crap .
The irony in all of this is that Doug believed he was doing the right thing by supporting me , but he was only eroding his credibility with me by not telling it straight .
Think of it like this , if I ’d swallowed the Doug Happy Pill , I would ’ve done nothing to recover from my failed presentation and I would have looked like an idiot to the Execs .
What I did do was swallow the Bitter Randy Pill and completely redo the presentation along with the help of my managers .
We presented a week later and actually did hit it out of the park .
That ’s with the truth gets you … progress .
No Versus The Truth
Randy did n’t Say
No , he told me the truth , but I ’m leaving this article entitled “ Saying No ” because I think it ’s harder to contradict your boss than to tell the truth .
Saying
No forces an idea to defend itself with facts .
Sure , no one really wants to hear their idea is crap .
It ’s hard to Say No and it ’s even harder to Hear No , but who do you want to work with ?
People who are going to help you refine your direction or ones who will merrily follow your downward spin to Crazy Town ?
As with every job , your success as a manager is the end result of innumerable decisions .
While the front of your top hat reminds everyone that you ’re the one making the decisions , the back of the hat reminds everyone else that , more importantly , you ’re the one responsible for those decisions .
Like other spiders , this Mexican Redknee ( Brachypelma Smithii ) tarantula bends its legs not with muscles and bones but with a pressurized fluid system that extends and contracts the joints .
Scientists have created devices for space robots and even clothing based on the spider mechanism .

Are spiders ideal space travelers ?
Not quite , but according to a new study , their legs may be .
Scientists Carlo Menon and Cristian Lira have designed and built lightweight , bendable joints based on the micro-hydraulic joint system of spider legs .
The duo ’s inflatable “ Smart Stick ” must overcome many of the harsh conditions of space , such as temperature range , pressure and atmospheric composition .
In a recent issue of Bioinspiration and Biomimetics , Menon and Lira explain how most animals use muscles to bend their joints , but spiders do n’t possess such extensors .
Instead , these boneless arachnids have legs that are attached to the prosoma , or the main body , which pumps out fluid into the legs by contracting and expanding .
Although spiders do n’t have veins or even true blood , a pressurized liquid called haemolymph fills the open spaces throughout a spider ’s body .
" Our research approach is to find inspiration from nature to conceive new space engineering systems , " Menon told PhysOrg.com .
" We realized that the characteristics of spiders ' hydraulic systems fit the need of great miniaturization and high force / mass ration required by space actuators . "
The scientists ’ Smart Stick , at 1 mm in diameter , is only slightly larger than a real spider ’s leg .
With one joint , the stick can bend about 1.8 degrees , and the scientists have developed a simple , modular system that enables the connection of several elastic joints for further bending .
Each module consists of an inflatable elastic actuator that separates different segments , and a tube runs between each joint .
To bend the Smart Stick , water in the tube is pressurized , causing the elastic actuators to fill with water and push the segments apart ( see figure ) .
Sensors measure the pressure and then provide feedback to the control unit , where more or less water is pressurized .
The Smart Stick bends similar to the way that spider legs bend .
A pressurized fluid runs through the actuator tube ( green ) , causing the elliptical mini-tube to swell and the joints to bend .
The fluid can be controlled to cause the Smart Stick to bend in different shapes .

“ Space applications require structures , mechanisms and systems that are able to fulfill challenging tasks , while keeping their volumes and masses to a minimum , ” wrote the scientists , emphasizing the importance of gossamer structures in the space field .
“ By folding and deforming the mini-tube , mechanical connectors are avoided , making the system simple , reliable and light . ”
Besides consisting of light materials , inflatable mechanisms must also confront high - energy particles , charged particles , and solar and space radiation when traveling beyond earth .
In this premier run , Menon and Lira developed Smart Stick for Earth conditions , and predict that Smart Stick ’s future will depend on using more flexible materials and incorporating a closed fluid loop in the system .
A closed loop would increase the hydraulic pressure as well as overcome challenges such as leakage and outgassing required for space travel .
" Lightweight joints could potentially be integrated in several space mechanisms , " Menon said .
" For example , they could be implemented in miniaturized robotic systems of sample distributed units , in miniaturized grippers , or embedded in foldable / deployable systems . "
Even if it takes a bit more time for Smart Stick to encounter space , the scientists already have ideas for terrestrial uses for the fluid actuator component of Smart Stick .
Lira is also investigating a wearable , elastic textile called “ variable structure fabric ” that comfortably improves people ’s posture , which is especially useful when working conditions call for long periods of standing or sitting .
" The actuators in ' Variable Structure Fabric ( VSF ) ' involve a new conceptual design of miniaturized fluidic actuators , which are then inserted in cloth items , " explains Lira 's Web page ( VSFproject.com ) .
" Uses for it [ include ] upholstery , technical clothing , underwear , and vehicle interior linings ( based on Smart Stick ) . "

Jack the cat is possessive about his territory , his owners say
The unwelcome intruder was forced up a tree - twice - by the family pet , a tabby cat called Jack .
The terrified bear was only able to make its escape when owner Donna Dickey called the hissing cat into the house .
Ms Dickey said Jack liked to keep a close watch on his territory and often chased away small animals , but one of this size was a first .
" We used to joke , ' Jack 's on duty ' , never knowing he'd go after a bear , " Donna Dickey told local newspaper The Star - Ledger .
" He does n't want anybody in his yard , " she added .
The bear was first spotted in the tree by neighbours who thought the 15 lb ( 7kg ) cat was just looking up at it .
They then realised the bear was afraid of the cat .
After some 15 minutes , the bear descended , but was chased up another tree , before finally making its escape when Jack was called indoors .
Bear sightings are not unusual in the area of West Milford in New Jersey , which experts say is one of the state 's most bear - populated areas .
A cat has changed thinking about ceremonial offerings
Archaeologists built a mock - up of the structures as part of an experiment .
Emma Sanderson , of Caithness Archaeology
Trust , said it was found that a dead rabbit had been left in the replica by a cat .
She said it could mean that animal bones found in real cairns were not the remains of ceremonial offerings , as thought , but left by other creatures .
Archaeologists built reconstructions of burial cairns and ancient towers called brochs as part of a series of research projects and excavations carried out in Caithness over the summer .
Prince Charles , who is on holiday at Castle of Mey , visited the ruins of a broch near Keiss this week .
A team from Nottingham University also dived to a number of wrecks off the Caithness coast , including one thought to be a World War I German warship .
The archaeologists are now analysing their field work , including new insights into cairns .
Knocked down
" One day a couple of weeks ago a dead rabbit was laid out in the cairn .
It had been placed there by a cat , " said Ms Sanderson .
She said it was previously thought that animal remains found in actual cairns were left as ceremonial offerings .
However , the cat 's dead rabbit has provided a new theory that they had been killed by other animals years after the cairn had fallen into disrepair .
Another theory about cairns may also have been exploded after archaeologists knocked down their mock - up .
It was noted that the stones collapsed in a pattern previously thought to be evidence of ceremonial closing of the cairn .
Google modestly declares its mission " to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful . "
But convenience may be part of the problem .
In the Web 's early days , the most serious search engine was AltaVista .
To use it well , a searcher had to learn how to construct a search statement , like , say , " Engelbert Humperdinck and not Las Vegas " for the opera composer rather than the contemporary singer .
It took practice to produce usable results .
Now , thanks to brilliant programming , a simple query usually produces a first page that 's at least adequate -- " satisficing , " as the economist Herbert Simon called it .
The efficiency of today 's search engines arises from their ability to analyze links among Web sites .
Google led in ranking sites by how often they are linked to other highly ranked sites .
It did so using an elaborate variation of a concept familiar in natural science , citation analysis .
Instead of looking at which papers are cited most often in the most influential journals , it measures how often Web pages are linked to highly ranked sites -- ranked by links to themselves .
Citation analysis has been attacked in library circles for inflating the ratings ( and indirectly the subscription prices ) of certain journals .
Search engines have the opposite problem : dispersion rather than concentration of interest .
Despite constant tweaking , their formulas display irrelevant or mediocre sites on a par with truly expert ones .
Curious about the academic field of world history ?
A neophyte would find little help entering " world history " in Google .
When I tried , the only article on the world history movement , from the open - source Wikipedia project , did n't appear until the fifth screen and was brief and eccentric , erroneously dating the field from the 1980's .
( In fairness to Wikipedia , that entry has since been corrected and improved ; moreover , the paid - access Encyclopaedia Britannica site has no specific article at all . )
Only on the seventh screen did I find the World History Network site , financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities , and it is not yet a good portal for beginners .
Many students seem to lack the skills to structure their searches so they can find useful information quickly .
In 2002 , graduate students at Tel Aviv University were asked to find on the Web , with no time limit , a picture of the Mona Lisa ; the complete text of either " Robinson Crusoe " or " David Copperfield " ; and a recipe for apple pie accompanied by a photograph .
Only 15 percent succeeded at all three assignments .
Imagine you ’re exiting the freeway on a ramp , and start braking .
Unfortunately , nothing happens .
Of course , your heart is going to start beating too fast , but try not to panic .
Take a few deep breaths , and use your engine to try to slow the car down .
If that does n't work , you may need to use friction , such as a guardrail , to slow the car .
If you can communicate immediately with the car ahead of you , and that driver is willing to take the risk , it might work .
But you 'd have to be ready to take responsibility for any damage to the other car .
If your vehicle is equipped with manual transmission , it wo n't allow you to switch to reverse gear during forward motion .
For automatic transmission vehicles , switching to reverse ( R ) mode from Drive ( D ) would n't be of any effect until your vehicle comes to a halt .
In either case , it would n't be of much help .
Additionally , reverse ( R ) during forward motion may also hurt your gearbox .
The best bet would be down shifting in quick successions , relying on engine braking to control your vehicle .
Using handbrakes will also help lowering the speeds marginally if not dramatically .
When an automatic transmission is put into park , a small lever ( the parking pawl ) engages a gear to prevent motion of the transmission output shaft .
If this shaft is not stationary when the car is put into park ( what is being suggested here ) , the pawl will not engage and the car will not slow down .
It may even break off , leading to extensive transmission damage and even more problems .
No .
If you turn off your car , you will immediately lose your power steering , as well as the ability to rebuild pressure in the system by pumping the brakes .
Instead of turning the car off , try pumping the brakes , downshifting to a lower gear , and the other instructions listed above .
No , it 's extremely dangerous .
Your rear brakes help prevent you from losing control if you have to suddenly stop .
For instance , if you were driving in the rain or snow and suddenly needed to stop to avoid an accident , your front wheels could lock up and you 'd lose control of your vehicle , which could result in a serious accident .
If your back brakes are out , have them replaced or repaired before you get back out on the road .
Yes , your emergency brake can stop your car if your main brakes are n't functioning properly .
However , activating your emergency brake while you 're moving at high speeds can cause you to lose control of your vehicle and potentially get into a serious accident .
Try to slow your car as much as you can by either applying your standard brakes or allowing your car to coast until it slows down .
Then , activate your emergency brakes and keep them on to keep your car from moving .
If your brake pads start wearing down and you can hear a grinding sound , you need have them replaced as soon as possible .
You could get into a serious accident or damage your vehicle 's braking system .
If you notice your brakes are acting up or making a funny noise , avoid getting out on the open road .
Instead , drive straight to a mechanic or an auto supply shop and get the brake pads replaced .
Keep your eyes on the road and continue to steer .
Pay attention to what ’s in front of you , and maneuver to avoid heavy traffic , pedestrians , and dangerous obstacles .
You may be close to stopping , but you could still cause damage if you 're not paying attention .
If you absolutely can't stop your car another way , try dragging it along or over something to slow it .
For instance , run the car along a curb or wall barrier , which will slow it , though it will likely destroy it in the process .
If other methods fail , turning the engine off can at least cut your speed off .
Wait until you 've slowed down as much as you possibly can before trying this method , as suddenly shutting the engine off can make you swerve .
It can also damage your engine , though , so leave this as a last resort .
If you can , look for a road that 's going uphill , even if it 's only slightly .
If your car is n't braking , the slope may slow it down enough to come to a stop .
For instance , even going up an on - ramp may slow you down , but be sure to stay out of the way of other cars if possible .
This action wo n't stop the car on its own .
However , it may help to slow you down a little .
Plus , it enables you to shout to other passengers and drivers as needed .
If you still are n't stopped , pull up on the emergency brake .
That 's usually the large lever that 's next to the driver 's seat in most cars , though in some , it may be a pedal you push .
The emergency brake may still be working even if your other brakes are n't .
Did You Know ?
Over time , air can get into your car 's brake lines .
This can be dangerous , so you should get your brakes checked by a mechanic every year to make sure they 're up to standards .

When your brakes fail , often they will only partially fail .
You may still have some brakes in place , and pumping the brakes may be enough to slow you to a complete stop .
After pumping a few times , press the brakes all the way to the floor to see if you have any pressure left .
Look for a place to get off the road .
You want to cause as little damage as possible to you and other vehicles , so get away from the main thoroughfare if possible .
If you 're on the freeway , get off it if you can .
If you 're driving a manual , press the clutch and downshift into the next gear down .
This will begin to slow the car .
Keep shifting down as you feel the car slow down .
If you 're in an automatic , use the gear selector to shift to second .
Then , shift to first ( also sometimes marked as " L " or " lower " ) .
Take your foot off the gas and / or turn off the cruise control .
Lifting off the gas will begin to slow the car down , just by virtue of friction and gravity .
Also , your cruise control system should turn off as soon as you touch the brake or clutch , but to be safe , make sure to switch it off manually .
Turn your hazard lights on to warn other drivers .
While they may not be able to figure out what the problem is , your hazard lights will tell other drivers to proceed with caution and pay attention to what your vehicle is doing .
Your hazard light button should be somewhere on your dashboard , and the symbol for them is an orange triangle inside an orange triangle .
This video from features nationally recognized driver safety expert Dr. William Van Tassel , Manager of Driver Training Operations at the American Automobile Association 's ( AAA ) National Headquarters .
He explains different types of braking systems , how to tell what system you have , and what to do if your brakes go out .
Brakes can become less effective if they get wet , especially after hydroplaning or going through deeper water .
When going into such water , it 's best to apply light acceleration or even downshift .
When exiting the water or recovering from a hydroplaning incident , press the brakes down moderately lightly , release , wait , and reapply ( but do not pump ) .
If the pedal feels spongy and soft reapply the brakes a few more times in the same way to dry them .
That red " brake light " comes on for a lot of reasons , not just to tell you that your parking brake is engaged .
Every time you start the car , see if it flashes to make sure it 's working .
If it comes on while you 're driving , you 've lost at least half of your braking system .
If it comes on while you 're applying the brakes , you have a problem – most likely low brake fluid or a faulty master cylinder .
You can avoid most instances of brake failure by regularly checking your brake fluid and changing it according to the manufacturer ’s recommendations .
You should also have your entire brake system inspected at regular intervals or if you notice any change in the performance of your brakes .
Do n’t put off making necessary repairs or performing routine maintenance .
Many " brake failure " cases are brought about by an object getting stuck under the brake pedal , such as a toy or a soda bottle .
Avoid this situation by keeping your car clean and free of debris , especially the area around the driver ’s seat .

Hamas won a crushing victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections as results yesterday showed it had swept away Fatah 's 40 - year monopoly of power , presenting a challenge to western policy towards " terrorist organisations " .
Israel 's acting prime minister , Ehud Olmert , joined the US , Britain and other countries in calling on the Islamist group , which has killed hundreds of people in suicide bombings , to renounce violence and its goal of destroying Israel if it wants international recognition .
" If a government led by Hamas or in which Hamas is a coalition partner is established , the Palestinian Authority will turn into an authority that supports terror , " said Mr Olmert .
" Israel and the world will ignore it and make it irrelevant . "
The Palestinian president and veteran Fatah leader , Mahmoud Abbas , asked Hamas to form the next government after it unexpectedly won 76 seats in the 132 - seat parliament in a stinging verdict on the corruption and mismanagement of Fatah 's rule , and the failures of the peace process .
Fatah won 43 seats .
Thousands of Hamas supporters took to the streets to celebrate , shooting in the air and handing out cakes .
They clashed with Fatah activists in Ramallah as the Hamas flag was raised over the Palestinian parliament .
Last night , hundreds of Fatah gunmen , angry at the result , fired rifles in the air in Gaza and called on Mr Abbas to resign .
The Hamas leader , Mahmoud al - Zahar , said his party was not interested in monopolising power and would begin immediate consultations with Fatah and smaller independent parties about forming a government of national unity .
Some Fatah leaders said they would prefer to resolve the deep divisions within their own movement first , and watch Hamas try to deliver on its promises to end corruption , reform the Palestinian Authority and create a Palestinian state .
Although Hamas is banned as a terrorist organisation in the US and EU , President George Bush , in comments yesterday , did not rule out dealing with the new Palestinian administration .
But it would have to renounce its past policies .
" If your platform is the destruction of Israel , it means you 're not a partner in peace , and we 're interested in peace , " he said .
Tony Blair said Hamas had won a powerful mandate , but must decide " between a path of democracy or a path of violence " .
Hamas has said its year - long ceasefire demonstrates that it is committed to the political path .
But last night , Dr Zahar said his organisation reserved the " right to resist " Israeli attacks on its activists and Palestinian territory .
" We are under occupation .
The Israelis continue aggression against our people : killing , detentions , demolitions .
In order to stop this , we are entitled to self - defence by all means including using guns .
If the Israelis stop their aggression , we will be committed to the quiet , " he said .
Ismail Haniyeh , the Hamas leader in the new parliament , called on foreign governments to respect the election result .
" ' Do n't be afraid ' is our message to the outside world .
Hamas is an aware , mature and politically - open movement , " he said .
Mr Bush implicitly acknowledged that it would be difficult to shun a movement that has won a fair election at a time when the west is pressing other Arab countries to democratise .
He said the result was a " wake - up call " for the old Palestinian leadership .
Israeli analysts say a Hamas - controlled Palestinian government will destroy any prospect of a negotiated settlement and encourage Israel to pursue a unilateral strategy aimed at marking out its final borders and imposing them on Palestinians .
The Robert Morris Internet Worm
The following short overview is taken from Zen and the Art of the Internet , by Brendan P. Kehoe :
On November 2 , 1988 , Robert Morris , Jr. , a graduate student in Computer Science at Cornell , wrote an experimental , self - replicating , self - propagating program called a worm and injected it into the Internet .
He chose to release it from MIT , to disguise the fact that the worm came from Cornell .
Morris soon discovered that the program was replicating and reinfecting machines at a much faster rate than he had anticipated --- there was a bug .
Ultimately , many machines at locations around the country either crashed or became ``catatonic . ''
When Morris realized what was happening , he contacted a friend at Harvard to discuss a solution .
Eventually , they sent an anonymous message from Harvard over the network , instructing programmers how to kill the worm and prevent reinfection .
However , because the network route was clogged , this message did not get through until it was too late .
Computers were affected at many sites , including universities , military sites , and medical research facilities .
The estimated cost of dealing with the worm at each installation ranged from $ 200 to more than $ 53,000 .
The program took advantage of a hole in the debug mode of the Unix sendmail program , which runs on a system and waits for other systems to connect to it and give it email , and a hole in the finger daemon fingerd , which serves finger requests .
People at the University of California at Berkeley and MIT had copies of the program and were actively disassembling it ( returning the program back into its source form ) to try to figure out how it worked .
Teams of programmers worked non -stop to come up with at least a temporary fix , to prevent the continued spread of the worm .
After about twelve hours , the team at Berkeley came up with steps that would help retard the spread of the virus .
Another method was also discovered at Purdue and widely published .
The information did n't get out as quickly as it could have , however , since so many sites had completely disconnected themselves from the network .
After a few days , things slowly began to return to normalcy and everyone wanted to know who had done it all .
Morris was later named in The New York Times as the author ( though this had n't yet been officially proven , there was a substantial body of evidence pointing to Morris ) .
Robert T. Morris was convicted of violating the computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( Title 18 ) , and sentenced to three years of probation , 400 hours of community service , a fine of $ 10,050 , and the costs of his supervision .
His appeal , filed in December , 1990 , was rejected the following March .
5 Ways to Keep Your Cool when Dealing with Criticism
By John Higginbotham
No matter how tough you appear on the outside , dealing with criticism is hard .
If you ’re the victim of a harsh critique , whether justified or not , here are five ways to keep your cool and diffuse what could spiral into a heated situation !
1 . One of the toughest kinds of criticisms to handle is an unjust accusation .
Even though it ’s tempting , do n’t stage a comeback with equally defensive , biting or embarrassing personal remarks .
The accuser may have just been misinformed .
Instead , ask the criticizer questions and probe into their comments .
Often , there is some underlying cause for their accusation .
If it ’s truly unjust , you ’ll be able to mend the problem and state the facts right there on the spot .
2 . If you immediately assume the defense , your critic will feel as if their message just hit a brick wall , and they ’ll keep trying to insist and focus on the problem .
By listening constructively , you ’ll indicate that you ’ve heard their criticism and that you intend to follow up on the problem .
Even better , ask the critic what THEY would do differently if they were in your situation .
Chances are , you ’ll get a lot of feedback and perhaps some solid ideas and suggestions as well .
3 . If the discussion becomes heated , lower your voice for every level your critic raises theirs .
This shows not only that you ’re calm and collected ( even if your blood is boiling underneath ) , but puts the spotlight on the other person , embarrassing them to some degree because they were unable to maintain a reasonable tone and temper .
4 . Show that you ’re more interested in solving the problem than arguing for your point of view .
Sometimes , an honest critique can be a delicate way of informing you of a particular problem that no one else notices or wants to share .
Do n’t be too quick to defend yourself or judge your accuser , and take the complaints and suggestions in stride .
Chances are , it will give you some insights into improvements you can make that you ordinarily may have overlooked or not even considered .
5 . If the issues begin to get out of hand , and you feel yourself starting to lose your cool , take a deep breath to gather your thoughts and ask your accuser for specific details and points that led them to bring this item to your attention .
You may uncover the heart of the real matter and the real reason for their biting remarks , and it may even be something totally unrelated to the matter at hand !
Remember though , you ca n’t please all the people all the time .
Some people are simply never satisfied .
Overlook these shortsighted individuals and know deep down that you are making positive progress despite their attempts to drag you down .
When you know that you ’ve done your best , the bitter pill of criticism will feel more like a hearty dose of good medicine , and that makes all kinds of criticism easier to take .

LET YOUR BODY DO THE TALKING
We all hunt for the perfect chat - up line , but in reality , our body gives away a great deal before we open our mouth .
It is estimated that when you meet a stranger , their impression of you is based 55 per cent on your appearance and body language , 38 per cent on your style of speaking and a mere 7 per cent on what you actually say .
So what can we learn from the experts ?
There are a number of actions that signal “ I like you ” to another person .
Adopting an open posture ( no folded arms ) , and mirroring another ’s posture help create a feeling of affinity .
Most people are not conscious of being mirrored , but evaluate those who do it more favourably .
And it is worth adopting stances that enhance your masculinity or femininity , such as placing hands in pockets with elbows out to enlarge the chest .
You could also indulge in a “ gestural dance ” , synchronising your gestures and body movements with those of the object of your desire , such as taking a sip of your drinks at the same time .
EXPERIENCE FEAR TOGETHER
A dramatic setting can kick - start your love life .
Meeting a stranger when physiologically aroused increases the chance of having romantic feelings towards them …
It ’s all because of a strong connection between anxiety , arousal and attraction .
In the “ shaky bridge study ” carried out by psychologists Arthur Aron and Don Dutton in the 1970s , men who met a woman on a high , rickety bridge found the encounter sexier and more romantic than those who met her on a low , stable one .
A visit to the funfair works wonders too . …
I used to be really messy .
I used to also be really stressed out all the time .
I ’ve found that as I ’ve gotten older , wiser and more organized , I really developed a real appreciation for “ clean and orderly . ”
Why ?
Well , it all boils down to less stress .
I find that when I come home from work and my place is messy , instead of wanting to sit back , grab a beer , a book and relax , I find I feel compelled to take care of things .
I really like to have my place be nice and tidy .
Not spotless by any means , but not distracting .
This means no dirty dishes in the sink or on counters .
No piles of anything and no clothes left out in the open .
All of these things remind me of things I need to do and intrude on what should be a space and time for me to relax .
I ’ve been thinking about this a lot , as I ’ve recently gained a new roomate ; my fiancee , Staci .
She ’s pretty clean , but quite a bit less organzied and we ’re in a space that is simply too small .
( Especially with all the wedding gifts starting to come in — argh . )
It really brings to light some things I was taking for granted while living alone and it ’s made me go back and think creativley about how I keep my spaces clean and organized .
h3 . Some of my best tips on keeping things clean
* Be cleaning constantly .
I really try my best to keep things as clean as I can and I spend at least a few minutes every night cleaning up .
I try to take care of messes when they happen .
For example , I clean and put away dishes as I ’m making dinner and I file and sort my mail when I ’m opening it .
Working smarter , not necessarily harder .
* Hire a professional .
I have a cleaning service come once a month to do a deep clean .
It ’s easy to want to let the place get out of control before they come , so I really have to exercise discipline to keep things up , which also helps quite a bit .
It ’s been totally worth the money .
* Do pre-vacation cleaning .
I make sure and do a thorough clean ( laundry , dishes , etc. ) before I leave for any extended period of time .
It ’s soooo much nicer to come back to a clean house .
* Get good storage .
This is one thing I ’ve had in the past , but do n’t have now .
( Mainly because I have too much stuff — a story for another day )
Having places to file , discard or simply remove from sight things that are n’t used every day is key .
* Throw things away .
Getting rid of old , unused items can be a very liberating feeling .
* Do n’t pile !
I swear , piles of anything ( dishes , clothes , books , mail , paperwork ) are probably the most stress - causing things I can think of .
* Practice the 4 season clean .
Spring cleaning is n’t enough .
I try and do something similar every other month .
It always amazes me at how much crap I can accumulate in such a short period of time .
All in all I ’ve found that the cleaner my environment is the less stressed I am and the more I ’m able to meet the challenges of the day .
Now if I can only get Staci on the same page .
But I ’ll leave that for another day , as it ’s an ongoing issue I ’ve not yet sorted .
For now , let ’s just say I ’m pulling a bit of a double duty . ;)
The row between RIM and NTP stretches back to 2002
The US Supreme Court has refused to hear the Canadian - based group 's appeal against a patent infringement ruling .
The original ruling found that RIM infringed on patents held by NTP , a small technology firm from Virginia .
RIM now faces a possible injunction which could block the use of the handheld wireless device in the US .
The case dates back to 2002 , when patent holding company NTP successfully sued RIM in a lower court and won an injunction in 2003 to halt US sales of the Blackberry and shut down its service .
However , that ruling was delayed pending appeal .
Though the appeals court scaled back the initial ruling , it still ruled that RIM had infringed on NTP patents .
Shares dip
The two parties later reached a tentative $ 450 m settlement on the dispute in March last year , but the deal fell apart in June and a court later ruled that the agreement was not valid .
RIM still wants the agreement enforced .
In the latest appeal , the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether US patent laws were out of date in the age of the internet and global communication .
A panel of judges was asked to consider how US law applied to technology used in a foreign country had allegedly infringed on the intellectual property rights of a patent - holder in the US , in this case NTP .
They were asked to decide whether RIM was liable for patent infringement when its main relay station for e-mail and data transmission was located outside US borders .
The lower court had said it did not matter where the relay station was located .
The
Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal .
Shares in RIM fell over 3 % in value after the ruling .
Computing Thoughts
OpenOffice 2.0 passes the first trial - by - fire
by Bruce Eckel
October 22 , 2005
Summary
Up until now , whenever I 've tried open - source Word clones with my books , they 've collapsed to the floor , babbling and drooling .
Advertisement
Admittedly , a book is about the most challenging thing I can throw at it , so maybe it's not fair for those who are just typing a memo or letter or report now and then .
But for me , it 's not even worth thinking about getting cozy with a product unless it can deal with a book .
In fact , I had kind of given up on ever seeing an open - source tool that could do it .
In addition , there 's the challenge of converting from Word .
My books are Word documents , formatted for camera - ready output .
Previous versions of OpenOffice were the only things I had experienced that could even open one of my book documents without crashing , but the formatting was always trashed by the time they were done .
So I naturally assumed that OpenOffice 2.0 was going to be a similar experience , and I was rather amazed when it was n't .
It opened Thinking in Java , fourth edition and the formatting was nearly perfect .
It appears that there were tiny things here and there , but at this point my assumption is that , if you are creating documents in OpenOffice 2.0 and working all the time with it , you 'd probably be able to deal with those .
It even seemed to handle the indexing and table of contents OK .
Another interesting result was the size of the document .
The Word document is almost 10 MB , whereas the native OpenOffice format is 1.6 MB .
I tried outputting to PDF , and there were a few bumps here and there -- again , I assume that if you were working with it all the time you'd be able to sort those out .
And it was much faster to output to PDF than Adobe Acrobat ( although I did n't see some of the features that I need , such as being able to adjust for press quality ; they may be there , I did n't look very hard ) .
I tried to look at the macros , because I use macros a lot in book development , and it was n't clear that they had come through successfully with the book .
However , the ability to write macros in Python , which OpenOffice supports , might just compensate for the loss of the VBA macros .
( I actually use Python - COM whenever I can for Word document manipulation , which is usually a superior substitute for VBA ) .
Unfortunately , OpenOffice 2.0 failed when I tried to save the book in DocBook format .
It did n't crash , just tried for awhile and then told me it could n't do it .
One of the appealing possibilities for book development is to be able to write Python programs to manipulate the document in XML , so this was a little disappointing .
I suspect that it would be successful with less - complex documents , but I hope that they can fix this issue .
Before you point out that , finally , I should be able to switch to the Mac and have one of those lovely instant - on , instant off laptops ( and the thought certainly crossed my mind ) , it appears that the UML diagramming tool of choice is Enterprise Architect , which as far as I know only runs on Windows boxes .
Oh well .
So I think they 've passed a milestone , at least according to my tests .
If it can at least haul itself through my hoops , then it should be ready for normal use by the vast majority of users .
Congratulations to the OpenOffice team !
PS : The " Impress " PowerPoint clone also seems to have improved , although the one feature that I had hoped for more with -- the export to Flash SWF files -- does n't seem to have changed from the previous version .
In particular , when I put Media Player objects into the slides , these did n't export to SWF in a way that they would actually play the sound .
I think fixing this would be a great contribution , because then you could capture the slides and audio of a presentation and distribute it in Flash format so people could easily view it .
PPS : they have some kind of bug in their file browser ; especially when you go to " My Computer " it can slow down and hang .
Talk Back !

Secret gov't source tells ABC News : ' Get new cellphones ' Posted by Frank James at 12:10 pm CDT ABC News has a very disturbing report today , at least for reporters and anyone else who believe that whistleblowers serve an important role in safeguarding American democracy .
On its blog , The Blotter , ABC News reports that a senior government source has told its reporters that the reporters ’ phone calls with sources are being tracked by the U.S. government “ to root out confidential sources . ”
I hasten to say I do n't have independent confirmation of the facts underlying the ABC News report .
But I thought it was something readers of The Swamp would find interesting .
The item follows .
Federal Source to ABC News : We Know Who You 're Calling
May 15 , 2006 10:33 AM
Brian Ross and Richard Esposito Report : A senior federal law enforcement official tells ABC News the government is tracking the phone numbers we call in an effort to root out confidential sources .
" It 's time for you to get some new cell phones , quick , " the source told us in an in - person conversation .
ABC
News does not know how the government determined who we are calling , or whether our phone records were provided to the government as part of the recently - disclosed NSA collection of domestic phone calls .
Other sources have told us that phone calls and contacts by reporters for ABC News , along with the New York Times and the Washington Post , are being examined as part of a widespread CIA leak investigation .
One former official was asked to sign a document stating he was not a confidential source for New York Times reporter James Risen .
Our reports on the CIA 's secret prisons in Romania and Poland were known to have upset CIA officials .
People questioned by the FBI about leaks of intelligence information say the CIA was also disturbed by ABC News reports that revealed the use of CIA predator missiles inside Pakistan .
Under Bush Administration guidelines , it is not considered illegal for the government to keep track of numbers dialed by phone customers .
The official who warned ABC News said there was no indication our phones were being tapped so the content of the conversation could be recorded .
A pattern of phone calls from a reporter , however , could provide valuable clues for leak investigators .
Being a confidential source who disagrees with a presidential administration then decides to oppose it by becoming a whistleblower can take courage when discovery means loss of a job and possible legal consequences .
It ’s just that kind of courage that this revelation is likely to chill .
That could be the administration ’s intent here , to make would - be confidential sources think twice before talking with reporters .
It ’s no small irony that the only reason we now know about this is because a ABC News ’ confidential source told them about it .
The Blotter posting raises the question of whether ABC News ’ phone calls were swept up as part of the vast National Security Agency database consisting of the phone - call records of millions of Americans which USA Today reported on last week .
It ’s impossible for anyone outside of a few inside the government to say .
But the fact that ABC News journalists are even seriously wondering about whether the warning is connected to the NSA ’s domestic surveillance activities indicates just how anxious many people in Washington have become .

Now do you understand why we do n't want the NSA spying on us ?
Posted by : Cheryl | May 15 , 2006 12:43:58 PM
Wait , I 'm confused ; you mean I can't trust this administration when it says they 're just using this power to catch terrorists ?
I did NOT see that coming ...
Posted by : Andy Burdick | May 15 , 2006 12:47:19 PM
I think reporters and the CIA personal that leaked this information should take a long look in the mirror and decide whose side they are on .
Posted by : Matt Holland | May 15 , 2006 12:51:46 PM
Good Job brothers !
We are now almost ready to unveil the plan to rid the country of all those who are dragging us down .
You know who I am talking about !
The unfirm , mentally unfit to work at the weapons factory .
Those who are old and weak and costing much of our countries valuable resources .
It is time for the cleansing to begin !
Adolf Bush Posted by : Adolf | May 15 , 2006 12:54:05 PM
Being a whistleblower implies being courageous enough to ' blow the whistle ' in the face of consequences .
Wether this latest story ( which once again sees print w/o any sort of evidence to back it up ) is true , the rules of the game have n't changed in that regard .
Frankly it 's high time the government does something to clamp down on a media who seems to have confused ' freedom of press ' with ' freedom to spill every state secret we can get our hands on in the pursuit of ratings ' .
Posted by : RG | May 15 , 2006 12:56:20 PM
I cannot believe commenters really think that the people that spoke to the media about these crimes should be " clamped down on " .
In a free country the government does not clamp down on the press .

When will our congressmen and women start doing their jobs and do something about this ?????
I think nothing less than impeachment is in order for Bush .
My God , Clinton got impeached for doing something FAR less !
It 's too bad elections are n't being held today .
It 's time to clean house .
But , unfortunately , all of this will have been forgotten by November and we will vote to keep in power those that are doing us the most harm .
Say good bye to the Bill of Rights !

Matt , I think you might take a look in the mirror and consider whether you 're proud of your country just because you happened to be born here or because you understand and value the principles that once made this nation a beacon to the world .
Personally , I 'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees , and I think that 's an American virtue ; unlike cowardly consent to bullying .

The biggest problem I have with the NSA eavesdropping program is it does not seem to be cost - effective .
Why have n't they made links between large drug or arms suppliers , and prosecuted same .
Instead , they are looking at small - level dealers , citizens with relatives / friends in foreign countries , and anyone who disagrees with their policies .
Hayden took an oath to defend the Constitution , but it seems to me he must never have read it .

"
Being a confidential source who disagrees with a presidential administration then decides to oppose it by becoming a whistleblower can take courage when discovery means loss of a job and possible legal consequences .
" There is a difference between being a ' whistleblower ' and a ' leaker ' .
Whistleblowers go to Congress with their complaints , where confidential material can remain confidential and a proper investigation can be done .
There are laws to protect Whistleblowers if they follow the process .
A leaker takes their information to the press .
Maybe they tried Congress first , maybe they did n't .
Considering the animosity toward this administration by many in Congress , I highly doubt that an issue raised with a Congress member would go uninvestigated .
There 's a difference between being a whistleblower and a leaker , and that difference is who they tell .
The press has a vested interest here in getting a story out , and could care less about proper process being followed in my opinion .

For those who would give up their liberties merely to assuage the blood - thirst of a government gone rampant and insane with a murderous grab for power do not deserve to claim the freedom that was bought with the blood of martyrs and revolutionaries such as Patrick Henry et al .
They fought against a government who ruled by force so others could be free .
Yet today people are all to ready to give up those same liberties because some government said they should .
Is there no irony here ?
While this article may not have evidential proof and merely be speculation , it does not change the fact that we should ALL be wary of a government , that is known to lie , which says , " Trust me . "
I THINK NOT !
And that applies to ANY POLITICAL PARTY , be it Republican , Democrat , Libertarian , etc. Nixon was called on the carpet for tapes in his possession .
When did it become right to eavesdrop , tap , record , etc. without a court order or evidence of a crime ?
The president is no more above the law than anyone else .
He is the EXECUTIVE BRANCH , NOT the Legislative Branch OR the Judicial Branch .
The whole thing about separation of powers is to prevent a dictator from ruling .
Bush is attempting to take the Office of the President and turn it into the Office of the Dictator .
Must we all say , " Seig Heil " ?

How bad things have things gotten at Wikipedia ?
It 's common knowledge that the site suffers from hoaxsters , inaccurate information , and a vandalism problem that might be funny if it were n't so pervasive .
Even the vandalism page has now been vandalized .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told CNET in an interview that the Germans are coming — and they have a plan to save Wikipedia .
The German - language version of Wikipedia will get an experimental overhaul in the next few weeks designed to cut down on vandalism , edit wars , and misinformation .
How will it work ?
Through the magical power of trust .
In the German system , any user will still be allowed to make edits to any article .
Those edits wo n't show up in the live version of the site , though , until a registered user with a certain level of time and experience approves the changes .
It 's a simple change , but one that could prevent the most juvenile forms of vandalism from ever appearing on the main site , which should do much to remove the appeal of vandalizing articles .
The feature probably wo n't deter more committed defacers and political operatives , but it should bring a stability to the site that Wikipedia currently lacks .
If the pilot program is successful , the idea could eventually be incorporated into other Wikipedia sites .
While this seems like an obvious step in the right direction , it only deals with Wikipedia 's vandalism problem — accuracy issues are not addressed .
The move comes in response to a German court decision early this year that ruled against Wikipedia for publishing the name of a deceased hacker whose family was involved in a court case over his death .
The new protections should make it easier for German editors to spot material that might get the site into Heißwasser ; simply claiming that " but anyone can edit , your honor ! " is n't going to cut it anymore .
Now that Wikipedia a has exploded in size and attracted worldwide interest , finding people willing to do edits and write content for free is no longer Wikipedia 's biggest challenge .
Now the concern is to find some way to keep the content more stable , so that users who visit a Wikipedia article on three separate days do n't find three dramatically different versions of the same article .
Wales would like to develop " Wikipedia 1.0 , " a frozen version of the encyclopedia 's contents where a user could " pull Wikipedia articles and be pretty sure you 're not going to get a giant penis picture , " but he concedes that the material is not yet that polished .
U.S. military now quietly tracking Iraqi deaths / Pentagon begins to acknowledge toll taken by insurgents
2005-10-30 04:00:00 PDT
Baghdad --
In the first public disclosure that the U.S. military is tracking some of the deaths of Iraqi civilians , the military has released rough figures for Iraqis who have been killed or wounded by insurgents since Jan. 1 last year .
The estimate of dead and wounded Iraqi civilians and security forces was provided by the Pentagon in a report to Congress this month .
It appeared without fanfare in a single bar graph on Page 23 of the document .
But it was significant because the military had previously avoided virtually all public discussion of the issue .
The count is incomplete -- it provides daily partial averages of deaths and injuries of all Iraqis at the hands of insurgents , in attacks such as bombings , and suicide strikes .
No figures were provided for the number of Iraqi civilians killed by U.S. - led forces .
Still , it shows that the military appears to have a far more accurate picture of the toll of the war than it has been willing to acknowledge .
" They have begun to realize that when you focus only on the U.S. , it gives the impression that the U.S. does n't care about Iraqis , " said Anthony Cordesman , a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a research group in Washington .
" In these kinds of political battles , you need to count your allies , not just yourself . "
According to the graph , Iraqi civilians and security forces were killed and wounded by insurgents at a rate of about 26 a day early in 2004 , and at a rate of about 40 a day later that year .
The rate increased in 2005 to about 51 a day , and by the end of August had jumped to about 63 a day .
Extrapolating the daily averages over the months from Jan. 1 , 2004 , to Sept. 16 of this year results in a total of 25,902 Iraqi civilians and security forces killed and wounded by insurgents .
According to an analysis by Hamit Dardagan , who compiles statistics for Iraq Body Count ( www.iraqbodycount.net), which tracks civilian deaths , about 3 Iraqis are wounded in the war for each 1 who dies .
Given that ratio , the total Iraqi death toll from insurgent violence would be about 6,475 , based on extrapolations of the military 's figures .
" It strikes me as low , " said Marc Garlasco , senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch in New York .
More Iraqis are dying now in insurgent attacks than at U.S. checkpoints or in U.S. military operations , he said , but the numbers of Iraqis killed by Americans would still add to the overall total .
The tally is lower than the 11,163 deaths of Iraqi civilians in the war during the same period counted by Dardagan 's group , which draws its data from reports of deaths and injuries by various news outlets .
It is also lower than figures released by Iraq 's Interior Ministry showing that 8,175 Iraqi civilians and police officers had been killed by insurgents from August 2004 through May 2005 .
Even so , the tallies show that the military has been recording Iraqi deaths by insurgents with some regularity since the first months after the invasion .
The casualties were compiled from reports filed by coalition military units after they responded to attacks , said Lt. Col.
Barry Venable , a Pentagon spokesman , in answers to questions from the New York Times sent by e-mail .
The numbers are spotty , he said , because forces do not respond to every attack , and initial on - site counts are often incomplete .
The count did not separate the dead from the wounded or differentiate between civilians and police officers or soldiers .
" These incident reports are not intended to provide -- and do not provide -- a comprehensive account of Iraqi casualties , " Venable said in his e-mail message .
The information in the reports shows " trends in casualties resulting from insurgent attacks . "
The report , " Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq , " was the second of the quarterly accountings required by Congress this year .
The first accounting , issued in July , was criticized by some members of Congress for providing too few details about the effort in Iraq .
The second report , which included the Iraqi casualty figures , was twice as long as the first and was posted on the Department of Defense Web site on Oct. 13 .
Venable said information on civilians was included in the October report " as a result of specific questions posed by congressional staffers during briefings . "
" We were very interested in it , " said Timothy Rieser , an aide to Sen.
Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , who sponsored the amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill that calls for casualty details .
" After denying that they keep these statistics , it gives the Congress something concrete to ask them about , " Rieser said .
The bar graph was made public , but the data underlying it were not , so the figures used for this article were derived from measuring the bars .
Venable said the information had been classified because it could allow insurgents to assess the effectiveness of their attacks .
Dardagan questioned the secrecy , citing regular releases of American deaths .
" We now know that the U.S. military does keep records of Iraqi civilian deaths , " Dardagan said .
" There seems to be no obvious reason for keeping them a secret . "
There have been some separate attempts at tallying Iraqis killed by U.S. troops .
Mohamed al - Musawi , director of the Iraqi Human Rights Organization , said in an interview last week that he had documented 589 Iraqis killed by Americans in Baghdad since 2003 .
Previously , the military said its records were so incomplete that it would not release any data .
In July , Lt. Col .
Steven Boylan , a spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad , said , " We do not have the ability to get accurate data .
We do not have visibility all over Iraq in every location . "
U.S. military officials have said attacks against Americans and Iraqis have been averaging 85 a day for much of the past year .
It is not clear what proportion of attacks U.S. forces respond to , but Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , a spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq , said Thursday that forces respond " whenever we can . "
GALLUP , N.M. , Dec. 20 — Earl Milford put up an artificial Christmas tree in the wooden house on the Navajo reservation near here that he shares with a son and daughter - in - law and their two little girls .
But money is scarce and so are presents .
“ It ’s all right , ” he said , “ they know I love them . ”
Mr. Milford is chronically broke because each month , in what he calls “ my ritual , ” he travels 30 miles to Gallup and visits 16 storefront money - lending shops .
Mr. Milford , who is 59 and receives a civil service pension and veteran ’s disability benefits , doles out some $ 1,500 monthly to the lenders just to cover the interest on what he had intended several years ago to be short - term “ payday loans . ”
Mr. Milford said he had stopped taking out new loans , but many other residents of the Gallup area and countless more people across the country are visiting payday lenders this month , places with names like Cash Cow , Payday Plus and Fast Buck , to get advances of a few hundred dollars to help with holiday expenses .
While such lending is effectively banned in 11 states , including New York , through usury or other laws , it is flourishing in 39 others .
The practice is unusually rampant and unregulated in New Mexico , where it has become a contentious political issue .
The Center for Responsible Lending , a private consumer group based in Durham , N.C. , calculates that nationally payday loans totaled at least $ 28 billion in 2005 , doubling in five years .
The best year in my history of films would have to be 1999 .
Look at the list :
The Matrix
South Park : Bigger , Longer and Uncut ,
Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ,
Three Kings
American Beauty
but the best of this list of bests was Fight Club .
No movie spoke to me on so many levels as that movie .
You either get it or you do n't .
Now a lot of people hate it .
And it got the Entertainment Chief of Fox , Bill Mechanic fired .
But for me and others it was the defining movie of our generation .
And as time has passed some peoples opinion about the film has changed as well .
Entertainment Weekly , which had originally given the film a negative grade of D , later ranked the DVD # 1 on its list of " The Top 50 DVDs You Need To Own . "
The movie , which was a flop at the box office , actually has made a profit because of DVD sales .
But none of that matters .
What matters it that it told a generation that it was " not it 's fucking khakis … "
Here 's a rare trailer …

Food For Thought
By Rusty Rockets
The article , Was The Missing Link A Tripping Chimp ? , suggested that humans split from their chimp cousins 5 - 7 million years ago thanks to the psychoactive compounds contained in a particular root found on the plains of Africa .
This band of psychedelic chimps eventually developed into the first hominids , and if you fast forward around 5 million years , you 'd have likely found these early humans dwelling along the shorelines of Africa 's prehistoric Rift Valley .
According to Dr. Stephen Cunnane , this was the point at which the human brain showed signs of " explosive " growth due to the iodine rich foods that they were harvesting from the waters and shorelines where they now lived .
But this theory has proved a bitter pill for many anthropologists to swallow , who maintain the standard line that it was tool - use and language that activated the remarkable evolutionary growth of the human brain .
While it appears to be a case of " which came first , " nobody should be too hasty in throwing their hands in the air with bewildered indifference , as Dr. Cunnane presents a convincing argument .
It should be stated that while our brains weigh twice as much as our 2 million year old ancestor Homo habilis , the explanation for such massive growth still remains a divisive hot - button topic among anthropologists and evolutionary biologists to this day .
One of the most controversial aspects of Dr. Cunnane 's theory that really fires up the opposition is that humans became complete brain - boxes ( well , most of us ) by chance , rather than adaptation .
It was by chance that early humans started eating the foods with the necessary minerals and nutrients that fed the already inherent potential for brain growth in early humans , reckons Cunnane .
" Initially there was n't selection for a larger brain , " he explains .
" The genetic possibility was there , but it remained silent until it was catalyzed by this shore - based diet . "
It is this hypothesis that forms the basis for Cunnane 's book entitled Survival of the Fattest , published in 2005 .
Cunnane argues that his theory casts doubt on the idea that tool use and language forced the brain to adapt and grow to accommodate these newly acquired skills .
" Anthropologists and evolutionary biologists usually point to things like the rise of language and tool making to explain the massive expansion of early hominid brains .
But this is a Catch - 22 .
Something had to start the process of brain expansion and I think it was early humans eating clams , frogs , bird eggs and fish from shoreline environments .
This is what created the necessary physiological conditions for explosive brain growth , " says Dr. Cunnane , a metabolic physiologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec .
There are some other factors related to tool use that add another supportive dimension to Cunnane 's theory .
As pointed out in Tripping Chimp , previous research showed that chimps simply do n't have the brainpower to learn how to use tools as humans do .
While early chimps could use basic tools such as sticks to pry out ants , modern chimps demonstrate that they have not advanced their tool making abilities one iota .
It was also suggested that perhaps chimps learned basic tool usage from their tripping chimp chums .
But researchers at the Yerkes Primate Center in Atlanta showed that an intelligent chimp called Kanzi could not be shown how to make an effective stone tool successfully , despite evidence showing that the earliest Oldowan tool - makers understood this principle .
To make even the crudest form of tool , we'd have to accept that our ancestors had to have made a massive cognitive leap , which brings us back to Cunnane 's hypothesis .
Cunnane argues that it is the " metabolic constraints " placed on the human brain that represent the missing link between humans and our estranged chimp cousins .
Apart from being huge compared to our closest primate relatives , right from birth the human brain has an insatiable hunger for energy and the minerals and nutrients needed for growth , development and maintenance .
Cunnane argues that this is why among all of the primates only human babies are born cute and chubby .
With a newborn baby 's brain consuming 75 percent of its daily energy intake , the extra body fat functions as a " built - in energy reservoir , " says Cunnane .
For a newborn 's brain to grow to its full potential , a particular polyunsaturated fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) is required .
It so happens that baby fat contains very high concentrations of DHA and Cunnane argues that the benefits of the surplus fat on early human babies provided the optimal conditions for " explosive " brain growth to transpire .
So , where did this surplus body fat come from ?
From their new shoreline diets , which included shellfish and catfish , Cunnane believes .
" The shores gave us food security and higher nutrient density .
My hypothesis is that to permit the brain to start to increase in size , the fittest early humans were those with the fattest infants . "
However , it seems debatable as to whether a mother 's high protein diet explains the chubbiness of her newborn , or indeed , whether newborns at this time were carrying surplus pounds at all .
In any case , Cunnane continues by saying that one of the advantages of having a shoreline diet was that , unlike Africa 's hostile savannahs , it provided a constant nutrient rich food supply , which accommodated the inherent potential for human brain growth .
Cunnane knows that early humans settled in these shoreline areas , as associate Dr. Kathy Stewart 's own excavations in East Africa uncovered numerous Homo habilis sites that contained a large quantity of catfish and other assorted fish bones .
The significance of these finds is crucial to Cunnane 's hypothesis in yet another way , as a rich aquatic diet is also high in iodine .
" The evidence of the importance of key shoreline nutrients to brain development is still with us - painfully so .
Iodine deficiency is the world 's leading nutrient deficiency , " explains Cunnane .
The result of iodine deficiency in its severest form is cretinism , which results in varying degrees of physical and mental impairment .
In a recent edition of the Australian Medical Journal , Professor Cres Eastman explains how even children in prosperous countries run the real risk of suffering the consequences of iodine deficient diets .
Eastman has campaigned for the distribution of iodized salt by law in many countries , such as Tibet , where cretinism is rife .
Thanks to Eastman and others , iodine is legally required to be added to salt in more than 100 countries .
" We 've created an artificial shore - based food supply in our salt , " says Cunnane .
This observation together with the other evidence he has gathered has led Cunnane to conclude that : " It was the combination of abundant shoreline food and the " brain selective nutrients " that sparked the growth of the human brain . "
Cunnane 's hypothesis favors geographical location , a nutrient rich diet and an inherent potential for brain growth over natural selection and adaptation as being the instigators of explosive brain growth in humans .
But his measured arguments also acknowledge the difficulties in determining whether it 's nature or nurture that drives certain traits and abilities forward .
Focusing on the " survival of the fattest " only seems to momentarily shift attention away from the obvious question of where this initial potential for brain growth came from , especially considering that humans seem to be the only ones that were endowed with such potential .
When , and where , did this potential for brain growth come from ?
While Cunnane 's hypothesis appears strong , there 's still the nagging question of why early hominids moved from their food abundant rainforests to the dangerous savannahs , and then later to the shorelines of Africa 's Rift Valley .
Cunnane claims that it was by sheer chance that they came across the right food source to cause massive , explosive brain growth .
But could it instead be thanks to those psychoactive compounds ?
Maybe those original pioneering chimps would n't have begun their perilous journey unless they were all dosed up on mind - expanding substances .

The indictment of Tom DeLay , majority leader of the House of Representatives , may not be the start of a conservative crack - up ; but a realignment of the movement that has come to dominate American politics could be in the works
AFP
TOM DELAY is no stranger to excitement .
He claims nearly to have been killed during a bout of revolutionary violence in Venezuela , where he lived in his teens .
He was asked to leave the first university he attended , and he made a living exterminating bugs before he entered politics .
But “ the Hammer ” has not been able to swat away the swarm of investigators buzzing around him .
On Wednesday September 28th , Mr DeLay was indicted by a grand jury in Texas for alleged breaches of campaign - finance law , and forced to resign , at least temporarily , his position as Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives , America 's lower parliamentary chamber .
There was much whooping among Democrats , for whom Mr DeLay was a hate figure even before he played a crucial part in the impeachment of Bill Clinton .
“ I hope his cell is full of cockroaches , ” was one of the gentler postings on one leftish blogsite .
Washington , DC , is now engulfed in two debates .
The first revolves around how bad a mess Mr DeLay is in ; the second is about the extent of the fissures within the conservative movement that currently dominates American politics .
The case against Mr DeLay is less easy to understand than the perjury - about - fellatio charge against Mr Clinton .
Along with two political associates , John Colyandro and Jim Ellis , he is accused of conspiracy to violate the election code in his home state of Texas .
Mr DeLay has a political action committee called Texans for a Republican Majority ( TRMPAC ) .
Prosecutors allege that it accepted $ 155,000 from various companies , and then wrote a cheque for $ 190,000 to an arm of the Republican National Committee , with instructions to distribute chunks of the stash to individual candidates in Texas .
In effect , the indictment argues , TRMPAC enabled the party to get around the ban on corporate donations to individual candidates .
If convicted , Mr DeLay faces up to two years in jail and a fine of up to $ 10,000 .
But that is far from certain .
He has denounced the charges as “ one of the weakest , most baseless indictments in American history ” , adding that the district attorney behind the case , Ronnie Earle , was “ an unabashed partisan zealot with a well - documented history of launching baseless investigations and indictments against his political enemies ” .
Mr Earle is a liberal Democrat who , in 1993 , indicted Kay Bailey Hutchison , now the state 's senior Republican senator , on what “ The Almanac of American Politics ” called “ flimsy charges he was forced to drop the first day the case came to court ” .
Against that , Mr Earle has prosecuted four times as many Democrats as Republicans .
Mr DeLay said that his defence “ will not be technical or legalistic ; it will be categorical and absolute .
I am innocent .
Mr Earle and his staff know it .
And I will prove it . ”
He then promised that Republicans would not be deflected from their “ bold and aggressive agenda ” to do something about petrol prices , state pensions , illegal immigration and fiscal responsibility — issues he vowed would all be tackled in the next few weeks .
That may be a bit optimistic .
For one thing , the Republicans will miss Mr DeLay 's vote - whipping skills .
He has a startling record of assembling hair - thin majorities for ticklish pieces of legislation , such as on Medicare prescription - drug benefit in 2003 .
In other words , he is adept at offering the necessary inducements to just enough waverers , but no more .
His case will probably not come to trial for several months , and in the meantime he remains a member of the House of Representatives .
His duties as majority leader are to be assumed , for now , by Roy Blunt of Missouri , the House Republican whip , with assistance from David Dreier , a representative from California , and Eric Cantor of Virginia .
None is likely to be as forceful as the Hammer .
Mr DeLay 's indictment is not the only ethical problem hampering the Republicans .
Bill Frist , the Senate majority leader , is being investigated about a stock sale he insists involved no inside information .
Karl Rove , President George Bush 's chief strategist , is fighting accusations that he leaked the name of Valerie Plame , an undercover CIA agent ( see Rove profile ) .
On Thursday , the vice - president 's influential chief of staff , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , was revealed also to have told a reporter that Ms Plame worked for the CIA .
And Mr DeLay 's problems are not limited to Texas : a lobbyist chum of his , Jack Abramoff , has been accused of a variety of dodgy doings involving Indian casinos and influence - peddling .
This accumulation of sleaze has made it harder for the Republicans to push through their agenda , reckons Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution , a liberal think - tank .
Other pundits are not so sure .
Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think - tank , says Mr DeLay 's indictment will “ not have a huge impact ” on the Republican legislative programme , “ mostly because it was in tatters before ” .
That might sound odd .
After all , only last November conservatives were preening themselves like peacocks , having won their seventh presidential election in ten contests .
Mr Bush ran for his second term on a conservative platform of tax cuts , family values and American power .
Marshalled by Mr Rove , millions of activists — anti-tax people , gun people , social conservatives , neo - conservatives and many more — comprehensively outfought their liberal equivalents .
Mr Bush won more votes than any candidate in history .
Today the conservative movement is in turmoil .
Different types of conservatives are at each other 's throats .
Everybody is hurling opprobrium at the president .
David Brooks , a conservative columnist on the New York Times , recently declared that he sometimes wonders whether Mr Bush is a Manchurian candidate — sent to discredit conservatism .
The loudest howls are coming from small - government conservatives who are furious with Mr Bush 's loose spending .
But business conservatives are furious about his love - affair with the religious right and traditional conservatives are furious about his commitment of blood and treasure to the Iraq war .
These rows are particularly dangerous because they reflect long - standing tensions within the conservative movement :
• Small - government conservatives v big - government conservatives .
Mr Bush has embraced all sorts of big - government programmes ( from supercharging the Department of Education to creating the huge new Medicare drug entitlement ) while trying to keep small - government conservatives on side with tax cuts .
But this was a formula for fiscal disaster .
It also failed to placate purists who believe that the federal government has no business running schools or pushing pills to pensioners .
• Conservatives of faith v conservatives of doubt .
Doubters do n't think that the federal government should interfere in people 's private lives .
They do n't want Washington meddling in states ' rights to legalise euthanasia or medical marijuana .
Conservatives of faith believe that the federal government should encourage civic virtue .
Under Mr Bush they have had the upper hand .
The Justice Department has been aggressive in imposing its views on the states .
The poster - child of the conservative movement on Capitol Hill at the moment is Senator Rick Santorum , a staunch advocate of family values .
• Insurgent conservatives v establishment conservatives .
The conservative movement , rooted in the south and west , has been deeply hostile to Washington .
But electoral success has created a Washington - based Republican establishment , which spends its time doling out goodies to its buddies and expanding federal power .
Mr Bush has managed this relationship by presenting himself as an anti-Washington Washingtonian : the son of a president who prefers to spend his time in Texas .
The insurgent wing seems increasingly unconvinced .
• Business conservatives v religious conservatives .
The latter are waiting keenly to see whom Mr Bush appoints next to the Supreme Court .
Business conservatives are worried that religious people have already got too much .
Mr Bush 's stance on stem - cell research will cost America its competitive edge in biotechnology .
Add to this their concerns about Mr Bush 's reckless fiscal policy and you have the making of a business revolt .
• Neo-conservatives v traditional conservatives .
The former have an expansive vision of America 's role in the world — a vision that has come to include not just nation - building in Afghanistan and Iraq but also the transformation of the Middle East .
But traditionalists balk at the hubris of this vision .
How can conservatives who believe that government power is fallible rally to the idea of transforming an entire region ?
This sort of criticism was once limited to mavericks such as Pat Buchanan .
But it is now mainstream .
William Buckley , one of the movement 's founders , has declared that the Iraq war was probably a mistake .
Before the election , one senior White House figure confided that his biggest worry was not the anti-war left ( which always sings the same song ) but the possibility that the conservative intellectual elite would turn against the war .
The rive droite seems to be turning .

Can Rove turn it around again ?
How bad is this ?
All successful political parties contain tensions .
Look at Britain 's Labour Party — a party of pacifist trade unionists led by a hawkish fan of capitalism .
The bigger a political party gets , the bigger the tensions .
Politics is the art of managing these tensions — something Mr Bush 's team did brilliantly until this year .
The loss of touch began before Hurricane Katrina .
Bungling in Iraq provoked a drumbeat of discontent , with neo -conservatives calling for more troops and traditional conservatives calling for an exit strategy .
And the Valerie Plame affair demoralised the White House .
It not only threatened Mr Rove 's political career , and is now putting Mr Libby in the spotlight ; it also demonstrated how far Mr Bush 's pursuit of the war had alienated much of the Washington establishment ( including the CIA and the State Department ) .
Katrina has been a disaster .
Mr Bush 's slow response to the hurricane ( it did not help that Mr Rove was in hospital ) spoiled his claim to be a can - do president and it unleashed a previously quiescent press .
The Bush machine 's ruthless media management infuriates journalists , but while he was on top they played the game on his terms .
Now they are out for revenge .
Earlier this year , Newsweek fawned about the “ hands - on and detail oriented ” president who wants to hear the bad news first .
After Katrina it presented a picture of a man who surrounds himself with toadies who are too terrified to warn him of brewing disaster .
Surviving Watergate and Bill Clinton
Predictions of the demise of American conservatism are almost as old as the movement .
It survived both Watergate and Bill Clinton .
Emmett Tyrell , the editor of the American Spectator , published “ The Conservative Crack - up ” in 1992 .
So much of the right 's power lies outside the administration and Congress — in its domination of the intellectual agenda for instance — that it is seldom down for long .
The Democrats show few signs that they have the wind in their sails .
Their handling of John Roberts 's nomination to the Supreme Court has been dismal .
Neither Harry Reid , the minority leader in the Senate , nor Nancy Pelosi , the minority leader in the House , is likely to set the world on fire .
Moveon.org types want to drag the party to the left ; Clintonistas want to pull it to the centre .
America has two dysfunctional parties .
But Mr Bush 's recent problems do raise one important possibility : that of a realignment on the right .
The fact that the Bush machine is running out of steam makes it much less likely that he will be able to determine his successor .
This creates opportunities for very different sorts of conservatives who are waiting in the wings .
One possibility is Rudy Giuliani , former mayor of New York , who combines managerial toughness with social liberalism .
But an even more likely one is John McCain .
Up until now Mr McCain , a senator , has been popular in the country at large ( he wins all head - to - head competitions with Hillary Clinton ) but unpopular with the conservative movement .
But the right is beginning to warm to him .
He has spent his career campaigning against the sort of pork - barrel spending that conservatives are now railing against .
And he is soundly conservative on both foreign and fiscal policy .
A conservative crack - up may be going too far ; but a conservative realignment is definitely in the works .
USE OF FORCE ….
After reading tonight ’s story about North Korea preparing to test fire a new missile , it occurred to me that this would make a good real - life test of the “ use of force ” question .
That is , when is it justifiable to use force against dangerous or unstable international regimes ?
Windy theorizing is one thing , but the rubber hits the road when you have to decide what to do in real time in an actual case .
Here ’s the background : the North Koreans are supposedly fueling their new Taepodong - 2 missile , which is a sign that a launch is imminent .
The State Department has taken the unusual step of directly contacting the North Korea delegation at the UN to warn them against performing the test .
The missile could reach the United States and is probably capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
So : would we be justified in launching an attack on the North Korean test site ?
What does a neocon like Bill Kristol think ?
An old - fashioned super - hawk like Dick Cheney ?
A reformed liberal hawk like Peter Beinart ?
An unreformed liberal hawk like Hillary Clinton ?
Or would they all say the same thing and demonstrate that behind the rhetoric there ’s not really much difference between them ?
Or how about this suggestion from James Robbins ?
Sounds like a great opportunity to test our missile - defense technology .
North Korea has no right to test weapons over other countries , so they wo n’t have a leg to stand on legally .
And it would be a great statement of our resolve to stand up to their aggressive behavior .
Finally , it would be a high - profile way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our missile - defense systems .
For example the Airborne Laser system is up for a flight test this year .
Why not make it count ?
Hell , I could almost sign up for that .
After 20 years , it ’s time for the missile defense guys to put their money where their mouths are .
Of course , Boeing does n’t even pretend that ABL is operational yet , so that particular suggestion is probably out .
But how about GMD ?
Anyone up for finding out if it really works ?
After this teaser the other day , you knew Bill O'Reillys interview with Rep. Barney Frank was going to be fun .
Frank succinctly breaks down why he called Chris Wallace out on his " odd view of balance " saying that the interview was promoted as a chance for the Democrats to talk about their agenda yet began with Wallace nitpicking points of controversy while all but ignoring the positive Democratic agenda the incoming Chairmen were prepared to discuss .
Frank made his case so persuasively that O'Reilly -- who claimed he 's been " sabotaged " before too -- conceded he had a point .
Download WMP | Download MOV
Sparks began to fly when O'Reilly brought up the topic of income redistribution and freaked out when Frank gave him an answer he did n't like .
This prompted the Congressman to tell Bill to " stop being a silly would - be district attorney " when he demanded an answer " for the record " and told him to " go to law school " if he wanted to do that .
O'Reilly could n't resist the urge to fire back accusing Frank of thinking he was the " czar of the interview . "
Good times .
Newshounds has more ...
Galaxies do n't have enough regular matter to keep them from flying apart , scientists have been telling us for years .
So there must be a bunch of unseen " dark matter " lurking in every galaxy .
But dark matter has never been directly detected , and nobody knows what it might be made of .
A few scientists remeain skeptical .
To a lay person , it might sound downright crazy .
Now a new study suggests there may be no such thing as dark matter .
Fred Cooperstock of Northeastern University and Steven Tieu at the University of Victoria say Einstein 's theory of general relativity can explain the cohesiveness of individual galaxies including our Milky Way .
Here 's the thinking :
Newton 's laws of physics explain why our solar system stays together .
But the planets are negligible in the overall gravitational scheme , with the Sun being the total ruler and containing 99.86 percent of all the mass .
The same Newtonian physics were long ago applied to galaxies , and the rotation of stars could n't be explained , so dark matter was invented to make theory work .
But a galaxy is much different than the solar system , Cooperstock explains .
The conglomeration of all the matter -- stars , black holes , gas , and dust -- is collectively the source of the galactic gravity .
Even a black hole at a galaxy 's center typically packs less than 1 percent of the galaxy 's overall mass .
The overall galaxy 's gravity " feeds its own motion ... unlike the case of the solar system , " Cooperstock told SPACE.com .
The science of the new argument is complex , but here goes :
" In the galaxy case , having rotation , we have found that general relativity provides a very important potential that is connected to the density of the galactic matter in what we call a ' nonlinear ' manner , ' " Cooperstock says .
" This is unlike Newtonian physics . "
This nonlinear effect has been noted before .
" The interesting twist is that this holds also for the simpler steady rotational motion under gravity as in the galaxy , " he said .
The upshot :
The motions of stars in galaxies " is realized in general relativity 's equations without the need to invoke massive halos of exotic ' dark matter ' that nobody can explain by current physics , " Cooperstock said .
A small percent of what used to be considered dark matter is made of burned - out stars that are hard to see .
Predictions for how much of that material exists would not change .
Also , the new idea does not yet explain how large clusters of galaxies bind together .
Further research by other theorists might solve that problem too , however , Cooperstock said .
The new analysis has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal but has yet to be reviewed by other scientists .
If it is right ?
" This would remove about 25 percent of the mass of the universe , the ultimate weight - reduction program , " Cooperstock said .
Startup Idea : Real - time route suggestions based on traffic or needs November 16 , 2006
Today I can use a mapping service like Google Maps or Mapquest to get directions from point - A to point - B ( or multi- point trip planning ) .
I can use a fat - client application like MapPoint to get DOT road construction data or to find points of interest along the way ( i.e. “ gas stations within 5 miles of the route ” ) .
Also I can get real - time traffic reports on MSN ( and likely other services ) that let me know about congestion , accidents , or road closures in roughly real - time .
But that information needs to be mashed up .
I have 4 routes I normally take .
Which route I choose on any given day is based on a few simple factors :
The time of day
Traffic information from the radio
Whether I need to stop to get something along the way
Sometimes I guess right .
Sometimes not .
All of the data I need to make the decision , and even the process needed to make the decision , could be automated though .
I could look at a website ( or get an email or an RSS feed or a text message or whatever ) before leaving work that tells me which of my preferred routes is the one likely to get me home the fastest .
I do n’t need to look along each of the four routes for accidents and then think about what time it is .
I just need to read the words “ Go home in I - 40 to US - 1 ” .
If I need to get something like gas it could suggest which gas station along the way is the best route .
If I promised my wife I would pick up a pizza on the way home it could route me to Papa John ’s site , make my order and then optimize my route with that stop .
I could have used this yesterday .
I needed to stop at a florist to get my wife flowers ( are n’t I a great guy ? ) .
This meant finding a florist on my route , figuring out the best way to get there and making the order .
It should n’t have taken the 15 minutes it did .
All I needed to do was say “ find me a florist on my preferred route home .
I anticipate I will leave at 4:30 ” .
Obviously real - time traffic data ca n’t fit into the prediction but when 4:25 rolled around I could have asked for an update that would confirm that my route was still good or it would have recommended another route between the office and the florist .
Basically we already have all the information we need to do this .
All we need is a mashup that allows me to give my preferred routes and then use that information to form a recommendation .
There are many integration possibilities here .
Cell phones , in - car GPS units , On * Star , etc .
The revenue stream could be from retail affiliations , subscription fees ( free + premium service ? ) , ads , corporate accounts ( fleet management ) , licensing , etc .
I do n’t know .
I ’m just the idea guy .

年の瀬も差し迫った今日の早朝、驚くべき内容のメールが自分のメールボックスに入っていた。差出人は烏賀陽弘道氏。「Jポップとは何か」（名著！）「Jポップの心象風景」でおなじみのジャーナリストだ。
まずは下記に内容を転載するので読んでもらいたい。
※ 12月19日早朝、烏賀陽さんのサイトに、ご本人自らのコメントがアップされました。訴状が送られてきた日時の修正と、チェーンメールを呼びかける文面の削除が行われたので、下記転載部分も混乱を避けるため修正します。
■ 「オリコン」が烏賀陽個人を被告に5000万円の損害賠償訴訟■
意見が違うというだけで、企業が個人に5000万円を求めるなんて！
これは武富士と同じ手口の言論封殺の恫喝訴訟じゃないのか。オリコンは雑誌だってたくさん出しているのだから、烏賀陽の言うことが間違っているのなら「烏賀陽のいうことはウソです。なぜなら××」と反論すればいいのだ。それこそがまっとうな「言論」というものじゃないのか。意見の異なる者を高額訴訟で社会的に抹殺するなんてのは、民事司法の体裁をとった言論妨害じゃないのか。
緊急事態が起きました。どうか、みなさんのお知恵、お力を貸してください。
06年12月13日、月刊誌「サイゾー」編集部に東京地裁から損害賠償訴訟の訴状が送られてきました。原告は、音楽ヒットチャートでは知らない人のない巨大独占企業「オリコン」。その企業が、烏賀陽弘道という一個人に対して、5000万円という巨額の損害賠償金を支払うよう求める民事訴訟を同地裁に起こしたのです。
訴訟の対象になったのは、 「サイゾー」06年4月号51ページの「ジャニーズは超ＶＩＰ待遇！？事務所とオリコンの蜜月関係」という1ページの記事に掲載された烏賀陽のわずか20行ほどのコメントです。
これは、サイゾー編集部からの電話取材に対して、烏賀陽が話した内容を同編集部がまとめて文字化したものです（よって、内容は烏賀陽の原義とはかなり隔たっていますが、そのへんはひとまず置きます）。よって、烏賀陽が能動的に寄稿したものでも、執筆したものでもありません。
その中で、烏賀陽はオリコンのヒットチャートのあり方についていくつかの疑問を提示しています。ここにコメントしたことは、烏賀陽の取材経験でも、音楽業界内の複数のソースから何度も出た話で、特に目新しい話や驚くような話はひとつもありません。
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
この訴訟には、いくつか露骨なまでの特徴があります。
（１）記事を掲載した「サイゾー」および発行元「インフォバーン」を訴訟対象にしていないこと。つまり烏賀陽個人だけを狙い撃ちしている。烏賀陽は前述の弁護士費用、訴訟準備などをすべて一人で負担しなければならないことになります。これではフリー記者としての活動を停止し、訴訟対策に専念しなくてはなりません。みなさん、ワタクシは生活費は一体どうやって稼げばよいのでしょう（笑）。
（２）この5000万円という金額は、応訴するために弁護士を雇うだけでも着手金が219万円かかるというおそるべき額です（そんな貯金あるわけないですがな＝笑）。裁判で負ければ、烏賀陽はジャーナリストとしての信用を失い、職業的生命を抹殺されてしまうばかりか、賠償金を払えず、社会的生命をも抹殺されかねない恐れがあります。
どこかで聞いた覚えはありませんか？ そう。これは、ジャーナリストの批判を封じるための恫喝を目的とした、消費者金融・武富士がかつて行ったのと同じ手法の、恫喝訴訟と言えるでしょう（武富士訴訟ではジャーナリスト側が勝訴し、逆に武富士を訴えて勝っています）。
http://www.kinyobi.co.jp/takefuji
（３）しかも、訴状をどうひっくり返して読んでも、なぜ5000万円の損害を受けたのかという計算の合理的根拠はまったくどこにも書いてありません。ずさん、というより、相手が払えない（そしてビビる）高額であればそれでいいという額をテキトーに選んだ印象を受けます。
（４）烏賀陽は一貫して「レコード会社の宣伝・営業担当者にはオリコンの数字を操作しようとする良からぬ輩もいる＝オリコンは被害者である」という立場を取っているし、文意からもそれは明らかなのに、なぜかオリコンはそれを無視し烏賀陽の記事が自社の信用を損なったと主張していること。
（５）裁判の証拠書類として、烏賀陽が「アエラ」03年2月3日号に書いたオリコンの記事が添付されていました。
http://ugaya.com/private/music_jpopcolumn18.html
これはオリコンのデータとＰＯＳデータ（サウンドスキャン社）のデータが乖離しているのはなぜか？という疑問を提示したものです。この記事も当時オリコンの小池恒右社長の憤激を買いました（社長直々にお怒りの電話を頂戴しました）ので、烏賀陽がオリコンの「好ましからざる人物」にリストアップされていたことは間違いありません（過去に取材拒否もあり）。
（６）オリコンは「オリジナル・コンフィデンス」はじめ多数の出版物を出す出版社でもあります。ですから、もし「ウガヤのいうことはウソだ」というのなら、そこの紙面上で思う存分「ウガヤの言っていることはウソです、なぜなら××」と意見を述べればいい。ぼくもまたどこかの媒体で反論します。これこそが正統な「言論」でありませんか。それこそが正当な出版社のすべきことではありませんか。
意見が違うものは高額の恫喝訴訟で黙らせる、というのは民事司法を使った暴力に近い。
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
みなさん。ぼくはずぼらなので「運動」とか「闘争」とか「たたかい」とかとは縁遠い人間ですが、この訴訟はいくらなんでもひどすぎる。あまりに露骨な言論妨害だ。言論・表現の自由という基本的人権を蹂躙している（それも音楽という表現世界で商売をしている企業が！）。
もしこの種の恫喝訴訟がまかり通るようになれば、フリー記者には（いや、あるいは社員記者もできなくなるかも）企業批判はまったくできなくなります。
いやそれどころか、雑誌の求めに応じてコメントひとつしても、5000万円なのですよ。コメントすらできないではありませんか。
そんな時代が来てほしいですか？ぼくはいやです。
これが言論の自由へのテロでなくて何でしょう。民主主義の破壊でなくて何でしょう。これは体を張ってでも阻止せねばなりません。
というわけで、みなさん。長々とすみません。お忙しいところ本当に恐縮ですが、どうかお知恵とお力を貸してください。ご希望の方には訴状そのほか資料をお届けします。
どうか無視しないでください。助けてください。ぼくも２，3日前まではこんな話は（けしからんことに）他人事だと思っていたのです。でも、こんな恐ろしいことが、いつ、どこでみなさんの上に厄災として降りかかるかわからない時代になってきたようです。
長文失礼しました。ご静聴に感謝します。
メールには烏賀陽さんが実際に書いた記事が添付されており俺も読ませてもらった。一読したときの正直な感想として「こんな記事（しかもコメント）で、訴えられるのか!?」というものだった。下記に該当部分を引用する。
" 初登場 第１ 位 " は上げ底か !?
ジャニーズは超VIP 待遇!?
事務所とオリコンの蜜月関係
文／編集 部
約30年にわたって人気を維持し続けているジャニーズ事務所。だが、その人気は、巧みなメディア操作にあるという。特にオリコンのランキングについては、こんな疑惑がつきまとっている……。
右ページのヲリキ座談会でも言及されているように、強気な交渉で、テレビ界でのライバル蹴落としに成功してきたジャニーズ事務所。また、雑誌メディアにおいては、アイドル誌は言うに及ばず、「抱かれたい男ランキング」で木村拓哉が毎年１位を獲得する「anan」（マガジンハウス）など女性誌との蜜月関係も有名だ。
さらにある疑惑が囁かれているのが、オリコンとの関係である。ジャニーズタレントの新曲は、発売されるたびに上位にランキングされるが、実際の売り上げと、かなりの乖離があるのではないかというのが、通説である（オリコン側は、この事実を否定）。
『 Jポップとは何か』（岩波新書）『Jポップの心象風景』（文春新書）などの著者・烏賀陽弘道氏は、「日本には、長くオリコンしかヒットチャートが存在しなかったため、その統計学的な正確さが過大評価されがちです。まず第一に、オリコンは予約枚数もカウントに入れている。予約だけ入れておいて後で解約するカラ予約が入っている可能性が高いのです。『オリコン初登場１位』などという文言は、その後の宣伝に使えます。『オリコンの数字はある程度操作が可能だ』というレコード会社員の話も複数聞いたことがあります。そもそもオリコンは不思議な団体で、『オリコン独自の統計手法だ』と言い張ってその方法をほとんど明らかにしないんですよ。ふつうの統計調査は、その手法を細かく公開して、その信憑性に疑問が挟む余地がないことを強調するのが当たり前です。それをしないで公開されたデータは、統計学的な信用度が低いと自分で言っているようなものです」と語る。
試しに、06年2月の、オリコンチャートとPOSデータで集計を取っているサウンドスキャンを例に、ジャニーズタレントの週刊ランキングを比較してみた。2月7-13日の週では、タッキー＆翼の「VENUS」（週間販売枚数45954枚）は、オリコンシングルチャート２位だが、2月6-12日週のサウンドスキャンでは、15位（週間販売枚数13573枚）とふるわない。そのほか、TOKIO「Mr.Traveling Man」の順位もそれぞれ、オリコン初登場第１位（2月14-20日）、サウンドスキャン第31位（2月13-19日）と、大きく異なる。確かに他の所属事務所のアーティストと比較して順位に差があるようだ。
ジャニーズ事務所は、メディアの評価を作為的に高めることで、「ジャニーズタレント＝売れている」というイメージを周到に用意しているようにみえる。このような刷り込み戦略の成功が、長きにわたって人気を維持してきた秘訣かもしれない。ただ、気になる点といえば、ジャニーズと蜜月関係にあるメディアがオールドメディア化しつつある点だ。同事務所のネット嫌いは周知の事実だし、「『ディスクの売り上げ枚数＝人気の指標』という常識は終わりつつあります。音楽を運ぶメディアがディスクからネットに大幅に移行し始めているため、着メロや通信カラオケ、ダウンロード販売といった数を見なければ、本当の意味での人気はわからなくなってきている」（烏賀陽氏）という指摘も耳にする。ジャニーズの凋落がはじまるのか、更なる栄華を築き上げるのか、今後の成り行きに注視していきたい。
とまあこんな感じ 。
この恫喝めいた個人（烏賀陽さん）宛の提訴にはいくつかのポイントがある。
●記事内のコメント主に責任はあるのか
烏賀陽さんが挙げたポイント（１）と重なるが、この提訴でまずおかしいのは、なぜオリコン側が「烏賀陽さん個人」を訴訟対象にして、この記事が掲載されている雑誌『サイゾー』を発行する「インフォバーン社」を訴訟対象にしなかったのかということ。この記事の文責は「サイゾー編集部」であり、烏賀陽さんはあくまで編集部からコメントを求められてコメントしただけなのだ。烏賀陽さん自身のコメントにもあるが、たいていの場合識者のコメントが中に挿入される記事というのは、基本的にその記事の書き手が事前にある程度の「ストーリー」を作り、そのストーリーに合致した部分を「識者のコメント」（この場合烏賀陽さんからもらった電話コメント）から抜き出して適宜編集し、コメントとして文中に入れ、その文章に客観的な説得力を持たせるというフォーマットで作られることが多い。つまり、オリコン側が主張するようにこの記事によってオリコンに対して何らかのネガティブなイメージが読者にもたらされるとするならば、真っ先にその対象とすべきなのは記事全体の筆者（この場合はサイゾー編集部）であり、訴訟対象とすべきなのはサイゾーを発行しているインフォバーン社だろう。
いわゆる識者コメントというのはとても難しい。俺自身これまで識者からコメントをもらって記事を書いてきたことも多いし、今では自分がこうしたメディアに対してコメントをするということもやっている。どちらの経験もある立場から１つ言えることは、よほどひどい内容（あるいは過激で政治的な主張）でない限り、コメント主に対して責任を負わせるというのは、あまりにも乱暴な方法でないかということだ。
先ほど、地の文を書く筆者が 「ストーリー」を作り、そこにコメントを当てはめていくと書いたが、もちろん全ての記事がそのようなやり方で作られるわけではない。純粋に取材をして、取材をした人の話の内容を踏まえて全体のストーリーを決めることもあるし、事前に取材先に内容を精査してもらって事実関係や発言の趣旨などが変わらないかチェックしてもらうこともある。だが、文字数に制約がないネット媒体と異なり、紙媒体は限られた文字数の中でコメントのエッセンスを圧縮して盛り込まなければならない。端的にいえば、「○○は△△という事情が背景にあり、本当は□□ならば良いんだけど、結果的に××になっている」というコメントをしたときに「○○は△△なので、××だ」と、細かい背景説明などが省かれてしまうことがあるのだ。実際、自分が取材を受けてコメントするときの経験でいえば、１時間しゃべったことが細かいディテールを全部抜き取られて数行のコメントに圧縮されてしまうこともある。そういうとき、内容に間違いはなくてもその記事を読んだ人には俺の言いたいことのせいぜい２〜３割しか伝わらないなぁとも思ってしまう。だが、実際に自分が誰かにコメントを求めて記事を書くときは文字数の制約がある以上、同じようにコメントを圧縮しなければならないわけで、コメントを取って記事にするライター・記者の苦労も十分わかる。だから完全に自分の意図した形のコメントにならなくてもある程度は妥協して、「自分の言いたいことを全部入れなければ、コメントの許可は出さない」というような無茶は言わないようにしている（そのかわり、幸いに俺は自分のメディアを持っているので、意図が十分に伝わらないコメントになった場合は、真意をこのサイトに書くようにしているが）。
また、媒体によってコメントの事前確認をさせないところもある。大体新聞や新聞系の出版社は、社の方針として、ゲラをコメント主に見せないようにしており、そうなるとさらに厄介だ。出版されてみると自分の意図とは正反対の（とまではいかなくても本来の意図とはかなり違った）趣旨のコメントが、あたかも自分が言ったように書かれてしまうことがあるからだ。このあたりも確かに難しい問題なのである。
自分がライターとしていろいろなメーカーを取材したときの経験では、大体メーカーの広報は記事の事前確認を求めてくる。そして、記事のゲラを彼らにFAXすると、彼らにとってちょっとでも都合の悪い部分はたいていの場合すべて削除され、別の表現に直されて返ってくる。報道被害の問題を考慮すれば、記事に重大な事実誤認が含まれるような場合、問題が大きいということはわかる。だから、「事実誤認があるかどうかの確認」であればゲラを出すこと自体は俺は問題ないと思っている。しかし、現実はそうならない。広告記事であればクライアントが表現に口を出してくるのも当然だが、メディアはあくまでメディアとして責任を持って情報を発信しなければならない。新聞系のメディアが事前確認をさせないのは彼らに「表現の自由を守るため」というお題目があり、そしてそこに一定の正当性はある。ただ、現実にメディアの現場を見ると事前確認をさせないことによって起きる弊害も多いし、表現の自由が単なる「建前」になっているという点も否定はしないが。
話が長くなってしまったが、俺が言いたいのは、従来の紙媒体が今までのやり方を続ける以上、記事内の著者に過分な「責任」を負わせるのは酷だ、ということだ。
しかも、今回の記事の場合烏賀陽さんはコメント内で直接オリコンを腐しているわけではない。あくまで彼が取材した（彼が責任を持って調べ、ある程度客観性が担保されるはずの）「事実」をコメントとして言っているに過ぎないからだ。
大体、記事全体の 「ストーリー」を読めば、ジャニーズとオリコンが癒着関係にある（かもしれない）ことを読者に想起させ、それを面白おかしく煽ろうとしているのはサイゾー編集部が作った「地の文」である。特にオリコンチャートとサウンドスキャンのデータを比較しているところは、単に集計方法の「誤差」の範囲内で収まるところをあえて面白おかしくかき立てているようにも見える。
オリコンが今どういう方法でランキングを集計しているのかは俺も細かくは知らないが（何しろ調査店に関する質問は「下記（調査協力店一覧）記載内容以上の詳細についてはお答えできませんのでご了承ください」として、具体的な集計方法を公開してないからね）、音楽業界内で言われているのは「出荷枚数と消化率から売り上げを推計している」ということだ。これに対し、プラネットやサウンドスキャンは実売ベースのランキングと言われている。出荷ベースのオリコンと、実売ベースのプラネット・サウンドスキャンでは特に初動枚数に大きな違いが出ると言われており、その意味ではこの記事の
試しに、06年2月の、オリコンチャートとPOSデータで集計を取っているサウンドスキャンを例に、ジャニーズタレントの週刊ランキングを比較してみた。2月7-13日の週では、タッキー＆翼の「VENUS」（週間販売枚数45954枚）は、オリコンシングルチャート２位だが、2月6-12日週のサウンドスキャンでは、15位（週間販売枚数13573枚）とふるわない。そのほか、TOKIO「Mr.Traveling Man」の順位もそれぞれ、オリコン初登場第１位（2月14-20日）、サウンドスキャン第31位（2月13-19日）と、大きく異なる。確かに他の所属事務所のアーティストと比較して順位に差があるようだ。
という部分は、説得力に欠けるように思える。この記事に説得力を持たせたいのなら、サイゾー編集部は、同じ時期に発売された「ジャニーズ以外」のアーティストのオリコンとサウンドスキャンの「違い」を検証し、それらのアーティストよりもジャニーズが「優遇」されていることを客観的なデータとして出すべきだった。その点は俺も（烏賀陽さんではなく）サイゾー編集部の落ち度だったと思う。
いずれにせよ、この記事に対してオリコンが「事実無根のイメージ誘導だ」というなら、自分たちがどのようにランキングを集計しているのかクリアにして、その結果いかにこのサイゾーの記事が間違っているかを説明し、烏賀陽さんではなくインフォバーン社に記事内容の訂正と謝罪を求めれば済む話である。それをなぜ烏賀陽さん個人なのか。そして5000万円という途方もない金額の根拠は一体どこにあるのか、オリコンにはきちんと説明する責任がある。
あのJASRACですら、昨年9月に発売された「週刊ダイヤモンド
9/17号」における「〈企業レポート〉日本音楽著作権協会（ジャスラック）/使用料1000億円の巨大利権
音楽を食い物にする呆れた実態」という記事（→PDF、→画像１、→画像２）に対して、すぐさま怒ってその後訴訟を起こしているけど、あくまで被告は資本力のあるダイヤモンド社と記事執筆者であるダイヤモンド社の社員だ。そんな訴訟起こして裁判費用ムダにかけるくらいなら、メディア使ってデータ出して反論して、その分きちんと会員アーティストへの還元額を増やせよと思わなくもないが、少なくともJASRACはきちんとその記事の発行元であるダイヤモンド社と記事の文責がある記者を対象に訴訟をしており、記事内でコメントしているジャズ喫茶の店主や玉木宏樹氏を訴えているわけではない（スワンとの訴訟は別にあるという話はややこしくなるので、ここではとりあえず置いておく）。JASRACだってこういうときの「最低限の仁義」は踏まえているのだ。
●チャート操作について
オリコンが出荷ベースの推計ランキングである以上、それはある程度「操作可能」であるというのは客観的事実として明白だ。一時的にランキングを上げたければ「多く出荷して、集計対象店で大量購入する」ことで、（ある程度は）ランキングを上げることが「システム上」可能だからだ。これはオリコンがある種前時代的なアナログ的なシステムを使っている（少なくとも以前はそうだったわけで、今は違うというのならそれをきちんとオリコンがオープンにすればいい話だ）ことから起きるセキュリティホールのようなもので、オリコンは別に「不正」に関わらなくてもこの抜け道をそのままの形で残しておくだけで良いのである。これが残っていることで探偵ファイルに掲載されたこの記事のような手段を使って、レコード会社は自腹でランキングを上げることができるからだ。もっとも探偵ファイルのこの記事は“あらゆるレコード店を巡回し、その店ごとに同一のＣＤを大量に買い込む”ことを「違法行為」と断言しており、あたかもレコード会社とオリコンがグルになって消費者を騙しているかのようなイメージ操作を行っている。サイゾーの記事なんぞより、よほどこっちの方が（オリコンやレコード会社にとっては）悪質だし、烏賀陽さん訴えるならそれより先に探偵ファイル（探偵ファイル特捜班）を訴えるべきであろう。
ちなみに俺は上の記事に対して違法行為というなら具体的に法律に違反しているのか書けばいいのにねというエントリを書いたし、チャートが「メディア」としての性質を持っている以上、そこにコンテンツ企業がお金を投じて「プロモーション」を行うこと自体は否定されるべきではない、という考え方だ。もっとも烏賀陽さんが記事でコメントしている通り、今は「ディスクの売り上げ枚数＝人気の指標」ではなくなりつつある、とも思うが。
さて、記事中の烏賀陽さんのコメント
『オリコンの数字はある程度操作が可能だ』というレコード会社員の話も複数聞いたことがあります。
についてだが、これは俺も複数のレコード会社員、小売店、その他音楽業界関係者から同じ趣旨の話を聞いたことがある。また、Wikipediaの「オリコン」の項目を見てみると、こんなことも書かれている。
● POS システ ム
集計方法は、あらかじめ決められた販売店から売り上げデータを受け取るもの。[1]以前はFAXなどに頼っていたが、販売店にPOSシステムが普及したこともあり、最近ではPOSの売り上げデータによってデイリーチャートを集計している。対象となる販売店は、ここ数年でAmazon.co.jpなどのオンライン店舗も一部は対象には入っているが、それらに含まれない特殊なルートでの販売しかない楽曲にはオリコンチャートにランクインしないものもある。例としては、NEWSのデビューシングル『NEWSニッポン』はセブン-イレブン限定販売だったため、オリコンチャートにランクインしなかった。また、DVDの面では、代表的な例は「水曜どうでしょうDVD全集」があげられる。
特殊ルートでの販売のオリコンランクインを認める以前ではオリコン上位にランクインしていたが、ローソンやオンラインショップのみの販売ルートなので、この方式がとられてから販売されたDVDは週売り上げ1位にもかかわらず、オリコンには掲載されなかった。（「幻の1位」としてあげられることが多い。）
●累計売り上げ枚 数
オリコンチャートによる累計売り上げ枚数と称されるものは、チャート圏内（CDの場合、かつては週刊チャート100位以内、2002年12月以降はシングルは週刊チャート200位以内、アルバムは週刊チャート300位以内）の売り上げのみを単純に加算したものであり、圏外に落ちてからの売り上げは含まれていない。（同業他社のプラネット・サウンドスキャン等は一週間に1枚の売り上げでも累計売り上げ枚数に加算される）また、レンタル店の購入分や特殊なルートでの販売はランキングに加算されないため、売り上げの実数よりは少ない数値になる。特に、演歌・アニメソングや、「定番」と称される名盤アルバムなどは、チャート圏外やオリコンの集計対象外の店での売り上げが多いため、実数からはかけ離れた数値になると考えられる。
●赤丸
オリコンチャートでは、初登場や売り上げが伸びている曲を赤字で表記し、「赤丸急上昇」と呼ぶ。これらはチャート順位の浮き沈みで付けられているのではなく、前週よりも多くの枚数を売り上げを上げた作品に付けられるもので、ごく稀にチャート順位が下がっているにもかかわらずこの現象が起きることがある。
●影響度
音楽チャート業界では、プラネット・サウンドスキャンといった同業他社がいるものの、オリコンチャートの影響力は絶大であり、アメリカのビルボード誌と同様、音楽界での評価指標として真っ先に用いられる。
オリコンチャートでは総売り上げよりも初登場順位ばかりが強調されがちであり、レコード会社もそれを承知で発売1週目により多くの売り上げを稼ごうとする。そのため、基本的にチャートは急激な右肩下がりとなる傾向がある（近年、この傾向は特に如実に現れている）。逆に、チャートの下がり幅が小さいか、1週目の順位が低くても2週目以降のランキングがアップするアーティストは着実にファンを獲得していく傾向があり、その実力は後々になって受け入れられる。また、一部の人気低枠アーティストに対してはスタッフがわざわざ集計対象店に出向き、大量にCDを買い付けるサクラのようなものも実際にはいるとされ、一部で恣意的なチャート操作が行われているとも言われる。
また、音楽業界からの圧力で 「 KinKi Kids、B'zには必ず1位を取らせなければいけない」とも言われており、事実、この2グループが直接対決を行ったことは今までに一度も無い。
ということだ 。Wikipediaなので信頼性がどれだけあるのかという議論はあるだろうが、この際Wikipediaの信頼性とかはどうでもいい話なのである。重要なのはこういう記述に代表されるように、ある程度音楽業界に明るい人間からすれば「オリコンチャートが現実の売り上げと乖離している部分があり、ランキング操作が行われている」ということが「常識」的な空気として作られていることなのだ。このことをオリコンはきちんと自覚した方が良い。自覚した上でオリコンがすべきことは、真っ当に仕事をしている個人のジャーナリストに資本力を背景とした嫌がらせのような訴訟を起こすことではなく、自分たちが持っている「チャート」という強大なメディアの信頼性をいかにオープンなやり方で高めて、音楽業界と音楽リスナーにメディアとしての有効性を提示するか、ではないか。
オリコンが音楽配信に乗り出すというニュースが出たとき、いろいろなところに取材したが、取材を離れたところでのレコード会社員から返ってきた反応は概ね「なんで、公正なチャートを提供する、ある種中立的な立場でなきゃいけないはずのオリコンが、自分たちで配信始めるんだろうね。それって初めから『配信のチャートは操作可能』って言ってるようなものじゃん」というものだった。
別に俺はオリコンに何の恨みがあるわけでもないし、前述した通りチャートが「メディア」である以上、ある程度のアナログ的な「操作」が入り込む余地があることは仕方ないとも思っている（データの客観性や信頼性でいったら、テレビ視聴率なんてどうなるんだって話だよ。それに比べりゃオリコンチャートなんて全然まともだ）。
だけど、言論を金や力で封殺するような今回のオリコンのやり方には強い抵抗を覚える。俺だってこのように実名でいろいろなメディアに好き勝手（本当は好き勝手なんて書けないけどな！）いろいろ書いている以上、無関係じゃない。もしかしたら来週には俺のところにもオリコンから訴状が届くかもしれない。
オリコン自体がこの訴訟にノリノリというわけじゃなく、もしかしたら裏で手を回しているのは記事中でもう１つの揶揄対象になっていたジャニーズ事務所なのかもしれない。しかし、そんな細かいことはどうでもいい。間違いなく言えることは、こういう訴訟がまかりとおるようになったら、音楽業界に「ジャーナリズム」とか「自浄作用」なんてものは今後一切生まれない、ということだ。
俺ら個人のジャーナリストが潰されたあとは、次に来るのはネット規制に決まってる。こういう流れが加速すれば、プロバイダー制限責任法も改悪され、ネットから匿名性は奪われ、著作権侵害は非親告罪化され、著作物のダウンロードは違法化され、権力と金を持っているところに楯突く存在は、こういう形で抹殺されるだろう。
だから、このエントリを読んでくれた人は「なんか音楽業界とか出版業界で揉めてるんだね」とかそういう意識じゃなくて、現実の自分たちの生活に関わってくる問題として捉えて欲しい。もう対岸の火事じゃないんだよ。力を持っている連中が自分たちの都合の悪いことをシステマティックに潰せる仕組みができあがりつつあるんだから。そうなったらもう左とか右とか、関係ないよ。
烏賀陽さんはメールの冒頭で「みなさんのお知恵、お力を貸してください。記事にしてください。ブログに書いてください。ウエブサイトに載せてください。メールを転送してください。言いふらしてください」と書いた。
みんなができることは簡単だ。このことをリアルの社会で話のネタにしたり、ふざけるなと憤ってネット上で「今こんなことが起きているんだよ」と広めてくれるだけでいい。それが大きなうねりになれば、オリコンだって態度を軟化させざるを得なくなる。
ネットなんて現実社会を動かせない？ そんなことないよ。輸入盤の問題のときだって法案は通ってしまったけど、あそこであれだけ大きな動きになったから今歯止めが効いている部分だってあるし、電気用品安全法だってあのネットの動きがなかったら、今はもっと現場は混乱していたかもしれない。
今はまだ小さな力でしかないかもしれないけど、ネットが持つ潜在的な力を理解したからこそ、既存のメディアの連中が今焦って、そういう力をスポイルさせようとしている。そういう彼らの焦りは、メディア業界に片足突っ込んでいる俺は本当によくわかる。
あんま大仰な話で煽るのは好きじゃないし、柄でもないけど、この訴訟は本当に許せなかったし、やりきれない思いになった。オリコンは「出版社」という「言論メディア」の性格を持っているんだよ？
だったらサイゾーと烏賀陽さんが提起した「言論」に対しては少なくとも最初は「言論」で対抗してくださいよ。それが最低限の「仁義」だろうし、メディアとして当然持たなきゃいけないプライドじゃねーのか？
とにかく俺は俺でこの問題に対していろいろ動きます。烏賀陽さんを支援できる立場にある人、憤りを感じた人はぜひ協力してください。よろしくお願いします。

訴状を読むと確かにサイゾー編集部に届いているものの、訴えているのは烏賀陽さん個人になっていますね。
サイゾー編集部にも問い合わせたところ、この訴状が届いていることが間違いないということがわかりました。追ってサイゾー編集部から正式なコメントをいただくことになっています。
なお、烏賀陽さんはこの訴訟の当事者であるため、自発的な発言が非常に難しい（微妙な）状況に置かれております。この訴訟に関する発言が少ないことに関しては、そのような事情があることをご理解ください。
さらにいえば、烏賀陽さんは第１回期日（来年１月４日）までに答弁書を作成し、裁判所に提出しなければなりません。それをしなければオリコン（原告）の主張が認められてしまうからです。この訴訟に関する（現時点での）彼の発言が少ないことに関しては、そのような事情があることをご理解ください。
烏賀陽さんの年末年始はこの答弁書の作成に追われることになってしまうでしょう（しかも高額の着手金を自腹で弁護士に支払って、です）。ライター・ジャーナリストにとって死ぬほど忙しいこの時期を狙い打ちし、本来はゆっくり落ち着くための年末年始を潰し、精神的に追いつめるようなオリコンのやり口は個人的に到底許すことはできません。本当に憤懣やるかたない思いでいっぱいです。
（追記３ ）
オリコンのサイトに事実誤認に基づく弊社への名誉毀損についてというプレスリリースが掲載されています。内容については訴状とあわせて各自ご判断ください。
いずれにせよ、この問題、来年初頭には司法の場で「事実誤認」があったかどうかが争われることになるわけです。僕は烏賀陽さんを応援しようと思っています。

BOSTON , April 4
Â Massachusetts is poised to become the first state to provide nearly universal health care coverage after the state legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill today that Gov. Mitt Romney says he will sign .
The bill does what health experts say no other state has yet been able to do : provide a mechanism for all of its citizens to obtain health insurance .
It accomplishes that in a way that experts say combines several different methods and proposals from across the political spectrum , apportioning the cost among businesses , individuals and the government .
" This is probably about as close as you can get to universal , " said Paul Ginsburg , an economist who is president of the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change in Washington .
" It 's definitely going to be inspiring to other states about how there was this compromise .
They found a way to get to a major expansion of coverage that people could agree on .
For a conservative Republican , this is individual responsibility .
For a Democrat , this is government helping those that need help . "
The bill , which resulted after months of wrangling between legislators and the governor , requires all Massachusetts residents to obtain health coverage by July 1 , 2007 .

Teaching a new dog old tricks
Linux distributor Terra Soft has announced that its Yellow Dog Linux 5.0 ( YDL ) product will run on the Playstation 3 .
Derived from Fedora Core 5 , YDL is a complete Linux distribution optimized for the PPC architecture .
The upcoming YDL 5.0 release will feature " a simple installer [ that ] enables absolutely anyone to install without instruction " and the Enlightenment e17 desktop environment " in order to provide an unprecedented level of function and interface aesthetic . "
YDL 5.0 for the PS3 is scheduled for release next month , and a version for Apple 's old PowerPC hardware will be released later this year .
This past May , we reported on comments made at E3 by Sony manager Izumi Kawanishi , who revealed that a Linux distribution and various developer tools would probably be available for the PS3 .
Terra Soft 's YDL 5.0 distribution , which will ship with GCC 4 and the Cell SDK in addition to a broad assortment of common open source desktop applications , could potentially facilitate the emergence of a homebrew PS3 development community and bring a lot of extra value to Sony 's next - gen console .
That said , there is plenty of room for skepticism given the limitations of the old PS2 Linux environment , the high cost of the PS3 itself , the depressingly limited availability of the Playstation 3 at launch , and the experimental nature of e17 .
An intrepid entrepreneur and one of the earliest pioneers of Linux on the PowerPC platform , Terra Soft CEO Kai Staats possesses a unique perspective on the relationship between people and technology , which undoubtedly inspires his company 's creative and unconventional approach to Linux .
We discussed YDL 5.0 with Staats , who answered our questions and provided some insightful commentary about e17 and the potential of the PS3 as a multimedia platform .
In light of the PS3's poor reception from the press and the gaming community , one immediately wonders why Terra Soft would work with Sony rather than Microsoft or Nintendo .
Staats says that the PS3 " looks and feels like a real computer , " and explains that " it is important to understand that the Xbox and Nintendo are not designed to be personal computers , the PS3 is . "
What about the XBox 360 ?
Staats " contacted the Microsoft ' Linux Lab ' a few months ago , just to see what they might say , " and received no response .
In the past , the open source software community has reverse - engineered proprietary gaming platforms with varying degrees of success in order to facilitate homebrew development .
One wonders how YDL 5.0 compares to the various unauthorized Linux console platform ports that have emerged over the years .
Unlike homebrew Linux solutions , Staats points out that " YDL 5.0 for the PS3 is not a hack , " and argues that it is " the most complete , thoroughly tested , professional Linux distribution for the Power architecture . "
Staats feels that Terra Soft 's relationship with Sony has facilitated development of a well - integrated product : " Our work with Sony has granted us a unique opportunity to have in our possession beta PlayStation units ( the same that the game developers have used ) in order to work closely with the system to ensure a high quality end - user experience , from bootloader to halt , from installation to playing CDs and configuring the desktop . "
Will the high price of the PS3 deter interested users ?
It certainly deters me .
Staats believes that the PS3 will provide a do - all set - top box , and he shared his own plans to incorporate one into his personal home theater : " I cannot emphasize enough that the PS3 is designed for Linux and [ is ] far more than a game box , " he said .
" Personally , I plan to remove my home DVD and CD decks and use instead a PS3 attached with my home theater for DVD , CD , MP3 , and home computer attached to a 5:1 14 speaker system with HD LCD .
Elegant , simple , and powerful . "
The capacity of the PS3's powerful hardware to serve as a fully - functional Linux PC is a point that Staats also emphasizes when responding to critics that point out the limitations of Linux on the PS2 .

The memo was finished one day after President Bush interviewed Robert M. Gates , the president of Texas A&M University , as a potential successor to Mr. Rumsfeld and one day before the midterm elections .
By then it was clear that the Republicans appeared likely to suffer a setback at the polls and that the administration was poised to begin reconsidering its Iraq strategy .
The memo provides no indication that Mr. Rumsfeld intended to leave his Pentagon post .
It is unclear whether he knew at that point that he was about to be replaced , though the White House has said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld had a number of conversations on the matter .
Told that The New York Times had obtained a copy of it , a Pentagon spokesman , Eric Ruff , confirmed its authenticity .
“ As it became clear that people were considering options for the way forward , the secretary had some views on the subject , and this memo reflects those views , ” he said .
At the Pentagon , Mr. Rumsfeld has been famous for his “ snowflakes ” — memos that drift down to the bureaucracy from on high and that are used to ask questions , stimulate debate and shape policy .
Mr. Rumsfeld ’s Nov. 6 memorandum , circulated as part of the administration ’s review of Iraq policy , is written in that spirit and with the same blunt aphorisms that Mr. Rumsfeld frequently uses in public .
Unlike the lawyerly memo on Iraq policy submitted Nov. 8 by Stephen J. Hadley , the national security adviser , Mr. Rumsfeld ’s listed more than a dozen “ illustrative options ” that the defense secretary did not endorse , but suggested merited serious consideration .
“ Many of these options could , and in a number of cases , should be done in combination with others , ” Mr. Rumsfeld advised .
With Mr. Rumsfeld ’s resignation , the options no longer have the same weight .
In recent weeks , some have been discarded as the Bush administration tries to adjust its military and political strategy in Iraq .
But others , like increasing the number of advisers attached to Iraqi forces , live on and have also been recommended by others .
Mr. Rumsfeld , who has presided over two wars and is one of the longest - serving Pentagon chiefs , is scheduled to leave when his designated successor , Mr. Gates , is confirmed by the Senate , expected later this month .
" Does this dress make me look fat ? "
People lie to you every day .
And it ’s most likely your own fault .
" Hi , welcome to our store .
Can I help you ? "
" So , tell me , what problems does your company face ? "
" Why did n’t your VC firm fund us ? "
" Can you please blurb my book ? "
" When do you think you will be ready to invest in this solution ? "
" How am I doing ? "
" So , when does the next budget cycle begin ? "
" Do you like this product ? "
" Would you recommend us to a friend ? "
" Did you pack your own luggage ? "
Every question represents a choice for the person you are asking .
She can choose to take a risk and tell you truth , or she can dissemble , fib or outright lie , and save your feelings or avoid an awkward situation .
The way you ask the question , then , matters .
The easy answer to , " Can I help you ? " is , " I ’m just looking . "
On the other hand , the easy answer to , " Do you want to see what ’s on sale ? " is , " yes . "
Most of the time , we ask questions hoping for lies .
It ’s easier that way .
But what if you really want to know ?
( and you should ) .
" What is the best thing about our product ?
The worst ? "
" Now that you ’ve read our business plan , if you could change one thing about it , what would it be ? "
" Who ’s the weakest person on our team , do you think ? "
The thing is , once you get someone to tell you tell you the truth , you have no right to argue with them .
Punishing someone for giving you honest feedback just guarantees that they ’ll never do it again .
And when was the last time you persuaded someone they were wrong about their opinion ?

Do We Have Inflation ?
Barron 's jumps on the " We Have Inflation " bandwagon this week , with two editorials acknowledging what Big Picture readers have long known : Inflation , undermeasured by the BLS , is robust and widespread throughout the economy .
Mike Santoli ( subbing for Alan Abelson ) addresses the subject in the front of the weekly :
" THE COST OF AMERICA'S PASTIMES KEEPS RISING .
This is not just a reference to the persistent escalation of prices for Major League Baseball tickets this season , which are up 5.4 % on average from 2005 , a rate of increase well ahead of that reflected in government - sanctioned inflation data .
The trend in baseball tickets , incidentally , follows a broader pattern in today 's economy .
Namely , the things that we need -- gasoline , coal , health insurance , tickets for the Red Sox and Yankees -- are high and getting more expensive , while things we could easily do without -- a third flat - screen TV , another Chevy Tahoe to replace the one GM gave us in ' 04 , fast - food burgers , box seats to a Royals game -- are relatively cheap or dropping in price .
No , other pastimes are feeling the cost squeeze as well .
A Nascar race car gets around four to six miles per gallon , about the same as the Class A RVs that so many race fans pilot to follow the circuit around the country all summer .
With gasoline prices at retail up 18 % from a year earlier and climbing toward the $ 3 - a - gallon level reached last fall , this is becoming an increasingly pricey hobby .
Note , not coincidentally , that nationwide registrations of motor homes fell 26 % in January from a year earlier .
Perhaps it 's only a matter of time before the rocketing prices of aluminum ( up 40 % since September to an 18 - year high ) and titanium ( which quadrupled in price last year ) make it much more expensive for weekend warriors on baseball fields and golf courses to buy a new weapon to swing .
Arguably the most broadly pursued pastime in the country that 's becoming pricier is borrowing money , specifically borrowing to buy houses .
With the bearish turn in the Treasury market driving the 10 - year note yield above 5 % last week , near a four - year high , Freddie Mac 's benchmark 30 - year fixed - mortgage rate rose to just below 6.5 % . " ( emphasis added )
Weighing in from the paper 's end pages : Thomas Donlan ( Do We Have Inflation ? ) , who admonishes investors to be " keenly aware of inflation , and of the various methods for calculating it . "
That means understanding the oddities and permutations that go into the perenial under- measurement of inflation :
" The mathematicians at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics seemed to confirm the homeowners ' intuition :
The index most used to measure the rise of consumer prices ( Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ) was up 3.4 % in 2005 , and the price of shelter , whether rented or incorporated in the price of a home , was up 2.6 % .
The appreciation of homes as investment assets was over 20 % in some places .
But investment is n't consumption , and so investment assets are n't recognized in the CPI .
The statisticians confirmed that homeowners were wealthier , but only by definition .
Even within the realm of consumer goods and services , prices often respond to supply and demand more strongly than to the price of money .
Gasoline was another hot topic last year .
The price was up 50 % between September 2004 and September 2005 .
Since gasoline is a commodity that almost every American buys every week at a price that 's clearly advertised in front of every gas station , many Americans use it as a simple proxy for the cost of living .
Such people had the feeling last year that inflation was rising fast . "
We 've discussed all too many times that CPI fails to adequately capture the perniciousness of rising prices as they are experienced by consumer and corporations alike .
Donlan observes
" Like it or not , we are stuck with measuring inflation by measuring prices .
But we must understand that the measurements are made with a rubber yardstick . "
Ironic .
Just as inflation -- and the absurdity of the CPI -- is finally get the ink it deserves , the acceleration in inflation has begun cooling off .
Oh , we still have inflation , only its not getting worse at a faster clip anymore .

I 'm not sure that we have to argue mis-measurement rather than being mis-read .
Have you looked at the YOY % changes in both CPI and PPI ?
Looks pretty inflationary and accelerating too me !
Also note PPI > CPI implies severe profit pressures leading to much lower earnings .

The US can not do this ?
What on earth does he mean ?
At first sight his contention seems plain wrong .
While Israel intends to sustain its occupation of Palestinian territory , a wider settlement is impossible .
It surely follows that the country that has the greatest potential leverage over Israel is the country with the greatest power to broker peace .
Israel 's foreign policy and military strategy is dependent on the approval of the United States .
Though Israel ranks 23rd on the global development index - above Greece , Singapore , Portugal and Brunei - it remains the world 's largest recipient of US aid .
The US government dispensed $ 11bn of civil foreign assistance in 2004 .
Of this , Israel received $ 555 m ; the three poorest nations on earth - Burkina Faso , Sierra Leone and Niger - were given a total of $ 69 m .
More importantly , last year Israel also received $ 2.2 bn of military aid .
It does not depend economically on this assistance .
Its gross domestic product amounts to $ 155bn , and its military budget to $ 9.5 bn .
It manufactures many of its own weapons and buys components from all over the world , including - as the Guardian revealed last week - the United Kingdom .
Rather , it depends upon it diplomatically .
Most of the money given by the US foreign military financing programme - in common with all US aid disbursements - is spent in the United States .
Israel uses it to obtain F - 15 and F - 16 jets ; Apache , Cobra and Blackhawk helicopters ; AGM , AIM and Patriot missiles , M - 16 rifles , M - 204 grenade launchers and M - 2 machine guns .
As the Prestwick scandal revealed , laser - guided bombs , even now , are being sent to Israel from the United States .
Many of these weapons have been used to kill Palestinian civilians and are being used in Lebanon today .
The US arms export control act states that " no defence article or defence service shall be sold or leased by the United States government " unless its provision " will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace " .
Weapons may be sold " to friendly countries solely for internal security , for legitimate self - defence [ or for ] maintaining or restoring international peace and security " .
By giving these weapons to Israel , the US government is , in effect , stating that all its military actions are being pursued in the cause of legitimate self - defence , American interests and world peace .
The US also becomes morally complicit in Israel 's murder of civilians .
The diplomatic cover this provides is indispensable .
Since 1972 the US has used its veto in the UN security council on 40 occasions to prevent the passage of resolutions that sought either to defend the rights of the Palestinians or to condemn the excesses of Israel 's government .
This is a greater number of vetoes than all the other permanent members have deployed in the same period .
The most recent instance , on July 13 , was the squashing of a motion condemning both the Israeli assault on Gaza and the firing of rockets and abduction of an Israeli soldier by Palestinian groups .
Over the past few days , the United States , supported by Britain , has blocked all international attempts to introduce an immediate ceasefire , giving Israel the clear impression that it has a mandate to continue its assault on Lebanon .
It is plain to anyone - and this must include Paddy Ashdown - that Israel could not behave as it does without the diplomatic protection of the United States .
If the US government announced that it would cease to offer military and diplomatic support if Israel refused to hand back the occupied territories , Israel would have to negotiate .
The US government has power over that country .
But can it be used ?
A paper published in March by the US academics John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt documents the extraordinary influence the " Israel lobby " exercises in Washington .
They argue that the combined forces of evangelical Christian groups and Jewish American organisations such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ensure that " Israel is virtually immune from criticism " in Congress and " also has significant leverage over the executive branch " .
Politicians who support the Israeli government are showered with funds , the paper contends , while those who contest it are cowed by letter - writing campaigns and vilification in the media .
If all else fails , the " great silencer " is deployed : the charge of anti-semitism .
Those who oppose the policies of the Israeli government are accused of hating Jews .
All this makes an even - handed policy difficult , but not impossible .
Standing up to bullies is surely the key test of leadership .
A US president in his second term is in a powerful position to demand that Israel pulls back and negotiates .
But if Ashdown meant that it is impossible psychologically and intellectually for the US government to act , he might have a point .
At his press conference with Tony Blair last Friday , George Bush laid out his usual fairy tale about the conflict in the Middle East .
" There 's a lot of suffering in Lebanon , " he explained , " because Hizbullah attacked Israel .
There 's a lot of suffering in the Palestinian territory because militant Hamas is trying to stop the advance of democracy .
There is suffering in Iraq because terrorists are trying to spread sectarian violence and stop the spread of democracy . "
The current conflict in Lebanon " started , out of the blue , with two Israeli soldiers kidnapped and rockets being fired across the border " .
I agree that Hizbullah fired the first shots .
But out of the blue ?
Israel 's earlier occupation of southern Lebanon ; its continued occupation of the Golan Heights ; its occupation and partial settlement of the West Bank and gradual clearance of Jerusalem ; its shelling of civilians , power plants , bridges and pipelines in Gaza ; its beating and shooting of children ; its imprisonment or assassination of Palestinian political leaders ; its bulldozing of homes ; its humiliating and often lethal checkpoints : all these are , in Bush 's mind , either fictional or carry no political consequences .
The same goes for the US invasion and occupation of Iraq and the constant threats Bush issues to Syria and Iran .
There is only one set of agents at work - the terrorists - and their motivation arises autochthonously from the evil in their hearts .
Israel is not solely to blame for this crisis .
The firing of rockets into its cities is an intolerable act of terrorism .
But to understand why the people assaulting that country will not put down their arms , the king of fairyland would be forced to come to terms with the consequences of Israel 's occupation of other people 's lands and of its murder of civilians ; of his own invasion of Iraq and of his failure , across the past six years , to treat the Palestinians fairly .
And this he seems incapable of doing .
Instead , his answers last Friday suggested , Bush is constructing a millenarian narrative of escalating conflict leading to the final triumph of freedom and democracy .
So I fear that Paddy Ashdown may be right .
The United States cannot pursue a wider settlement in the Middle East , for it is led by a man who lives in a world of his own .

[ a reply to all that vulgar materialism of “ brain chemicals make me sad ” type ]
Wall Street Journal - November 18 , 2005
SCIENCE JOURNAL By SHARON BEGLEY
Some Drugs Work To Treat Depression , But It Is n’t Clear How
Hardly any patients know how Lipitor lowers cholesterol , how Lotensin reduces blood pressure , or even how ibuprofen erases headaches .
But when it comes to Prozac , Zoloft and Paxil , ads and glowing accounts in the press have turned patients with depression into veritable pharmacologists , able to rattle off how these “ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ” keep more of the brain chemical serotonin hanging around in synapses , correcting the neurochemical imbalance that causes depression .
There is only one problem .
“ Not a single peer - reviewed article … support [s ] claims of serotonin deficiency in any mental disorder , ” scientists write in the December issue of the journal PLoS Medicine .
Indeed , a steady drip of studies have challenged the “ serotonin did it ” hypothesis .
A 2003 mouse experiment suggested that SSRIs work by inducing the birth and growth of new brain neurons , not by monkeying with serotonin .
In March , a review of decades of research concluded that something other than “ changes in chemical balance might underlie depression . ”
And as Jeffrey Lacasse and Jonathan Leo write in PLoS Medicine , although ads for SSRIs say they correct a chemical imbalance , “ there is no such thing as a scientifically correct ‘ balance ’ of serotonin . ”
How did so many smart people get it so wrong ?
Medicinal chemist Derek Lowe , who works in drug development for a pharmaceutical firm , offered an explanation in his “ In the Pipeline ” blog .
“ I worked on central nervous system drugs for eight years , and I can confidently state that we know just slightly more than jack ” about how antidepressants work .
It is not for lack of trying .
In 1965 , psychiatrist Joseph Schildkraut of Harvard University suggested that a deficiency of a brain chemical causes depression .
With the success of drugs that block the reuptake of these chemicals , that idea started to look pretty good .
Yet the evidence was always circumstantial .
You ca n’t measure serotonin in the brains of living human beings .
The next best thing , measuring the compounds that serotonin breaks down to in cerebrospinal fluid , suggested that clinically depressed patients had less of it than healthy people did .
But it was never clear whether depression caused those low levels , or vice versa .
A 2002 review of these early experiments took them to task for such flaws .
There had always been data that do n’t fit the serotonin - imbalance theory .
Depleting people ’s serotonin levels sometimes changed their mood for the worse and sometimes did n’t .
Sending serotonin levels through the roof did n’t help depression , a study found as early as 1975 .
There is little doubt that the SSRIs do what their name says , keeping more serotonin in the brain ’s synapses .
But the fact “ that SSRIs act on the serotonin system does not mean that clinical depression results from a shortage of serotonin , ” says Dr. Leo , professor of anatomy at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine , Bradenton , Fla .
No more so , anyway , than the fact that steroid creams help rashes means that rashes are caused by a steroid shortage .
A clue to how SSRIs do work comes from how long they take to have any effect .
They rarely make a dent in depression before three weeks , and sometimes take eight weeks to kick in .
But they affect serotonin levels right away .
If depression does n’t lift despite that serotonin hit , the drugs must be doing something else ; it ’s the something else that eases depression .
The best evidence so far is that the something else is neurogenesis – the birth of new neurons .
When scientists led by Rene Hen of Columbia University and Ronald Duman of Yale blocked neurogenesis in mice , SSRIs had no effect .
When neurogenesis was unimpeded , SSRIs made the mice less anxious and depressed — for rodents .
As best scientists can tell , SSRIs first activate the serotonin system , which is somehow necessary for neurogenesis .
That is what takes weeks .
Claiming that depression results from a brain - chemical imbalance , as ads do , is problematic on several fronts .
Patients who believe this are more likely to demand a prescription .
If you have a disease caused by too little insulin , you take insulin ; if you have one caused by too little serotonin , you take serotonin boosters .
Most people treated for depression get pills rather than psychotherapy , and this week a study from Stanford University reported that drugs have been supplanting psychotherapy for depressed adolescents .
Clinical guidelines call for using both , and for psychotherapy to be the first - line treatment for most kids .
Psychotherapy “ can be as effective as medications ” for major depression , concluded a study in April of 240 patients , in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
Numerous other studies find the same .
The hegemony of the serotonin hypothesis may be keeping patients from a therapy that will help them more in the long term .
The relapse rate for patients on pills is higher than for those getting cognitive - behavior psychotherapy .
Some 19 million people in the U.S. suffer from depression in any given year .
For many , SSRIs help little , if at all .
To do better , we have to get the science right .
COLLEGEVILLE , Pa. — John Strassburger , the president of Ursinus College , a small liberal arts institution here in the eastern Pennsylvania countryside , vividly remembers the day that the chairman of the board of trustees told him the college was losing applicants because of its tuition .
It was too low .
So early in 2000 the board voted to raise tuition and fees 17.6 percent , to $ 23,460 ( and to include a laptop for every incoming student to help soften the blow ) .
Then it waited to see what would happen .
Ursinus received nearly 200 more applications than the year before .
Within four years the size of the freshman class had risen 35 percent , to 454 students .
Applicants had apparently concluded that if the college cost more , it must be better .
“ It ’s bizarre and it ’s embarrassing , but it ’s probably true , ” Dr. Strassburger said .
Ursinus also did something more : it raised student aid by nearly 20 percent , to just under $ 12.9 million , meaning that a majority of its students paid less than half price .

Ngoc :
Three decades without sleep
" My husband used to sleep well , but these days , even liquor can not put him down . "
She said when Ngoc went to Da Nang for a medical examination , doctors gave him a clean bill of health , except a minor decline in liver function .
Ngoc currently lives on his 5 ha farm at the foot of a mountain busy with farming and taking care of pigs and chickens all day .
His six children live at their house in Que Trung .
Ngoc often does extra farm work or guards his farm at night to prevent theft , saying he used three months of sleepless nights to dig two large ponds to raise fish .
Bhagat :
Had his twin brother on his stomach
Sanju Bhagat 's stomach was once so swollen he looked nine months pregnant and could barely breathe .
iving in the city of Nagpur , India , Bhagat said he'd felt self -
conscious his whole life about his big belly .
But one night in June 1999 , his problem erupted into something much larger than cosmetic worry .
Mehta said that he can usually spot a tumor just after he begins an operation .
But while operating on Bhagat , Mehta saw something he had never encountered .
As he cut deeper into Bhagat 's stomach , gallons of fluid spilled out — and then something extraordinary happened .
" First , one limb came out , then another limb came out .
Then some part of genitalia , then some part of hair , some limbs , jaws , limbs , hair . "
At first glance , it may look as if Bhagat had given birth .
Actually , Mehta had removed the mutated body of Bhagat 's twin brother from his stomach .
Bhagat , they discovered , had one of the world 's most bizarre medical conditions — fetus in fetu .
It is an extremely rare abnormality that occurs when a fetus gets trapped inside its twin .
The trapped fetus can survive as a parasite even past birth by forming an umbilical cordlike structure that leaches its twin 's blood supply until it grows so large that it starts to harm the host , at which point doctors usually intervene .
Yokoi : Spent 28 years hidden after WWII
Shoichi Yokoi was a soldier , conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army in 1941 and sent to Guam shortly thereafter .
In 1944 , as American forces reconquered the island , Yokoi went into hiding .
On January 24 , 1972 , Yokoi was discovered in a remote section of Guam by two of the island 's inhabitants .
For 28 years he had been hiding in an underground jungle cave , fearing to come out of hiding even after finding leaflets declaring that World War II had ended .
" It is with much embarrassment that I have returned alive , " he said upon his return to Japan , carrying his rusted rifle at his side .
Mehran : Lives at the Airport since 1988
Mehran Karimi Nasseri , also known as Sir , Alfred Mehran ( yes , including the comma ) , is an Iranian refugee who has been living in the departure lounge of Terminal One in Charles de Gaulle Airport since August 8 , 1988 .
After he was later imprisoned , tortured and expelled from his country , he applied for asylum in many European countries without luck .
When he decided to go to the United Kingdom , he claimed that he was mugged , and his shoulder bag stolen while waiting at the RER platform to go to Charles de Gaulle Airport to take a flight to Heathrow .
Nasseri managed to board the plane , but when he arrived at Heathrow without the necessary documentation , Heathrow officials sent him back to Charles de Gaulle .
Nasseri was unable to prove his identity or his refugee status to the French officials and so he was moved to the Zone d'attente ( waiting zone ) , a holding area for travellers without papers .
Nasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the 2004 movie The Terminal .
Unlike Tom Hanks ' character in the movie , and since at least 1994 , Nasseri does not live in the duty - free transit area but simply in the departure hall , in the circular boutiques and restaurants passage on the lowest floor .
He can at least theoretically leave the terminal at any moment , although , since everyone knows him , his departure might not remain unnoticed .
He does not seem to speak with anyone normally .
With his cart and bags , he almost looks like a traveler , so people either do not notice him or ignore him as if he were a homeless person .
Mitsuo : A Japanese Jesus Christ
Matayoshi Mitsuo is an eccentric Japanese politician with the conviction that he is the God and Christ .
According to his program , he will do the Last Judgement as the Christ but the way to do this is totally within the current political system and its legitimacy .
His first step as the Savior is to be appointed the prime minister of Japan .
Then he will reform Japanese society and then the United Nations should offer him the honor of its General Secretary .
Then Matayoshi Jesus will reign over the whole world with two legitimate authorities , not only religious but also political .
He has presented himself in many elections but he has not won yet .
He has become well - known for his eccentric campaigns where he urges opponents to commit suicide by hara - kiri .
Bihari : Most officially dead person
Lal Bihari ( born 1961 ) is a farmer from Uttar Pradesh , India who was officially dead from 1976 to 1994 .
He founded Mritak Sangh or the Association of the Dead in Uttar Pradesh , India .
He fought Indian government bureaucracy for 18 years to prove that he is alive .
When Lal Bihari tried to apply for a bank loan in 1976 , he found out that he was officially dead .
His uncle had bribed a government official to register him as dead so he would get the ownership of Bihari 's land .
Bihari discovered at least 100 other people in a similar situation , being officially dead .
He formed Mritak Sangh in the Azamgarh district .
He and many other members were in danger of being killed by those who had appropriated their property .
Nowadays the association has over 20,000 members all over India .
By 2004 they had managed to declare four of their members alive .
In 2004 he ran for a seat in the parliament of Lal Ganj .
Icke : Our salvation from Reptilian Humanoids
David Icke , is a former professional football player , BBC television sports presenter , and British Green Party national spokesperson .
Since 1990 , he has been what he calls a " full - time investigator into who and what is really controlling the world . " : reptilians .
He dresses only in turquoise and sustains that the world was ruled by a secret group called " The Elite " : a race of reptilian humanoids , known in ancient times as the Babylonian Brotherhood , and that many prominent people are descended from them , including George W. Bush , Queen Elizabeth II , and Kris Kristofferson .
He believes that descendants of the reptiles engage in child molestation and Satanism .
He is the author of 15 books explaining his views .
After a five - hour speech to students , he received a standing ovation at the University of Toronto in 1999 .
Nakamatsu : Photographed and analyzed every meal for 34 years
Yoshiro Nakamatsu ( born June 26 , 1928 ) , a.k.a.
Dr. NakaMats , is the Japanese inventor claiming to hold the world record for number of inventions with over 3,000 , including the floppy disk and " PyonPyon " spring shoes .
He has being photographing and retrospectively analyzing every meal he has consumed during a period of 34 years ( and counting ) .
The goal of Nakamatsu is to live over 140 years old .
Lotito : Mister eat - it - all
Michel Lotito ( born June 15 , 1950 ) is a French entertainer .
Lotito , who was born in Grenoble , is famous as the consumer of undigestables , and is known as Monsieur Mangetout ( Mister Eat - it - all ) .
Lotito 's performances are the consumption of metal , glass , rubber and so on in items such as bicycles , televisions , a Cessna 150 , and smaller items which are disassembled , cut - up and swallowed .
The aircraft took roughly two years to be ' eaten ' from 1978 to 1980 .
He began eating unusual material while a child and has been performing publicly since 1966 .
Lotito does not often suffer from ill - effects due to his diet , even after the consumption of materials usually considered poisonous .
When performing he consumes around a kilogram of material daily , preceding it with mineral oil and drinking considerable quantities of water during the ' meal ' .
He apparently possesses a stomach and intestine with walls of twice the expected thickness , and his digestive acids are , allegedly , unusually powerful , allowing him to digest a certain portion of his metallic meals .
Mahir Cagri : " I KISS YOU !!!!!! "
Mahir Cagri , a resident of Turkey , became an Internet celebrity in 1999 .
His picture - laden personal homepage , which exclaimed in broken English his love of the accordion and travel , was visited by millions and spawned numerous fansites and parodies .
Mahir claimed in various interviews that his personal webpage was hacked , with additions such as " I like sex " embedded into his webpage .
His website was quickly spread through word of mouth on the internet .
The website came at a time when " Internet phenomenon " was a new concept for Internet users , media , and the curious public .
# Some quotes from his site : " I KISS YOU !!!!!! "
# " Who is want to come TURKEY I can invitate .....
She can stay my home ........ "
# " I like sex "
# " I like music , I have many many music enstrumans my home I can play "
" My husband used to sleep well , but these days , even liquor can not put him down . "

Sixty - four - year - old Thai Ngoc , known as Hai Ngoc , said he could not sleep at night after getting a fever in 1973 , and has counted infinite numbers of sheep during more than 11,700 consecutive sleepless nights .
" I do n't know whether the insomnia has impacted my health or not .
But I 'm still healthy and can farm normally like others , " Ngoc said .
Proving his health , the elderly resident of Que Trung commune , Que Son district said he can carry two 50kg bags of fertilizer down 4 km of road to return home every day .
His wife said ,
To hear the American government and its Israeli allies tell it , the struggle in the Middle East is a straightforward black - and - white one , which pits the Forces of Goodness ( Washington and Tel Aviv ) against “ terrorists ” and terrorist - supporting states like Iran and Syria .
This narrative enables the Americans and the Israelis to mask their own agendas  regional hegemony , territorial expansion ( on Israel ’s part ) , and access to cheap oil  behind the “ war on terrorism ” rubric .
It also lets them lump together groups  including Hamas , Hezbollah , and al - Qaeda  that are not only different but opposed to each other ’s interests , their only commonality being that they are Arab , Muslim , and armed .
However , every once in a while , reality intrudes and the official narrative suffers a direct hit : the latest such incident is the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Damascus .
Syrian security forces gunned down three men who tried to blow up the U.S. embassy in Damascus Tuesday , wounding and capturing another .
The upscale Abu Romana area , where embassies and the houses of the rich nestle near the presidential palace of Bashar al - Assad , was the scene of a 30 - minute gun battle .
Shouting religious slogans and firing RPGs , four Takfiri , reportedly members of Jund al - Sham ( Soldiers of Syria ) , a shadowy jihadist Sunni group vaguely affiliated with al - Qaeda , stormed the building .
One Syrian guard was killed and two were wounded , in what is being described as a failed attempt to detonate a car bomb in front of the embassy .
Eleven civilian bystanders were injured .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed her gratitude for the Syrian response .
Tony
Snow echoed this uncharacteristic note of civility and thanks to the Syrians , opining that American gratitude “ does not mean they are an ally .
We are hoping they will become an ally and make the choice of fighting against terrorists . ”
Syria  a U.S. ally ?
What ’s going on here ?
Damascus has long been at loggerheads with Washington , despite Syrian strongman Bashar al - Assad ’s best efforts to ameliorate the ferociously anti-Syrian policies and pronouncements of U.S. officials , including barely disguised threats of military action .
Economic sanctions and a regular diet of anti-Syrian diatribes coming from the State Department , the Pentagon , and the executive branch have prevented any rapprochement , and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon only exacerbated the situation .
It ’s quite a turnaround for the U.S. , which had earlier accused the Syrians of orchestrating the assassination of Lebanese politician and entrepreneur Rafik Hariri , to now be thanking this alleged “ terrorist ” regime for taking casualties in defense of U.S. interests .
Not that there is much of an American presence in Damascus .
U.S. ambassador Margaret Scobey did not hear the explosions , being a few thousand miles away in Washington after having been recalled by the State Department on the occasion of Hariri ’s death .
The Americans averred , without evidence , that the Syrians had killed the Lebanese businessman and rising political star  but not even the kangaroo court set up by UN investigator Detlev Mehlis , with its “ leaked ” third - hand hearsay masquerading as “ evidence , ” could bring the case against Syria to a satisfactory close  satisfactory , that is , to the Americans and their Israeli sidekicks , who used the assassination as a stick to beat up on the Syrians and force the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon .
A little over a year later , the Israelis invaded Lebanon  and we can see who came out ahead in that little game .
Although Secretary Rice says it ’s “ too early ” to know who was behind the attack , the Syrians  who keep a very close watch on their neck of the woods  are pretty certain : the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. said on CNN that Jund al - Sham , a Syrian Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group , is undoubtedly responsible , and therein lies a story
Jund al - Sham , loosely affiliated with al - Qaeda , has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in the Levant , including the assassination of a Hezbollah official .
Now this last certainly seems like an odd task for a purportedly Islamist group to undertake .
The ostensible motivation for this attack is the Shi’ite - Sunni rivalry : the Shi’ite Hezbollah is considered heretical , and therefore a target of Takfiri retribution , yet the confluence of interests between these “ Soldiers of Syria ” with the soldiers of Israel in the IDF is striking .
Another oddity : the links between Jund al - Sham and a recently uncovered Israeli spy network in Lebanon .
Hussein Khattab , a Palestinian member of the spy ring  which has been linked to several assassinations of Palestinian leaders and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon  is the brother of Sheik Jamal Khattab , an Islamic cleric and recruiter for al - Qaeda in Iraq , who is , in turn , connected to Jund al - Sham .
Furthermore , a suspiciously large part of Jund al - Sham ’s activities in the Levant have been directed against Hezbollah .
In July 2005 , Jund al - Sham faxed a threat to the Shi’ite Fatwa Center in Tyre , vowing to murder several prominent Hezbollah figures , including former spiritual leader Sayyed Hussein Fadlallah .
The group also issued a number of statements labeling Hezbollah “ unbelievers ”  and thus justifiably targeted by “ true ” Muslims .
Another coincidence : the assassination of Hezbollah leaders Ali Saleh and Ghaleb Awali , as well as Palestinian militants in Lebanon , previously claimed by Jund al - Sham , has been uncovered by the Lebanese security forces as the work of the Mossad ring .
The attack on the U.S. embassy underscores the reality of what is going on in the Levant , with Syria at the epicenter of a brewing Islamist storm  and the U.S. and Israel objectively allied with radical Islamists seeking “ regime change ” in Damascus .
Syria , with its secular government and moderate religious leaders , is an affront to the real terrorists , just as it is anathema in Washington and Tel Aviv .
A rational American policy in the region would be to seek a reconciliation with Damascus and an alliance against al - Qaeda and the forces of religious extremism that represent a real threat to our interests .
But U.S. interests have nothing to do with our Middle East policy , and that has been true for a long time .
Syria , too , is living in the shadow of a terrorist threat  but it will be a cold day in hell before Washington ever recognizes that .
All our policymakers care about is appeasing Israel and maintaining the support of that country ’s vocal and very powerful Washington lobby  and American interests be damned .
Until that policy changes , the Syrians will be fighting a lonely battle against al - Qaeda in their country .
I would merely point out that the interests of the Israelis and the Islamists are entirely congruent in the Levant : “ regime change ” in Damascus , and the elimination of the Hezbollah “ unbelievers . ”
That , of course , is just a coincidence  and no doubt a very useful one for all concerned .

One YouTube user , who would not identify himself other than by his account name , facez0 fdeath , and his location , in Britain , said by e-mail that he posted a video of a sniper attack “ because I felt it was information the U.K. news was unwilling to tell . ”
“ I was physically sickened upon seeing it , ” he said , adding , “ I am wholly opposed to any form of censorship . ”
The video he posted , which had been viewed more than 33,000 times , was removed earlier this week .
Another YouTube user , who said he was a 19 - year - old in Istanbul and who posted more than 40 videos of Iraq violence , said via e-mail that “ anti-war feelings and Muslim beliefs ( the religion of peace ) motivates me . ”
Neal O. Newbill , a freshman at the University of Memphis who viewed some of the YouTube videos and posted comments on them , said in an interview that he was enraged by the recorded chants of “ Allahu Akbar , ” Arabic for “ God is great , ” that follow some of the sniper attacks .
But Mr. Newbill added that he was awed by the size of the blasts from the improvised explosive devices , or I.E.D. ’s , used against American vehicles .
A son , nephew and grandson of American veterans , Mr. Newbill said he had sought out the videos , searching on YouTube for “ I.E.D. , ” “ because I like watching stuff blow up . ”
The Web sites also contain a growing number of video clips taken by American soldiers .
One shows the view from the back of a truck containing several members of a platoon , whose vehicle then hits an I.E.D. and is turned on its side .
A few videos also show American servicemen or private security guards firing at attackers , and one shows an American rocket - propelled grenade hitting a building from which insurgents are firing .

Popular and academic discussions of Wal - Mart are small - but - growing parts of the larger debate about social organization , markets , and the role of the state .
Wal - Mart and its impact on labor markets have become hot - button political issues , with several states and municipalities attempting to pass laws expressly designed to keep Wal - Mart out .
New York Senator , former First Lady , and former Wal - Mart board member Hillary Clinton returned a $ 5,000 contribution from Wal - Mart 's political action committee because she did not approve of the company 's practices . [ 1 ]
Why the sensation ?
Why does Wal - Mart matter ?
First , Wal - Mart matters for anyone interested in human welfare and the alleviation of poverty .
Economists have identified a large " Wal - Mart effect " on food prices .
Recently , economists Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag have argued that consumer benefits from Wal - Mart entry are " substantial , both in terms of food expenditure and in terms of overall consumer expenditure . "
Their study finds that " low income households benefit the most . "
[ 2 ]
In another study , they argue that the Bureau of Labor Statistics overstates inflation by failing to account for Wal - Mart 's substantial impact on grocery prices . [ 3 ]
A study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that Wal - Mart accounted for a disproportionate share of US productivity growth in the 1990s . [ 4 ]
Research on Wal - Mart 's effect on employment is somewhat more ambiguous , with University of Missouri economist Emek Basker finding that Wal - Mart entry increases employment while University of California - Irvine economist David Neumark and co-authors find that Wal - Mart entry might increase total employment and reduce retail payrolls : " in the South … the evidence indicates that Wal - Mart reduces retail employment , total employment , and total payrolls per person . " [ 5 ]
In light of recent attention paid to microfinance as a poverty - alleviation measure , New York Times columnist John Tierney has argued that Wal - Mart may deserve a Nobel . [ 6 ]
Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize for their focus on poverty , but as Tierney points out , Wal - Mart 's impact on global poverty has been much larger .
Writing on TCSDaily.com , Michael Strong notes that one of the most important effects Wal - Mart and other multinational corporations have on the welfare of the world 's poor is that they provide the poor with access to markets in developed countries .
Microfinance may or may not have helped to reduce global poverty , but the positive record of trade with rich countries is unquestionable .
As Strong writes , " ( p ) oor , rural micro - entrepreneurs selling eggs to other poor rural peasants simply do not have access to the vast pipeline of wealth from the developed world . "
Wal - Mart has lifted many out of poverty by providing " access to the vast pipeline .
" Strong quotes economist and columnist Paul Krugman , who , in a 1997 article sub - headed " bad jobs at bad wages are better than no jobs at all , " described the entrepreneurial process and its impact on the world 's poor .
Seeking only profit , " soulless multinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs " are able to " take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor . "
Is the process esthetically pleasing ?
For many , it is not .
Krugman continues :
It is not an edifying spectacle ; but no matter how base the motives of those involved , the result has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to something still awful but nonetheless significantly better . [ 7 ]
Labor conditions in the developing world may be offensive to the refined sensibilities of some western observers , but " bad jobs at bad wages " are preferable to the relevant alternatives .
Benefits accrue to American consumers in the form of lower prices .
In the United States , Wal - Mart 's impact on food prices has been orders of magnitude greater than what the federal government spends on food stamps .
Production for the markets opened by Wal - Mart has led a great many people to the road out of poverty in countries like China .
Unfortunately , the story does n't end there .
The ways a company ( or an individual ) can get rich include the following methods :
Produce products that people want to buy at prices they are willing to pay , and do so at the lowest cost possible .
Get the government to force people to give you money .
Get the government to make it illegal for other people to compete with you .
For the most part , Wal - Mart earns its profits by method # 1 : the company produces products people want to buy at extremely low prices .
It is better able to serve consumers — paraphrasing Ludwig von Mises , Wal - Mart is better able to anticipate consumer wants and adjust their production decisions to those wants than any of their competitors .
The company 's ability to move goods from one place to another at low cost is unparalleled , and this has led to tangible , incremental , but sometimes imperceptible improvements in consumer well - being .
Savings of a few cents here and a few dollars there may be so small as to be unnoticeable at the cash register , but these savings accumulate , amount to substantial sums over time , and contribute to what economist Don Boudreaux calls " the prosperity pool . "
In addition to their impact in terms of global poverty alleviation , Wal - Mart earned high marks from observers for its nimble response to Hurricane Katrina , especially in contrast to a government effort that has been lambasted by news reporters and commentators .
The company was perhaps the most effective " first responder " to Hurricane Katrina ; as one official remarked in a Washington Post article , Wal - Mart was " ready before FEMA was . " [ 8 ]
Recently , however , Wal - Mart has attempted to earn money through methods # 2 and # 3 .
The company 's post - hurricane magnanimity notwithstanding , Wal - Mart has attracted criticism from free - market advocates in recent years because of its recent turn toward political rather than economic competition .
Wal - Mart has gotten subsidies from local governments in the form of tax abatements , tax increment financing , tax - financed infrastructure improvements , and the use of eminent domain .
These practices provide Wal - Mart with an advantage over smaller firms that do not have access to the " political means " to wealth . [ 9 ]
Last year Wal - Mart called for an increase in the minimum wage in spite of research on how the minimum wage affects labor markets .
This might benefit Wal - Mart for a couple of reasons .
First , Wal - Mart wages are well above the federal minimum , but an increase in the minimum wage would reduce potential competition .
This would make it effectively illegal for some people to compete with Wal - Mart .
Second , an increase in the minimum wage would benefit some low - income workers and hurt others ; regardless , it might increase demand for Wal - Mart 's goods . [ 10 ]
On net , should Wal - Mart be commended or condemned ?
I for one have written in defense of Wal - Mart , and while its managers certainly may not have the impeccable credentials that one might expect of certified Randian heroes , the popular debate over Wal - Mart is not , for the most part , a debate over the political economy of the minimum wage or the economics of eminent domain .
Rather , the popular debate over Wal - Mart is an important part of a broader debate between freedom and interventionism .
Those who vilify Wal - Mart do so not for Wal - Mart 's political failings but for Wal - Mart 's economic successes .
The company 's critics are making inroads , but the anti-Wal - Mart campaign is a campaign to strangle a goose that has laid a disproportionate share of golden eggs .

The difference between " economic means " and " political means " to wealth is outlined by Oppenheimer ( The State ) .
Oppenheimer defines the " economic means " as " one 's own labor and the equivalent exchange of one 's own labor for the labor of others " and the " political means " as " the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others . "
[ 10 ] Galles ( " Wal - Mart " ) has criticized Wal - Mart on precisely this point .
Empirical findings on the minimum wage are summarized in Neumark ( " Economic Effects " ) .

Taxpayers who are obliged to pay the annual share of the s corp Tax ( IS ) , have to do it in installments .
These payments are 3 , one corresponding to each current tax period .
It is important to note that this installment payment is considered a tax debt .
IS deductions and bonuses However , companies can benefit from a series of bonuses and deductions in some cases , for which they will benefit from aid or discounts .
You can choose the s corp tax services also .
These bonuses and deductions from s corp
Tax are the following : Deduction for double taxation
This aid makes it possible to alleviate the double taxation of income that has already been taxed in another company .
But , two types of double taxation are specified : Internal
It is one in which the dividends belong to companies resident in Spanish territory .
In this case , the company may deduct 50 % of the full share corresponding to the Taxable Base of the profit shares , or 100 % in the event that the profit shares come from entities with a share percentage , direct or indirect , equal to or greater than 5 % , .
International
One in which the income of a taxpayer is taxed in two countries or the same income is taxed on two different taxpayers by two different countries ( taxes borne , income obtained through permanent establishment , etc. ) .
In this way , the company may deduct the lower result of the following options :
Tax paid abroad .
Which would correspond to pay in Spain for said income
In case of delivering participation in profits taxed abroad : the tax paid for the profits out of which the dividends are paid , in the corresponding amount .
You can make use of taxfyle for the best results .
Deductions for the incentive of certain activities
This type of tax aid is in force so that certain business activities are promoted .
Only a percentage of the investment made ( % deduction ) may be deducted , and whose value depends on the investment modalities and varies according to them .
In addition , these deductions avoid double taxation .
These companies can opt for the installment payment method as follows :
By presenting the second installment payment of the IS in the first 20 calendar days of October 2020 , for taxpayers who cannot benefit from the aforementioned extension period .
The taxpayer who exercises this option is bound to this modality , exclusively , with respect to the payments corresponding to the same tax period .
Entry and return document
The refund or deposit will be made by transfer to the account that we indicate in the document , which may be open in a credit institution in Spain or in the European Union , in the SEPA area , or in the rest of the countries .
Reduced rate of 20 % for cooperatives
It is applicable generically in tax - protected cooperative societies , with the exception of extra-cooperative results , which are taxed at the general rate of 25 % .
However , this does not apply to credit unions or rural savings banks .
For example , associations declared of public utility and foundations can apply 10 % .
Likewise , certain collective investment entities can pay 1 % tax .
After an article on The Oil Drum I started looking up the energy intensity of different modes of transit .
" Energy intensity " is the amount of energy required to do useful work ( for instance , to move a passenger ) .
Here 's what I found ( from here ; chapter 2 , Tables 2.11 and 2.12 ) :
Btu / passenger - mile Auto ( highway ) 3549 1.00 ( relative to car ; smaller is better ) Bus transit 4160 1.17 Bus intercity 932 0.26 Air 3587 1.01 Amtrak 2935 0.83 Rail transit 3228 0.91 Commuter rail 2751 0.78
Public transit also does n't come off very well from this comparison .
Admittedly highway automobile traffic is more efficient than city automobile traffic .
But still the energy intensity of public transit is surprisingly bad .
This is contrary to most people 's intuition ; I think this is why people expect public transit to be energy efficient :
People believe that bigger things are naturally more efficient .
That a bigger power plant is better than a smaller one , or a bigger factory is better than a smaller one , etc .
This is what we 've come to expect from industrialization .
So putting more people in a larger vehicle must be more efficient .
Environmentalists tend to support public transit ( even if for other reasons than direct energy use ) .
Many kinds of public transit do n't outwardly pollute ( even though their actual impact on the environment may still be substantial , especially CO2 output ) .
One argument for rail or other mass transit is that it uses electrical power .
Of course this is not a great environmental benefit now ( at the moment it probably compounds the inefficiencies ) , but in the future it allows for the substitution of more environmentally friendly power generation .
It 's also strategically advantageous even if we continue to use fossil fuels , because unlike gasoline or diesel there are copious domestic fuels that can be used for generating electricity ( like coal ) .
Then we should also ask : why is public transit so energy inefficient ?
Yes , it 's better than cars , but only barely better .
The answer of course is ridership -- if all the trains and buses were full all the time they'd be quite efficient .
But they are n't full .
A naive response is that if we just need to encourage more public transit riders : by growing the systems , providing greater operating subsidies , and by taxing or tolling auto traffic .
Once ridership is higher the efficiency will go up .
Does that really make sense ?
Consider some situations :
Commuter traffic :
At rush hour large numbers of people travel , often in particular directions .
Vehicles have to bring people from their homes to work centers , then return the mostly - empty vehicles to make another trip .
Non-circular lines :
When you have a line that goes from one point to another point , typically somewhere in the center your line reaches its maximum utility and maximum ridership -- you 've already passed many population sources , and are yet to reach many desired destinations .
You need to have sufficient capacity to hold all those riders .
At the start of the line you 've passed only one population source ( the terminal point ) ; at the end of the line you have only one destination ( the other terminal point ) .
You will necessarily have less ridership ( and empty seats ) when you are close to one of the ends .
Off - peak service : Let 's say you want to provide comprehensive service ( more about why you might want to do this later ) .
Then you have to provide late - night service , and some service to low - density areas .
These always have low ridership unless you are in an extremely dense area .
Why is ridership always low ?
Well , if you 've achieved good ridership from 6 pm - 8 pm the transit system has to take on the burden of providing reasonable service from 8 - 10 pm ( after all , someone riding at 8 pm very likely needs a return trip at 10 pm ) .
And if you get good 8 - 10 pm ridership , you need to provide reasonable service from 10 pm - midnight , and so on .
" Reasonable " is a balance between geographic coverage and frequency , and the more " reasonable " the higher your potential ridership .
Why does off - peak service matter ?
Consider cost : public transit can be quite expensive -- $ 1.25 - $ 2.00 a trip .
Public transit proponents counter that cars are also expensive , but the costs are hidden .
This is true , but the incremental cost of a car trip is fairly low .
You 've already bought the car , have the insurance , and the price of gas is not so high ( even now ) .
It 's very hard for public transit to compete with the incremental cost of a car trip , except when tolls are very high ( as in London ) or parking is expensive .
Even with parking it can be hard for public transit to compete when there are multiple passengers .
Public transit can only compete with the total cost of a car when it is a real option to actually ditch the car and rely solely on public transit ( and perhaps other complementary services like taxis and car shares ) .
If public transit does n't provide reasonably comprehensive service it can't compete as a primary form of transportation .
The complementary services help here , but they can be costly and might not be sufficiently flexible ; relying too heavily on those will also cut into public transit 's price advantage .
So what 's my point ?
Mostly I feel that these problems need to be considered more honestly by public transportation advocates .
But also we are at a point in history where transportation may change substantially ; concerns about both peak oil and global warming mean we have to reconsider our current transportation infrastructure .
Even without these concerns traffic itself is starting to become a major issue throughout the country , and there are no good near - term solutions ; we 're seeing substantially diminished returns when building new / larger roads .
What direction will we take going forward ?
Some are calling for an " Apollo Program " for alternative fuels ; a huge , rapid , forceful program to fix our energy problems .
Usually what this means is an attempt to switch cars from gas to something else -- usually biofuels , hydrogen or electricity .
Traffic may be resolved through automated car lanes .
Both kinds of technology are some ways off , but neither seems impossible .
Public transit proponents ( and despite my negative tone here , I am one ) usually have additional reasons they want public transit .
There 's a lot of good reasons ( though not everyone will agree with all of them ) :
Negative feelings towards suburban development and culture , especially the alienating aspect of a car culture .
Denser populations support other forms of transportation like biking and walking .
Biking and walking are much less alienating .
Cars directly conflict with pedestrians and bike traffic .
( Automated cars would probably make this even worse . )
Denser populations have other energy and environmental benefits ( for example , New York City residents have the lowest per-capita energy use in the country ) .
Public transit is usable by people who cannot drive : children , the elderly , and the handicapped .
( Automated cars wo n't help here anytime in the foreseeable future . )
Public transit has low up - front costs , making it more accessible to the poor .
More time to read , less time listening to stupid morning radio ;)
And more reasons I can't think of now , I 'm sure .
I want public transit to win over private transit .
I just do n't think the public transit we have is a very good contender .
Maybe we can jam public transit initiatives through the government process once , or twice , or a few times -- but people have already noticed that these initiatives are incredibly expensive and underperform .
Retorts that we just have n't tried it on a big enough scale are n't very convincing .
Solutions like having the U.S. become Europe or Japan just are n't realistic ; the U.S. just is n't any of those places , and just because something works there does n't mean we can make it work here .
Mass transit today looks a lot like mass transit 75 or 100 years ago .
People who believe in the promise of public transit need to demand something more .
We need to stop apologizing for poor performing systems .
We need to stop pretending it 's reasonable to pay $ 2 to go five blocks , or that a 15 mph system is fast enough , or that having to stand during your trip is a great way to meet new people .
What should we do in particular ?
In my opinion PRT holds more promise than any other system I 've seen .
Some people disagree , and they should offer up their own plans .
But please do n't try to just offer the same broken ideas as though they 'll work this time .
Existing systems ( even ones that say they are new ) simply are n't good enough .

The box is full of salmon , and a man sits atop the box .
Long ago this man hired armed guards to keep anyone from eating his fish .
The many people who sit next to the empty river starve to death .
But they do not die of starvation .
They die of a belief .
Everyone believes that the man atop the box owns the fish .
The soldiers believe it , and they will kill to protect the illusion .
The others believe it enough that they are willing to starve .
But the truth is that there is a box , there is an emptied river , there is a man sitting atop the box , there are guns , and there are starving people .
In the 1930's , anthropologist Ruth Benedict tried to discover why some cultures are " good , " to use her word , and some are not .
She noticed that members of some cultures were generally " surly and nasty " -- words she and her assistant Abraham Maslow recognized as unscientific -- while members of other culutres were almost invariably " nice . "
Benedict is of course not the only person to have made this distinction .
The psychologist Erich Fromm found that cultures fell , sometimes easily , into distinct categories such as " life - affirmative , " or " destructive . "
The Zuni Pueblos , Semangs , Mbutus , and othes that he placed in the former category are extraordinary for the way in which they contrast with our own culture .
" There is a minimum of hostility , violence , or cruelty among people , no harsh punishment , hardly any crime , and the institution of war is absent or plays an exceedingly small role .
Children are treated with kindness , there is no severe corporal punishment ; women are in general considered equal to men , or at least not exploited or humiliated ; there is a genarally permissive and affirmative attitude toward sex .
There is little envy , covetousness , greed , and exploitativeness .
There is also little competition and individualism and a great deal of cooperation ; personal property is only in things that are used .
There is a general attitude of trust and confidence , not only in others but particularly in nature ; a general prevalence of good humor , and a relative absence of depressive moods . "
Readers may more closely recognize our own culture in Fromm 's description of the Dobus , Kwaikutl , Aztecs , and others he put into the category of " destructive . "
These cultures , he said , are " characterized by much interpersonal violence , destructiveness , aggression , and cruelty , both within the tribe and against others , a pleasure in war , maliciousness , and treachery .
The whole atmosphere of life is one of hostility , tension , and fear .
Usually there is a great deal of competition , great emphasis on private property ( if not in material things then in symbols ) , strict hierarchies , and a considerable amount of war - making . "
...
Given the ubiquity of this culture 's destructiveness as well as its technological capacity , there has never been a more important time to ask Ruth Benedict 's question :
Why are some cultures " good " and others not ?
Benedict found that good cultures , which she began to call " secure , " or " low aggression , " or " high - synergy cultures , " could not be differentiated from " surly and nasty " cultures on the basis of race , geography , climate , size , wealth , poverty , complexity , matrilineality , patrilineality , house size , the absence or presence of polygamy , and so on .
More research revealed to her one simple and commonsensical rule separating aggressive from nonaggressive cultures , a rule that has so far evaded implementation by our culture : the social forms and institutions of nonaggressive cultures positively reinforce acts that benefit the group as a whole while negatively reinforcing acts ( and eliminating goals ) that harm some members of the group .
The social forms of aggressive cutures , on the other hand , reward actions that emphasize individual gain , even or especially when that gain harms others in the community .
A primary and sometimes all - consuming goal of members of these cultures is to come out ahead in their " dog eat dog " world .
Another way to put this is that social arrangements of nonaggressive cultures eliminate the polarity between selfishness and altruism by making the two identical :
In a " good " culture , the man atop the box from the parable above would have been scorned , despised , exiled , or otherwise prevented from damaging the community .
To behave in such a selfish and destructive manner would be considered insane .
Even had he conceived such a preposterous idea as hoarding all the fish , he would have been absolutely disallowed because the box was held at the expense of the majority , as well as at the expense of future generations .
For him to be a rich and influential member of a good culture , he would have had to give away many or all of the fish .
The act of giving would have made him rich in esteem .
But he would never have been allowed to strip the river .
There would have been no fear with regard to the " gift " of fish , for social arrangements would have made him secure in the knowledge that if his next fishing trip failed , his more successful neighbors would feed him , just as this time he had fed them .
It all comes down to how a culture handles wealth .
If a culture manages it through what Benedict called a " siphon system , " whereby wealth is constantly siphoned from rich to poor , the society as a whole and its members as individuals will be , for obvious reasons , secure .
They will not need to hoard wealth .
Since this generosity is manifested not only monetarily but in all aspects of life , they will also not need to act out their now - nonexistent insecurities in other ways .
On the other hand , if a culture uses a " funnel system , " in which those who accumulate wealth are esteemed , the result is that " the advantage of one individual becomes a victory over another , and the majority who are not victorious must shift as they can . "
For reasons that should again be obvious , such social forms foster insecurity and aggression , both personal and cultural .
When you work in a startup with 2 - 3 colleagues , you are well - aware of their roles and functions in the company .
But the more people you work with , the vaguer is your understanding of what your colleagues are actually responsible for .
Too many departments , too many people …
Employees fail to see the big picture , management becomes more and more formal .
All in all , it creates a silo mentality – each department knows only their own role in the company , but they are reluctant to share information with other departments or not really willing to listen to their suggestions on how to improve .
As a result , the whole company suffers from poor communication , employees have no idea what their colleagues in other departments do and how much time one or another task might take .
Cross - department boundaries are difficult to breach .
Besides general strategies to keep your team motivated and engaged , there are new HR practices , such as cross- training , job - shadowing and job rotation .
Cross - training provides employees with possibilities to learn new skills outside their usual duties .
Alongside improved morale , increased employee flexibility and productivity , cross- training enables your team see the aspects of work their colleagues do .
Job - shadowing is not only a career - exploration activity , it is a popular on - the - job learning technique .
Your employees see the challenges their colleagues have to deal with every day .
Job rotation is a method used in some companies to keep their employees motivated , make them learn new skills and see the bigger picture .
All in all , these techniques help employees breach cross-department boundaries and improve the collaboration in the company .
Improve interpersonal relationships
Prior to 2006 , PowerBook was consistently one of the most respected and lusted after brands in the portable computing market .
Apple ’s first attempt at repackaging the Macintosh as a portable failed ( the 16 lb. Macintosh Portable never caught on ) .
But Apple scored a hit with its first PowerBook , and sales of the line helped the company generate $ 7.1 billion in sales in 1992 , its best year to date .
Like the Macintosh , the PowerBook succeeded despite Apple ’s management .
The PowerBook Project
In the fall of 1990 , Apple CEO John Sculley started a semi-autonomous division to produce a successful portable computer .
He later contracted with Sony to create a more svelte version of the Portable , dubbed Asahi .
John Medica , Randy Battat , and Neil Selvin were the product managers for the new division , and they had all witnessed firsthand the inefficiency of Apple ’s corporate structure .
Randy Battat had served as the product manager for the Lisa and watched as the future of personal computing was relegated to the few businesses that could afford such an overpriced computer .
Battat was head of the PowerBook division and supervised the creation of the software used to make the PowerBook operate efficiently as a portable .
John Medica and Neil Selvin headed hardware design and marketing respectively and worked under Battat .
The portable market of 1991 was very different from today’s .
Toshiba , which produced the first mass market PC laptop in 1985 ( the T1100 ) and the first $ 1,000 laptop in 1987 ( the T1000 ) , and Compaq , which began as a portable PC maker in 1983 ( the luggable 28 lb. Compaq Portable ) , were the front - runners .
Their notebooks typically weighed over 8 pounds and lacked many of the features found in even the least expensive desktop systems , like hard drives and mice .
PowerBooks
The trio managing the newly christened PowerBook project were determined to beat the existing manufacturers at their own game .
The PowerBook would weigh less than 8 lb . and have all the same features that a comparably priced desktop system would .
John Medica ’s team set to work creating the hardware designs .
Apple would design two different machines : Tim LC and Tim .
Tim would be identical to Tim LC , except with a faster processor and a more expensive active matrix screen ( the first laptop from any vendor to use an active matrix display , something Apple had pioneered with the Mac Portable in 1989 ) .
Both would be housed in similar cases to the Asahi , which was being designed by Sony .
However , the Tim hardware would be dramatically different .
The Portable and Asahi both used 16 MHz 68000 processors , while the Tim designs used the 68030 processor , which allowed for more RAM , more speed , more processing power , and virtual memory .
Novel Design
The most striking difference between PowerBooks and PC portables was the presence of a built - in trackball .
No other manufacturers included built - in trackballs or other pointing devices ( although there were some clip - on trackballs ) , and when they began to offer built - in trackballs , they were often placed in awkward positions .
Compaq ’s trademark design element was to position the trackball on the back side of the display , so a user could grasp the display and move the pointer .
Others put the trackball on the side ( like the Macintosh Portable ) or relegated it to an attachment to the side of the keyboard .
Tim and Asahi both put the trackball in front of the keyboard , in the middle of a large palm - rest .
Tim and Asahi were not only easier to use , they were also much more comfortable .
Incredibly , Medica ’s engineers were able to fit everything into a package much smaller than their PC counterparts .
Both models were less than 2.5 ″ thick ( the smallest Compaq was 2.75 ″ thick ) and covered an area slightly larger than a letter - sized sheet of paper .
Besides that , they both weighed in at 6.8 lb. , making them truly portable and not merely luggable ( like the Portable ’s 15 lb .. of heft ) .
Software
Most of the software from the Portable was carried over to Tim .
Randy Battat ’s major changes mostly came under the hood .
The major new feature in Tim ’s software was the ability to clock back the processor when the computer was running on battery power to improve battery life .
The 68030 processor ’s higher RAM threshold allowed the developers to create RAM disks that could survive a restart , so users could turn the hard drive off altogether and run their programs and operating system from RAM .
One of the PowerBook ’s biggest selling points originated outside of the PowerBook team .
AppleTalk had been released in 1985 as part of the Macintosh Office , and it allowed users to create impromptu networks anywhere and exchange files .
Elsewhere at Apple , a team of engineers was creating a version of AppleTalk that could operate over common phone lines with a modem ( AppleTalk Remote Access ) , allowing users to log onto an AppleTalk network thousands of miles away .
Neil Selvin managed to convince the team to delay the release of the software until the release of the PowerBook , which was scheduled for the Comdex computer showin November 1991 .
Cheap Launch
John Sculley was still very squeamish about portable computers .
He did not want to invest money into what could be a flop like the Portable , so he gave Selvin an allowance of only $ 1 million , compared to tens of millions often afforded other project .
Instead of creating an entire campaign to market the PowerBook , Selvin decided to buy one big - budget spot and rely on the buzz it generated to promote the PowerBooks .
Chiat / Day , the company that created the 1984 spot for the original Macintosh , created an ad featuring basketball superstar , Kareem Abdul - Jabar , uncomfortably sitting in a cramped airliner seat .
He pulls out a PowerBook and begins typing effortlessly , the screen fades to black and the caption appears : “ At least his hands are comfortable . ”
The PowerBook was a smash success .
Apple released the Asahi , Tim LC , and Tim to an eager and excited market .
They ranged in price from $ 2,300 to $ 4,300 , though Asahi ( released as the PowerBook 100 ) was soon slashed to less than $ 1,000 after disappointing sales .
The two Apple - designed PowerBooks enjoyed incredible sales .
The high - end Tim , named the PowerBook 170 , was by far the best seller , and Apple was unable to keep up with demand .
( Tim LC became the PowerBook 140 . )
Management had failed to anticipate the success of Tim yet had overestimated demand for Asahi .
Because of shortages , customers were faced with a six month wait for their computer .
In the first year on the market , PowerBooks generated over $ 1 billion in sales and dethroned Compaq and Toshiba in the portable market .
Even during Apple ’s darkest days during 1994 , the PowerBook segment was successful .
Not until the release of the flawed PowerBook 5300 in 1995 did Apple cede its position to PC manufacturers .

with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking .
While countries without any oil were sanctioned for these violations , the Bush administration spared Saudi Arabia .
And the
( 11/04/05 : Update at the end of the post ) Europe and the US seem to be addicted to oil and unable to pursue their security interests and moral values in regard to Saudi Arabia .
US government reports indicate Saudi support for terrorism and the lack of counter - terrorism coopertation .
The State Department determined the non-existence of religous freedom in Saudi Arabia and the non-compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking .
While countries without any oil were sanctioned for these violations , the Bush administration spared Saudi Arabia .
And the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee canceled unexpectedly a hearing on Saudi incitement in U.S. mosques .
Now in more detail :
The United States Government Accountability Office reported about the support for terrorism by Saudi charities :
For example , in July 2005 , a Treasury official testified before Congress that Saudi Arabia - based and - funded organizations remain a key source for the promotion of ideologies used by terrorists and violent extremists around the world to justify their agenda .
In addition , according to States 2005 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , Saudi donors and unregulated charities have been a major source of financing to extremist and terrorist groups over the past 25 years .
In July 2003 , a former State Department official testified before Congress that a Saudi - based charity , al Haramain Islamic Foundation , had allegedly financed assistance to the Egyptian terrorist group Gamma al Islamia .
In May 2004 , the same former State official also testified that some half dozen of the most visible charities , including two of Saudi Arabias largest , the International Islamic Relief Organization and the World Muslim League , have been linked to supporting Islamic terrorist organizations globally .
In addition , a former Treasury official identified Wael Hamza Julaidan as a senior figure in the Saudi charitable community who provided financial and other support to several terrorist groups affiliated with al Qaeda operating primarily in the Balkans .
Moreover , the 9/11 Commission report states that al Qaeda raised money in Saudi Arabia directly from individuals and through charities .
According to Rachel Ehrenfeld 's Front Page Magazine article :
Former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey testified before the U.S. House of Representatives  Committee on Government Reform in April this year that  Some $ 85 - 90 billion has been spent from sources in Saudi Arabia in the last 30 years , spreading Wahhabi beliefs throughout the world .
The U.S. National Intelligence Reform Act of December 2004 requires development of a Presidential strategy to confront Islamic extremism , in collaboration with Saudi Arabia .
So far , says a September Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) report , U.S. agencies have been unable to determine the extent of Saudi Arabias domestic and international cooperation . (...)
Under U.S. pressure , Saudi Arabia declared repeatedly that it would close some charities identified as spreading Wahhabism and funding terrorism .
However , the GAO report notes that in May 2005 , ... it was unclear whether the government of Saudi Arabia had implemented its plans . 
Despite Saudi promises to establish a new National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad , the GAO said : as of July 2005 , this commission was not yet fully operational .
At least two members of the Saudi government , Riyadh Governor Prince Salman and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan , are sponsors of the Saudi High Commission , which evidence in the 9/11 victims lawsuits shows has long acted as a fully integrated component of al - Qaedas logistical and financial support infrastructure . 
Moreover , the lawsuits detail that  the Sept. 11 attacks were a direct , intended and foreseeable product of [ the High Commissions ] participation in al - Qaedas jihadist campaign . 
Law.com reports that this " charity "
cannot be sued for the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , a federal judge has ruled .
Southern District of New York Judge Richard Conway Casey found that the Saudi High Commission was shielded from suit under the act because it presented a prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign .
Because the Saudi High Commission " was formed by order of the Kingdom 's governing body , it provides the Kingdom 's aid to Bosnia , it is governed by a Saudi official and its employees are civil servants , it is an organ of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , " Casey wrote in three of the several cases connected to the Sept. 11 attacks that have been consolidated before him by the Panel on Multi-District Litigation under 03 MDL 1570 .
The court also found that the Saudi High Commission has not waived its sovereign immunity . "
American Future refers to a Freedom House report , that
provides voluminous documentary evidence that dozens of mosques in major cities across America are distributing documents , bearing the seal of the government of Saudi Arabia , that incite Muslims to acts of violence and promote hatred of Jews and Christians .
A hearing by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Saudi incitement in U.S. mosques scheduled for October 25th was cancelled unexpectedly .
Israpundit believes :
This hearing would have exposed Saudi support for the wrathful dogma of Wahhabism , the rejection of the co-existence of different religions and condemnation of Christians , Jews , and all other non Muslims .
It would have revealed their attempts to instill contempt for America and its non Wahhabi - style of government .
According to the State Department , religious freedom is non-existent in Saudi Arabia .
While Eritrea was punished for lack of religious freedom under the Religious Freedom of Information Act , Saudi Arabia got another waiver for half a year .
The San Antonio Express - News editorilized on October 17th :
Late last month , the State Department informed Congress it was placing commercial sanctions on the tiny East African nation of Eritrea for violations of religious freedom .
The export of certain defense items to Eritrea is now banned , marking the first sanctions enacted under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 .
Under the terms of that act , the State Department is to issue an annual survey of religious freedom .
In its report to Congress one year ago , the State Department cited Eritrea , Vietnam and Saudi Arabia as nations lacking religious freedom .
In Saudi Arabia , in fact , the report said religious freedom is nonexistent .
While Eritrea is now facing sanctions and Vietnam made commitments to improve religious freedom earlier this year , the Bush administration has given Saudi Arabia another 180 - day waiver from sanctions .
Moreover , the Pentagon has informed Congress of its intention to sell more than $ 2 billion worth of military equipment to the desert kingdom .
By failing to confront Saudi Arabia about its religious intolerance , the Bush administration is n't just violating the spirit  if not the letter  of the International Religious Freedom Act .
It is also hindering efforts to deal with the ideological sources of terrorism .
Religious extremism that originates in Saudi Arabia provides theological and financial sustenance for terrorist organizations such as al - Qaida .
Punishing religious intolerance in Eritrea while ignoring the much greater problem in Saudi Arabia makes a travesty of the International Religious Freedom Act .
State Department Deputy Spokesman Adam Ereli told the Voice of America that
American diplomats intend to engage Saudi authorities in the coming months with the hope of developing a plan of action to deal with U.S. concerns , including allowing other religious groups to hold public worship sessions , and giving them the right to possess their respective holy books and other religious documents .
Saudi Arabia is a destination for men and women from South and East Asia and East Africa trafficked for the purpose of labor exploitation , and for children from Yemen , Afghanistan , and Africa trafficking for forced begging .
Hundreds of thousands of low - skilled workers from India , Indonesia , the Philippines , Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Ethiopia , Eritrea , Somalia , and Kenya migrate voluntarily to Saudi Arabia ; some fall into conditions of involuntary servitude , suffering from physical and sexual abuse , non-payment or delayed payment of wages , the withholding of travel documents , restrictions on their freedom of movement and non-consensual contract alterations .
The Government of Saudi Arabia does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so .
Saudi Arabia has moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 because of its lack of progress in anti-trafficking efforts , particularly its failure to protect victims and prosecute those guilty of involuntary servitude .
Criminal cases are adjudicated under Sharia law , and there is no evidence trafficking victims are accorded legal assistance before and during Sharia legal proceedings .
The government should consider adopting comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation that would punish traffickers , provide for the protection of victims , and facilitate prevention programs .
It should also collect and disseminate data on prosecution and mediation efforts , prosecute aggressively cases of physical and sexual abuse using available criminal laws , and increase its efforts to prevent and investigate the trafficking of children for forced begging .
Saudi Arabia is one 14 countries failing to do enough to stop the modern - day slave trade in prostitutes , child sex workers and forced laborers , wrote The Boston Globe on June 3 , 2005 :
Three other U.S. allies in the Middle East -- Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- were newly listed this year as nations that are failing to adequately address trafficking problems .
The State Department said the 14 countries could be subject to sanctions if they do not crack down .
Did Saudi Arabia implement the US recommendations in the meantime ?
The SF Chronicle wrote about the US administration 's conclusions three months after the publication of the State Department survey :
Of those 14 , Bush concluded that Bolivia , Jamaica , Qatar , Sudan , Togo and the United Arab Emirates had made enough improvements to avoid any cut in U.S. aid or , in the case of countries that get no American financial assistance , the barring of their officials from cultural and educational events , said Darla Jordan , a State Department spokeswoman .
Cambodia and Venezuela were not considered to have made similar adequate improvements .
But Bush cleared them nonetheless to receive limited assistance , for such things as combatting trafficking .
In the case of Venezuela  which has had a tense relationship with the United States under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez , one of Latin America 's most outspoken critics of U.S. foreign policy 
Bush also allowed funding for strengthening the political party system and supporting electoral observation .
In addition to Saudi Arabia , Ecuador and Kuwait  another U.S. ally in the Middle East  were given a complete pass on any sanctions , Jordan said .
Despite periodic differences , oil - rich Saudi Arabia and the United States have a tight alliance built on economic and military cooperation .
That left Myanmar , Cuba and North Korea as the only nations in the list of 14 barred completely from receiving certain kinds of foreign aid .
Perhaps the Bush administration did not sanction anti-American Venezuela and Saudi Arabia , because the US imports so much oil from these countries .
According to the Department of Energy :
During the first five months of 2005 , Saudi Arabia exported 1.57 million bbl/d of oil ( of which 1.51 million bbl/d was crude ) to the United States .
For this time period , Saudi Arabia ranked fourth ( after Canada , Mexico , and Venezuela ) as a source of total ( crude plus refined products ) U.S. oil imports , and third for crude only .
Saudi Arabia is eager to maintain and even expand its market share in the United States for a variety of economic and strategic reasons .
During the first five months of 2005 , Saudi Arabia 's share of U.S. crude oil imports was 14.9 percent , up from 13.9 percent during the first five months of 2004 .
The Department of Energy believes
Oil is the lifeblood of Americas economy .
Currently , it supplies more than 40 % of our total energy demands and more than 99 % of the fuel we use in our cars and trucks .
Oil , however , fuels the United States and Europe 's foes as well .
In August The Atlantic Review wrote that SUV drivers undermine US foreign policy by strengthenening anti-American and anti-democratic forces in oil rich countries .
Europe and the US seem to be addicted to oil and unable to pursue their national interests and moral principles in regard to oil - rich countries .
The Road To Lisp
Developing Lisp code on a free software platform is no mean feat , and documentation , though available , is dispersed and often too concise for users new to Lisp .
In the second part of an accessible guide to this flexible language , self - confessed Lisp newbie Martin Howse assesses practical issues and implementations under GNU / Linux
________
Lisp is as esoteric as it is powerful and coding is truly the only route to mastering the intricacies of this complex and supremely intriguing language and the rapid development model presented by its REPL ( Read Eval Print Loop ) or top - level .
Lisp masters well earn the title of wizards , and it's no coincidence that Abelson and Sussman refer to casting spells with Lisp , a common metaphor within the community and modified title of a popular beginner 's tutorial at lisperati.com .
In the first article in this series , the conceptual underpinnings of Lisp were presented , giving a flavour of the language from a cultural and theoretical perspective .
As an aside , before getting down to the real action of Lisp on a free software platform , it 's also worth stressing the importance of Lisp to thinkers and mathematicians on the bleeding edge of theory , working artistically in what are often considered wholly scientific fields .
Douglas Hofstadter , of GEB ( Godel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid ) fame provides an excellent introduction to the playfully recursive aspects of Lisp in his rich and rewarding Metamagical Themas .
And both Bruno Marchal and Gregory Chaitin , working in the fields of consciousness theory and hardcore maths and computation respectively , have expressed huge interest in the elegance of Lisp .
Aside from such lofty concerns which serve to fire the thirst for Lisp , what we 're concerned with here is getting down and dirty with some simple application or example code , say from Paul Graham 's excellent ANSI Common Lisp , and such an enterprise demands a robust and readily navigable working environment .
We 'll need to select from a plethora of free software Lisp ( and dialects such as Scheme ) implementations , choosing one which will readily suit a beginner , whilst still remaining open to others more suited to certain more demanding users and applications .
Some free software Lisps can seem brittle and over - verbose is comparison to solid , hefty common tools such as gcc , gdb and associated autobuild suite .
There 's a lot to get used to here , and the implementation should be well bonded with an IDE such as GNU Emacs .
SLIME is a contemporary solution which really does this job , and we 'll check out some integration issues , and outline further sources of Emacs enlightenment .
It 's all about identifying best of breed components , outlining solutions to common problems and setting the new user on the right course , so as to promote further growth .
And as users do develop , further questions inevitably crop up , questions which online documentation is poorly equipped to handle .
Packages and packaging from both a user and developer perspective are often badly covered if it all .
And whereas , in the world of C , everyday libraries are easy to identify , under Common Lisp this is far from the case .
Efforts such as key SBCL ( Steel Bank Common Lisp ) developer and all round good Lisp guy Dan Barlow 's cirCLe project , which aimed to neatly package implementation , IDE , documentation , libraries and packaging tools , would certainly make life easier for the newbie , but unfortunately progress does seem to have slowed on this front .
Many worlds
Without even throwing Scheme , a distinct dialect of Lisp , into the mix , and scarcely scratching the surface of smaller , more embeddable custom Lisps , the terrain of free implementations is vast and few maps exist to readily guide the newbie .
Free Common Lisps include the exotically titled Armed Bear Lisp , CLISP , a pleasant interactive Lisp , GCL , the official GNU Common Lisp and the two big hitters CMUCL ( CMU Common Lisp ) and SBCL ( Steel Bank Common Lisp ) .
Other free Lisps of note include the cool and very powerful OpenMCL , which runs on a PPC architecture under LinuxPPC or Darwin , and in the latter instance includes bindings to Cocoa and Carbon , which makes for elegant application building .
Various comparative surveys have been made of these major free Lisps , with the ubiquitous cliki .
net resource providing at - a - glance tables surveying the terrain as to features , ANSI compliance and performance across a good range of benchmarks .
Of course compliance is important , particularly if you 're interested in coding portable applications across implementations , but there are plenty for other issues which effect the choice , particularly for new users .
Once Lisp experience has been gained , other flavours can be checked out as it's obvious that some Lisps are better suited to particular projects .
Alongside portability , other pressing issues include the level of integration with a suitably powerful IDE .
In this instance SLIME ( Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs ) has been chosen as best of breed component which fits the bill here , and CMUCL , SBCL , and OpenMCL all play well here , with work in progress on CLISP .
Other key issues in assessing Lisps include the availability of functional libraries , delivery of executables and the nature of compilation .
The last is a tricky topic which involves some digging deep into how such Lisps work .
However although such technical issues do have some bearing , choosing an appropriate Lisp is a lot more about style and flavour , with factors such as verbosity and ease of re-entering the REPL or top - level as major elements here .
Under GNU / Linux on an x86 architecture , CMUCL and SBCL really are the major players , garnering most respect from the community .
It 's also worth mentioning that SBCL now offers 64 bit support for the AMD64 and EM64T platforms .
CLISP is well worth keeping in reserve , however , with good performance for some tasks , and readline providing an excellent level of command line interaction .
It 's a good , lightweight Lisp to fire up at odd moments , when you simply do n't need the burden of a fully fledged IDE .
CLISP can even be used as a shell for those who like to see Lisp everywhere .
Given that CMUCL and SBCL can readily be viewed as brothers , forking from the same stock or code base , the choice between these high performance Lisps is something of a tough one , boiling down to look and feel , and compatibility with various libraries or research apps such as Common Music .
Indeed , SBCL derives so much code from CMUCL , created at Carnegie Mellon University , that save for the confusion such a naming would cause , CMUCL has been mooted as an equally appropriate name for this vibrant offshoot .
In practise , SBCL 's rather ugly expansion into Steel Bank Common Lisp is an acknowledgement of the industries where Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon , respectively , made the money .
The name also well refers to the heavyweight , industry - strength qualities of this powerful Lisp , and though favoured by hardcore free software hackers on the Lisp scene , such as key developer Dan Barlow , SBCL lives up to the tough , heavy handed , somewhat ugly inspiration of its name .
That said , SBCL does expose a decent feature set with native threads as a major bonus , but most differences between the two siblings lie under the bonnet and relate to the differing development models of both Lisps .
Steel pulse
SBCL stresses standards compliance and maintainability through cleaner concepts and code , and perhaps as a result does appear to be undergoing more active development with ports across a vast range of architectures .
Bootstrapping has been simplified , but the major difference lies within the compiled or interpreted nature of each Lisp .
On the surface both present the standard top - level interpreter which can be used interactively , but SBCL does offer a simpler more or less compiler - only model .
In the case of CMUCL things are more complex , not to say arcane , though even digging around the internals with Common Lisp functions such as compiled - function - p , which tells us if a function has been compiled , in nearly all instances shows few differences .
CMUCL offers two levels of so - called interpretation , alongside both byte - code , for a VM ( virtual machine ) , and native or machine code compilation .
The lowest level presents a tiny baby interpreter which handles the really basic stuff like value assignment .
Next up is the fully fledged interpreter which makes use of the first stages of the byte - code compiler to convert code to a suitable internal representation .
It really behaves more like a compiler , handling expansion of all macros .
These interpreters are invoked from the interactive top - level , or when code is loaded as source .
Compilation is explicitly commanded with functions such as compile - file .
SBCL takes a similar approach , but cuts out the middleman .
In both instances , the speed of a compiled language is proffered with all the development benefits of interactive interpretation .
It 's a win win situation .
In common with CMUCL , SBCL offers a low level , basic interpreter for easy forms .
More complex stuff is thrown straight at the native compiler .
Of course it 's all still totally interactive , and compiled - function - p is our only clue that we 're not dealing strictly with an interpreter .
SBCL does present a more attractive package given its more active development model , which means that libraries and build systems are well packaged for it .
The ASDF package management system , though now ported to CMUCL , was originally an SBCL only affair , and packaging of asdf - install does reflect this .
Sockets are also easier to get to grips with under SBCL , and there 's a good deal of documentation regarding the installation and configuration of most libraries under SBCL .
On the CMUCL side , graphical support is more stable , with a stable cl- sdl library providing SDL ( Simple DirectMedia Layer ) support and excellent OpenGL bindings .
CLX , the Common Lisp Xlib , is also more mature under CMUCL .
For the beginner CMUCL presents a serious option , running in a friendlier manner out of the box and easily integrating with SLIME .
Output is less verbose and everything works well .
It 's quite simply a softer landing for the newbie , and presents fewer problems with apps such as Common Lisp Music and Common Music which present high - level Lisp - based compositional and sound processing environments .
For the more audio inclined both apps offer exciting opportunities for experimentation , alongside an easy platform for learning Lisp .
Installation of CMUCL and associated packages is a simple enough affair under either Gentoo or any apt - enabled distribution .
It 's worth mentioning that most Lispers do prefer a Debian - based distro , and many online Howtos are dedicated to this flavour .
Without digging too deep into Scheme , a small and conceptually pleasant Lisp alternative , PLT Scheme and associated DrScheme environment present a supremely usable coding platform .
Other Lisps of interest , which fulfil particular functionalities in relation to extending or embedding code include SIOD ( Scheme In One Defun ) and Guile on the Scheme side , and powerful librep , on the Lisp case .
However before considering any of these as scripting or extension language for a large scale app , it 's worth checking another approach to embedding which would make use of Lisp 's native FFI , or Foreign Function Interface , which can be used to link to any C library from Lisp code .
That said , if you do have a hefty body of C code which readily needs a scripting or interactive component , librep is a powerful solution which has been successfully adopted by apps such as the Sawfish window manager and Jade editor .
And , of course , what could be a better exercise in learning Lisp internals than rolling your own interpreter in a language of choice .
There 's plenty of material out there to assist in such a task , with the work of Abelson and Sussman once again very much to the fore .
EINE , ZWEI
Lisp can well be developed following the edit - compile - test cycle of languages such as C , with , for example , an editor providing indentation , highlighting and shell access , and any of the Lisps under consideration compiling to native code for debugging .
However , as we 've seen in the last issue , the beauty of Lisp lies in supreme interaction , with on - the - fly bugfixes a distinct possibility .
The REPL provides for this interaction in theory , but in practise an IDE which integrates with this functionality and extends it radically is very much in order for this complex language .
Such an IDE should free the coder from banal concerns with syntax and numerous shortcuts should ease repetitive actions and provide for flexible , customised development models .
Though offering highlighting and formatting , a good IDE is much more than a text editor , and should allow programmers to examine and engineer their code at a range of levels .
And the very nadir of IDEs , not to say the greatest programming environment ever , was to be found bundled with the original Lisp Machines , an important milestone in the history of Lisp and an area well worth rewarding research for the Lisp newbie .
Seasoned Lispers come over all dewy eyed at the mere mention of Genera , the OS that ran on the Symbolics Lisp Machines and which included an integrated editor , excellent GUI and a range of functionalities to examine objects and processes .
Genera is hard to beat when it comes down to integration and it's tough to give an idea of the flexibility afforded by the tight bonds between editor , object oriented programming language , GUI toolkit ( CLIM ) and the OS itself .
Genera occupies an important position both within the history of coding and Lisp itself and it's worth noting the appearance of the Emacs family in this field .
With customary hacker wit , and echoing the recursion wrapped up in the GNU acronym , the original Lisp Machine 's Emacs implementation was called EINE , standing for ' EINE Is Not EMACS ' .
And more cleverly a second version of EINE on the Lisp Machines was known as ZWEI , for ' ZWEI Was Eine Initially ' .
GNU Emacs , on which we 'll build the contemporary IDE of choice , grew from the original Multics implementation , and though thoroughly extendible using its own dialect of Lisp , elisp , is written primarily in C. Indeed , GNU Emacs is described in part by the GNU project as an elisp interpreter with extensions to support text editing .
For the sake of completeness , XEmacs , a fork of GNU Emacs which presents much of the same functionality , is worth mentioning but will not be examined in any detail .
Superior Interaction
Emacs , and particularly GNU Emacs , has spawned a rich culture , or perhaps religion , which views Emacs as a way of life .
There 's a fairly steep learning curve but built - in tutorials should take some of the burden and the two excellent O'Reilly works covering GNU Emacs use and customisation are invaluable for those seeking to get the most from this radical tool .
Online cheat - sheets and .emacs configuration files are readily available to suit all needs , and once basic text editing has been mastered , the full IDE can readily be assembled by throwing SLIME into the mix .
SLIME ( reviewed in issue 45 ) pushes Emacs as IDE further towards the Genera model , with a good deal of low level functionality for debugging purposes , cross-referencing of function callers and variables , access to online documentation and a host of completion , indentation and parentheses functions all available with a range of Lisp REPLs .
Installation is a simple enough affair and there are a good many Howtos online covering basic use .
SLIME plays well with CMUCL and SBCL , with CMUCL perhaps providing a cleaner experience .
Help for key bindings for the SLIME mode are readily accessible through the usual Emacs functions , and documentation touches on nearly all areas of SLIME use .
With such bindings mastered , and key concepts understood , SLIME really does take care of the gnarly bits for novice coders , and can well function with code examples as a good teaching aid .
Beyond the SLIME basics which are well described in both issue 45 and online , with cliki .
net again serving as central resource , SLIME also features a decent Emacs - integrated debugger and offers good levels of customisation , using the standard Emacs means .
Following the continuing rise and rise of SLIME , few would choose to deal with ilisp , the rather unfortunately titled inferior Common Lisp interface which ships with GNU Emacs .
Ilisp fulfils some of the basic functionality of SLIME in connecting Emacs to many Lisps , but is brittle in practise and does n't come close to SLIME 's feature set and flexibility .
Emacs own Lisp mode can be used aside from extending Lisp to check out basic code , though it 's worth remembering that the elisp dialect differs in major ways from Common Lisp , and newbies may well slip up on its unusual dynamic scoping .
Other IDEs or editors of note include Hemlock , CMUCL's own native Emacs - alike editor , which has inspired the elegantly titled Portable Hemlock , described in the words of the developers as " An attempt to free Hemlock from its CMUCL prison . "
On the GUI side , Jabberwocky is a major player which supports all of our free Common Lisp implementations including CLISP and boasts a decent editor , with the usual fontification , parentheses matching and indentation at work , debugger , project explorer and self - styled interaction buffer .
Only one drawback for Lisp purists though ; the GUI is pure Java , necessitating the unfortunate installation of a JDK or JRE .
Best of breed
There 's certainly a good many useful libraries which can be installed with supreme ease using well - built packaging tools such as ASDF or Common Lisp Controller .
Again , it 's all about identifying best of breed components which should see the novice Lisp programmer over most everyday hurdles .
CLX and cl-sdl have already been encountered within a graphical context , and bundled examples should make clear usage .
Cl - sdl is more in the order of a set of bindings or FFI ( Foreign Function Interface ) , and in this context it's well worth mentioning UFFI , a library which provides an extra portable layer on top of FFI .
McCLIM presents a more high - level GUI toolkit , and can readily be viewed as a free and portable implementation of CLIM , our elegant old friend from the days of Lisp Machines .
Garnet , originally developed at Carnegie Mellon , presents high level abstractions for GUI design .
Expanding the acronym gives some flavour of what to expect from this complex toolkit ; Garnet stands for Generating an Amalgam of Real - time , Novel Editors and Toolkits .
The networking side of things does present more of a minefield , with some divisions as to Lisp implementation .
Sb - bsd - sockets provides for a complete BSD sockets API , but runs only with SBCL , and the older db - sockets which would run with CMUCL is currently unsupported .
Trivial - http and trivial - sockets can satisfy basic networking needs across most of the implementations covered , and a huge range of further libraries cover specific protocols such as LDAP , SNMP and SMTP .
Though nowhere near approaching the wealth of libraries available under languages such as C , Common Lisp does have most bases covered , with support for a range of databases , regular expressions , XML , and encryption .
Using UFFI or an implementation 's native FFI , and following example code such as the cl- sdl library itself , it 's relatively easy to access C library functionalities from Lisp code .
With libraries rounding out the powerful picture of a free , practical , and complete Common Lisp environment on GNU / Linux , it 's clear that Lisp really does present a brave new choice for future coders intrigued by the wizardry which can be achieved with such a concise , expressive and elegant language .
Wrapping it up
Dealing with larger projects through breaking down code into multiple modules or packages is a brutal affair in C or C++ , with sacrifices to modularity in some instances , but at least it 's always been clear how to achieve this partitioning and well rehearsed tools and build systems do exist .
Lisp newbies may not immediately need to know how to work on large or collaborative projects , but many do feel the lack of this knowledge , and building other 's projects can be a confusing business the first time round .
Packaging and namespace are the watchwords when it comes to large - scale Lisp modularity , and the relevant Common Lisp expressions reflect the former with in - package , defpackage and use - package as major players here .
Packages provide for decent modularity , preserving separate namespaces for symbols .
A file containing a distinct package of code would commence with a defpackage which defines the new package , specifies which other packages will be used and which symbols will be exported and can thus be used without a qualifier .
A subsequent in - package makes of the following code the defined package .
Use - package allows us to access all of the exported symbols , or alternatively import can be used for specific symbols .
Packages are well documented as to their theoretical use , and once the namespace notion is well understood , are relatively easy to use , but as usual some practical issues are overlooked .
For example , package definitions will need to be loaded or defined before they can be referred to .
Load will thus be used to provide appropriate pathnames and Lisp code can easily be written to deal with things in the right order .
Peter Seibel 's excellent Practical Common Lisp , freely available online and soon to be published in print , provides the best tutorials on package gotchas .
Larger projects may well need to make use of mk - defsystem , the Lisp equivalent of make , and ASDF ( Another System Definition Facility ) , an excellent , if tersely documented , system which can even automate downloading of relevant source .
ASDF is bundled as part of SBCL , or it can be obtained with the Common Lisp Controller , which further automates the installation of libraries and source on Debian and Gentoo systems .
Again , cliki .
net is probably the main provider of documentation , and indeed itself functions as a clear component within the ASDF system .

Man killed after bomb claim at airport
Official : Air marshals fired after he approached them aggressively
Federal officials say Rigoberto Alpizar was arguing with a woman before the shooting .

Does the presence of armed air marshals make you feel safer on a plane ?

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- A 44 - year - old U.S. citizen who claimed to have a bomb was shot and killed when air marshals opened fire on a boarding bridge at the Miami airport , several sources told CNN .
No bomb was found .
American Airlines Flight 924 was in Miami on a stopover during a flight from Medellin , Colombia , to Orlando , Florida , when the man , identified as Rigoberto Alpizar , said there was a bomb in his carry - on backpack , a Department of Homeland Security official said .
Alpizar was confronted by a team of federal air marshals , who followed him down the boarding bridge and ordered him to get on the ground , the official said .
( Watch the aftermath of the shooting -- 1:36 )
When Alpizar appeared to reach into his backpack , he was shot and wounded , the official said , adding that the marshals ' actions were consistent with their training .
Officials said later that the man died of his injuries .
( Watch an air marshal talk about his extensive training -- 5:03 )
Upon investigation , there was no evidence that Alpizar had a bomb , an official said .
Alpizar was traveling with a woman and had arrived in Miami on a plane from Quito , Ecuador , federal officials said .
He and the woman began arguing before getting off the plane in Miami , two officials said .
A passenger , Mary Gardner , told WTVJ in Miami that the man ran frantically down the aisle from the rear of the plane , arms flailing , and that the woman accompanying him said that her husband was bipolar and had not taken his medication , according to The Associated Press .
After he got off the plane in Miami and went through customs , he got on the Orlando - bound plane and said he had a bomb , Air Marshal Service spokesman Dave Adams said .
( Read about air marshals being taught to avoid risk )
Air marshals asked him to get off the plane , which he did , but when they asked him to put his bag down , he refused , Adams said .
Alpizar then approached the marshals in an aggressive manner , at which point two or three shots were fired , he said .
Karlina Griffith , translating for her grandmother , witness Miriam Delgado , told WFOR television that Delgado heard three gunshots before people started running and " going crazy . " ( Watch a witness account -- :40 )
Officials could not confirm if Alpizar suffered from mental illness .
His mother - in - law told WKMG television in Orlando that he suffered from bipolar disorder , but his brother - in - law , Steven Buechner , told CNN he was unaware of any mental problems .
Alpizar moved to the United States from Costa Rica in 1986 and worked for Home Depot , Buechner said .
He and his wife had been in South America since the day after Thanksgiving to help her uncle , a volunteer dentist , Buechner said .
Alpizar and his wife lived in Maitland , Florida , just a few miles north of Orlando , and they had no children , Buechner said .
The killing marks the first time a federal air marshal has fired a weapon at an individual since the program was bolstered after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Footage from the scene showed armed SWAT team members carrying rifles outside the aircraft , along with more than a dozen police vehicles .
Paramedics were standing on the stairway to the aircraft .
Investigators took the backpack and two other pieces of Alpizar 's luggage onto the tarmac , and an explosives team blew the bag open by firing a bottle full of water at it .
The water is used to effectively defuse any explosive device by separating its components .
The Boeing 757 , which can hold about 180 passengers , was due to take off for Orlando at 2:18 p.m. ET .
It had arrived in Miami at 12:16 p.m. ET , according to the airline 's Web site .
No other flights at Miami International were disrupted Wednesday , an airport official said .
The Real Deal : The Great " Incompetency " Heist
I never cease to be amazed at the extent to which successful policies are portrayed as failed policies , and the transfer of public resources to private parties are spun as the result of government and bureaucratic “ incompetence . ”
Recent financial headlines are full of news of record profits by oil companies and strong stock performance , proof positive that the invasion of Iraq has been successful .

Those who are saying that the Bush Administration has failed in Iraq or that we are not winning the war apparently do not understand that a policy must be judged according to its goals .
If oil company profit and resulting stock market performance left any doubt , the fact that the cost of the war is expected to top $ 1 trillion should make the case .
Cost of Iraq war could surpass $ 1 trillion
By Martin Wolk , MSNBC , March 17 , 2006
A successful war policy is one that pours money into the private pockets that promoted it .
So to whom is the $ 1 trillion going ?
It appears that the Pentagon may not have to say because they are still allowed to hide behind the ruse that they and the most powerful corporate contractors and banks in the world who run their systems are not capable of maintaining a basic accounting system .
When Kelly O’Meara was writing about the $ 3.3 trillion of undocumentable adjustments at DOD , the head of the General Accounting Office committed to publish the names of the contractors responsible for the Pentagon ’s financial , accounting and payment systems .
As far as I know , this never happened .

It is worth asking the question : “ What is the relationship between the corporate contractors billing government agencies and the corporate contractors and depositories running those agency information , accounting and payment systems ? ”
One thing is clear - the combined policies of war in Iraq and a ten year refusal to maintain basic books and records have created a grand slam home run success for the Tapeworm .
The military is not alone in engineering public failure to achieve private profits for political success .
The other half of the central banking - warfare coin is engineering similar achievements .
As the price of gold reached record dollar highs last week , the Bank of England came under fire for having sold half of its gold reserves between 1999 and 2002 — a time during which the gold price was supressed by central bank market manipulations .
Hence , these sales incurred an opportunity loss of as much as $ 6.5 billion at 2006 prices .

Labour ’s sale of half the Bank of England ’s gold reserves to invest in euro and yen was ‘ impatient ’ and ‘ badly timed ’
By Jason Nissé , The Independent , May 14 , 2006
Perhaps the Bank of England ’s gold sales were not ‘ badly timed . ’
Perhaps they were beautifully timed .
Some private parties made off with a $ 6.5 billion windfall .
Would n’t you love to know who was able to buy so much gold at supressed prices ?
If someone were to ask for those transaction records , they might be hard to find .
Unanswered question : Could this explain why some dealers have been leaving the business ?
It is invaluable in understanding the world around us to assume that government is perfectly capable of being competent when it is politically desirable to the private parties that finance and operate government .
Therefore , governmental and central banking policies which continue are policies which are successful in terms of their real goals .
Hence , it should come as no suprise that the “ strong dollar ” policy is succeeding in destroying the value of the dollar :
And that the power of the IMF to dictate policies to Congress is rising :

We are watching an
epic transfer of wealth

The big financial question hanging out there is whether or not the events in and around Iran in the coming months will resolve themselves in terms of a bounce in the dollar and a significant drop in the gold price , or will the rise of precious metals and the fall of the dollar continue .
There is no way to know .
I believe it is possible to spend full time trying to understand events and still not have the reliable information we need to make an educated guess .
My advice is to be prepared to live with significant volatility either way and stay focused on building financially intimate wealth according to long term fundamentals .
Ultimately we all need to be good at predator evasion .
Other than knowing when to duck , it is wise not to spend too much time trying to figure out what the Tapeworm is up to .
Tracking the destruction of wealth ultimately detracts where our focus should be — on withdrawing our resources from the Tapeworm ’s control and investing them in financially intimate ways in a manner that shifts the game entirely .

HOUSTON , May 2 — Faulty evidence masquerading as science sent two men to death row for arson in Texas and led to the execution of one of them , a panel of private fire investigators concluded in a report released Tuesday in Austin .
The report , prepared for the Innocence Project , a legal clinic dedicated to overturning wrongful convictions , was presented to a new state panel , the Texas Forensic Science Commission , created by the Legislature last year to oversee the integrity of crime laboratories .
Barry C. Scheck , a co-director of the Innocence Project , said the report offered " important evidence of serious scientific negligence or misconduct in the investigations , reports and testimony of Texas state fire marshals " and called into question not just the two cases but also many others based on similar arson analyses .
The nine - member forensic panel , late to start up and as yet unfinanced , " will review it and investigate , " said its chairwoman , Debbie Lynn Benningfield , a fingerprint expert and retired deputy administrator of the Houston Police Department 's latent laboratory section .

A timely perspective article in Science this week addresses the issues of upper atmosphere change .
‘ Upper ’ atmosphere here is the stratosphere up to the ionosphere ( ~ 20 to 300 km ) .
Laštovička et al point out that cooling trends are exactly as predicted by increasing greenhouse gas trends , and that the increase in density that this implies is causing various ionspheric layers to ‘ fall ’ .
This was highlighted a few years back by Jarvis et al ( 1998 ) and in New Scientist in 1999 ( and I apologise for stealing their headline ! ) .
The changes in the figure are related to the cooling seen in the lower stratospheric MSU - 4 records ( UAH or RSS ) , but the changes there ( ~ 15 - 20 km ) are predominantly due to ozone depletion .
The higher up one goes , the more important the CO 2 related cooling is .
It ’s interesting to note that significant solar forcing would have exactly the opposite effect ( it would cause a warming ) – yet another reason to doubt that solar forcing is a significant factor in recent decades .
Update :
The best explanation for the cooling trends can be found on ESPERE ( alternative site ) , in particular , figure 3 ( alt. version ) .

The UK supplied Israel with quantities of plutonium while Harold Wilson was prime minister , BBC Newsnight can reveal .
Watch the report
The sale was made despite a warning from British intelligence that it might " make a material contribution to an Israeli weapons programme " .
Under Wilson , Britain also sold Israel tons of chemicals used to make boosted atom bombs 20 times more powerful than Hiroshima or even Hydrogen Bombs .
In Harold Macmillan 's time the UK supplied uranium 235 and the heavy water which allowed Israel to start up its nuclear weapons production plant at Dimona - heavy water which British intelligence estimated would allow Israel to make " six nuclear weapons a year " .
All export licensing of materials associated with civil nuclear programmes went through stringent checks across Whitehall
Foreign Office
Read the Foreign Office statement in full Last August on BBC Newsnight we revealed the first British / Israeli deal , the sale of the heavy water , but the government responded by telling the International Atomic Energy Agency the UK was not a party to any sale to Israel and that all it did was sell some heavy water back to Norway .
Hundreds of shipments Using Freedom of Information , Newsnight has obtained top secret papers .
They show Foreign Minister Kim Howells misled the IAEA and that Britain made not one , but hundreds of secret shipments of nuclear materials to Israel .
Tony Benn , who was Minister of Technology in 1966 , is shocked to learn of the sales Tony Benn became Minister of Technology in 1966 while the plutonium deal was going through .
The nuclear industry was part of his " white heat of technology " brief but no one told him that we were exporting atomic energy materials to Israel .
" I 'm not only surprised , I 'm shocked , " he says , adding that neither he nor his predecessor Frank Cousins , who was a member of CND , agreed to the sales .
Benn says he always suspected civil servants were doing deals behind his back but he never thought they would sell plutonium to Israel .
" It never occurred to me they would authorise something so totally against the policy of the government . "
Dimona Back in August 1960 covertly taken photos of a mysterious site at Dimona in Israel arrived at Defence Intelligence Staff ( DIS ) in Whitehall .
A brilliant analyst called Peter Kelly immediately realized they showed a secret nuclear reactor and he alerted the rest of British intelligence .
Kelly recognized it was a French reactor and soon discovered where the heavy water to run it had come from .
Selling plutonium to Israel was against UK government policy Britain had bought heavy water from Norsk Hydro in Norway for its nuclear weapons programme but found it was surplus to requirements and needed a buyer .
The papers obtained by Newsnight show that a company called Noratom acted as a consultant and arranged the deals in return for a 2 % commission .
Britain knew all along that Israel wanted the heavy water " to produce plutonium " and Israel paid the full military price - £ 1 million - to avoid safeguards to stop the plutonium being used to make nuclear weapons .
Kelly discovered a charade was played out with the UK and Israeli delegations sitting in adjacent rooms while Noratom ferried separate contracts to and fro so Britain could say they had n't signed a deal with Israel .
Cover story
Once the press heard about Dimona in December 1960 there was an international outcry .
Israel put out a cover story that it was a small research reactor .
This did not fool Kelly .
Using the figure of 20 tons of heavy water he estimated that Israel could build a reactor capable of producing " significant quantities of plutonium " .
Michael Crick has used Freedom of Information to obtain secret papers British intelligence learnt there was also a reprocessing plant and concluded " the separation of plutonium can only mean that Israel intends to produce nuclear weapons " .
Kelly even discovered that an Israeli observer had been allowed to watch one of the first French nuclear tests in Algeria .
Kelly and his colleagues in intelligence soon found their views about Israel were being challenged by Britain 's representative at the IAEA Mike Michaels , who worked for one of the main figures in Harold Macmillan 's Cabinet - Lord Hailsham .
Michaels received a JIC report early in 1961 estimating Israel would take at least three years to make enough plutonium and then another six months to work out how to make a bomb .
But it occurred to him that a friendly power might give Israel a small sample of plutonium to speed up the process .
" Perhaps the French have supplied a small quantity for experimental purposes as we did to the French in like circumstances some years ago , " he noted in the margin of the report .
A few years later Michaels persuaded the UK to sell Israel a small sample of plutonium when he was aware - as this note shows - that this might cut months off the time it took them to get the Bomb .
Invitation The Israeli nuclear chief , Ernst David Bergmann , personally invited Michaels to Israel .
Kelly warned Israel might use Michaels as part of a disinformation campaign to show " everything is above board " .
Michaels was given VIP treatment .
He met not only Bergmann but Shimon Peres and Prime Minister David Ben Gurion - the three fathers of the Israeli Bomb .
As Kelly suspected , Michaels ' report gave Israel the all clear and he handed it to Hailsham at a crucial time , two days before Ben Gurion met Harold Macmillan at Downing Street .
Tony
Benn thinks it inconceivable that Harold Wilson knew of atomic exports to Israel In 1962 the Dimona reactor started turning uranium into plutonium , thanks to the heavy water Britain had delivered , but Michaels continued to protest Israel 's innocence .
Then at the beginning of 1966 UK Atomic Energy Authority made what they remarkably called a " pretty harmless request " .
They wanted to export 10 milligrammes of plutonium to Israel .
The MoD strongly objected and Defence Intelligence wrote directly to say the sale might have " significant military value " .
The Foreign Office told UKAEA " It is HMG 's policy not to do anything which would assist Israel in the production of nuclear weapons " and therefore they blocked the sale .
Sale Michaels wrote angrily " to protest strongly " against the decision .
Five years earlier he had noted such a sale could speed up the Israeli bomb programme , now he was powerfully advocating just that .
He said small quantities of plutonium were not important and anyhow if we did n't sell it to the Israelis someone else would .
The Foreign Office gave in and the sale went ahead .
Kelly believes Mike Michaels knew all along that Israel was after the Bomb .
He died in 1992 .
Tony Benn is incredulous that Michaels never referred the Israeli nuclear sales to him or Frank Cousins .
They were after all the ministers in charge of Britain 's nuclear industry including imports and exports .
" Michaels lied to me .
I learned by bitter experience that the nuclear industry lied to me again and again " .
The atomic files , which have been classified until now , detail hundreds of nuclear deals with Israel flagged up as sensitive .
Benn 's initial reaction to whether Harold Wilson knew about atomic exports to Israel was " it 's inconceivable " .
Then he muses : " Harold was sympathetic to Israel , " before concluding that this was probably a conspiracy by civil servants and the nuclear industry to flout HMG policy .

Where do you find co-founders ?
Most successful startups have more than one founder , and usually the founders seem to have been friends for at least a year before starting the company .
The best way to meet co-founders is to go to school with them , so recent grads have a big advantage there .
You can also meet co-founders at work , but be careful not to violate whatever noncompete you signed .
In the old days , co-founders often met through user groups , but this seems less common now .
How can someone start a startup if they have a family to support ?
The best plan might be to start a consulting business that you can gradually morph into a startup .
This way you always have a source of income .
See How to Fund a Startup , especially the section labelled " Consulting . "
Do you know of any good books about startups ?
The how - to type of books are generally wretched .
Many are downright mistaken .
The best source of information about startups is probably not business books , but histories of particular startups and industries .
The most famous is Tracy Kidder 's Soul of a New Machine , but there are many good books of this type .
I particularly liked Sorensen 's My Forty Years with Ford .
The one book we encourage startup founders to read is Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People .
It 's critically important for anyone in business .
Try to get a used copy printed before the 1960s ; after Carnegie died , the book continued to be " updated " by a committee , and the changes were not for the better .
I 'd also recommend Franklin 's Autobiography .
I have multiple startup ideas .
How do I decide which to work on ?
Work on the one that will cause the most immediate , concrete improvement in users ' lives .
Do n't worry too much at first about competitors , or how users will find out about it , or how to make money .
But do n't work on something that 's going to take ten years , either .
( In technology , ten years rounds up to never . )
Google is a good example .
Everyone needs
Web search , and the founders probably had something that significantly improved their own ability to find stuff online within the first couple months .
And once something starts to work ( a ) it 's enormously encouraging , and ( b ) it 's much clearer what direction to take it in .
How much should a startup worry about being sued for patent infringement ?
There are two kinds of patent suits :
1. Random people suing you in the hope of getting money .
2. Competitors suing you in order to destroy you .
Until you 're successful , you wo n't have to worry about the first type .
And once you are successful , you 'll inevitably have a lot of them to deal with , valid or not .
So fatalism is the right plan for type 1 suits .
How much you should worry about type 2 suits depends on what kind of business you 're in .
You probably have to worry more about it in hardware than in software .
In software such suits are rare , so far .
So if you 're doing software , I 'd try to build something people want , and then hope for the best .
The best , in this case , being that you get big enough that you have to worry about type 1 suits .
In software , patent suits are rarely to never the deciding factor in whether a startup succeeds or not .
Founders should probably spend 100x as much time worrying about building something users wo n't want , because that kills 100 x more startups than patent problems .
See Are Software Patents Evil ? for more .
O n March 20 , 1948 , the elite of Hollywood , braving freezing temperatures and gale - force winds , filed past the newsreel cameras into the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the twentieth annual presentation of the Academy Awards .
Once inside , they discovered a stage that had been transformed into a towering birthday cake , with twenty giant Oscar statuettes in place of candles .
The studios had much to celebrate that night .
Their movies , the most democratic of all art forms , had become the principal mode of paid entertainment for the vast majority of Americans .
In an average week in 1947 , 90 million Americans , out of a total population of only 151 million , went to a movie , paying on the average forty cents for a ticket .
Nor was this massive outpouring , about two thirds of the ambulatory population , the product of expensive national marketing campaigns .
It was simply the result of regular moviegoers going to see whatever was playing at their neighborhood theaters .
Most of these moviegoers did n’t go to the theater to see a particular film .
They went to see a program that included a newsreel ; a short comedy film , such as the Three Stooges ; a serial , such as Flash Gordon ; animated cartoons , such as Bugs Bunny ; a B feature , such as a western ; and finally , the main attraction .
In 1947 in America , movie houses were more ubiquitous than banks .
There were more than eighteen thousand neighborhood theaters .
Each had only one auditorium , one screen , one speaker ( located behind the screen ) , one projection booth , and one marquee .
Every week , usually on Thursday , a UPS truck picked up the previous week ’s reels and delivered the new ones .
The new film ’s title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspapers constituted all the advertising most movies got .
Virtually all of these movies and shorts came from regional exchanges owned and operated by seven distribution companies that were , in turn , owned by seven Hollywood studios : Paramount , Universal , MGM , Twentieth Century –Fox , Warner Bros. , Columbia , and RKO .
In little over a generation , these studios had perfected a nearly omnipotent mechanism for controlling what the American public saw and heard .
It was known , collectively , as the studio system .
These studios had their common origins in the arcades , nickelodeons , and exhibition halls of the silent - film era .
Their founders , self - made and self - educated Jews , had been part of the late - nineteenth - and earlytwentieth - century wave of immigration from Eastern Europe .
They had worked at menial jobs as ragpickers , furriers , errand boys , butchers , junk peddlers , and salesmen and then gone into the business of showing movies .
Here they found an enthusiastic audience , especially among those not yet fully literate in English , and a great deal of competition for it .
To rise above their competitors , they instinctively sought what later economists would call “ economies of scale . ”
Louis B. Mayer , the founder of MGM , borrowed money to expand from a single theater in Haverhill , Massachusetts , to a small group of theaters that he combined into a “ circuit ” — so called because the reels of a single movie could be sent by bicycle from one theater to the next ( with showtimes cut so close that sometimes one theater was showing the first reel of a film while another theater was showing the last ) , allowing multiple screenings of — and multiple admissions for — the movies he rented from film exchanges .
As their circuits expanded , these entrepreneurs began opening their own film exchanges and distributing movies to other theater owners , but they still made most of their money from tickets bought at their own box office — so called because the cash went into locked boxes .
When they found that they could not get enough movies on a regular basis from independent moviemakers , these new distributors took the next step and started making their own films .
Initially , their studios were in the East , but as their production expanded after the turn of the century , they came under increased pressure from the Edison Trust , the legal entity formed by Thomas A. Edison to control the basic patents on movie cameras and projectors in America .
The Trust filed a constant stream of lawsuits against the nascent film companies , who finally decided to relocate their studios a continent ’s width away from the reach of the Trust ’s East Coast lawyers .
They chose the newly incorporated village of Hollywood , California — a place they could control — for their new home .
In less than a generation , these entrepreneurs had literally gone from rags ( or furs ) to riches .
By the 1940s , the studio heads were among the highest - paid executives in the world .
Having come from poverty , they reveled in this wealth and dubbed themselves moguls — an appellation that , although perhaps not strictly appropriate since it originally referred to absolute Moslem rulers , became part of their identity .
Louis B. Mayer , who had scavenged rags as a newly arrived immigrant and at nineteen did not have , as his son - in - law David O. Selznick later put it , “ the price of a sandwich , ” was in 1947 the highest - paid executive in America , with an annual salary from MGM of $ 1.8 million .
The studios produced nearly five hundred films in 1947 — features and B movies .
While marketing strategies varied slightly from studio to studio , the movie business in 1947 was a relatively simple affair .
The studios did not license their films to television or other media or license their characters for toys , games , T - shirts , or other merchandise .
Foreign markets provided some revenue , but that income was mostly offset by high taxes — Britain had a 75 percent import tax , for example — and most European and Asian countries had restrictions on currency repatriation .
As a result , profits from abroad were almost impossible to retrieve .
In short , studios looked to a single source for virtually all their money : the American box office .
In 1947 the six major studios earned over 95 percent of their revenue from their share of ticket sales ( called “ rentals , ” since it was technically the “ rent ” theaters paid for films ) at North American movie houses .
This came to $ 1.1 billion , which made movies , after grocery stores and automotive sales , America ’s third - largest retail business .
The studios were able to harvest this windfall extremely efficiently because they controlled almost all the movie theaters .
MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Twentieth Century–Fox , and RKO had their own theater chains , which produced about half of their total revenue , while Columbia and Universal controlled chains of theaters less directly through their distribution arms .
Among the theaters under studio control were most of the first - run houses in major cities in the United States and Canada , where films had their premieres .
During these first runs , films got their reviews , garnered publicity , and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising .
Thanks to their direct ownership of the theaters , studios were able to determine where , when , and for how long their films played in their first run .
Such engagements could extend for many months while studios prepared the subsequent release to neighborhood theaters .
For example , in 1947 , Samuel Goldwyn ’s The Best Years of Our Lives was still playing at New York ’s Astor Theater , owned by MGM through its Loews subsidiary , six months after its premiere .
In addition , the studios indirectly controlled almost all independently owned theaters , which included most of the neighborhood and secondrun movie houses , through ironclad contracts that forced the theater owners to commit to show a given number of films ( usually ten ) in a socalled block .
If they did not accept a block , they got no studio films at all — which meant they did not have the star names to attract an audience .
Only a few dozen art theaters that showed foreign films could afford to turn down this “ blind - bidding ” arrangement .
Not only were the studios able to control the bookings of their films , but they enjoyed a monopoly on the resulting revenue .
Stars , directors , writers , and other talent did not share in it .
Neither did producers .
In rare cases these participants might receive a share of the eventual profits , but never of the studio ’s rentals .
The studios were further aided by low distribution and marketing costs .
Because films opened in only a handful of theaters in major cities before moving on to other regions , the same prints and posters could be used first in the Northeast and later on in the South and West .
Distribution costs therefore were low , averaging only about $ 60,000 a film in 1947 .
Further , there were no national advertising campaigns , and since theaters paid a good part of local advertising and stars freely supplied the publicity on radio and in newsreels , the advertising budgets averaged less than $ 30,000 a picture .
What remained after these distribution and advertising costs were deducted from the rental revenue were the studios ’ net receipts .
In 1947 these totaled approximately $ 950 million .
To ensure a profit , studios obviously had to produce their films for less money than their net receipts totaled .
To maximize their economies of scale , each studio had organized what amounted to a film factory , with staff and equipment that could operate around the clock .
On their soundstages , shadowless light was cast by vast arrays of arc lamps , artificial weather was whipped up by wind , rain , and snow machines , and seas were created in indoor pools .
On their back lots , exotic locales could be replicated and filled with extras dressed from the stocks of costumes and other props stored in their warehouses .
For example , in 1947 , MGM shot the adventure movie The Three Musketeers , which was set in seventeenth - century France , entirely on its soundstages and back lots .
The studios ’ technological apparatus included synchronous background projection , which allowed them to seamlessly integrate actors in current films with stock footage from their extensive film libraries and with film shot elsewhere by second units .
They also had animation cameras to convert miniaturized models , puppets , and other replicas into the illusion of full - scale phenomena .
To do all this , a veritable army of electricians , camera operators , seamstresses , makeup artists , set dressers , sound engineers , and other technicians were paid weekly wages .
The MGM studio in Culver City , which in 1947 was the largest of the studios , could churn out on its soundstages six different films at the same time .
With the aid of these assembly - line facilities , feature films could be shot in less than a month , and some B films were shot in a week .
Under this factory system , studios were also able to keep a tight rein over their product .
Frank Capra wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1939 that “ about six producers today pass on about 90 percent of the scripts and edit about 90 percent of the pictures . ”
These producers reported to the studio chief , who was directly responsible to the studio ’s owners .
The studios also had locked up all the stars who attracted audiences to movie theaters in a contractual arrangement called the star system .
In 1947 , 487 actors and actresses — including such marquee names as Bing Crosby , Bob Hope , Betty Grable , Gary Cooper , Ingrid Bergman , Humphrey Bogart , Clark Gable , John Wayne , Alan Ladd , and Gregory Peck — were under such contracts .
Since these contracts usually ran seven years , precluded the actors from working elsewhere , and had renewal options , the stars were , for that period at least , essentially the studios ’ chattel .
They had to play every part and perform every bit of publicity assigned to them .
If they balked , they could be suspended without pay , as Lana Turner was in 1947 by MGM when she initially refused a part in The Three Musketeers .
With no further recourse and facing the prospect of not being allowed to work at the height of her stardom , she finally acceded to MGM ’s casting and played the part .
In addition , studios could rent stars out to other studios for more than their salaries and pocket the difference .
Joan Crawford , under contract to MGM , was loaned to Columbia for They All Kissed the Bride in 1942 ; and Bette Davis , under contract to Warner Bros. , was loaned to RKO for The Little Foxes in 1941 .
The contracts also usually gave the studios control of the stars ’ public image to further their publicity campaigns for their movies .
This meant , in practice , that studios could script stars ’ interviews and dictate their public utterances , photographic poses , and gossip - column items .
They could order them to alter their facial appearance , hair color , biographical details , and , as was commonly done , their name .
Issur Danielovitch , for example , had his name changed to Kirk Douglas , Marion Morrison to John Wayne , and Emanuel Goldenberg to Edward G. Robinson .
In return , the studios provided their contract actors with an annual salary , roles in major films , and publicity in the media that they owned or controlled , which included newsreels and fan magazines .
Whatever publicity benefits stars enjoyed by being contractually linked to a studio , however , their salaries were relatively low compared with the additional revenue they produced at the box office .
In 1947 even highly successful stars , such as Clark Gable , made on averag less than $ 100,000 a film .
Until their contracts ran their course , stars could not increase their fees as they became more popular with audiences and more prominent in the entertainment media .
The star system , in effect , allowed the studios to brand their products via the personas they had created — for example , a James Cagney gangster film , a Roy Rogers western , a Clark Gable romance — and take the full profits from them .
By locking in actors ’ salaries , Hollywood studios were able to control the cost of manufacturing their products .
Indeed , virtually all their films made money .
Since the average cost of producing a film in 1947 , including all studio overhead , was only $ 732,000 , and the average net receipts for a studio feature amounted to $ 1.6 million , filmmaking was a lucrative enterprise for studios .
Less successful films might eke out a profit of only a few thousand dollars , but the hits that appealed to a broad adult audience , like The Best Years of Our Lives , made profits in excess of $ 5 million .
But the studio moguls wanted more from their invention than mere profits .
Not entirely secure with their rapid ascent to wealth , they also wanted the kind of respect , admiration , and status that would reinforce their position .
This social part of the equation had been formally recognized some twenty years earlier , in 1927 , at a dinner at the Ambassador Hotel , when Louis Mayer had proposed to thirty - five other top studio executives that they institute a way to honor Hollywood ’s ( i.e. , their own ) achievements .
The result was the establishment of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and its annual ritual of bestowing honors in the form of Academy Awards .
The Oscar for the Best Motion Picture of 1947 went to Twentieth Century – Fox ’s Gentleman ’s Agreement .
Adapted from the book of the same title by Laura Z. Hobson , the black - and - white film included the studio contract players Gregory Peck , Celeste Holm , John Garfield , and Dorothy McGuire .
The Moss Hart script , like those of most of Hollywood ’s feature films , had all the elements of a classic narrative : a beginning , a middle , and an end ; rising and falling action ; conflict , confrontation , and resolution .
It also had a character with whom the audience could readily identify in Philip Green ( Gregory Peck ) , a gentile magazine writer who pretended to be Jewish so he could report firsthand on anti- Semitism .
The conflict was almost entirely an intellectual one , resolved without mayhem or bloodshed .
Nor was there any sex , nudity , profanity , or even suggestive language , all of which was proscribed by the studios ’ own censorship system .
Director Elia Kazan also won an Oscar for Gentleman ’s Agreement .
The thirty - eight - year - old stage director had been retained by Twentieth Century – Fox after the studio had bought the book , commissioned and approved Moss Hart ’s script , and assigned all the major roles to its contract stars .
Like almost all other directors under the studio system , Kazan arrived at the beginning of principal photography and departed when it ended .
The director ’s job was to exact the best performance from the actors and technicians within a shooting schedule prepared by the studio .
Twentieth Century–Fox executives , including studio head Darryl F. Zanuck , reviewed Kazan ’s daily progress during the twelve weeks of production .
Zanuck then supervised the film ’s editing and musical score .
Absolute authority over the creative process had been invested in the studio head ever since Irving Thalberg at MGM had perfected the system in the late 1920s .
Zanuck had produced 170 of Fox ’s films , and Gentleman ’s Agreement , which he had supervised from start to finish , was no exception .
When Kazan accepted the Oscar for Gentleman ’s Agreement that night , the film was still , four months after opening at the Mayfair Theater in New York , in its first run .
Even at this point , without having yet moved to neighborhood theaters , it had already earned back the $ 2 million it had cost to make .
Although it was a cerebral film intended mainly for adults , it could reasonably be expected to draw a much larger audience once it was released more widely because , like all studio features , it would be part of a theater program that included a B film for teenage audiences and cartoons for children .
On that cold night in March 1948 , all the signs seemed to indicate that the system was still operating almost flawlessly , and many of the old faces were there to attest to it .
For the Academy Awards ’ twentieth anniversary , all the original moguls were present except Carl Laemmle , the founder of Universal , who had died , and William Fox , the founder of Twentieth Century – Fox , who , after nearly succeeding in taking over MGM in 1929 , had gone bankrupt and then to prison for attempting to bribe a judge in his bankruptcy case .
But if there is one lesson Hollywood teaches , it is that looks can be deceiving , and in 1948 the world of American moviemaking was on the verge of radical and irreversible change .
Although it was not evident in their demeanor that night , the power elites gathered at the awards ceremony knew that ominous storm clouds were amassing on the horizon .
Hollywood was becoming the principal target of the House Un- American Activities Committee ’s efforts to uncover Communist subversion .
In 1947 a large number of writers , actors , and directors had been called before the committee and asked to name subversives in the film industry .
Many of those who refused to cooperate were then cited for contempt of Congress , and ten of them , the so - called Hollywood Ten , had to choose between prison and flight from the country .
Caught in this bind , many leading writers — including Joseph Losey , Ben Barzman , and Donald Ogden Stewart — had moved abroad to avoid being subpoenaed .
The studios , rather than defying the congressional inquisition , had declared that anyone who invoked his or her constitutional right against self - incrimination or refused to cooperate by naming names would be fired and blacklisted .
The Screen Actors Guild , headed by Ronald Reagan , in turn supported the studios , which had hired ex–FBI agents to help them weed out employees who had a politically suspect past .
The smiles and jokes during the awards ceremony notwithstanding , the ugly issue of what constituted loyalty was threatening to tear apart the social fabric of the film community .
Another cloud was even darker and more threatening .
For nearly ten years , in U.S. v. Paramount et al. , the Justice Department had been pressing an antitrust suit against the studios , alleging that the studios ’ control over the means by which movies were distributed and exhibited constituted an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act .
The lower courts had decided in favor of the Justice Department , and the studios were running out of appeals .
To settle the case , the government had demanded that the studios end their block booking and divest themselves of either their distribution arms or their theaters .
In either case , they would lose control over what was shown — and that control , as every studio owner realized , was the jugular of the studio system .
RKO — the weakest of the studios — was on the verge of breaking ranks and signing a consent decree .
If it did , the other studios would come under tremendous , if not irresistible , pressure to follow suit .
And once they did , the studio system would be dead .
The darkest cloud on the horizon , however , was the advent of an alternative entertainment medium : television .
To be sure , at that point the new technology offered only a few hours of primitive programming a day in black and white , but it offered that at no cost to the consumer .
Advertisers , not the audience , paid the broadcasters .
The Hollywood studios had attempted to hobble this infant medium , if not kill it , by refusing to let the networks show films from their libraries or use their facilities to produce programs .
Nevertheless , the television broadcasters were finding alternatives : live sports , news , game shows , and independent movies .
And , although there were only 1 million sets in American homes in 1947 , television manufacturers were expecting that number to quadruple by 1949 .
If these projections were realized , it would only be a matter of time before a good part of the 90 million people who paid to see movies at theaters would choose instead to watch free television .
Since the studios were almost entirely dependent on this audience for their revenues , any substantial decrease would be an economic disaster .

The US has the oldest film industry and largest in terms of revenue .
Los Angeles is the primary mecca for the American film industry .
Other cities are known for there influence in the film industry New York City is a classic filming destination as well as Las Vegas .
Las Vegas and New York
have the flare and appeal that many directors and producers love .
These directors and producers have made hotels in New York City as well as Las Vegas hotels famous throughout the world .
The Plaza hotel and MGM Grand are just two hotels made famous by movies .
Last month , Bennett Haselton , the founder of Peacefire.org , a Web site that promotes open access on the Internet , got an e-mail message from a Los Angeles Times reporter who was writing an article about online censorship .
The reporter was unable , from The Times 's newsroom , to access Mr. Haselton 's site , which also offers instructions on how to get around software installed to block Web site access .
To make sure the block was not a fluke , Mr. Haselton sent a query to other Times reporters to ask if they , too , had failed to reach Peacefire.org from their work computers .
Some reported that they could not access Playboy.com or Penthouse.com .
" It just seemed odd that the class of people that we rely on for our information have less Internet freedom than a citizen in China , " said Mr. Haselton , adding that this was the first time he had heard of blocking software at a newspaper .
" We rely on reporters for our information of what 's going on in society , and they can't necessarily do their job if a third party is deciding what they can see . "
The reporter who initially contacted Mr. Haselton could not be reached for a comment .
But David Garcia , the director of media relations for The Times , disputed the claim that reporters could not access Playboy.com .
Gas - saving tips put to the test
Edmunds.com tests common fuel - saving wisdom and finds some changes make little difference .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Common gas - saving tips were put to the test recently by Edmunds.com , CNN.com 's automotive content partner .
While most , it turned out , actually did save gas , some of the fuel - saving advice you commonly hear did n't make much difference at all .
Drivers took two different vehicles on the same 56 - mile route eight times under various conditions .
The vehicles , both Ford Motor Co. products , were a 2005 Ford Mustang GT and a Land Rover LR3 SE .
Both have V - 8 engines .
The Mustang 's EPA - estimated mileage is 15 in the city and 25 on the highway while the Land Rover 's is 14 in the city and 18 on the highway .
In ordinary driving , most vehicles usually get about 15 percent lower gas mileage than EPA estimates indicate .
Using cruise control
Drivers are often advised to use cruise control during long highway drives on level roads .
The idea is that it prevents " speed creep " -- the tendency to gradually start going faster the longer you drive -- and cuts down on other unnecessary speed changes which can eat up gas .
In Edmunds.com 's test , the Land Rover got almost 14 percent better mileage using cruise control set at 70 miles per hour rather than cruising at driver - controlled speeds between 65 and 75 miles per hour .
The Mustang got 4.5 percent better mileage with cruise control .
Verdict :
It works
Roll up windows , use A / C
When driving on the highway , most of a vehicle 's power is used simply to overcome aerodynamic drag .
On the other hand , air conditioning also uses a lot of power .
Drivers are often told that keeping the windows rolled up , which significantly reduces drag , and using air conditioning actually results in better fuel economy than driving at high speeds with the windows open .
In fact , CNN / Money has offered the same advice in a story we 've run on our site .
In Edmunds.com 's test , conducted at a steady 65 miles per hour , " windows down " or " A / C on " made virtually no difference in mileage .
The Mustang got 4.1 percent better mileage -- 30.7 mpg vs. 29.5 mpg -- with the windows down .
The Land Rover got 1.6 percent better mileage with the windows down , a difference of just 0.3 miles per gallon .
Basically , the extra fuel used by the air conditioner is made up for in improved aerodynamics at high speeds .
Your not really saving any fuel but , at least on the highway , the A/C is n't costing you appreciably either .
Verdict : No difference
Avoid hard acceleration
You 've probably been told before that rushing up to stop lights and racing away from them wastes gas .
Turns out it wastes a whole lot of gas , according to Edmunds .
com 's test .
Slowing zero - to - sixty times to 20 seconds instead of 10 to 15 seconds makes a big difference in mileage over the long term .
Braking slowly and gently helps , too .
Driving the Land Rover gently resulted in a 35.4 percent increase in gas mileage while feather - footing the Mustang garnered a 27.1 percent mileage increase .
Verdict : Big difference
Properly inflate tires
Not having enough air in the tires can cause a number of problems , including a potentially dangerous blow - out .
But it also reduces gas mileage .
In Edmunds.com 's test , the mileage improvement with properly inflated tires , compared to slightly under - inflated ones , was slight but noticeable in the Land Rover but non-existent in the Mustang .
Still , for safety 's sake , keep enough air in your tires .
Verdict : Small impact on mileage
Full story from Edmunds.com
Front-ends are present in all applications that process source code compilers , interpreters , linters , and the like .
Common beliefs about the design of front - ends are that they are made up of phases ( lexical , syntactic , and semantic analysis ) , are largely decoupled , and that lexical analysis consists of regular - expression matching .
When these assumptions are true , the design of a parser is facilitated .
Unfortunately , these assumptions are n't always true in the real world .
In this article , I discuss the design of a front - end for ANSI C , and show the pitfalls that make it trickier than you 'd expect .
Myth # 1 : Front - Ends Are Made Up of Independent Phases
A front - end is a program that accepts text input and produces a representation of that text in a desired forman abstract syntax tree , for instance .
Again , front - ends are present in any application that manipulates source code in a nontrivial way compilers , interpreters , pretty printers , code analyzers ( such as splint or Purify ) , and so on .
Anyone who has taken a compiler course recognizes the classic flow diagram of a front - end in Figure 1 .
It includes three phases lexical , syntax , and semantic analysis .
The lexer and parser recognize the word - level and phrase - level structure of the input text .
The lexer splits the undifferentiated stream of characters of the input program ( after preprocessing , if any ) into a sequence of tokens , each belonging to a well - defined category such as keyword , operator , literal constant , identifier , or type name .
For example , the lexer determines that the consecutive characters " += " constitute a single operator , rather than two separate " + " and " = " operators , and that " 18.52 " is a floating - point literal constant rather than the two integer literal constants " 18 " and " 52 " with a dot punctuator in the middle .
The parser recognizes the language constructs ( expressions , statements , declarations , and so on ) , and usually outputs the syntax tree corresponding to the program .
Traditionally , lexers and parsers are obtained automatically by running tools such as flex and bison over a set of specifications .
Lexers are specified as a set of actions , each associated to a regular expression ; parsers are specified as a set of actions , each associated to BNF syntax rules .
Finally , the semantic analyzer contains all the remaining application - dependent algorithms , which implement context checks ( for example , making sure that there are no nested function definitions in a C program ) and connect to the back - end .
Unfortunately , Figure 1 can be misleading in suggesting that the three phases lexer , parser , semantics are independent and operate sequentially without overlaps .
In fact , the input can first be entirely tokenized , then its syntax tree derived , and finally all the semantics evaluated on top of this tree .
Consequently , you 'd think you could design the lexer , parser , and semantic analyzer as separate , distinct problems .
While this might be true for simple languages and applications ( such as command - line calculators ) , it is n't true for complex languages like C . For C , it is n't even possible to complete the lexical analysis of a token before some semantic analysis has been completed for the preceding input .
For instance :
typedef unsigned long int ulint_t ;
contains the declaration of a user type ulint_t .
Parsing this declaration according to the grammar of C leads to the parse tree in Figure 2 ( a ) , where ulint_t must be tokenized as an IDENTIFIER .
( I write tokens such as " IDENTIFIER " in uppercase to differentiate them from nonterminal symbols in the grammar , such as " expression , " " statement , " and " type_name " ) .
As a consequence of the type declaration , if this declaration is encountered :
ulint_t my_ul_int ;
ulint_t must be tokenized not as an IDENTIFIER ( as before ) , but as a TYPE_NAME .
The syntax tree of this declaration is in Figure 2 ( b ) .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
C lets you define new type names , and the standard C grammar is based on this distinction .
Therefore , lexers must be able to actively enforce this distinction .
Simple solutions to circumvent this difficulty do not help .
For example , a lazy solution may abolish the distinction between IDENTIFIER and TYPE_NAME , and consider each name an IDENTIFIER , adapting the grammar accordingly .
This solution fails , however , because it makes the grammar ambiguous , so that some declarations or statements may be parsed in multiple , inconsistent ways .
Two points are clear :
Lexers based on regular - expression matching alone cannot do the job .
More intelligence is needed .
The lexer needs to know the entire set of declarations and definitions , which are visible in the current scope .
Lexers must access the symbol tables associated with the previous input in a way that is consistent with the scoping rules of the language .
Unlike simple languages , for which the symbol table is entirely the semantic phase 's business , the lexer operates on the basis of the information in the symbol table .
Symbol tables cannot be maintained by lexers alone ; therefore , lexers , parsers , and semantic actions cannot operate sequentially .
They must work in an intertwined way .
Symbol tables cannot be maintained by lexers because understanding the structure of the declarations and definitions is the parser 's job , and processing them is the responsibility of the semantic layer .
This leads to the structure in Figure 3  a call graph representing the simplified structure of a front - end developed with flex and bison .
The application - specific code calls the parser ( traditionally , function yyparse ( ) ) just once to parse the entire input .
The parser calls the lexer ( function yylex ( ) ) as many times as there are input tokens in the input text .
Every time the parser recognizes a syntax rule , an appropriate semantic action is triggered .
If a declaration is recognized by the parser , the corresponding action adds a new entry in the symbol table .
The new entry is visible to the lexer the next time it is invoked to fetch the following token , and it may influence whether the token is categorized as IDENTIFIER or TYPE_NAME .
NASA Extends Prize Funding for Space Elevator Challenges to 5 Years
Press Release From : Spaceward Foundation
Posted : Tuesday , October 3 , 2006
Purses Furnished by NASA Centennial Challenges Totals $ 4 Million
Mountain View , CA - The Spaceward Foundation in collaboration with NASA today announced a significant expansion of the Power Beaming and Tether Challenges .
These two events are collectively known as the Space Elevator Games as they focus on the two key technologies needed to build the Space Elevator .
The new agreement expands the time - frame of both the Beam Power and the Tether Challenges from one year to five years through the year 2010 , and provides incrementally larger total purses for years two through five above the $ 200 K purse in year one for each contest .
For the second through the fifth years , the total prize purses to be offered for each competition each year are $ 300 K , $ 400 K , $ 500 K , and $ 600 K , respectively .
Who : The Spaceward Foundation , who is about to run the 2006 Space Elevator games .
What : Announcing ten - fold increase in NASA - provided prize purse , to $ 4,000,000 over the next 5 years .
When :
The competition is annual through 2010 .
Where : Mountain View , CA
Why :
This lays the foundation to a solid 5 - year plan that will foster the development of core Space Elevator technologies .
" This is a substantial commitment to our program " said Ben Shelef , Founder of the Spaceward Foundation .
" The expanded prize purse and the 5 year commitment will attract serious attention to the research and development effort needed to build the Space Elevator . "
The event is to be held annually in conjunction with the X - PRIZE Cup in Las Cruces , New Mexico in October .
The Tether Challenge centers on the creation of a material that combines light weight and incredible strength .
Under this challenge , teams will develop high strength materials , such as carbon nanotube - based fabrics that will be stretched in a head - to - head competition to see which tether is strongest .
The Beam Power Challenge focuses on the development of wireless power transmission technologies for a wide range of exploration purposes , such as human lunar exploration and long - duration Mars reconnaissance .
In this challenge , teams will develop wireless high - power transmission systems , including beam transmitters and receivers , to power robotic climbers and payloads to the top of a multi-story cable .
Racing against the clock , the climber who carries the largest payload to the top in the shortest period of time wins the competition .
" Technology developments from these competitions have the potential to directly impact the Vision for Space Exploration , " said Ken Davidian of NASA 's Centennial Challenges program .
" NASA is already benefiting a great deal from the amount of high - quality energy and innovation poured into all the Centennial Challenges competitions , and that 's before any team has even won a prize !
The amazing part is that it's all coming from a wide variety and large number of individuals and groups that NASA does n't normally reach , " he said .
" We are thrilled with our partnership with NASA and we 're excited to take the Tether and Beam Power challenges to the next level , " said Meekk Shelef , president of the Spaceward Foundation .
' Building on our success of the 2005 competitions , we expect to continue to expand the scope of the event .
This new commitment will allow us to increase our public outreach for these vital emerging space technologies .
Most importantly , we must reach the next generation of budding engineers who will be the ones that actually build a space elevator !'
The space elevator concept was first introduced in the 1960s and has only recently garnered serious attention due to advances in materials and power transfer technologies .
If built , a Space Elevator would provide a safe , low cost , way to launch payloads such as satellites into orbit .
The Spaceward Foundation is a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit educational organization dedicated to furthering the cause of emerging space technologies and space access in educational curriculums and the public .
NASA 's Centennial Challenges promotes technical innovation through a novel program of prize competitions .
It is designed to tap the nation 's ingenuity to make revolutionary advances to support the Vision for Space Exploration and NASA goals .
The Centennial Challenges program is managed by NASA 's Innovative Partnerships Program Office .

Republicans are so afraid to run on their merits that they continue to resort to dirty tricks .
Listen to this robocall ( . WAV ) being sent to Virginia voters :
Tim Daly from Clarendon got a call saying that if he votes Tuesday , he will be arrested .
A recording of his voicemail can be found online at : www.webbforsenate.com/media/phone_message.wav
The transcript from his voicemail reads : " This message is for Timothy Daly .
This is the Virginia Elections Commission .
We 've determined you are registered in New York to vote .
Therefore , you will not be allowed to cast your vote on Tuesday .
If you do show up , you will be charged criminally . "
Daly has been registered to vote in Virginia since 1998 , and he has voted for the last several cycles with no problem .
He has filed a criminal complaint with the Commonwealth 's attorney in Arlington .
More from the Webb campaign ( from an email ) :
Widespread Calls , Allegedly from " Webb Volunteers , " Telling Voters that their Polling Location has Changed .
A couple of examples : a. Norman Cox has been registered to vote in the same location in Arlington since 1972 .
Someone from a 406 number ( in Montana ) called to tell him that his polling place has changed .
[ Note : The Webb Campaign is NOT making any such phone calls . ]
Cox said he believed that he was being mislead and the caller hung up .
b. Peter Baumann in Cape Charles , VA ( North Hampton ) got a similar call from a " Webb volunteer " saying his polling location had changed .
He said : No , I 'm a poll worker and I know where I vote .
The girl -- who was calling from California - - hung up .
The Secretary of the State Board of Elections Jean Jensen has logged dozens of similar calls , finding heavy trends in Accomack County ( middle peninsula ) and Essex County ( outer peninsula ) [ as reported by the counties ' registrars ] .
3 ) Fliers in Buckingham County Say " SKIP THIS ELECTION " ( paid for by the RNC ) have caused many in the African American community to call the Board of Elections to see if the election is still on .
The full tag line says : " SKIP THIS ELECTION ... ( and then in smaller print ) : Do n't Let the Tax and Spend Liberals Win . "
4 ) Voter Machine Problems . a .
On many ballots in heavily Democratic neighborhoods , Jim 's name is cut off .
The ballots say : " James H. ( Jim ) " with no Webb . b. New reports that ballots in Essex County have Jim 's name split on 2 pages .
The " James H ( Jim ) " on one page , " Webb " on the next .
c. Reports of voting machines in Isle of White that do not provide a clear image of the ballot , making voting a challenge .
Voting issues need to be a foremost priority in the next Congress .
This is unconscionable .
And the best solution , by far , is still the Oregon vote - by - mail model .
People over 30 should be dead Wednesday , 07/09/03 04:37 PM
Received from my Mom , who passed it on from one of her friends .
Yeah , I was raised this way , I should probably be dead , too :)
According to today 's regulators and bureaucrats , those of us who were kids in the 40's , 50's , 60's , or even maybe the early 70's probably should n't have survived .
Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead - based paint .
We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles , doors or cabinets , and when we rode our bikes , we had no helmets .
( Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking . )
As children , we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags .
Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat .
We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle .
Horrors !
We ate cupcakes , bread and butter , and drank soda pop with sugar in it , but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing .
We shared one soft drink with four friends , from one bottle , and no one actually died from this .
We would spend hours building our go - carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill , only to find out we forgot the brakes .
After running into the bushes a few times , we learned to solve the problem .
We would leave home in the morning and play all day , as long as we were back when the street lights came on .
No one was able to reach us all day .
No cell phones .
Unthinkable !
We did not have Playstations , Nintendo 64 , X - Boxes , no video games at all , no 99 channels on cable , video tape movies , surround sound , personal cell phones , personal computers , or Internet chat rooms .
We had friends !
We went outside and found them .
We played dodge ball , and sometimes , the ball would really hurt .
We fell out of trees , got cut and broke bones and teeth , and there were no lawsuits from these accidents .
They were accidents .
No one was to blame but us .
Remember accidents ?
We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it .
We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms , and although we were told it would happen , we did not put out very many eyes , nor did the worms live inside us forever .
We rode bikes or walked to a friend 's home and knocked on the door , or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them .
Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team .
Those who did n't had to learn to deal with disappointment .
Some students were n't as smart as others , so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade .
Horrors !
Tests were not adjusted for any reason .
Our actions were our own .
Consequences were expected .
The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of .
They actually sided with the law .
Imagine that !
This generation has produced some of the best risk - takers and problem solvers and inventors , ever .
The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas .
We had freedom , failure , success and responsibility , and we learned how to deal with it all .
And you 're one of them !
Congratulations !
Please pass this on to others who have had the luck to grow up as kids , before lawyers and government regulated our lives for our own good ....
Does n't it kind of make you want to run through the house with scissors ?
Introduction
Electronic digital computers moved out of science fiction and into reality during World War II .
Less powerful than a modern pocket calculator , the first real job for these massive machines was to speed up the calculation of artillery firing tables .
Thirty years later , computers had firmly cemented themselves in the public imagination .
They were huge boxes , covered with blinking lights and whirring reels of tape .
Banks and big corporations all had computer rooms , closely guarded by a priesthood of programmers and administrators .
Science fiction novels and movies imagined impossibly brilliant supercomputers that guided spaceships and controlled societies , yet they were still room - sized behemoths .
The idea of a personal computer , something small and light enough for someone to pick up and carry around , was n't even on the radar .
Even the major computer companies at the time did n't see the point of small machines .
The mainframe industry was dominated by IBM , who was the Snow White to the Seven Dwarves of Burroughs , CDC , GE , Honeywell , NCR , RCA and Univac .
Mainframes took up entire floors and cost millions of dollars .
There was also a market for slightly smaller and less expensive minicomputers , machines the size of a few refrigerators that sold for under a hundred thousand dollars .
This industry was dominated by Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) , with strong competitors such as Data General , Hewlett - Packard and Honeywell - Bull .
None of these companies considered the personal computer to be an idea worth pursuing .
ENIAC , the second electronic digital computer , circa 1943
It was n't that the technology was n't ready .
Intel , at the time primarily a manufacturer of memory chips , had invented the first microprocessor ( the 4 - bit 4004 ) in 1971 .
This was followed up with the 8 - bit 8008 in 1972 and the more - capable 8080 chip in 1974 .
However , Intel did n't see the potential of its own product , considering it to be useful mainly for calculators , traffic lights , and other embedded applications .
Intel had built a reference design with a microprocessor and some memory that could be programmed using a terminal , but it was used for testing purposes only .
An Intel engineer approached chairman Gordon Moore with the idea for turning it into a consumer product , but Moore , with a rare lack of insight , could n't see any practical purpose for such a device and decided not to go ahead with the project .
The task of inventing the personal computer , and with it the personal computer industry , was left instead to the manager of a small , little - known calculator company in Albuquerque , New Mexico .
His name was Ed Roberts .

ave you heard about Ruby ?
It seems to be a popular topic in software development circles today .
This language came to my attention at a Java conference last spring , where gentlemen like Bruce Tate ( author of Bitter Java and Better , Faster , Lighter Java ) , Dave Thomas ( Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master ) , and others were all talking about Ruby and telling many of us in the audience it deserved a look .
Now , if you are like me , you 've been developing software for some time and you know that while learning a new programming language can be fun , you 've been through enough of them that you probably look a little skeptically at another programming language .
After all , the programming language wars in the ' 80s and '90s culminated in the conclusion that there are essentially two camps : the Java world and the development languages that Microsoft supported on .
NET .
Its not that I did n't want to learn another language , I just expected that the days of switching programming languages to gain a technological advantage were over .
However , given the stature of these gentlemen in the industry , I decided to take a look .
Well , " I 've been to the mountain top " so to speak and this article is a report on what I 've found regarding Ruby .
Bottom line up front , Ruby has some very nice features and is worth your investigation .
Setting Up Ruby
Ruby is an open source programming language developed by Yukihiro " Matz " Matsumoto in Japan in the mid-90s ( for more on the history of Ruby , check out this article by its founder .
Ruby can be obtained at www.ruby-lang.org.
Originally built as a scripting language , it is available for many platforms , including Linux , many flavors of UNIX , MS - DOS , Windows , BeOS , Amiga , Acorn Risc OS , and MacOS X .
As of this writing , the latest version of Ruby is 1.8.4 .
For those using Windows platforms , click here for the " one- click " Windows installer .
Along with the base Ruby binaries and libraries , this download comes with several helpful ( and free ) IDEs and tools , including : documentation and sample code , RubyGems Package Manager , FreeRIDE ( Free Ruby IDE ) , Fox GUI Libraries , fxri ( a search engine and GUI guide to Ruby 's documentation , along with an interactive command line tool ) , and SciTE ( Scintilla Text Editor IDE ) .
As of this writing , the " stable " version of Ruby offered through the Windows installer is 1.8.2 , with a 1.8.4 version in preview form .
This article was written using the 1.8.2 version of the Windows installer .
The installation of Ruby using the Windows installer is straightforward .
You download and run a simple install executable ( ruby182-15.exe for version 1.8.2 ) that initiates a standard install wizard .
The download file is about 15MB and will take up almost 40 MB when the wizard completes the install of Ruby on your Windows platform .
For those dedicated to using their favorite editors to program , a number of familiar editors offer Ruby support to include emacs , vim , JEdit , Jed , Nedit , and Textpad .
Of course , there is also a Ruby Eclipse project .
Ruby Development Tools ( RDT ) is an Eclipse plug - in that is still early in development but available here .
Also emerging on the market are a number of inexpensive Ruby IDEs .
Arachno Ruby is one such example .
George W. Bush was once known as the C.E.O .
President , a term his handlers eagerly coined in order to convey that the country would from now on be run like a business .
That quickly evolved into the less flattering ... then the War President ... now it 's looking like we can all finally settle on one .
George W. Bush : the Disaster President .
" I do n't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees . "
He honestly said that .
If that brings up more than a passing twinge of familiarity , being a more than remarkable restatement of Condi Rice 's now - famous assertion to the Senate panel -- then I suppose we should n't be surprised .
But it does bring up something that we joke about often , but apparently have never taken quite seriously enough : our President is an idiot .
I do n't mean an average , run - of - the - mill idiot .
I mean an idiot who apparently , for the entire duration of his presidency , literally was paying absolutely no attention to even the most life - threateningly critical tasks of government .
The administration specifically cut the funds to fix these specific levees , in order to specifically divert that Corps money to Iraq , despite urgent warnings and predictions of catastrophic disaster if the levees were breeched .
The administration specifically cancelled the Clinton - backed flood control program to preserve and restore the wetlands between New Orleans and the gulf , instead specifically opening parts of that buffer zone for development .
Nobody anticipated this disaster ?
It was identified by FEMA as one of the top three likeliest major disasters to strike America .
( That link , one of countless stories , was from 2001 , by the way . )
It has been a major disaster scenario for years .
Everybody anticipated it , which makes this single statement by George W. Bush possibly the most dishonest , lying , craptacularly false thing he has ever said in his presidency -- even surpassing his now - infamous State of the Union Address .
Truly , this is President Bush 's blue - dress moment .
And yet , funneling the money into Iraq was more important .
You better bet your crapulent , lying , one - track , drink - addled ass that 's a political issue .
He also said today :
" I hope people do n't play politics at this time of a natural disaster the likes of which this country has never seen . "
Oh , I 'm touched .
Utterly touched .
After 9/11 , the entire Republican Party went en masse to get Twin Towers ass tattoos .
The Republican convention was a wholesale tribute to crass exploitation , the sets themselves designed to evoke the aftermath of the attack .
Every domestic and international policy this administration -- no , this entire Republican government -- has produced has been heaved up before the public while waving the spectre of 9/11 as the catch - all vindication of every administration whim .
Every tax cut , every civil rights issue , every budget cut , every budget expansion , no matter how tortured the logic must be , has some Republican senator standing on the Senate floor and proudly raping the corpses of that day as justification for their particular agenda item .
Oh , we 've seen politicization of disaster .
Every Republican campaign for the last four years has revolved around the politicization of disaster .
But Lord help us , George W. Bush is going to get the vapors if anyone asks him to explain his administration 's active cuts of the very programs designed to keep New Orleans safe .
The PlayStation 3 is released in November
Sony has teamed up with US biologists who already run the distributed computing project , folding@home ( FAH ) .
The project harnesses the capacity of thousands of PCs to examine how the shape of proteins , critical to most biological functions , affect disease .
FAH say a network of PS3s will allow performance similar to supercomputers .
With 10,000 machines joined together the researchers calculate they should be able to do a thousand trillion calculations per second .
If that was achieved it would be nearly four times as fast as the world 's most powerful supercomputer , IBM 's BlueGene / L System , capable of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
Complex problems
Distributed computing is a way of solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
CELL SPECS 256 billion calculations per second 2.5MB of on - chip memory Able to shuttle data to and from off - chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors
The Cell 's hard sell
Volunteers download a piece of software that uses their PC or PS3's processing power when it is idle .
In this way small packets of data can be crunched by individual machines , before being automatically fed back over the internet to a central computer where all of the results can be viewed together .
The method is already used by scientists examining millions of simulations of how malaria spreads to look for ways to control the disease .
Other groups are searching through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
Biological processes
The FAH uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
The way in which proteins contort underpins almost every biological process .
When they do not fold correctly they can cause diseases such as Huntington 's , Parkinson 's disease , and many cancers .
Scientists still do not entirely understand how or why this process occurs .
To try to gain a better understanding , scientists need to simulate the complex folding process .
However , although a fold may take just ten millionths of a second ( 10 microseconds ) in the body , it takes far longer to simulate on a computer .
An average PC would take all day just to simulate just one billionth of a second ( one nanosecond ) of protein folding , and 10,000 days to simulate a complete fold .
Dividing the problem up allows the researchers to speed through many more simulations .
Advanced gaming
The scientists hope the arrival of the PS3 will take this research up another level .
Sony has demonstrated a piece of protein - folding software that will run on its PS3 when it is launched in November .
The PS3 has a powerful processor known as a " cell " , which will run up to 10 times faster than current PC chips .
A graphical interface , also being developed between Sony and FAH , will eventually allow users and the scientists to look at the protein from different angles as it folds in real - time .
The new interface takes advantage of the PS3's graphics chip , designed for advanced gaming .
The graphics application is currently undergoing tests and is expected to be finished by September .
When the program is released to PS3 owners , the scientists say they will be able to " address questions previously considered impossible to tackle computationally " .

(1) The Hexagonal Coordinate System
Here ’s a hexagonal grid with a coordinate system mapped to square grids .
Note that this is just one possible orientation of the hexagons --- if you change it so hexes are adjacent horizontally instead of vertically , you get a symmetric situation ( the details of which i’m sure you can work out ; essentially , in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) below , the “ == ” changes to a “ ! = ” ) .
__ 5 __/D \__ 4 __/ \__/ \__ 3 " Y " coord __/ \__ / \__/ \__ 2 __ / A \__/ \__/ \__/ \__ 1 __/ \__/ \__/E \__/B \__/ \__ 0 / \__ /G \__/ \__/ \__/F \__/C \ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ 5 \__/ \__/ \__/ \__/ 4 \__/ \__/ \__/ 3 \__/ \__/ 2 " X " coord \__ / 1 0
Unlike the obvious route , these coordinates are not orthogonal --- that is , the y - coord increases to the upper - left , and the x-coord increases to the upper - right .
This means “ A ” has coords ( 2,5 ) , B is ( 4,2 ) , C = ( 5,0 ) , D = ( 5,5 ) , E = ( 3,3 ) , F = ( 4,1 ) and G = ( 1,4 ) .
This also means that a “ square ” in this coordinate system is more of a diamond shape ( as you can tell from the 6x6 “ square ” shown above ) .
Circles , however , are reasonably circular .
(2) Distance in Hexspace
Distance between points A and B is given by :
dx = B.x - A.x ; dy = B.y - A.y ; if ( sign ( dx ) == sign ( dy ) ) { // this is ( 1 ) ; see first paragraph dist = max ( abs ( dx ) , abs ( dy ) ) ; } else { dist = abs ( dx ) + abs ( dy ) ; }
This is a distance metric in the technical sense .
So , for instance , the distance between A and B is given by :
dx = 4 - 2 = 2 ; dy = 2 - 5 = - 3 ; since sign ( dx ) != sign ( dy ) , dist = abs ( 2 ) + abs ( - 3 ) = 5 ;
(3) Line of Sight ( LOS ) in Hexspace
How do you compute line - of - sight ?
You use a simple modification of Bresenham ’s line algorithm .
Here ’s a schematic version which calls the function “ process ( ) ” for each coord in the line from A to B .
Note that there ’s a choice in the horizontal move of whether to increment x , process , then y , or to increment y , process , then x .
// assume abs ( dx ) >= abs ( dy ) , it 's symmetric otherwise int sig , dx , dy , factor , x , y , xone , yone ; // this is ( 2 ) ; the next line changes from " == " to " != " if // hexagons are not stacked vertically ( see first paragraph ) sig = ( sign ( dx ) == sign ( dy ) ) ; if ( dx < 0 ) xone = - 1 ; else xone = 1 ; // unit increments if ( dy < 0 ) yone = - 1 ; else yone = 1 ; // unit increments if ( dx % 2 ) { // so dx is divisible by two dx *= 2 ; dy *= 2 ; } dx = abs ( dx ) ; dy = abs ( dy ) ; // do n't need the signs anymore factor = dx/2 ; // should start at 0.5 , which is just ( dx/2 ) / dx x = A.x ; y = A.y ; process ( x , y ) ; while ( x != B.x || y != B.y ) { factor += dy ; if ( factor >= dx ) { //
Make a " diagonal move " in grid ( ie vertical or horizontal ) factor -= dx ; if ( sig ) { // vertical move : 2 moves in 1 x += xone ; // add 1 in the appropriate sign y += yone ; } else { // horizontal move : 2 moves in 2 x += xone ; // does n't matter which increases first process ( x , y ) ; y += yone ; } } else { x += xone ; } process ( x , y ) ; }
For example to get from G to D in our grid described above , we get the following sequence of steps :
dx = 4 , dy = 1 , factor = 2 , sig = true process ( 1,4 ) ; factor = 3 , process ( 2,4 ) ; factor = 0 , process ( 3,5 ) ; factor = 1 , process ( 4,5 ) ; factor = 2 , process ( 5,5 ) ;
(4) How to Use Rectangular Arrays of Hexagons
A “ square ” or “ rectangle ” in the above hexagon coordinates unfortunately looks like a diamond - shape .
This is fine when the boundary of your domain is irrelevant .
However , it does not work out so well if you want your hexagons to fit neatly on a rectangular screen , while still keeping the information in an array .
Fortunately , this is a rather simple transformation .
Consider the following rectangular “ patch ” of hexspace , with the origin ( 0,0 ) at the upper left , and suppose you want to embed this into a 9x8 array so the upper row is at y=0 , with x increasing to the right , the next row down is y=1 , etc .
Here is the patch with the corresponding hex coordinate system shown :
Hex X coord \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | O | W | | A | | | | | | H \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ e 0 | V | | Z | | | | | | | x / / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / / | U | | | | | | | | | Y \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ 1 | B | | | | | | | | | c / / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / o / | | | | | | | | | | o \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ r 2 | | | | | | | | | | d / / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / / | | | | | | | | | | \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ 3 | | | | | | | | | | / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / / O = upper - left origin = ( 0,0 ) Your hex x-coord increases to the right and up .
Your hex y - coord increases to the right and down .
So in hex space , U= ( - 1,1 ) , V= ( 0,1 ) , W= ( 1,1 ) , Z= ( 2,3 ) , A= ( 3,3 ) , B= ( - 1,2 ) and in array space , U= ( 0,2 ) , V= ( 0,1 ) , W= ( 1,0 ) , Z= ( 2,1 ) , A= ( 3,0 ) , B= ( 0,3 )
The idea is then to store this patch of hexspace into a 9x8 array , and be able to address hexes by their array coordinates .
We need two transformations :
array -> hexspace given by :
array2hex ( x , y ) = ( x - floor ( y / 2 ) , x+ceil ( y / 2 ) ) hexspace -> array given by :
hex 2 array ( x , y ) = ( floor ( ( x+y ) / 2 ) , y- x )
Note that floor & ceiling here will need to deal with negative as well as positive inputs .
Also note that this is for a rectangular patch as depicted above — if the topmost line is to be offset to the right ( instead of to the left as is shown ) , then floor & ceil change places .
(5) Distance and LOS in a Rectangular Array of Hexagons
Given these transformations , computing distance and LOS is easy .
Let A and B be a hexagons , with array coordinates given by A.ax , A.ay and B.ax , B.ay .
Then distance between them is :
// a macro to compute integer floor / ceiling when divide by two # define Floor2 ( X ) ( ( ( X ) >= 0 ) ? ( ( X > > 1 ) : ( ( ( X ) - 1 ) /2 ) ) # define Ceil2 ( X ) ( ( ( X ) >= 0 ) ? ( ( ( X ) +1 ) >> 1 ) : ( ( X ) /2 ) ) // calculate hexspace coordinates of A and B A.x = A.ax - Floor2( A.ay ) ; A.y = A.ax + Ceil2 ( A.ay ) ; B.x = B.ax - Floor2( B.ay ) ; B.y = B.ax + Ceil2 ( B.ay ) ; // calculate distance using hexcoords as per previous algorithm dx = B.x - A.x ; dy = B.y - A.y ; if ( sign ( dx ) == sign ( dy ) ) { dist = max ( abs ( dx ) , abs ( dy ) ) ; } else { dist = abs ( dx ) + abs ( dy ) ; }
You might have expected the “ == ” to change to a “ != ” given my comments about the original hexspace algorithm for computing distance .
However , in this case the hex grid is not just rotated , but the axes have changed too , fortuitously resulting in an identical situation .
So , the distance between the hexes mapped to array coords ( 3,4 ) and ( 3,0 ) is just :
A.x = 3 - Floor 2( 4 ) = 1 ; A.y = 3 + Ceil2(4 ) = 5 B.x = 3 - Floor 2(0 ) = 3 ; B.y = 3 + Ceil2(0 ) = 3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2 ; dy = 3 - 5 = - 2 ; and thus , dist = 4 ;
and the distance between the hexes mapped to array coords ( 3,4 ) and ( 1,4 ) is just :
A.x = 3 - Floor 2( 4 ) = 1 ; A.y = 3 + Ceil2(4 ) = 5 B.x = 1 - Floor 2( 4 ) = - 1 ; B.y = 1 + Ceil2 ( 4 ) = 3 dx = - 1 - 1 = - 2 ; dy = 3 - 5 = - 2 ;
and thus , dist = 2 ;
As you might expect , line - of - sight is computed exactly in the same way as before , except we first convert our array coordinates to hex coords , and convert back before we call process .
The complete algorithm would be :
// Assume A.x , A.y , B.x and B.y have been calculated , as has dx and dy // assume abs ( dx ) >= abs ( dy ) , it 's symmetric otherwise int sig , dx , dy , factor , x , y , xone , yone ; sig = ( sign ( dx ) == sign ( dy ) ) ; if ( dx < 0 ) xone = - 1 ; else xone = 1 ; // unit increments if ( dy < 0 ) yone = - 1 ; else yone = 1 ; // unit increments if ( dx % 2 ) { // so dx is divisible by two dx *= 2 ; dy *= 2 ; } dx = abs ( dx ) ; dy = abs ( dy ) ; // do n't need the signs anymore factor = dx/2 ; // should start at 0.5 , which is just ( dx/2 ) / dx x = A.x ; y = A.y ; process ( A.ax , A.ay ) ; // note process being called with array coords while ( x != B.x || y != B.y ) { factor += dy ; if ( factor >= dx ) { //
Make a " diagonal move " in grid ( ie vertical or horizontal ) factor -= dx ; if ( sig ) { // vertical move : 2 moves in 1 x += xone ; // add 1 in the appropriate sign y += yone ; } else { // horizontal move : 2 moves in 2 x += xone ; // does n't matter which increases first process ( Floor 2 ( x+y ) , y-x ) ; // note : passing array coords y += yone ; } } else { x += xone ; } process ( Floor 2 ( x+y ) , y-x ) ; // note : passing array coords }
So , the sequence of array coords to get from the hex at array coords ( 3,0 ) to the one at ( 0,3 ) is :
( A.hex = ( 3,3 ) , B.hex = ( - 1,2 ) , sig = 1 , dx = - 4 , dy = - 1 ) process ( 3,0 ) process ( 2,1 ) process ( 1,1 ) process ( 1,2 ) process ( 0,3 )
(6) LOS by Intersection of Hexagons with a Straight Line
The algorithm given above computes LOS by finding a shortest , “ straightest ” path between two hexagons .
Sometimes , though , it is desireable to compute LOS not just by trying to draw as straight a line as can be formed formed from hexagons , but by finding all the hexagons that intersect a Euclidean line drawn on the hexagonal grid .
If our “ line ” is a infinite half - ray ( ie an arrow which starts at a given hexagon but continues on forever ) , then this corresponds to the set of hexagons which would be “ visible ” by someone standing at a particular hexagon and looking in a given direction ; it is the Euclidean LOS mapped to the hexagonal grid .
The algorithm given above is not ideal for this purpose — it draws a “ straight ” line which does not deviate too much from a Euclidean line , but it does not * always * find * all * the hexagons which would intersect this line .
The brute force approach to this problem is just to go through every hexagon and calculate if a given straight line intersects the hexagon ( intersection of a line and convex object like a hexagon is a simple problem , and an algorithm is given below ; finding the actual intersection point is computationally more expensive ) , and then decide if it lies on the half - ray .
This is quite wasteful , though , and it is a simple matter to restrict our intersection tests to a more realistic set , and in a way that does not actually require calculating any intersection points .
We will still need functions to tell if a hexagon intersects a line , though .
You could do this in many ways ; here ’s an easy and efficient way .
The following turns ( ) function is quite standard in graphics / geometry ; it tells whether a given point is “ left of ” or “ right of ” a given directed line .
# define LEFT 1 #define STRAIGHT 0 #define RIGHT -1 // returns LEFT if ( x0,y0 ) -->( x1,y1 ) -->( x2 , y2 ) turns to the left , // RIGHT if ( x0,y0 ) -->( x1,y1 ) -->( x2 , y2 ) turns to the right // STRAIGHT if ( x2,y2 ) is colinear with ( x0,y0 ) - ->( x1 , y1 ) int turns ( double x0 , double y0 , double x1 , double y1 , double x2 , double y2 ) { double cross ; cross = ( x1-x0 ) * ( y2 - y0 ) - ( x2-x0 ) * ( y1 - y0 ) ; return ( ( cross > 0.0 ) ?
LEFT : ( ( cross==0.0 ) ?
STRAIGHT : RIGHT ) ) ; } //
A convex object ( like a hexagon ) intersects an infinite line if and // only if some ( at least one ) of its coordinates lie on one side of the // line , and some ( at least one ) lie on the other .
Note that any two // distinct points on our infinite line will work for ( x0,y0 ) and ( x1,y1 ) .
//
Also note that this function will consider a hexagon to intersect even // if it just touches the line .
Returns 1 if it does intersect , 0 if not .
int hexintersectsline ( hexagon *h , double x0 , double y0 , double x1 , double y1 ) { // first see if it intersects the infinite line int side1 , i , j ; side1 = turns ( x0 , y0, x1 , y1, h -> x [ 0 ] , h->y [ 0 ] ) ; if ( side1==STRAIGHT ) return 1 ; for ( i=1 ; i< 6 ;i++ ) { j = turns ( x0 , y0, x1 , y1 , h - > x [ i ] , h->y[ i ] ) ; if ( j==STRAIGHT || j!=side1 ) return 1 ; } return 0 ; }
So , suppose we ’re standing at hexagon h0 , which has centre ( x0,y0 ) , and you ’re looking toward hexagon h1 , which has center ( x1,y1 ) .
To find all the hexagons intersecting this LOS , you have to find all hexagons intersecting the infinite half - ray starting at ( x0,y0 ) and extending towards ( and past maybe ) ( x1,y1 ) .
The following algorithm works by “ following ” the line as it intersects hexagons ; we begin at hexagon h0 and we check to see which side of the hexagon the line exits from --- the hexagon adjacent in that direction is the next one on the list .
We continue in this manner until reaching h1 ( which we are certain to do ) .
For this we need a standardized way of referring to the sides and vertices of our hexagons .
//
This set of routines finds all hexagons intersecting a Euclidean line // between h0 and h1 .
For this we need to make some assumptions about how // hexagon corners are designated .
Assuming a coordinate system as shown // in the section on how to use rectangular arrays of hexagons , we assume // that hexagon vertices are stored in an array accessible by the hexagon // structure and that vertices are numbered in the following way : // 2 // 3 / \ 1 // | A | // 4 \ / 0 // 5 //
Given the coordinate system , we also know how coordinates change as we // move to any particular adjacent hexagon : // // / \ / \ // | A | B | if Z = ( x , y ) in hex coords , then : // / \ / \ / \ A = ( x , y - 1 ) F = ( x , y+1 ) // | C | Z | D | C = ( x - 1 , y - 1 ) D = ( x+1 , y+1 ) // \ / \ / \ / E = ( x - 1 , y ) B = ( x+1 , y ) // | E | F | // \ / \ / // //
And that hexagons are maintained such that we can call the function // " hex At ( x , y ) " for hexagon - coordinates ( x , y ) and get the hexagon structure // at that location .
Symmetrically , we have to be able to tell what are // the hexagonal coordinates of a given hexagon , so we assume each hexagon // structure also contains its coordinates in its " hx " and " hy " fields .
// //
A line can intersect at most 3 hexagons at any point .
If we are // building our list of intersecting hexagons incrementally by following // the line , then each time we leave a hexagon we will have to consider // the possibility that we may be next intersecting either one or two // hexagons , but no more .
Thus , this routine calls " process " each time // with either one or two hexagons ( in the latter case the 2nd argument // will be NULL ) .
Note that hexagons are assumed to intersect even if // it 's just an edge or vertex that intersects the line .
// //
But first , a routine that finds the next hex or 2 after cur , making // sure it 's / they 're not cur2 ( or cur ) or last1 or last2 .
Returns the // total number of next hexes found ( should always be 1 or 2 ) int nexthexes ( hexagon * cur , hexagon * cur2 , hexagon ** next1 , hexagon ** next2 , hexagon * last1 , hexagon * last2 , double x0 , double y0 , double x1 , double y1 ) { hexagon *h ; int i , j, turn1 , tur n2 ; static int hexneighbours [ 6 ] [ 2 ] = { { 1,1} , { 1,0} , {0 , - 1} , { - 1, - 1} , {- 1,0} , { 0,1} } ; * next1 = NULL ; * next2 = NULL ; for ( i=0 ; i< 6 ;i++ ) { turn1 = turn ( x0 , y0 , x1 , y1 , cur - > x [ i ] , cur - > y [ i ] ) ; turn2 = turn ( x0 , y0, x1 , y1 , cur -> x [ ( i+1 ) %6 ] , cur ->y [ ( i+1 ) %6 ] ) ; if ( turn1==STRAIGHT || turn2==STRAIGHT || turn1!=turn2 ) { // in each of these cases we 'll have to consider the hexagon // adjacent to edge ( i,i+1 ) h = hex At ( cur ->hx+hexneighbours [ i ] [ 0 ] , cur ->hy +hexneighbours [ i ] [ 1 ] ) ; if ( h!=cur && h!=cur2 && h!=*next1 && h!=*next2 && h!=last1 && h!=last2 ) { if ( * next1==null ) * next1 = h ; else if ( * next2==null ) * next2 = h ; } if ( turn1==STRAIGHT ) { // current vertex ( i ) lies on the line // hex next to edge ( i - 1 ,i ) h = hex At ( cur - >hx+hexneighbours [ ( i+ 5 ) %6 ] [ 0 ] , cur ->hy + hexn eighbours [ ( i+5 ) % 6 ] [ 1 ] ) ; if ( h!=cur && h!=cur2 && h!=*next1 && h!=*next2 && h!=last1 && h!=last2 ) { if ( * next1==null ) * next1 = h ; else if ( * next2==null ) * next2 = h ; } } if ( turn2==STRAIGHT ) { // next vertex ( i+1 ) lies on the line // hex next to edge ( i+1, i+2 ) h = hex At ( cur ->hx+hexneighbours [ ( i+1 ) %6 ] [ 0 ] , cur ->hy + hexneighbours [ ( i+1 ) % 6 ] [ 1 ] ) ; if ( h!=cur && h!=cur2 && h!=*next1 && h!=*next2 && h!=last1 && h!=last2 ) { if ( * next1==null ) * next1 = h ; else if ( * next2==null ) * next2 = h ; } } } } return ( next2==NULL ) ? 1 : 2 ) ; } //

(7) Euclidean Field of View ( FOV ) on a Hexagonal Grid
If you ’re calculating LOS on a hexagonal grid in order to find all hexes visible from someone standing at a particular hexagon , you ’re actually looking for the “ Field of View . ”
You can calculate the FOV from hexagon h in a rectangular patch of a hexagonal grid by drawing Euclidean lines from h to every hexagon .
Obviously , this is not the most efficient method --- lines overlap , and so many hexagons will be examined repeatedly .
Fortunately , a more efficent way exists .
Consider a circle or “ bubble ” expanding outwards from h .
If there are no obstacles in sight , everything within the bubble ( up to some maximum radius if desired ) is visible from h .
An obstacle , a hexagon one cannot see through , though casts a shadow , which should block view of all hexagons “ behind ” the obstacle hexagon .
In the diagram below , for instance , if we are standing at the centre of h and hexagon X contains the only obstacle ( which completely fills X ) , we should be able to see all unmarked hexagons , but any marked S are fully obscured , and ones marked P are partially visible ( depending on your goals , you can consider partially - blocked hexes as visible or not ) :
/ \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | | | | | P | S | S | / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | | | | | P | S | S | S | \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / | | | | X | P | P3| P | / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | | | h | | P1| P2 | | | \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / | | | | | | | | / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | | | | A | | | | | \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
In other words , we look from a point ( center of h ) , and obstacles are presumed to fill their entire hexagon .
This means obstacles cast a shadow “ cone ” — the center is the center of h , and the “ arms ” of the cone are as close to hexagon X as possible without crossing the interior of X ( sorry , ascii is just not up to depicting this ) .
This means our circular field of view from h can be divided into a sequence of shadow cones separated by visible cones .
Of course , whether we consider shadow cones or visible cones is not real critical here ( from one representation we can clearly derive the other ) , and in fact it turns out to be slightly more efficient to represent the field of view as composed of a sequence of visible cones , rather than a sequence of shadow cones .
This is what we shall do .
Suppose we start off with some visible cones , with their union forming the entire 360 - degree FOV .
Determining visibility is then a matter of repeatedly expanding these cones outward one radius unit , possibly shrinking them or splitting them as they encounter obstacles .
Each cone is thus represented by its two ( x , y ) - coordinates for its two arms , and a list of the hexagons forming its “ outer arc ” .
Actually , we do n’t need to keep a literal list of hexagons --- we can number each hexagon in our expanding bubble by it ’s “ polar ” coordinates , formed from radius and counter - clockwise distance along the circle from the hex at 3 o’clock .
Thus in our above diagram , P1 has polar coords ( 2,0 ) , P2 is ( 3,0 ) , P3 is ( 4,1 ) , X is ( 2,1 ) and A is ( 2,10 ) .
It is easy to convert between hex coords , array coords , and these new hex polar coords ; if a hex h has polar coordinates ( r , t ) , and the center of the circle has hex coords ( x , y ) , then we can calculate h’s hex coords as follows :
Each circle at a given radius looks like a big hexagon .
We first find out which “ side ” h is on , which we can do be noting that each of the sides of the circle at radius r consist of r hexagons .
Thus , h is on side s = ( int ) ( t/r ) .
It is easy to figure out where the 6 corners of the circle are .
Each corner is r hexes along a line of adjacent hexagons , so we can use the way coordinates change ( described in Section ( 7 ) , the A - F directions from Z ) .
We can then tell where h is if we know how far along the given side h is , which can be calculated by e = t%r .
First we determine the hex coords of the appropriate corner ( cx , cy ) = ( ( x , y ) + ( r * one of A - F ) ) , then we use the same set of direction vectors to calculate the coords of h as ( cx , cy ) + e * ( a different one of A - F ) by following along the appropriate line .
Sample code is shown in the HexGrid.hexOnCircle ( ) method of the HGAT code , described below .
Thus , we need only store the coords of the two hexes forming the end - points of our arc for each cone .
Using these polar coords and being able to conveniently convert from polar to hex / array means that we can iterate through the list of hexagons forming the arc , say ( r, t1 ) and ( r, t2 ) , by just running through all hexes in ( r , i ) for i=t1 to t2 .
It should be noted that our cones make use of two kinds of information for designating their limits : the arms and the outer arc of hexagons .
It is the arms which designate the limits of visibility for each particular cone .
However , the end - points of the arms are * not* updated each iteration outward unless we encounter a new obstacle .
There ’s really no need to stretch the arms out if the cone has n’t changed ; the whole point of the cones is to be able to determine which hexagons lie inside ( wholly or partially ) the cone , and which do not .
This sort of information is calculated by looking at cross products to determine whether hexagon vertices are “ left of ” ( CC - wise ) or “ right of ” ( C - wise ) of a given arm ; such an approach works for any two points on our cone arm , so if the arm does not move there ’s no reason to update the arm endpoint .
So , why do we need to maintain the arc - list of hexagons ?
Each time we expand outward we may encounter new obstacles in the path of our cone .
The arc - list makes finding these obstacles somewhat easier than checking every hexagon on the circle perimeter for intersection with a given cone .
Given a list of hexagons comprising the outer arc of a cone it is also a simple matter to expand it outward one radius unit ; one looks at all neighbours of the two arc endpoints which are one radius unit further out , and checks to see which hex intersects the cone ’s actual arm , or which is the first to lie entirely to one side of the arm ( ie , it ’s inside the cone , but one has to be careful not to exclude the possibility of the cone being too narrow to contain a whole hexagon ) .
The hex which does so is the endpoint of the next arc outward .
It should be noted that these endpoints are not unique between cones — adjacent cones might indeed share an endpoint hex ; effectively , the arms designate the cone limits , but the arcs give the list of hexagons which fully * or partially * intersect the given cone .
When we encounter obstacles , we shrink or split the cone to exclude them .
If the obstacle blocks an endpoint of the arc , we simply move our cone arm toward the other cone arm , effectively shrinking the cone .
Thus , the process of expanding outwards includes not only finding the next arc , but also possibly shrinking the cone by moving the arm endpoints .
Of course if we move both arm endpoints to the degree where the clockwise and counter - clockwise arms of our cone meet or cross over , then the cone is empty and can be discarded .
As well as shrinking the cones to account for obstacles near the endpoints of our arcs , we may also have to split our cones if we encounter an obstacle somewhere within the interior of an arc .
In such a case we divide our cone into two cones , and recursively repeat the process of adjusting our cones .
There are some non-trivial implementation issues here .
First , in order to avoid dealing with degenerate cones — obtuse ones , and in particular ones with an interior angle of 180 - degrees or more — it is best not to start off with one 360 - degree cone representing the entire space ; rather , space should be already divided into several cones .
The HGAT code starts off with 4 cones , one for each quadrant ; since cones never widen , this ensures we do not have to ever worry about clockwise and counter - clockwise arms getting confused .
The second issue results from dealing with finite hex grids — what does one do when the arcs are only partially on the rectangular patch of hex grid in which we are interested ?
After all , our expanding circles are certain to only refer to valid hexagons when they ’re entirely contained inside the section of grid we are representing , but the FOV calculation should not stop until it has expanded the circle so the entire circle is outside the grid ( if we want FOV over the entire grid ) .
We could hack in special code to avoid this situation ; the approach in HGAT is to generate “ fake ” hexagon structures for the hexagons outside our grid — these structures are only created as requested by the FOV algorithm , and are discarded as soon as they are no longer needed .
This is n’t the most efficient way of dealing with this problem — special code would be better — but it is perhaps the easiest way of avoiding the issue .
One final implementation point is how to deal with numerical error .
Depending on how we calculate the coordinates of hexagon corners , we may find that cones which should be eliminated are instead just becoming extremely - thin .
This can result in hexagons which should be obscured being considered visible .
In the implementation mentioned below this is handled by checking the interior angle of all cones created — any which are too narrow are considered empty .
Note that we do n’t have to actually calculate the angle ; we use instead an upper bound on the cosine of the angle , which avoids actually evaluating trigonometric functions .
The entire algorithm is just too long to include the code here .
The overall process is simple enough , though :
Initialize 4 cones
Expand the arcs of the cones out one radius unit , respecting the arms .
If the arms intersect any obstacle hexes , contract the arms ( and hex - lists ) to exclude the obstacle hex .
Do this for both sides ; if this causes the arms to coincide or cross , the cone is empty and can be discarded .
Otherwise run through each hex on the arc list and look for obstacle hexes .
Such obstacles cause the cone to be split into two ( non-empty , because we know the arc endpoints are not obstacles ) cones , which may be recursively shrunk and / or split .
Repeat from step 2 )
A Java implementation illustrating the FOV algorithm can be seen at : http://www-acaps.cs.mcgill.ca/~clump/Hex/HGAT.html[4 ] .
The program is available as an applet on the above page ; complete source code is available ( HGAT.zip ) in the same directory .
In this program you see a hex grid with some obstacle hexes darkened ( and FOV is to be calculated from the center ) .
Each time you press the “ Expand ” button the cones move out one radius unit ( “ New ” randomizes the locations of the obstacles , “ Restart ” does the same grid again ) .
The cone arms are also shown ; note how the endpoints are not updated unless the arm must be moved .
Visible hexes at each step are indicated by writing their polar coords inside the hex .

I read the algorithm for calculating the distance in hexagonal coordinates system , which is as follows : dx = B.x - A.x ; dy = B.y - A.y ; if ( sign ( dx ) == sign ( dy ) ) { // this is ( 1 ) ; see first paragraph dist = max ( abs ( dx ) , abs ( dy ) ) ; } else { dist = abs ( dx ) + abs ( dy ) ; } I think the simpler ( =faster ) method is : dx = B.x - A.x ; dy = B.y - A.y ; dist = ( abs ( dx ) + abs ( dy ) + abs ( dx - dy ) ) / 2
Of course , the division by 2 can be done faster as right bitshift ...

Given the Dutch appetite for bicycles , it is little wonder that Frank van Oirschot joined two friends to open a business here they call Amazing Wheels .
In a sprawling warehouse along piers where fishing trawlers once dumped their haul , Mr. van Oirschot runs what is arguably the largest wholesale bike dealership in the Netherlands , and possibly in Europe .
Leading a visitor through the warehouse , he pointed out touring bicycles , the way the Dutch like them ; electric bicycles , from mountainous Switzerland ; recumbent bicycles , whose riders look like they are on a two - wheeled gurney ; and all sorts of three - wheeled models , for hauling groceries or tools or children .
There is even a bicycle that folds up into a suitcase , for carrying on planes .
“ We have house painters in Amsterdam who love the three - wheeled bikes , ” he said .
In neighboring Belgium , Coca - Cola recently ordered 13 SmartTrikes , three - wheeled bikes for carrying children or goods or both , which it plans to use to sell Coke at amusement parks .
“ Thirteen is not what I ’d call an impressive investment , but it ’s one way to bring the brand to consumers , ” said Wouter Vermeulen , a spokesman for Coca - Cola .
“ It ’s a bike - loving country . ”
Mr. van Oirschot , 37 , a heavyset former software expert , said bicycles were increasingly seen as an expression of a lifestyle .
“ It ’s , like , for hanging out , almost as a fashion statement , ” he said , pointing to Phat Cycles from California , with their laid - back look reminiscent of the movie “ Easy Rider . ”

Do n't worry , the goal is safe inland :
A false Wikipedia ' biography ' By John Seigenthaler " John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the early 1960's .
For a brief time , he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John , and his brother , Bobby .
Nothing was ever proven . " — Wikipedia
This is a highly personal story about Internet character assassination .
It could be your story .
I have no idea whose sick mind conceived the false , malicious " biography " that appeared under my name for 132 days on Wikipedia , the popular , online , free encyclopedia whose authors are unknown and virtually untraceable .
There was more : " John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1971 , and returned to the United States in 1984 , " Wikipedia said .
" He started one of the country 's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter . "
At age 78 , I thought I was beyond surprise or hurt at anything negative said about me .
I was wrong .
One sentence in the biography was true .
I was Robert Kennedy 's administrative assistant in the early 1960s .
I also was his pallbearer .
It was mind - boggling when my son , John Seigenthaler , journalist with NBC News , phoned later to say he found the same scurrilous text on Reference.com and Answers.com .
I had heard for weeks from teachers , journalists and historians about " the wonderful world of Wikipedia , " where millions of people worldwide visit daily for quick reference " facts , " composed and posted by people with no special expertise or knowledge — and sometimes by people with malice .
At my request , executives of the three websites now have removed the false content about me .
But they do n't know , and can't find out , who wrote the toxic sentences .
Anonymous author I phoned Jimmy Wales , Wikipedia 's founder and asked , " Do you ... have any way to know who wrote that ? "
" No , we do n't , " he said .
Representatives of the other two websites said their computers are programmed to copy data verbatim from Wikipedia , never checking whether it is false or factual .
Naturally , I want to unmask my " biographer . "
And , I am interested in letting many people know that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool .
But searching cyberspace for the identity of people who post spurious information can be frustrating .
I found on Wikipedia the registered IP ( Internet Protocol ) number of my " biographer " - 65-81-97-208 .
I traced it to a customer of BellSouth Internet .
That company advertises a phone number to report " Abuse Issues . "
An electronic voice said all complaints must be e-mailed .
My two e-mails were answered by identical form letters , advising me that the company would conduct an investigation but might not tell me the results .
It was signed " Abuse Team . "
Wales , Wikipedia 's founder , told me that BellSouth would not be helpful .
" We have trouble with people posting abusive things over and over and over , " he said .
" We block their IP numbers , and they sneak in another way .
So we contact the service providers , and they are not very responsive . "
After three weeks , hearing nothing further about the Abuse Team investigation , I phoned BellSouth 's Atlanta corporate headquarters , which led to conversations between my lawyer and BellSouth 's counsel .
My only remote chance of getting the name , I learned , was to file a " John or Jane Doe " lawsuit against my " biographer . "
Major communications
Internet companies are bound by federal privacy laws that protect the identity of their customers , even those who defame online .
Only if a lawsuit resulted in a court subpoena would BellSouth give up the name .
Little legal recourse Federal law also protects online corporations — BellSouth , AOL , MCI Wikipedia , etc. — from libel lawsuits .
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , passed in 1996 , specifically states that " no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker . "
That legalese means that , unlike print and broadcast companies , online service providers cannot be sued for disseminating defamatory attacks on citizens posted by others .
Recent low - profile court decisions document that Congress effectively has barred defamation in cyberspace .
Wikipedia 's website acknowledges that it is not responsible for inaccurate information , but Wales , in a recent C - Span interview with Brian Lamb , insisted that his website is accountable and that his community of thousands of volunteer editors ( he said he has only one paid employee ) corrects mistakes within minutes .
My experience refutes that .
My " biography " was posted May 26 .
On May 29 , one of Wales ' volunteers " edited " it only by correcting the misspelling of the word " early . "
For four months , Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before Wales erased it from his website 's history Oct.
5 . The falsehoods remained on Answers.com and Reference.com for three more weeks .
In the C - Span interview , Wales said Wikipedia has " millions " of daily global visitors and is one of the world 's busiest websites .
His volunteer community runs the Wikipedia operation , he said .
He funds his website through a non-profit foundation and estimated a 2006 budget of " about a million dollars . "
And so we live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and research — but populated by volunteer vandals with poison - pen intellects .
Congress has enabled them and protects them .
When I was a child , my mother lectured me on the evils of " gossip . "
She held a feather pillow and said , " If I tear this open , the feathers will fly to the four winds , and I could never get them back in the pillow .
That 's how it is when you spread mean things about people . "
For me , that pillow is a metaphor for Wikipedia .

The trend towards increased energy efficiency is levelling off
The Global Carbon Project says that emissions were rising by less than 1 % annually up to the year 2000 , but are now rising at 2.5 % per year .
It says the acceleration comes mainly from a rise in charcoal consumption and a lack of new energy efficiency gains .
The global research network released its latest analysis at a scientific meeting in Australia .
Dr Mike Raupach of the Australian government 's research organisation CSIRO , who co-chairs the Global Carbon Project , told delegates that 7.9 billion tonnes ( gigatonnes , Gt ) of carbon passed into the atmosphere last year .
In 2000 , the figure was 6.8 Gt .
Improvements made in the last 30 years appear to be stalling
Corinne Le Quere
The finding parallels figures released earlier this month by the World Meteorological Organization showing that the rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 had accelerated in the last few years .
Intense findings
The Global Carbon Project draws its data from a wide range of sources , including measurements of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and studies on fossil fuel use .
From that data , researchers have extracted two trends which they believe explain the sharp upturn found around the year 2000 .
The assumption is we will solve the problem by controlling demand ; but regulating at the point of use is clearly not working
Myles Allen
" From about 1970 the intensity decreased - we became more efficient at using energy - but we 've been getting slightly worse since the year 2000 , " she told the BBC News website .
" The other trend is that as oil becomes more expensive , we 're seeing a switch from oil burning to charcoal which is more polluting in terms of carbon . "
The Project does not have data on precisely where this is happening , but there is anecdotal evidence of increases in charcoal burning in parts of Asia and Africa .
There have been suggestions that as temperatures rise , carbon sinks - natural systems which absorb carbon dioxide - may become less efficient ; but Professor Le Quere said there was no evidence that this is happening systematically .
" The land sink has been very much affected by recent droughts , especially in the Northern Hemisphere , " she said , " but the ocean sink looks relatively stable and it does n't seem there is a global trend . "
Upper limits
How emissions will change over time is one of the factors considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the body responsible for collating and analysing climate data for the global community .
Australia under John Howard is increasing coal exports
The " high end " of IPCC projections would imply a rise in global temperatures in the upper portion of its projected range of between 1.4 and 5.8C between 1990 and the end of this century , though the exact figure depends on how climatic systems respond to elevated CO2 as well as on how society responds .
" We need to think about radical alternatives to the belt - tightening approach , " said Professor Allen .
" At the moment , the assumption is we will solve the problem by controlling demand ; but regulating at the point of use is clearly not working . "
At the recent United Nations climate summit in Nairobi , a number of delegations , including those of Britain , Australia and the US , pointed out that they had managed to grow their economies without significant increases in carbon emissions .
But , said Corinne Le Quere , the latest data showed this approach would not be enough to curb emissions in the future .
" Improvements that have been made in the last 30 years appear to be stalling , " she said .
" We are going to need a real decrease in emissions . "

With gas prices steep as a Himalayan slope , fuel - efficiency is a prime consideration for an ever increasing number of car buyers .
Edmunds.com has compiled a list of the 10 most fuel - efficient cars currently sold in the U.S .
Rankings are based on the Environmental Protection Agency 's ( EPA ) miles - per - gallon ratings for city and highway travel .
More specifically , Edmunds.com editors used the EPA 's combined fuel economy formula : 55 percent of city mpg rating plus 45 percent of highway mpg rating .
The rating for each vehicle below is expressed in mpg as a city / highway ratio .
All ratings apply to base models equipped with a manual transmission , except where indicated otherwise with an asterisk .
Each model was allowed only one appearance on the list .
The sole exception is the Honda Civic , which appears twice as a result of being available in both gas - electric hybrid and regular gasoline versions .
Honda Insight — 60/66
Toyota Prius —

Mono Lake , Mono County --
Thirty years ago , a dozen students from Stanford University , UC Davis and elsewhere camped at ancient Mono Lake for more than two months , conducting the first ecological survey of California 's largest lake , which was dying as a result of massive water diversions to Los Angeles .
This month , the same group -- now college professors , government scientists , an inventor , a physician and high school teachers , all in their early 50s -- returned for a historic reunion at the million - year - old lake that once inspired Californians to slap " Save Mono Lake " bumper stickers on their ' 70s vans .
Today the lake is saved -- rising and healthy .
The group 's 1976 study of birds , insects , phytoplankton , salinity and hydrology has been recognized as the scientific underpinning of the California Supreme Court 's 1983 ruling that the state must protect natural resources such as Mono Lake under the state Constitution 's public trust doctrine .
That decision ultimately saved the lake from the kind of water grab that in the 1920s turned Southern California 's Owens Lake into a 110 - square - mile salt flat .
" Everything we did was later repeated with more rigor , " said Jeff Burch , an engineer and inventor for Agilent Technologies in Palo Alto , who came to the reunion at Mono Lake County Park .
" But we pointed to the direction that policy needed to change or otherwise you 'd have this train wreck , with the Mono Lake ecosystem collapsing . "
It had been 30 years since Burch saw Connie Lovejoy , then a UC Davis student and now a biology professor at LaVal University in Quebec City , Quebec .
Back then , she was commanding him to pull up algae samples as they teetered in a small boat rocking on the lake amid its famous limestone towers .
Lovejoy , with her college colleague Gayle Dana , now a hydrology professor at the Desert Research Institute in Reno , conducted the water chemistry and biology studies of the lake .
David Winkler , now a biology professor at Cornell University , had n't seen Bob Loeffler since Winkler was counting birds in the sagebrush 30 years ago and Loeffler strode by on his way to complete calculations on groundwater levels around the Mono Lake Basin .
Winkler edited the final report of the 1976 research , for which he directed the bird study .
Loeffler , then at Stanford and now director of the mining , land and water division in the Alaska Department of Natural Resources , measured groundwater , river flow and evaporation .
Two weeks ago , the group returned to celebrate saving the world wonder .
They found a thriving 60 - square - mile lake freshened by a record amount of winter and spring runoff from the tributary creeks .
The lake is teeming with brine shrimp and alkali flies that feed the birds .
Bright green native grasses grow right down to the lake , now large enough to cover the once - exposed lake bottom .
The surging waters cover the old land bridges that had allowed coyotes to eat gull eggs and baby birds .
Freshwater springs bubble up from the lake 's bottom , growing a new crop of tufa crystals that will eventually form new underwater towers of calcium carbonate , a type of limestone .
The tributaries of Lee Vining and Rush creeks are gushing mountain streams filled with brown trout , and willows flourish on the edges along with the resurgence of Jeffrey pines .
Sprouting up are buffalo berry bushes and Woods ' roses , prized by the willow flycatcher .
The songbird known as " the ivory - billed woodpecker of Mono Lake " disappeared , then suddenly reappeared as waters returned to dry creeks .
The dying lake
For 35 years before the students arrived at Mono Lake , state and federal regulators had all but ignored the environmental fate of the lake , sister to Great Salt Lake .
When the budding scientists showed up , the lake had dropped by 42 feet , lost half its volume of water and shrunk in surface size by nearly a third .
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had been legally taking water since 1941 from four of the lake 's tributary creeks .
The water moved through an 11 - mile tunnel to the upper Owens River and Lake Crowley , a reservoir that sends water through three hydroelectric power plants before the flow hits aqueducts aimed at faucets in Los Angeles .
Because of those freshwater diversions , the lake -- naturally a mix of table salt , baking soda , Epsom salt and a dose of lye -- had become unnaturally saline .
Instead of its natural 50 parts per thousand of salt , the lake contained 92 parts per thousand -- about 2 1/2 times saltier than seawater .
One - inch - long brine shrimp and alkali flies were reaching their salt - tolerance limits .
Survival of these creatures was crucial because they fed more than 80 species of migratory birds stopping at Mono Lake , including thousands of Wilson 's and red-necked phalaropes and eared grebes .
Snowy plovers and the state 's largest breeding colony of California gulls were at risk .
Tributary creeks were dry .
The lake 's tufa towers looked like a boneyard as the limestone eroded .
There were few fresh calcium - rich springs to bond to the carbonates in the water and build new tufas .
And the lake was shrinking , leaving an alkali dust ring that caused unhealthy air pollution that filled the sky hundreds of miles away .
The ragtag group of science - minded friends of friends , later known as the Mono Basin Research Group , shared a love of the natural world , and they wanted to discover scientific ways to measure the lake 's health and save it .
They set up a camp on the principles of women 's equality , the health of organic foods and a philosophy of science for the people .
" There was zero competition and an unbelievably positive and supportive atmosphere , " recalled Jamie Grodsky , who periodically camped with the group and is now an environmental law professor at George Washington University .
Bird expert Winkler , nicknamed " Wink , " later persuaded the late David Gaines to found the Mono Lake Committee , which since 1978 has served as an advocate for the lake .
The committee would print the ubiquitous bumper stickers that spread the conservation word .
In 1979 , the National Audubon Society , the Mono Lake Committee and other groups sued Los Angeles , the first in a series of lawsuits that alleged the water diversions violated the public trust doctrine .
Four years later , the state Supreme Court ruled that the state had an obligation to protect such places as Mono Lake " as far as feasible " even if it meant reconsidering past allocations .
Eleven years after that , the state Water Resources Control Board re-examined Los Angeles ' water rights and set minimum stream flow requirements .
The agency ordered 18 vertical feet of fresh water returned to the lake .
Los Angeles originally was prohibited from taking any water from the Mono Basin until the lake 's level reached an elevation of 6,377 feet above sea level .
Los Angeles today is allowed to take 16,500 acre - feet of water a year -- or 16 percent of its original diversion , a restriction that will remain until the lake reaches an elevation of 6,392 feet .
The saved lake
Last week , the lake reached the 6,385 - foot level .
In eight more years , it 's expected to rise 7 more feet to reach the target level .
" It 's only been 10 years , but you can see how it 's all beginning to come back , " said Geoffrey McQuilkin , co-executive director of the Mono Lake Committee .
The return of the endangered willow flycatchers that had been long gone from the Mono Basin is a great sign , he said .
" That tells us we 've gone from a dry wasteland to a recovering streamside forest , " he said .
The once - diverted , now - restored creeks are supporting 49 species of breeding birds , according to PRBO Conservation Science , the nonprofit research group formerly known as Point Reyes Bird Observatory .
That number is in addition to the 80 species of migrating and resident birds living off the alkali flies and brine shrimp in the lake .
PRBO biologist Chris McCreedy spied the first willow flycatcher 's nest in 2002 .
As water filled the creeks , back came the shrubby vegetation , followed by the willow flycatcher that nests there , said Sacha Heath , PRBO eastern Sierra program director .
The yellow warbler also returned .
But birds that nest in tree holes and on top branches -- such as the American kestrel and the mountain chickadee -- are fewer because the trees have n't yet grown tall .
" In 10 years , I 'd expect we see an increase in the canopy and the cavity nesters , " she said .
PRBO researchers have been watching the gulls as far back as 1983 , the year of the state Supreme Court decision .
The gulls make nests and lay eggs on three islands in Mono Lake .
In the 1970s , the water level had sunk so low that bridges of land jutted above the surface of the lake , connecting the islands to the shore .
Coyotes trotted onto the island and ate the gull eggs and the chicks .
For several years , the gulls abandoned nests on black volcanic Negit Island , in the middle of the lake , then recolonized .
The populations have grown steadily between 1999 and 2004 .
" The lake 's up now , and there 's not much chance of the coyotes getting out there , " said Dave Shuford , a PRBO biologist .
The colony has remained at about 45,000 gulls .
But if the diversions had n't been cut , the numbers of gulls would be way down , he said .
As the lake rises and becomes less saline , the flies are expected to grow in numbers and provide food for even more birds .
Dave Herbst , a member of the original core of a dozen in 1976 , is now a UC Santa Barbara researcher based at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory 30 miles south of Mono Lake .
He continued to study the lake until his research funds dried up a couple of years ago .
Thirty years ago , his lab studies showed that the flies would die if salinity kept increasing .
Since then , he has published peer - reviewed experiments on the flies ' response to changing habitat and salinity .
A higher lake has a greater area of shallows around the edges , places where larvae and pupae thrive because temperatures are warmer and algae is more abundant , Herbst found .
As the water covers the tufas , they transform into habitat for aquatic life , " like the rocky headlands of the intertidal zone , " he said , providing surfaces protected from wave action on which the algae and pupae can attach .
And declining salinity favors growth of algae that feed the flies , helping them grow faster and larger , Herbst said .
Robert Jellison , also a research biologist at UC Santa Barbara who works out of the same Sierra Nevada lab as Herbst , has monitored Mono Lake for 24 years .
" Mono Lake is one of the real success stories worldwide in saving the ecological and public trust values of a salt lake .
Salt lakes throughout the world are desiccated , and Mono Lake is the exception , " Jellison said .
Water diversions have shrunk the Salton Sea , Nevada 's Walker Lake and the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan .
Ironically , under the 1994 state water - diversion order , Mono Lake will never reach its climatic equilibrium or natural size .
Once the lake fills to the target elevation , Los Angeles can increase its diversions as long as the lake does n't fall below the elevation .
Ultimately , it lost 45 feet .
It 's only getting about 18 feet back .
Starting the study
The work behind the recovery happened much by happenstance , all set in motion by a high school science teacher , Fred Savage , now in his 43rd year of teaching in the Orlando , Fla. , area .
Savage received notice of a National Science Foundation grant program for original student research and promptly tossed it .
Later , he reconsidered , pulled it from the wastebasket and sent it to Burch and his brother , Elliot , then a UC Santa Cruz student .
Jeff Burch immediately thought of Winkler , a UC Davis student Burch had met while counting birds at the Farallon Islands .
They had talked about doing a project together .
The grant possibility opened the way .
Burch also recalled passionate urgings for a Mono Lake study from biologist Gaines , the founder of the Mono Lake Committee .
Burch and Winkler decided to seek the Mono Lake grant and won it .
At the reunion , David DeSanti , a former Stanford teacher of several members of the group , praised Gaines as " an amazing person " who feared for the " loss of the glory of Mono Lake . "
Gaines died in a car crash in 1988 .
DeSanti , now director of the Institute for Bird Populations in Point Reyes Station , said : " These strong young minds , who were really in love with the Earth , were stimulated by David Gaines and maybe to change some course of events . "
Herbst recalled the summer as " one of those moments from where you can trace the change in your life . "
" We were all pretty green .
We had to rely on our classroom information and intuition , " said Herbst .
" We discovered what it was like to be a scientist , to find our own way . "
The lake also changed .
Now just swimming in the lake demonstrates the difference over three decades , Jeff Burch said .
" The fresh water lies on top of the lake water .
You feel six inches of icy cold Sierra snowmelt at the chest .
Below it 's warm .
The underwater tufas are really coming back to life .
Every tufa tower is bubbling and burping as fresh water is coming in .
" It was all worth it . "
Nov. 20 , 2006  --
In several of the largest school systems across the country -- from Baltimore to Cleveland to Atlanta and Oakland , Calif . -- half of the students are dropping out .
And the problem is not only in the big cities .
A recent study by the Department of Education found that 31 percent of American students were dropping out or failing to graduate in the nation 's largest 100 public school districts .
The implications from dropping out of high school are enormous , including a higher risk of poverty and even an abbreviated life span .
So why do they drop out ?
Eli Thomasson , 16 , of Georgia , explains why he wanted to drop out of school earlier this year .
" I was just tired of school , you know .
I did n't like it .
I had made my mind up that I was n't going to school anymore , " Thomasson said .
His mother , Donna Thomasson , was frantic .
" Terrified , " she said .
" I thought his life was over .
I did n't really see how I could force him to go because you can't force them to learn if they do n't want to . "
And Eli Thomasson was n't the only student at his high school to consider walking away without a diploma .
Berrien High in southern Georgia is part of a national epidemic .
More than 40 percent of students there do not graduate .
Sheila Hendley , Berrien
High 's graduation coach , has the daunting job of trying to stop this epidemic .
" I have sat with students and literally begged , ' Please do n't do this , ' " Hendley said .
" I do n't want you to have to suffer like I know you will if you do n't finish school . "
And in the case of Eli Thomasson , it worked .
She stayed on his case and persuaded him to stay in school .
" He said , ' You know , mom .
She probably just saved my life , ' " Donna Thomasson said .
It is estimated that about 2,500 students drop out of U.S. high schools every day .
" It 's like seeing a child in the middle of the lake that can't swim , and you see them bobbing up and down .
It 's like watching them drown , " Hendley said .
At Berrien High , the faculty is fighting to save students who are at risk of becoming a part of that troubling statistic .
" It 's a real fight .
Every day you talk to someone who needs to be motivated , " said Berrien High School Principal Mike Parker .
And why is a high school diploma so important ?
Consider this :
High school dropouts have a life span that is nine years shorter than people who graduate .
Dropouts are more likely to face poverty , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Typically high school dropouts earn $ 19,000 a year .
High school graduates earn $ 28,000 a year on average .
If you drop out of high school , your chances of running afoul of the law increase .
Nationally , 68 percent of state prison inmates are dropouts .
Sheriff Jerry Brogdon of Berrien County , Ga. , sees those consequences every day at the Berrien County Jailhouse .
He said that " 81.2 percent of the inmates we have in here today is high school dropouts . "
Anthony
White is a 17 - year - old Berrien County Jail inmate .
He quit high school just two weeks before he spoke to ABC News from the jailhouse .
He was arrested for allegedly firing a gun in the air just three days after he quit school .
" I felt like I was grown , " White said .
" Nobody could tell me not to make my own decision .
That 's how I felt at the time . "
But White said , " Now I wish I would 've listened . "
James Keefe , 19 , is another inmate .
He dropped out of high school , too .
He has been arrested on burglary charges twice .
" When I was in school , I did n't get in no trouble , " Keefe said .
On Tuesday , Pierre Thomas looks at some programs that school boards are implementing to reverse this drop - out trend .

The popularity of BitTorrent is growing every day .
BitTorrent sites are on the rise , and now four of them hold positions in the top 500 most popular websites on the Internet .
Even more are expected to join the club in the near future .
Back in 2004 , Suprnova managed to settle itself among the 1000 most visited websites on the internet .
So when the site was taken offline december 19 , 2004 , there was a huge gap to fill .
Today , 6 BitTorrent sites entered this top 1000 list , generating more traffic than Suprnova ever did .
Sites in Alexa ’s Top 1000 ( rank September 26 , 2006 )
205 Mininova
218 Torrentspy
387 The Piratebay
439 Isohunt
573 Torrentz
593 Demonoid
Top 4
As you can see , there are now four BitTorrent sites in the top 500 of the most visited websites on the internet .
Torrentspy and Mininova are currently 218 and 205 .
The Piratebay and Isohunt follow in 387 and 439 respectively .
Upcoming Sites
It does n’t stop here .
There are more sites waiting in line to enter the top 500 .
Currently Torrentz and Demonoid both entered the 1000 most visited sites on the internet .
Both sites are rapidly growing as you can see in the graph below .
They climbed from a spot somewhere around the 5000 to the top 1000 in only 6 months .
From Zero to Hero
One could argue that with al these popular sites , there is no room for new BitTorrent sites to grow .
However , the opposite is true .
New sites are being launched every day .
Fenopy and Btmon are great examples of torrent sites that attracted quite a lot of traffic over a relatively short period of time .
Fenopy launched this June , and Btmon in August .
Both sites made it to the top 10.000 in no time .
Today Fenopy ’s traffic rank is 7,914 , and Btmon is ranked 3,380 .
Another site that has been faring well lately is the recently resurrected Snarf - It .
Snarf - It went from a relatively low traffic rank in July to 5000 earlier this month .
Unfortunately they have some server issues at the moment , otherwise they would have climbed even higher .
And Next
So what ’s next ?
Well I predict that by the end of this year we will see at least 10 BitTorrent sites in the top 1000 .
If you look at the graph of the four most visited BitTorrent sites you may notice that their traffic stabilized since May .
I do n’t expect that Mininova or Torrentspy will enter the top 100 , but you never know .
Note : Alexa ’s data gathering is quite dubious .
The exact figures may be not be completely accurate , but it is a great tool ( especially the traffic rank ) to compare sites within the same niche and to get a global impression of traffic shifts over time .
Tokyo , Japan – Nintendo turned a lot of heads with their new wireless game controller that uses motion sensors to direct action on the screen .
A growing problem , however , losing their grip on the controller and throwing them through their TVs or injuring others .
The Wii-mote , as the controller has been called , does come with a strap to keep it from flying away , but most people feel it's too uncomfortable and do n't use it .
Kids in Japan have taken the innovative approach of using superglue to attach the Wii-mote to their hands .
Parents see the approach as silly and dangerous , but teens in Japan see being Wii-handed as a status symbol .
" I like the Wii controller permanently on my hand .
I never have to search for it , and the other kids think it is cool , " said Yugi Tamagotchi of Tokyo .
Kids in other countries have come up with different solutions to the problem .
Kids in the USA are more likely to use duct tape to hold the controllers in place than superglue .
" Those Japanese kids have lost their grip .
If you superglue it to your hand then you have to buy a new controller for everyone that wants to use the game .
Duct taping is much more practical , " said Devin Chelsea of Cleveland , Ohio .

"
Most concede , though , that it 's only a matter of time before this happens .
As an alternative to super - gluing and duct tape , Nintendo has begun offering gamers a shatterproof cage to stand in while they are playing games .
The Wii Cage is available for $ 299 .

Mouthy parrot ' reveals sex secret '
An African grey parrot YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Great Britain Pets or or Create Your Own LONDON , England -- A computer programmer found out his girlfriend was having an affair when his pet parrot kept repeating her lover 's name , British media reported Tuesday .
The African grey parrot kept squawking " I love you , Gary " as his owner , Chris Taylor , sat with girlfriend Suzy Collins on the sofa of their shared flat in Leeds , northern England .
But when Taylor saw Collins 's embarrassed reaction , he realized she had been having an affair -- meeting her lover in the flat whilst Ziggy looked on , the UK's Press Association reported .
Ziggy even mimicked Collins 's voice each time she answered her telephone , calling out " Hiya Gary , " according to newspaper reports .
Call - center worker Collins , 25 , admitted the four - month affair with a colleague called Gary to her boyfriend and left the flat she had shared with Taylor , 30 , for a year .
Taylor said he had also been forced to part with Ziggy after the bird continued to call out Gary 's name and refused to stop squawking the phrases in his ex-girlfriend 's voice , media reports said .
" I was n't sorry to see the back of Suzy after what she did , but it really broke my heart to let Ziggy go , " he said .
" I love him to bits and I really miss having him around , but it was torture hearing him repeat that name over and over again .
" I still can't believe he 's gone .
I know I 'll get over Suzy , but I do n't think I 'll ever get over Ziggy . "
Taylor acquired Ziggy as a chick eight years ago and named him after the David Bowie character Ziggy Stardust .
The bird has now found a new home through the offices of a local parrot dealer .
Collins , who admitted the affair , said : " I 'm not proud of what I did but I 'm sure Chris would be the first to admit we were having problems .
" I am surprised to hear he got rid of that bird , " she added to The Guardian newspaper .
" He spent more time talking to it than he did to me . "

The Internet was born as early as 1969 , but no later than 1983 , depending on what you consider to be the event most analogous to a ' birth ' .
However , only a tiny fraction of the world 's people were aware of the Internet even in the early 1990s .
Then , by 1994 - 95 , the graphical browser from Netscape seemingly emerged from nowhere , opening up a wonderland that appeared to have the sum total of human knowledge instantly available to anyone with a computer .
This ' World Wide Web ' was predicted by almost no one in the late 1980s and was absent from the vast majority of science fiction work depicting the late 1990s onwards , just five years before it happened ( with the notable exception of Ray Kurzweil in his book " The Age of Intelligent Machines " ) .
So many supposed ' great thinkers ' missed it .
How ?
Because , while they could easily extrapolate exponential trends such as Moore 's Law and the dropping cost of telephone calls / data transfer , almost no one thought about the bigger vision - combining the two .
1 ) By the late 1980s , personal computers were starting to make their way to the mass market .
That most of the population might have bought their first PC by 1995 was an easy prediction .
2 ) Long - distance telephone rates were dropping through the full 20 - year period from 1970 to 1990 .
That this would continue until costs would be virtually zero was an easy prediction .
Plus , people already had modems and where exchanging data between computers in the 1980s .
But combining the two , for the grand vision of hundreds of millions of PCs collectively accessing and contributing to the growing World Wide Web of information , was the missing layer of analysis that almost every great thinker missed .
Notice how the number of internet hosts was already growing exponentially in the early 1990s , but the apparent ' knee of the curve ' occurred after 1996 .
So , the next question becomes :
How do we make additional predictions by noticing multiple , steady exponential trends , and knowing which ones will combine into something explosive , at what time ?
That is , of course , the $ 64 trillion question .
I will venture a few , however , in the coming weeks .
Stay tuned ..........

As Vista slowly slips further into the mists of the future , I sometimes wonder if anything has really changed since I was on the losing side of the IBM - Microsoft OS / 2 war .
Why do we now hear of huge re-writes in a product that 's supposed to be almost ready ?
As a former O/S ( Operating System ) bug hunter , it sounds rather familiar .
No matter how disciplined you are in architecture , little issues have a way of forcing you to implement wider - ranging changes , and these build up like water behind a dam .
This can become a nasty techno / political problem .
Managers will play bluffing games , each hoping another team will take the bullet of making the project late .
So , you have managers expressing increasingly fictitious optimism , until the breaking point - when suddenly torrents of issues will flood through , with lots of relief ( and a bit of schadenfreude ) all round .
Then you can " fix " the project , merely by firing managers at random and allowing them to become blame sinks .
It would be too cynical of me to say that the management changes we 've seen reported here are the result ( El Reg 's take on this is here ) .
Way too cynical - I can't be right can I ?
It 's hard to gauge progress in a huge project like an O/S , so management focuses on a range of statistics and capability milestones .
OS / 2 reached the point several times where we found bugs faster than they could be fixed .
One set were caused by the compiler and processor having different ideas about valid opcodes .
Thus , bugs could depend upon the revision level of the CPU , and no code review could help you .
Management responded to this more than once by simply banning the finding of bugs , in a denial of bad news that would shame a Soviet spin doctor ; you had to be a third level manager to " approve " a bug at one point .
Bug hunters are seen as the bad guys by individual managers , whatever the top level says ( some managers think that the testing process itself actually " makes " bugs , which would n't be there if you did n't test - Ed ] .
They bring bad news .
In all organisations the bringers of good news prosper over the bringers of bad .
At IBM , however , us bug hunters were generally seen as valuable by the organisation as a whole , not least because we annoyed Microsoft ; and , yes , blame management became a big issue , complete with its negative productivity .
Microsoft has lots of smart people ; " evangelists " who ride out to inspire us all with the wisdom of Microsoft ways .
Ever heard of its testers ?
Reckon they 're the best paid people in Redmond ?
A tester should have a superset of the skills used by developers ; but at too many firms testing is a sin bin , and paid accordingly ; and it's hard to see that not being the cause of many disasters on the scale of Vista .
At IBM , some of us had a simplistic model .
Each line of new / fixed code put into the system has some probability of breaking it in a new way , and this probability grows with the size of code already written .
So , for a given quality and size of programming team , there is a maximum size of system .
Beyond that , any attempt at change is as likely to break something else as to fix a problem .
This steady state is permanent and fatal ; have the Vista teams hit it ?
Yes , I do mean " teams " plural .
The failure of OS / 2 commercially was partly down to the decision to do version 1.3 , and thus stop 2.0 in its tracks .
1.3 was a result of listening to customers , and was a lighter , faster , crap version , of 1.2 , whereas 2.0 had loads of cool features like being 32 bit and having the ability to run Windows apps .
There are competing teams within any large project – and when one version hits the sweet spot of desirability and plausibility for delivery , do you think that makes them friends ?
Individual Microsoft programming units are often larger than several whole companies , and so ( it seems to me ) " us " may be our bit of Microsoft , and " them " another part of Microsoft ; not the official Linux enemy .
Also , techies are known for their bitchiness ( I have no doubt that this article will prod people to point out some of my screw - ups over the last 20 years ) and often bug reports and fix requests are seen as coming from malicious incompetents , not colleagues .
We referred to the IBM team rewriting MS compilers as " children playing with matches " and refused point - blank to use their output ; and they doubtless had equally unkind things to say about us .
" Arrogant prima donnas " is probably all I can use here , without getting Reg Developer added to the banned site list .
The Vista teams must also be hitting " deadline fatigue " by now .
People get increasingly cynical about the assertions made by other groups and , after a while , by their own managers , who are torn between honesty with the troops and being seen as a " good team player " by their peers and bosses .
Also , in order to actually get a program out of the door , there are always compromises and fudges and things that just happen to work .
More than one bug in a Microsoft product has been fixed by deleting something from the manual [ that happened back in the days of MVS mainframes too , nothing changes - Ed ] .
We 've all done this , but the more deadlines you rush for , the more " clever hacks " accumulate , and by their nature are not only undocumented , but often unknown to anyone other than the developer who bodged them .
Source code control can fray a bit in the last desperate hours - it's not unknown for the source for the version of memory manager that actually shipped to be " lost " .
These issues actually make net progress slower , and the sort of managers who genuinely believe that sport is a good metaphor in setting goals for teams often do n't realise that trying for an unachievable target does n't bring out the best in people .
In fact , it actually digs a hole for the next wave of cannon fodder to fall into .
DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) does n't help .
Ever since Fred Brooks wrote
The Mythical Man-Month , based on his experiences with OS / 360 ( and since augmented with new material ) , we 've tried to segment large systems so that bugs do n't spread .
But to be effective , digital rights must be managed right across the system in a cooperative fashion .
That massively increases the effort and bug count , yet as far as the customer is concerned DRM itself is the bug .
A " feature " is something you 'd pay money to get .
DRM does not pass that test .
But I 'm not in the OS - writing game any more , thankfully , so I 'm looking forward to lots of feedback telling me in detail where my ideas are obsolete . ®
Hello !
I hope you had a merry Christmas , or if you do n't celebrate Christmas , that you enjoyed being tormented and outcast by society .
I think it is not an overstatement to say that I have many Christmas gifts for you in the form of fun new ( intangible ) things that you will enjoy !
Except , not all of my gifts for you are wrapped , and some of them are in various stages of being assembled or shipped or whatever the metaphor would be , and so you and I may have to wait a little while and instead celebrate a merry New Year , or perhaps a merry Martin Luther King Day , or possibly some sort of merry President 's Day or Flag Day or Columbus Day before all my goods are ready for you to consume .
Basically what I 'm saying is that it's a good thing we have a lot of holidays , and also that I do n't need to be shackled to oppressive holiday - centric gift - giving conventions , but also , I am behind on a lot of projects .

Cambridge , MA : Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have finally succeeded in creating the long sought after mobius pizza , a one sided pizza completely covered with toppings .
Science has long been aware that pizza lovers prefer toppings more than a bare crust .
" We 've attempted to solve this problem by adding flavorings and or cheese to outer crust or to make a deep dish styled pie filled with toppings , " stated MIT 's Chief Scientist of Foodology , Dr. John Jacobs .
" Of course such actions did nothing regarding the pizza 's long ignored side , the bottom side . "
Pizza scientists , philosophers , and theologians have long theorized of the existence of a one sided pizza completed covered with rich gooey toppings for the utmost in pizza pleasure .
Plato wrote in 412 BC that the typical two sided pizza was merely an imperfect materialization of the ideal one - sided form of a true pizza .
Rene Descartes continued this line of reasoning in his Principles and Passions on Pizza , where he wrote that because the bottom side was facing down and invisible to the eye , he could not even prove its existence , thus there had to be a perfect pizza where all sides were visible .
In more modern history Alexander Graham Bell devoted decades and hundreds of research assistants to the problem , but at best could only get a pizza with 1.999999 sides .
Even Albert Einstein once remarked that he regretted that a one sided pizza would never be realized in his lifetime after his infamous P=st² equation failed to produce any real world results .

Until only recently , scientists could create a pizza with 1.0000001 sides , but its atomic weight was unevenly distributed allowing it to exist for only milliseconds before collapsing in on itself .
However , the researchers at MIT finally formalized the mathematical underpinnings .
" It turns out that for the three thousand years we 've been forgetting to carry over the three .
We 're all quite embarrassed about it , " admitted Dr. Jacobs .
The mobius pizza can only be created in a zero- gravity oven specifically designed for the United States military .
It is expected to be sold in the coming year exclusively through newly created Halliburton Pizza outlets for only $ 9999.97 with your choice of three toppings .

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The Democratic victory last week has our political elites in both parties and in the national media squealing like stuck pigs .
Way to go , America , we may be on the way .
It seems nothing frightens our free trade and pro-illegal immigration orthodoxies more than putting the common good and the national interest above dominant special interests , corporate America and , of course , our darling elites in both political parties and the media .
The Bush administration long ago took polemics and false choices to a high art form .
On the issue of the war in Iraq , this administration has starkly defined our choices , until recently , as " stay the course " or " cut and run . "
Any critic of our conduct of this war , like me , has been declared unpatriotic .
Any critic of this administration 's faith - based economic policies that drive its free - trade agenda , like me , has been labeled an economic isolationist .
But now the name - calling and labeling is reaching a new level , and from all quarters .
The political , business and media elites have called me a " table - thumping protectionist " because I want balanced and mutual trade , because I want this country to export as much as it imports .
They 've called me a racist , nativist xenophobe because , in order to win the war on terror , the war on drugs and to stop illegal immigration , I want our borders and ports secured .
Over the past week , pundits and savants of both the left and the right have been trying to simultaneously define me and the newly elected Democratic victors in the Senate and the House by accusing us of being populists .
What a dirty little word .
Horrifying .
I admit to being , among many other things , a proponent of populism .
But I do believe my critics should look up the definition before they sling the word at me like a filthy epithet .
On second thought , it may be to them , because a populist is , after all , nothing more than " a supporter of the rights and the power of the people . "
In fact , I 'm a damn proud populist .
Since the election , there 's been an incredible confluence of one of the nation 's most liberal online magazines -- Slate -- with one of the world 's most traditional establishment newspapers -- The Financial Times -- to decry what Slate columnist Jacob Weisberg calls the ascension of the " Lou Dobbs Democrats . "
Weisberg decries what he sees as my " economic nationalism " and instructs us that such nationalism " begins from the populist premise that working people are n't doing so well .
But instead of blaming the rich at home , it focuses its energy on the poor abroad . "
The Financial Times also published Weisberg 's column , obviously equally unsettled with the possible turnaround in the new Congress , which could inconveniently lead to some mild discomfort for the Times ' corporate masters and some marginal improvement in the lives of America 's middle class .
Both Slate and The Financial Times resist saying what I 've been saying loudly and clearly :
We 're in a class war , and our middle class is losing , and losing badly .
But I do blame and have blamed the rich , corporate America and our political elites in both parties who have permitted the unabated assault on middle - class working men and women and their families .
And by God , I hope they 're right about the Lou Dobbs Democrats , and I hope they find some Lou Dobbs Republicans in the fight to return our government to the people .
I have never blamed the poor of Mexico , China or India for corporate America 's avarice and our political elites ' cowardice .
I blame us for forgetting that the United States is first a nation , and secondly a marketplace or an economy , and I blame us for being taken as fools by both political parties for far too long .
It is not nationalism by any stretch of the imagination for me to remind those in power that our political system , our great democracy , makes possible our free - enterprise economy , and not vice versa as the elites continually propagandize .
From the right , The Weekly Standard lamented that the Lou Dobbs Democrats " did n't just attack the GOP 's corruption and malfeasance ; they embraced a more thoroughgoing economic populism .... "
The conservative Standard is obviously more upset that the newly elected Democratic senators and congressmen want to focus not only on the corruption and incompetence of the Republicans , but -- God help us -- many of our new officeholders also actually want to see this great free - enterprise democracy work for all Americans .
No wonder the orthodoxies on the left and the right are convulsing .
Human Events
Online , another conservative publication , attacks my sincerity and conviction with the bizarre notion that because -- as it says -- I can " afford a bottle of Cristal or Dom Perignon " that my concern for the middle class is really nothing more than crocodile tears .
Human Events did n't quite get the fact that as flawed as I am , as many mistakes as I 've made in my life , the one thing I have n't done is forget that I was born poor , both parents working , and I 've never forgotten those who have made my opportunities in this country possible .
Also disturbed by the perturbation in their political universe and liberal orthodoxy , Newsweek columnists Fareed Zakaria and Jonathan Alter attacked my positions on illegal immigration ( I 'm against it ) and border security ( I 'm for it ) .
Zakaria refers to " CNN's Lou Dobbs and his angry band of xenophobes " and Jonathan Alter describes those who agree with me as " nativist Lou Dobbsians . "
But Alter and Zakaria are far too bright to not know better .
I 've never once called for a restriction on legal immigration -- in fact , I 've called for an increase , if it can be demonstrated that as a matter of public policy the nation requires more than the one million people we bring into this country legally each year .
And what does it mean to be a nativist in the United States in the 21st century when ours is the most ethnically and racially diverse society on the face of the earth ?
Both Alter and Zakaria are smart enough to know the answer to that question , and they know better than to write such drivel .
Neither Zakaria or Alter can substantiate their disappointing attempts at labels with a single thing I 've ever said or written .
I say what I mean and I mean what I say .
What we all need to be about now is honesty and forthrightness .
And the truth is , our political , business and media elites have abandoned the cornerstone of this great nation : equality of rights , equality of economic opportunity and equality of educational opportunity .
And , yes , I 'm an ardent and fervent believer in the first three words of that radical populist document , which begins with the words " We the People . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
A former CIA operative wanted for trial for acts of terrorism against Cuba is stuck in legal limbo in a Texas jail .
Luis Posada , 78 , who has allegedly taken part in plots to assassinate Fidel Castro and bomb Havana hotels , is being described as a test case of the US government 's commitment to fighting terrorism .
Mr Posada , a Cuban opponent of President Castro who is a naturalised Venezuelan , is in jail in El Paso , Texas .
He was arrested in Florida in 2005 on charges of entering the country illegally .
He has been accused by Cuba and Venezuela of being part of a 1976 plot to blow up a Cuban airliner en route from Venezuela to Cuba with the loss of 73 lives .
Both countries now seek his extradition to stand trial .
The US courts have ruled that Mr Posada should not be sent to Venezuela or Cuba on the grounds that he would not receive a fair trial and may face torture .
Mr Posada has denied involvement in the airliner bombing , but has admitted being part of a plot to bomb Havana hotels , which led to the death of an Italian tourist .
In addition , he was jailed for an assassination attempt on President Castro in Panama in 2000 , although he was later pardoned by the Panamanian authorities .
For the Bush administration , committed to a " war on terror " and opposed to anyone " willing to harbour a terrorist or feed a terrorist " , in the president 's words , Mr Posada is an increasing irritation .
One solution was for him to leave the US for a country prepared to offer him a home .
However , so far seven countries which have been approached - Canada , Mexico , El Salvador , Panama , Costa Rica , Honduras , and Guatemala - have all refused .
Yesterday his lawyer in El Paso , Felipe Millan , said that situation remains unchanged .
But the Maxtor Fusion may have other problems gaining acceptance .
At about $ 700 , it is nearly twice the price of other 500 - gigabyte hard drives .
Current Analysis , a San Diego market research firm , said consumers would pay only a $ 100 premium for this type of software and service .
The other problem comes after the box is taken home .
The first part of setting up the storage device is a joy .
Plug in the cables and turn it on .
Run the software on the enclosed disc and within five minutes you can move data , photos , videos and music to the storage and to every device on your network .
The second part , enabling the device to provide access to data from outside your home network is  well , let Maxtor ’s user guide describe it : “ This portion of the setup may prove challenging to complete . ”
Owners are faced with bewildering instructions about configuring the system to reroute dynamic D.N.S. addresses .
Image Credit ... Illustration by Dave Ember
If you know what that means , then you wo n’t have a problem .
For everyone else , be prepared to call Maxtor ’s technical support to get it running .
Better setup software could solve this problem .
( If you insist on knowing , computers seeking access to the home storage device from outside the home network have to know the address of the device .
But because most Internet service providers do not assign a static address , an additional service has to be used to locate and route requests to whatever address your service provider has assigned to it . )
That said , the Fusion does what it promises .
It is easy to store data and to designate what the public can see .
Mr. Baker predicts that the device will take some time to catch on .
“ It ’s a next - year product , ” he said .
But David Tang , vice president for marketing at Fabrik , says it will appeal to the type of people using MySpace and to other creative types who want to share their content by streaming music or video to friends .

I have been following reddit.com since I got my eyes on it ( I suspect I have been one of the first 100 users of reddit ) .
I start my day with it ; be it office or home .
And I am amazed every day .
For the uninitiated , it is a news / articles aggregator .
Basically any registered user can contribute any link to the site and the link will come up on the newest links tab .
Then users can rank the link with either a " + " or a " - " showing their interest / preference for the link .
The most popular ones will then be lifted to the hottest tab .
there also exists an all time favorite tab
The links that come up on the new tab are themselves worth the time one spends on the site .
They are an eclectic mix mirroring the interests and biases of the frequent contributors to the site .
I may be the target audience for such a site so the presented links generally interest me a lot .
There are many sites which do that .
Kuro5hin and slashdot come to mind .
But what really drives value in reddit is the unexpected surprise of a link which is both rare as well as very pertinent or interesting .
This I guess is because of the way the site has chosen to rank the links : people vote with their eyeballs / mind / clicks .
On the other hand there exists memeorandum .
This site was started by Gabe Rivera , the 32 - year - old programmer who quit his job at Intel .
it started off with a politicas section and now it has a tech section too .
This takes more of a centralised approach .
Links are selected in a pseudo algorithmic way from pre-picked sites which Gabe selects .
" Credibility and Engagement within peers " seems to be the ranking index for selection .
memeorandum has received its share of publicity which can be seen via links at the right hand pane on its blog .
memeorandum serves up a mix of links which turn into talking points because of the close coterie of high visibility bloggers and " web 2.0 conference attendees " .
the discussion and the feedback among bloggers is the only reason I frequent this site .
Both the sites greatly alleviate the need to go through hundreds of links served by feed aggregators .
But in my opinion reddit clearly is more informative and enjoyable than the staid , polictically correct style of memeorandum .
Also reddit is faster , way faster .
This can be seen in the number of days it took memeorandum to pick up the flock story .
It has come on memeorandum today ( Oct 22 , 2005 ) only while it appeared on reddit almost a month back .
This i think is because reddit gives power to the people .
Links with nuisance value only , get segregated into the new tab guaranteeing that links in top tab are really useful .
I think in future this the way to go : people vote within a system which filters content with only nuisance value .
The centralised way of filtering content will slowly fade away or get slotted into niched applications where freshness of content or new innovations are not necessary .
( originally posted on centrality )
Network analysts often speak about ( un ) directed graphs .
In essence , this refers to whether or not someone you know knows you .
If reciprocity is required by the system , it ’s an undirected graph .
The vast majority of online social networking tools assume that users are modeling friendship and thus if you ’re friends with someone , they better damn well be friends with you .
As such , they use undirected graphs and you are required to confirm that they are indeed your friend .
Well , what about fandom ?
Orkut actually put the concept of fan into their system , but in order to be someone ’s fan , you had to be their friend first .
Baroo ?
I ’ve noticed that Friendster introduced fans , although it is not consistent across the site ; the system decides who is celebrity .
I can be a fan of Pamela Anderson but i cannot be a fan of Michel Foucault or Henry Jenkins .
While i can understand that the former is clearly a Fakester , the latter is actually a real academic with a Friendster Profile that i genuinely admire ( far more than Ms. Anderson ) .
Even on MySpace where bands have a separate section , i have to add them to my friends ; i can not simply be fans .
The world is not an undirected graph and very little about social life online is actually undirected .
Many social relations are unequal ; they are rooted in directional graphs – fandom , power , hierarchy .
So why do we use undirected models ?
Of course , there are many systems that have directed graphs .
I can read blogs by bloggers who who do n’t read me ; blogrolls are directed .
I can have friends on LiveJournal that do not reciprocate .
I can subscribe to del.icio.us feeds of people that i admire without forcing them to do the same .
I can make a Flickr user a contact simply so that i can watch their photos .
I do all this because i know the world is not undirected .
Part of the problem is that we ’ve built a model off of social networks instead of attention networks and there ’s a very subtle difference between the two .
Attention networks recognize power .
They recognize that someone may actually have a good collection of references or be a good photographer and that someone else may want to pay attention to them even if their own collections are not worthy of reciprocation .
Attention networks realize that the world is not an undirected graph .
There are many good reasons to use attention networks in systems instead of social networks .
Do you really want to force people to get permission to subscribe to public material of someone else ?
Do you really want to put people through the awkwardness of having to approve someone that they do n’t know simply because one person respects the other ?
Of course , the awkwardness of social networks does not disappear simply by having directed graphs .
Reciprocity is still an issue whenever the networks are performative ( visible as a statement of connection ) .
This is most apparent in the blogging community where people feel insulted that they are not included on the blogroll of a blog that they read regularly .
Thus , people feel the need to perform a relation of someone that they do not read simply for good social measure .
Attention networks are far more visible when people actually use the network for some purpose .
Friendster networks are meant to be performative first and foremost .
There ’s minimal cost to having more friends .
It may foul up your gallery searches but , really , does it make a difference if you see 4,325,935 people instead of 4,311,266 ?
Attention networks like LiveJournal and Flickr combine the network with the subscription process .
You want to keep your Friends page clean and to only get information from people you care about .
Of course , LJ also recognizes that there are times when you need plausible deniability .
It allows you to create a separate group of LJ folks that you actually watch ( separate from your “ friends ” list ) .
The subscription process is inherently a process of attention relations , not friendship .
Of course , the computation needed for directed graphs is much greater than for undirected graphs .
Is that the main reason that most services require reciprocity ?
Even when it ’s not the best mechanism for the system ?
Or are there other reasons why folks are obsessed with undirected graphs ?

Poll shows most Americans consider racism a problem
• Blacks more than twice as likely to call racism a " very serious " problem
• Almost half of whites and blacks say they know someone who is racist
• Only a few of either race say they are racially biased themselves
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Most Americans , white and black , see racism as a lingering problem in the United States , and many say they know people who are racist , according to a new poll .
But few Americans of either race -- about one out of eight -- consider themselves racist .
And experts say racism has evolved from the days of Jim Crow to the point that people may not even recognize it in themselves .
( Watch how many blacks are still afraid to stop in a Texas town )
A poll conducted last week by Opinion Research Corp. for CNN indicates that whites and blacks disagree on how serious a problem racial bias is in the United States .
Almost half of black respondents -- 49 percent -- said racism is a " very serious " problem , while 18 percent of whites shared that view .
Forty - eight percent of whites and 35 percent of blacks chose the description " somewhat serious . "
( See the poll results )
Asked if they know someone they consider racist , 43 percent of whites and 48 percent of blacks said yes .
But just 13 percent of whites and 12 percent of blacks consider themselves racially biased .
The poll was based on phone interviews conducted December 5 through Thursday with 1,207 Americans , including 328 blacks and 703 non-Hispanic whites .
Blind to bias ?
University of Connecticut professor Jack Dovidio , who has researched racism for more than 30 years , estimates up to 80 percent of white Americans have racist feelings they may not even recognize .
" We 've reached a point that racism is like a virus that has mutated into a new form that we do n't recognize , " Dovidio said .
He added that 21st - century racism is different from that of the past .
" Contemporary racism is not conscious , and it is not accompanied by dislike , so it gets expressed in indirect , subtle ways , " he said .
That " stealth " discrimination reveals itself in many different situations .
A three - year undercover investigation by the National Fair Housing Alliance found that real estate agents steered whites away from integrated neighborhoods and steered blacks toward predominantly black neighborhoods .
" Racism here is quite subtle , " e-mailed CNN.com reader Blair William , originally from Trinidad , who now lives in Lexington , South Carolina .
" I think that the issue is twofold .
I believe that white America 's perception of blacks is still generally negative based on their limited interaction with blacks , whether this is via the media or in person .
...
" On the other hand , black Americans need to stop devaluing themselves and their people , " he added .
" Another race can only respect you if you respect yourself and currently , I find that blacks still devalue and disgrace each other and themselves . "
Applicants ' names may sway employers
Racism also can be a factor in getting a job .
( Watch how poll respondents feel about race and the top job in the U.S. )
Candidates named Emily O'Brien or Neil McCarthy were much more likely to get calls back from potential employers than applicants named Tamika Williams and Jamal Jackson , even though they had the same credentials , according to a study by the University of Chicago .
Racial bias may even determine whether you can flag a cab .
New York Times writer Calvin Sims recently wrote about his experiences in the city .
" If a cab passes you by , obviously it is frustrating , it 's degrading and it's just really confusing , because this is akin to being in the South and being refused service at a lunch counter , which is what happened in the '60s and ' 70s , " he said .
' Differences ... make this world exciting '
The Opinion Research poll shows that blacks and whites disagree on how each race feels about the other .
Asked how many whites dislike blacks , 40 percent of black respondents said " all " or " many . "
Twenty - six percent of whites chose one of those replies .
On the question of how many blacks dislike whites , 33 percent of blacks said " all " or " many , " while 38 percent of whites agreed -- not a significant difference statistically because of the poll 's 5 percent margin of error .
About half of black respondents said they had been a victim of discrimination because of their race .
A little more than a quarter of whites said they had been victims of racial discrimination .
" I am a firm believer that racism is rampant in the United States , " wrote another CNN.com reader , Mark Boyle , of Muncie , Indiana .
" The concept of ' race ' is flawed , " he added .
" Our differences as human beings are what make this world exciting and interesting .
If we were all of the same culture , how boring would that be ?
The world needs to take a page from the atmosphere in Hawaii -- the most racially diverse place in which I have lived . "
If you 've been following the court cases the RIAA have been launching against individuals , you 'll remember they start out by saying " we have evdience that you have been stealing our music , if you do n't settle , we 'll take you to court . "
People tend to be scared by this , and pay up .
Not so Mr. Wilke .
He has asked for a court to provide a summary judgement , on the grounds that he's not the person the RIAA seem to think he is , he 's never had one set of the songs on his computer , and the second set of songs he did have , but because he'd ripped them from his own CD collection .
The RIAA has filed a motion for " expedited recovery " to allow it to gather evidence .
Gather evidence ?
Yes , that 's right - although the RIAA sent a letter to Mr. Wilkes claiming to have proof that he'd been illegally downloading evidence , when given a chance to provide it to the court , they have to ask for time to start looking for that evidence :
" Plaintiffs can not at this time , without an opportunity for
full discovery present by affidavit facts essential to justify their opposition to Defendant 's motion "
It 's not known if all the lawyers in the music industry turn up packed into one car , which then falls apart as they emerge from it , but there is something of the comedy outsize shoe about these proceedings .
Once again , the RIAA has been caught launching speculative court cases without any proper evidence to back them up , in the hope that those they target will just cave in and pay up .
We 're sure this is totally different from blackmail in lots of ways .

Foods That Boost Your Mood Food has the ability to improve your mood .
If you have a fairly good diet , you can open up your pantry and come upon plenty of mood - boosting delicacies that are both healthy and delicious .
When you are dealing with any mood changes , whether it is more irritability , anger , or just mood swings , it is a good idea to take a look at your health and lifestyle first .
While it might be related to a medical condition that your doctor can help treat , consider what your current lifestyle is like .
Are you drinking alcohol or caffeine more than normal ?
Do you get enough exercise ?
How is your stress level ?
Another important aspect of your mood and mental health is with your diet .
There are quite a few healthy and delicious foods that are not only food for your body , but can help boost your modo as well .
Here are the top 14 foods that are going to give you a nice mood boost .
1 . Dark Leafy Greens
The first type of food that can be amazing for your mood is dark , leafy greens .
Greens have a variety of nutrients .
These include fiber , which balances your blood sugar , B vitamins for brain health , as well as iron .
Studies show that iron deficiency is closely linked to anxiety and disrupted neurotransmitters as well , which provides even more reason to eat these nutritious veggies Iron also helps to produce energy , which can lead to positive feelings .
While it can be great for boosting your mood , you also want to be sure not to have too much iron .
Talk to your doctor to discuss the right amount .
2 . Salmon Salmon acts as a great source of omega - 3 fatty acids , which are exceptional for helping to boost your mood .
Omega - 3 fatty acids act as crucial elements in the development of your nervous system and brain .
In geographical areas where the residents eat more fatty fish , they become less likely to get anxious or depressed , so it makes sense that it would be good for your mood !
There are also high amounts of protein as well as vitamins B12 and D in omega - 3 fatty foods like salmon .
If you have n’t had much salmon before , try adding it into your diet slowly .
You can just have a little bit of salmon on your salad with lots of veggies ( and leafy greens ! ) , or make a small serving of blackened salmon with brown rice and steamed veggies .
These provide simple , healthy ways to incorporate salmon into your diet .
3 . Turkey Full of tryptophan , turkey produces a neurotransmitter called serotonin .
When you have lower levels of tryptophan in your body , that can lead to less serotonin development as well as an increase in depression and anxiety .
Turkey also has tyrosine , an amino acid that is related to neurotransmitters .
Turkey is a healthy , low - fat protein option , so it is great for most people ’s diets .
Whether you are on a general healthy diet , low - carb or low - fat diet , it is going to work great for you .
Start adding turkey to your sandwiches , have roasted turkey for dinner , or use ground turkey in place of ground beef in different recipes .
Some other mood - boosting elements of turkey include vitamins B6 and B12 , as well as zinc .
Zinc deficiencies often lead to increased occurrences of depression and anxiety .
4 . Chia Seeds
Chia seeds act as another rich source of omega - 3 fatty acids , as well as nutrients such as iron , calcium , fiber , and protein .

However , if you like eggs , definitely add them to your diet to help boost your mood .
They are high in vitamins B12 and D , as well as protein .
Eggs have choline , which helps with your nervous system , mood , and makes neurotransmitters and selenium , an antioxidant .
When you eat antioxidant - rich foods , it helps with your brain health and boosts your mood .
6 . Lentils Next up is lentil , which supply folate , a vitamin that helps your nervous system develop .
Those who are deficient in folate experience higher rates of depression .
They also contain fiber , which helps with blood sugar , protein , vitamin B6 , and iron .
Vitamin B6 makes neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin .
If you are not accustomed to eating lentils , just start small by adding some to salads or having soup with lentils in them .
7 . Avocados
The good thing about avocados is that not only do they help boost your mood , but they are delicious !
Many people love eating avocados , but had no idea they could actually be good for you .
It is true that avocados are higher in fat , but it is the healthy type of fat .
They contain fiber and vitamins B6 , E and C . Another valuable vitamin you can get from avocados is B5 , which helps your neurotransmitters develop .
8 . Fermented Foods
In the past few years , research has shown a definite link between your brain and gut .
Over 90 percent of serotonin gets produced in your digestive system .
So , to get your moods back on track , you will need to prioritize your gut health .
These days , researchers have looked at the link between mood and gut bacteria .
Some meta - analyses even say that probiotics can help with depression .
Whether your fermented food item of choice is sauerkraut , kombucha , or even dairy - free yogurt , all of these foods are excellent sources of probiotics .
9 . Chocolate
There is a reason you tend to feel better and happier after eating chocolate , and it is not just from the sugar .
Chocolate , particularly dark chocolate , is amazing for health and wellness .
It contains compounds such as phenylethylamine ( for endorphins ) and anandamide , which researchers call the “ bliss ” chemical .
Not only is chocolate a good source of antioxidants , but it can also improve cognition and mood .
For a healthier option , try to go for the darkest chocolate you are able to enjoy , looking for lower amounts of sugar in the chocolate .
10 . Ghee
If you do n’t like butter or ca n’t eat it due to a dairy allergy , you ’re in luck !
You can instead use ghee , which is made from butter , but does n’t have the same effect on your body .
It also happens to be another great food for improving your mood .
Also known as clarified butter , ghee has a lot of nutritious fats as well as vitamin D .
It also helps to heal the digestive tract , which allows your gut bacteria to develop .
11 . Sunflower Seeds
A great source of vitamins B6 , E , and magnesium , sunflower seeds are a good mood booster for those with allergies to nuts .
You can easily switch any type of nut called for in a recipe for sunflower seeds .
Try adding sunflower seeds to your salads , or just having a handful of the seeds as a snack with a piece of fruit or cheese .
12 . Almonds Almonds act as an amazing source of protein , vitamin E , fiber , and magnesium .
Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant , which helps fight damage caused by free radicals .
This food item also improves your cognition and memory .
Not only can they help improve your mood and your overall health , but they are really easy to add to your diet .
There are so many ways to incorporate more almonds into your diet , from dipping apple slices in almond butter , to switching to almond flour in your baked goods when you want a healthier option .
13 . Bell Peppers
Before finishing off this list , we ca n’t forget about bell peppers .
All colors of bell peppers are great for you , low in fat , low in carbohydrates , and have lots of vitamins and minerals .
Bell peppers have the antioxidant vitamin C , which helps the functioning of your nervous system and the improvement of your cognition .
Studies show that vitamin C reduces your stress and helps with mood .
14 . Sardines 562985067
Last , but not least , are sardines .
These are an acquired taste and not mandatory , but a good option if you enjoy the salty fish .
Sardines come with a bunch of mood - boosting elements .
In addition to high levels of vitamin B12 , sardines have choline , vitamin D , protein , selenium , and omega - 3 fatty acids .
Boosting your mood with food is one of the easiest ways to improve your well - being over time .
You can see results even if you do n’t overhaul your diet right away .
Just making one or two changes to your diet to include more mood - friendly foods can be just the thing to change your life for the better .
Whether that change involves getting acquainted with kombucha or keeping a dark chocolate bar in your drawer “ in case of emergency ” , making tweaks to your diet now can pay dividends in the future .
Fruits and Vegetables That Kids Enjoy
When you start juicing with your family so that you can make healthy green juice for your kids , you will be using a variety of fruits and vegetables .
You might want to try different ingredients so that you can offer different types of juices for a wide range of benefits and tastes .

A better idea is to use more fruits and vegetables they like to keep it interesting .
Here are some fruits and vegetables that kids tend to favor over others , so they are good ones to start with .
Fruit Fruit does tend to be favored in general over fruit , so make sure even your vegetable or green juice has some fruit in it .
This makes it tastier , can alter its color , and really helps to cover up the flavor of greens and other vegetables you are using in your juice .
Here are some top favorite fruits among children : Berries – Kids seem to love berries , making it one of their favorite fruits .
Strawberries are often high up on the list , as they are juicy , sweet , and have a bit of a tangy flavor .
They are also nutrition and perfect for juicing , as well as berries like raspberries , blueberries , and blackberries .

There is a good amount of juice in apples , plus they are really good at covering up the taste of greens .
These can really help to sweeten up your green juices .
Citrus fruits – Citrus fruits like lemons , limes , and grapefruits might not be eaten a lot on their own , but kids do tend to like them in juice .
Try adding a small lemon or grapefruit that is juiced into other juices , and it becomes a really fun recipes .
Tropical fruit – Do n’t forget about the popularity of your more tropical and exotic fruits , such as watermelon , mango , cantaloupe , and papaya .
These are really fun to use since some of them are a little out of the ordinary .
Go ahead and add some kiwi and dragonfruit to the mix .
Peaches and pears – Some more fruit favorites among children are peaches , pears , nectarines , and apricots .
Vegetables

So this list is more of a generalized list of veggies to try adding to your juice .
Beets – Many kids actually love beets .
They like the bright red color , the sweet and tangy flavor , and the fact that it is fun to spread on toast or add to their juice and change the entire look of it .
Greens –
Do n’t be put off on making green juice with plenty of leafy greens , as many kids actually like it .
You are still adding a bit of fruit juice to your green juice , so it is n’t going to taste just like vegetables .
However , kids do tend to enjoy kale and spinach in their green use when used the right way .
Carrots – Carrots are the perfect vegetable to add to a juice when you want to increase its health benefits , and kids like carrots , so that ’s a major plus .

Soup Ideas Using Fall Superfoods
If there is one type of food synonymous with fall , it ’s soup .
So , it makes sense that you want to combine soup and superfoods .
There are tons of ideas , but these soup ideas are great ones to start with .
You can then customize them according to your preferences .
Harvest Squash Soup
This first soup is going to start with the basis of a classic butternut squash soup , but also add in some other fall harvest ingredients , including other veggies and seasonings that are perfect for this time of year .
You can use your butternut squash , along with pumpkin or other types of squash that you can get in the fall .
This soup also tastes really great when you add in some tomatoes , onions , and celery .
Then use vegetable broth , some cooked rice , and your choice of seasonings .
At this point , you can customize it until you have made the perfect harvest squash soup .
Turkey and Rice Soup Rice is a great addition to any soup , since it adds more fiber , lots of flavor , and makes the soup more hearty and filling .
You can use wild rice or any other type of rice you like for this one , including white or brown rice .
The superfoods here come from the turkey and kale , which are both excellent to have in the fall season .
This is a hot soup that will warm bellies on a chilly fall evening .
Some ingredients that go great with this soup are tomatoes , celery , onions , carrots , and kale or spinach if you prefer .
You can either use vegetable broth or chicken broth for a little more flavor .
Quinoa Soup with Superfoods
Another excellent soup recipe to try out is also going to use grains , but it has quinoa instead of rice .
Not only is the quinoa itself a superfood you can enjoy year - round , but it also includes some great superfood veggies for you .
Quinoa is high in protein and fiber , and generally more nutritious than other types of rice .
Kick the superfoods up a notch with veggies like cabbage , broccoli , cauliflower , and kale .
You can also have more of a harvest quinoa soup with butternut squash , but that is entirely up to you .
Seasoning like thyme , oregano , onion , and celery are wonderful in this type of soup .
Sweet Potato and Carrot Soup
Two popular vegetables to enjoy during the fall that are also nutritious superfoods are carrots and sweet potato .
You can combine them by making this creamy soup in the fall .
You can use your peeled and sliced carrots , diced and peeled sweet potatoes , vegetable broth , and onion .
For an Asian flair , add in some red curry powder or paste , garlic , and ginger .
Physicists who work with a concept called string theory envision our universe as an eerie place with at least nine spatial dimensions , six of them hidden from us , perhaps curled up in some way so they are undetectable .
The big question is why we experience the universe in only three spatial dimensions instead of four , or six , or nine .
Two theoretical researchers from the University of Washington and Harvard University think they might have found the answer .
They believe the way our universe started and then diluted as it expanded – what they call the relaxation principle – favored formation of three - and seven - dimensional realities .
The one we happen to experience has three dimensions .
“ That ’s what comes out when you do the math , ” said Andreas Karch , a University of Washington assistant professor of physics and lead author of a new paper that details the theory .
Karch and his collaborator , Lisa Randall , a physics professor at Harvard , set out to model how the universe was arranged right after it began in the big bang , and then watch how the cosmos evolved as it expanded and diluted .
The only assumptions were that it started with a generally smooth configuration , with numerous structures – called membranes , or “ branes ” – that existed in various spatial dimensions from one to nine , all of them large and none curled up .
The researchers allowed the cosmos to evolve naturally , without making any additional assumptions .
They found that as the branes diluted , the ones that survived displayed three dimensions or seven dimensions .
In our universe , everything we see and experience is stuck to one of those branes , and for it to result in a three - dimensional universe the brane must be three - dimensional .
Other realities , either three - or seven - dimensional , could be hidden from our perception in the universe , Karch said .
“ There are regions that feel 3D .
There are regions that feel 5D .
There are regions that feel 9D .
These extra dimensions are infinitely large .
We just happen to be in a place that feels 3D to us , ” he said .
In our world , forces such as electromagnetism only recognize three dimensions and behave according to our laws of physics , their strength diminishing with distance .
Gravity , however , cuts across all dimensions , even those not recognized in our world , Karch and Randall say .
But they theorize that the force of gravity is localized and , with seven branes , gravity would diminish far more quickly with distance than it does in our three - dimensional world .
“ We know there are people in our three - brane existence .
In this case we will assume there are people somewhere nearby in a seven - brane existence .
The people in the three - brane would have a far more interesting world , with more complex structures , ” Karch said .
With gravity diminishing rapidly with distance , a seven - dimensional existence would not have planets with stable orbits around their sun , Karch said .
“ I am not precisely sure what a universe with such a short - range gravity would look like , mostly because it is always difficult to imagine how life would develop under completely different circumstances , ” he said .
“ But in any case , planetary systems as we know them would n’t form .
The possibility of stable orbits is what makes the three - dimensional world more interesting . ”
Karch and Randall detail their work in the October edition of Physical Review Letters , published by the American Physical Society .
The research was supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation .
Karch said they hope the work will spark extensive scientific exploration of many other questions involving string theory , extra dimensions and the evolution of the cosmos .
From University of Washington
During Professor Jim Fetzer 's appearance on The O'Reilly Factor Thursday night , O'Reilly equated the 9/11 Scholars with terrorists and threw his weight behind a move to have them being investigated by the FBI , in a similar vein to a previous case in which his false charges led to the arrest of another professor and charges of supporting terrorism which were later dismissed .
" I 'd put the FBI on you and that nutty Barrett and find out what the hell you guys are up to , " salivates O'Reilly , making reference to Sammy Al - Arian , a former professor at USF who was charged and later acquitted of helping to lead a Palestinian terrorist group that carried out suicide bombings against Israel .
During a September 2001 interview before his arrest , O'Reilly told Al - Arian , " if I was the CIA , I 'd follow you wherever you went .
I 'd follow you 24 hours . "
As Kurt Nimmo writes , " Bill O'Reilly essentially had Dr. Sami al - Arian , an associate professor of computer engineering at the University of South Florida , not only bounced from his job but also arrested and indicted by the Justice Department on racketeering and terrorist charges due to his alleged association with Palestinian Islamic Jihad .
Ashcroft went as far as to characterize al - Arian as " the North American leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad . "
In that context O'Reilly is equating 9/11 Scholars with terrorists and throwing his weight behind a move to have them arrested , detained and charged as enemy combatants .
" O'Reilly quite literally advocated the government having the FBI track Fetzer down to find out " what you guys are up to " - Bill O'Reilly quite clearly proved tonight that he is in fact a fascist , " writes 9/11 Blogger .
O'Reilly is n't alone in his desire to see people who question 9/11 targeted as supporters of terrorists .
The White House 's own strategy document for " winning the war on terror , " cited by Bush in a recent speech , identifies conspiracy theorists as terrorist recruiters .
The rest of the alleged " interview , " in which Fetzer was barely able to get in a sentence in response to O'Reilly 's childish name - calling , O'Reilly paraded the usual straw man arguments to try and debunk questions about 9/11 .
O'Reilly makes the point that if the evidence for an inside job is so strong then why has n't it been carried on the front pages of newspapers that " hate Bush , " like the New York Times .
This is the same newspaper that unquestionably carried the phony Iraq WMD yellow cake claims that gave Bush the mandate for war and also splashed fake letters attributed to Musab Al - Zarqawi that were intentionally manufactured by the Pentagon for propaganda purposes .
O'Reilly sells the fallacy of the " liberal media , " when that same hierarchy has greased the skids for every key Bush policy or cover - up since his inauguration .
In addition , O'Reilly 's assertion that the media will not report up on the 9/11 truth movement because it lacks any credibility is trashed by the fact that countless mainstream outlets have covered the claims of 9/11 researchers for years and obsesively so in recent months .
" You 're like the guys that think space aliens kidnapped Elvis , " bleats O'Reilly , ever willing to throw out vacuous insults and cuss words yet when the issue of Building 7 is raised O'Reilly has nothing in response bar a wave of the hand .
In a clip from the previous night , O'Reilly is seen to attack a young student and berates another 9/11 Truther , Professor Kevin Barrett , for not having the facts to back up his beliefs - yet does n't even mention what those facts are purported to be .
It seems that O'Reilly should be the one checking his facts as the young student sets him right on several lies concerning the nature of the course Barrett teaches , including the false assertion that students have to buy Barrett 's book to join the course .
O'Reilly now seems hell - bent on getting Barrett and Fetzer suspended or fired using the same intimidation tactics that saw Professor Steven Jones suspended from teaching at BYU - after a World Net Daily hit piece in which it was salaciously and fraudulently alleged that Jones threatened violent overthrow of the U.S. government - a completely made - up piece of libel that the website had to later retract .
O'Reilly 's bully tactics are nothing new .
Back in March he warned that disagreeing callers to his radio show would receive a visit from Fox security .
" Fox security then will contact your local authorities , and you will be held accountable , " barked O'Reilly .
While O'Reilly claims that the dirty words of those who dare to speak the truth , even amidst the Brownshirt society he is trying to create , should be met by a harsh response by the authorities , it was his potty mouth that was hit by a sexual harassment lawsuit two years ago when a female Fox News producer was subjected to his perverted rants about vibrators , threesomes , and masturbation .

From HaskellWiki
This tutorial is designed as a practical guide to writing real world code in Haskell and hopes to intuitively motivate and introduce some of the advanced features of Haskell to the novice programmer .
Our goal is to write a concise , robust and elegant IRC bot in Haskell .
A packaged - up version of the code is available on GitHub .
Getting started
You 'll need a reasonably recent version of GHC .
Our first step is to get on the network .
So let 's start by importing modules from the standard library and the network package , and defining a server to connect to .
-- File 1.hs import System .IO -- base import qualified Network .
Socket as N -- network -- Configuration options myServer = " irc.freenode.org " :: String myPort = 6667 :: N . PortNumber --
Toplevel program main :: IO ( ) main = do h <- connectTo myServer myPort t <- hGetContents h hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering print t --
Connect to a server given its name and port number connectTo :: N . HostName -> N . PortNumber -> IO Handle connectTo host port = do addr : _ <- N . getAddrInfo Nothing ( Just host ) ( Just ( show port ) ) sock <- N . socket ( N . addrFamily addr ) ( N . addrSocketType addr ) ( N . addrProtocol addr ) N . connect sock ( N . addrAddress addr ) N . socketToHandle sock ReadWriteMode
The key here is the main function .
This is the entry point to a Haskell program .
We first connect to the server and get a socket h ( wrapped as a Handle ) .
We can then read and print any data we receive .
We disable buffering ( hSetBuffering ) on standard output , as print renders strings on a single line , with newline characters escaped .
Put this code in the module 1.hs and we can then run it .
Use whichever system you like :
Using runhaskell :
$ runhaskell 1.hs " NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname ...\r
NOTICE AUTH :*** Checking ident\r
NOTICE AUTH :***
Found your hostname\r
...
Or we can just compile it to an executable with GHC :
$ ghc -- make 1.hs -o tutbot Chasing modules from : 1.hs Compiling Main ( 1.hs , 1.o ) Linking ... $ ./tutbot " NOTICE AUTH :***
Looking up your hostname ...\r
NOTICE AUTH :*** Checking ident\r
NOTICE AUTH :***
Found your hostname\r
...
Or using GHCi :
$ ghci 1.hs * Main > main " NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname ...\r
NOTICE AUTH :*** Checking ident\r
NOTICE AUTH :***
Found your hostname\r
...
Great !
We 're on the network .
Talking IRC
Now we 're listening to the server , we better start sending some information back .
Three details are important : the nick , the user name , and a channel to join .
So let 's send those .
-- File 2.hs import System .IO -- base import qualified Network .
Socket as N -- network -- Configuration options myServer = " irc.freenode.org " :: String myPort = 6667 :: N . PortNumber myChan = " #tutbot - testing " :: String myNick = " tutbot " :: String --
Toplevel program main :: IO ( ) main = do h <- connectTo myServer myPort write h " NICK " myNick write h " USER " ( myNick ++ " 0 * : tutorial bot " ) write h " JOIN " myChan listen h -- Connect to a server given its name and port number connectTo :: N . HostName -> N . PortNumber -> IO Handle connectTo host port = do addr : _ <- N . getAddrInfo Nothing ( Just host ) ( Just ( show port ) ) sock <- N . socket ( N . addrFamily addr ) ( N . addrSocketType addr ) ( N . addrProtocol addr ) N . connect sock ( N . addrAddress addr ) N . socketToHandle sock ReadWriteMode --
Send a message to a handle write :: Handle -> String -> String -> IO ( ) write h cmd args = do let msg = cmd ++ " " ++ args ++ " \r
" hPutStr h msg -- Send message on the wire putStr ( " > " ++ msg ) --
Show sent message on the command line -- Process each line from the server listen :: Handle -> IO ( ) listen h = forever $ do line <- hGetLine h putStrLn line where forever :: IO ( ) -> IO ( ) forever a = do a ; forever a
Now , we 've done quite a few things here .
Firstly , we set up a channel name and bot nickname .
The main function has been extended to send messages back to the IRC server using a write function .
Let 's look at that a bit more closely :
-- Send a message to a handle write :: Handle -> String -> String -> IO ( ) write h cmd args = do let msg = cmd ++ " " ++ args ++ " \r
" hPutStr h msg -- Send message on the wire putStr ( " > " ++ msg ) --
Show sent message on the command line
The write function takes 3 arguments ; a handle ( our socket ) , and then two strings representing an IRC protocol action , and any arguments it takes .
write then builds an IRC message by concatenating strings and write it over the wire to the server .
For debugging purposes we also print to standard output the message we send .
Our second function , listen , is as follows :
-- Process each line from the server listen :: Handle -> IO ( ) listen h = forever $ do line <- hGetLine h putStrLn line where forever :: IO ( ) -> IO ( ) forever a = do a ; forever a
This function takes a Handle argument , and sits in an infinite loop reading lines of text from the network and printing them .
We take advantage of two powerful features ; lazy evaluation and higher order functions to roll our own loop control structure , forever , as a normal function !
forever takes a chunk of code as an argument , evaluates it and recurses - an infinite loop function .
It is very common to roll our own control structures in Haskell this way , using higher order functions .
No need to add new syntax to the language , lisp - like macros or meta programming - you just write a normal function to implement whatever control flow you wish .
We can also avoid do - notation , and directly write : forever a = a >> forever a .
Note that forever can also be found in the standard library base , in the module Control .
Monad ( with a more general type ) .
Let 's run this thing :
$ runhaskell 2 . hs > NICK tutbot > USER tutbot 0 * : tutorial bot > JOIN # tutbot - testing NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname ...
NOTICE AUTH :***
Found your hostname , welcome back NOTICE AUTH :*** Checking ident NOTICE AUTH :***
No identd ( auth ) response : orwell .
freenode .
net 001 tutbot : Welcome to the freenode IRC Network tutbot : orwell .
freenode .
net 002 tutbot : Your host is orwell .
freenode .
net ... : tutbot !
n = tutbot @ aa . bb . cc . dd JOIN :# tutbot - testing : orwell .
freenode .
net MODE # tutbot - testing + ns : orwell .
freenode .
net 353 tutbot @ # tutbot - testing :@ tutbot : orwell .
freenode .
net 366 tutbot # tutbot - testing : End of / NAMES list .
And we 're in business !
From an IRC client , we can watch the bot connect :
15:02 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has joined # tutbot - testing 15:02 dons > hello
And the bot logs to standard output :
:dons!i=dons@my.net
PRIVMSG # tutbot - testing : hello
We can now implement some commands .
A simple interpreter
Add these additional imports before changing the listen function .
import Data .
List import System .
Exit
-- Connect to a server given its name and port number listen :: Handle -> IO ( ) listen h = forever $ do line <- hGetLine h putStrLn line let s = init line if isPing s then pong s else eval h ( clean s ) where forever :: IO ( ) -> IO ( ) forever a = do a ; forever a clean :: String ->
String clean = drop 1 .
dropWhile ( /= ':' ) . drop 1 isPing :: String ->
Bool isPing x = " PING :" ` is PrefixOf ` x pong :: String -> IO ( ) pong x = write h " PONG " ( ' :' : drop 6 x )
We add 3 features to the bot here by modifying listen .
Firstly , it responds to PING messages : if ping s then pong s ... .
This is useful for servers that require pings to keep clients connected .
Before we can process a command , remember the IRC protocol generates input lines of the form :
: dons !
i = dons @ my .
net PRIVMSG # tutbot - testing :! id foo
so we need a clean function to simply drop the leading ' :' character , and then everything up to the next ':' , leaving just the actual command content .
We then pass this cleaned up string to eval , which dispatches bot commands .
-- Dispatch a command eval :: Handle -> String -> IO ( ) eval h " ! quit " = write h " QUIT " " : Exiting " >> exitSuccess eval h x | " ! id " ` is PrefixOf ` x = privmsg h ( drop 4 x ) eval _ _ = return ( ) -- ignore everything else
So , if the single string " ! quit " is received , we inform the server and exit the program .
If a string beginning with " ! id " appears , we echo any argument string back to the server ( the command is named after the identity function id , which just returns its argument ) .
Finally , if no other matches occur , we do nothing .
We add the privmsg function - a useful wrapper over write for sending PRIVMSG lines to the server .
-- Send a privmsg to the channel privmsg :: Handle -> String -> IO ( ) privmsg h s = write h " PRIVMSG " ( chan ++ " : " ++ s )
Here 's a transcript from our minimal bot running in channel :
15:12 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has joined # tutbot - testing 15:13 dons > ! id hello , world !
15:13 tutbot > hello , world !
15:13 dons > ! id very pleased to meet you .
15:13 tutbot > very pleased to meet you .
15:13 dons > ! quit 15:13 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has quit [ Client Quit ]
Now , before we go further , let 's refactor the code a bit .
Roll your own monad
A small annoyance so far has been that we 've had to thread around our socket to every function that needs to talk to the network .
The socket is essentially immutable state , that could be treated as a global read only value in other languages .
In Haskell , we can implement such a structure using a reader monad .
Monads are a very powerful abstraction , and we 'll only touch on them here .
The interested reader is referred to All About Monads .
We 'll be using a custom monad specifically to implement a read - only global state for our bot .
The key requirement is that we wish to be able to perform IO actions , as well as thread a small state value transparently through the program .
As this is Haskell , we can take the extra step of partitioning our stateful code from all other program code , using a new type .
So let 's define a small reader monad :
-- The ' Net ' monad , a wrapper over IO , carrying the bot 's immutable state .
data Bot = Bot { botSocket :: Handle } type Net = ReaderT Bot IO
Firstly , we define a data type for the global state .
In this case , it is the Bot type , a simple struct storing our network socket .
We then layer this data type over our existing IO code , with a monad transformer .
This is n't as scary as it sounds and the effect is that we can treat the socket as a global read - only value anywhere we need it .
We 'll call this new IO + state structure the Net monad .
ReaderT is a type constructor , essentially a type function , that takes 2 types as arguments , building a result type : the Net monad type .
We can now throw out all that socket threading and grab the socket when we need it .
The key steps are connecting to the server , followed by the initialisation of our new reader monad and then to run the main bot loop with that global value .
We add a small function , which takes the intial bot state and evaluates the bot 's run loop " in " the Net monad , using the Reader monad 's runReaderT function :
loop st = runReaderT run st
where run is a small function to register the bot 's nick , join a channel , and start listening for commands .
While we 're here , we can tidy up the main function a little by using Control .
Exception .
bracket to explicitly delimit the connection , shutdown and main loop phases of the program - a useful technique .
-- Toplevel program main :: IO ( ) main = bracket connect disconnect loop where disconnect =
hClose .
socket loop st = runReaderT run st
That is , the higher order function bracket takes 3 arguments : a function to connect to the server , a function to disconnect and a main loop to run in between .
We can use bracket whenever we wish to run some code before and after a particular action - like forever , this is another control structure implemented as a normal Haskell function .
Rather than threading the socket around , we can now simply ask for it when needed .
Note that the type of write changes - it is in the Net monad , which tells us that the bot must already by connected to a server ( and thus it is ok to use the socket , as it is initialised ) .
-- Send a message out to the server we 're currently connected to write :: String -> String -> Net ( ) write cmd args = do h <- asks botSocket let msg = cmd ++ " " ++ args ++ " \r
" liftIO $ hPutStr h msg -- Send message on the wire liftIO $ putStr ( " > " ++ msg ) --
Show sent message on the command line
In order to use both state and IO , we use the liftIO function to lift an IO expression into the Net monad making that IO function available to code in the Net monad .
-- Imported from Control .
Monad.IO.
Class liftIO :: IO a ->
Net a
The monadic , stateful , exception - handling bot in all its glory :

Show sent message on the command line -- Process each line from the server listen :: Net ( ) listen = forever $ do h <- asks botSocket line <- liftIO $ hGetLine h liftIO ( putStrLn line ) let s = init line if isPing s then pong s else eval ( clean s ) where forever :: Net ( ) ->

Send a privmsg to the current chan + server privmsg :: String -> Net ( ) privmsg msg = write " PRIVMSG " ( my Chan ++ " : " ++ msg )
Note that we threw in a new control structure , notify , for fun .
Now we 're almost done !
Let 's run this bot .
Using runhaskell :
$ runhaskell 4.hs
or using GHC :
$ ghc -- make 4.hs -o tutbot Chasing modules from : 4.hs Compiling Main ( 4.hs , 4.o ) Linking ... $ ./tutbot
And from an IRC client we can watch it connect :
15:26 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has joined # tutbot - testing 15:28 dons > ! id all good ?
15:28 tutbot > all good ?
15:28 dons > ! quit 15:28 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has quit [ Client Quit ]
So we now have a bot with explicit read - only monadic state , error handling , and some basic IRC operations .
If we wished to add read - write state , we need only change the ReaderT transformer to StateT .
Extending the bot
Let 's implement a basic new command : uptime tracking .
Conceptually , we need to remember the time the bot starts .
Then , if a user requests , we work out the total running time and print it as a string .
A nice way to do this is to extend the bot 's state with a start time field :
import Data .
Time
-- Updated
Bot type data Bot = Bot { botSocket :: Handle , startTime :: UTCTime }
We can then modify the initial connect function to also set the start time .
-- Connect to the server and return the initial bot state connect :: IO
Bot connect = notify $ do t <- getCurrentTime h <- connectTo myServer myPort return ( Bot h t )
We then add a new case to the eval function , to handle uptime requests :
eval " ! uptime " = uptime >>= privmsg eval ...
This will run the uptime function and send it back to the server .
uptime itself is :
--
Get the current uptime uptime :: Net String uptime = do now <- liftIO getCurrentTime zero <- asks startTime return ( pretty ( diffUTCTime now zero ) )
That is , in the Net monad , find the current time and the start time , and then calculate the difference , returning that number as a string .
Rather than use the normal representation for dates , we 'll write our own custom formatter for dates :
-- Pretty print the date in ' 1d 9h 9 m 17s ' format pretty :: NominalDiffTime ->
String pretty diff = unwords . map ( \ ( t , unit ) -> show t ++ unit ) $ if null diffs then [ ( 0 , " s " ) ] else diffs where diffs :: [( Integer , String ) ] diffs = filter (( /= 0 ) . fst ) $ decompose [ ( 86400 , " d " ) , ( 3600 , " h " ) , ( 60 , " m " ) , ( 1 , " s " ) ] ( floor diff ) decompose [ ] _ = [ ] decompose ( ( secs , unit ) : metrics ) t = let ( n , t' ) = t ` divMod ` secs in ( n , unit ) : decompose metrics t'
And that 's it .
Running the bot with this new command :
16:03 -- tutbot [ n=tutbot@aa.bb.cc.dd ] has joined # tutbot - testing 16:03 dons > !uptime 16:03 tutbot > 51s 16:03 dons > ! uptime 16:03 tutbot >
1 m 1s 16:12 dons > !uptime 16:12 tutbot > 9 m 46s
Where to now ?
This is just a flavour of application programming in Haskell , and only hints at the power of Haskell 's lazy evaluation , static typing , monadic effects and higher order functions .
There is much , much more to be said on these topics .
Some places to start :
Or take the bot home and hack !
Some suggestions :
Use forkIO to add a command line interface , and you 've got yourself an irc client with 4 more lines of code .

I ’ve started a new blog — this one is officially retired !
After about 15 years , I ’m retiring Collision Detection .
( I ’ve posted so infrequently in the last three years that it ’s been essentially retired anyway , heh . )
But hey !
I ’ve started a new site over at my namesake URL , www.clivethompson.net.
I ’ll be posting occasional essays and building an archive of all my journalism over there .
Go over and check it out !
Because there ’s so much fun stuff I ’ve done on Collision Detection , though , I ’m not taking this site down .
I ’ll leave it here until the server crashes or the sun burns out , whichever comes first .
A game created “ as if games were the only medium on Earth ”
I recently picked up 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die .
I could n’t resist the title , which so neatly refracts the gibbering cultural anxieties of lists like “ 1000 novels everyone must read ” .
You see this sort of highbrow listicle often in the realms of literary fiction , movies , possibly poetry .
It ’s classic canon panic , and I say that with a degree of charity and warmth ; I actually think arguing heatedly and even snobbishly about what works of art are important and mindbending can be a lot of fun , and occasionally useful to the parties involved .
But there ’s something hilarious and unsettling about claiming there are 1,001 video games we must play .
On the obvious level , it ’s a cheeky way of mocking the way literary fiction — or perhaps movies — are the only arts that self - aggrandizingly proclaim themselves highbrow enough to be considered absolutely compulsory for all non-knuckle - dragging hominids .
On a subtler level , it throws a challenge even to gamers themselves .
It suggests that no matter how many titles they ’ve played and enjoyed ( or hated ) , there is a much , much larger sea out there .
Indeed , the idea that there is a subset of games that are mandatory , and that this number is as large as 1,001 , points to the fact that the pool of nonmandatory games ( the bad ones , the forgettable ones , the aesthetically and game - mechanically uninspired ones ) is probably several orders of magnitude bigger — tens of thousands , maybe hundreds of thousands of games .
Maybe more ?
I mean , how many video games have been made , anyway ?
I ’ve never seen a good estimate of this .
When you throw in disposable app - store games — the phyloplankton of the game world , some so forgettable you ’d swear they ’d just been procedurally generated ( and come to think of that , that would make a crazy project !
A robotic game studio that craps out algorithmically - generated games , much like the programmers who bulk - spray thousands of algorithmically - generated books onto Amazon ) — the number becomes Carl - Sagan huge .
Could anyone actually play 1,001 games ?
Let ’s do the math !
Since modern games promise , in general , “ 40 hours of play ” , we ’re talking about 40,000 hours of play .
Actually , let ’s shrink that down to 30,000 hours , because many early arcade games discussed in this book could be “ played through ” in a few minutes or an hour or so .
But even at 30,000 hours , that ’s 14 solid years of playing , if you took it on as a full - time job , played for 40 hours a week , and tried to get to the end of every game .
The upshot is , the whole sly point of a book like 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die is that you ’re really never going to be able to play them all .
The fun is in reading about them — in touring through the encyclopedic entries .
In this regard , I gotta say , the book does not disappoint .
The writeups are all barely a villanelle ’s - worth in length — a single short page , or even half a page — yet the writers ( about two dozen game journalists ) manage to fit in a number of really delightful observations .
Which brings me to the whole reason I ’m writing this post !
In the writeup for Half - Life 2 , Duncan Harris makes a fascinating argument about the title .
I ’ll quote nearly the whole writeup :
Released in 2004 after five years in development , it continues the story of an alpha geek , scientist Gordon Freeman , as he deals with the aftermath of an experiment gone wrong .
Placed back on Earth by the mysterious G - Man , he finds himself entering City 17 , the cold and forbidding capital of the world now enslaved by aliens .
The Combine , who snuck into our dimension , thanks to the events of Half - Life , have broken humanity ’s spirit and turned it cities into ghettos .
Citizens wear rags and huddle next to tenement windows , waiting for the Civil Protection squads to abduct them to who - knows - where .
There are no children .
Had the game been so vulgar as to mimic any movies , there ’d have been a Hollywood version years ago .
But the secret of it success is that , while full of historical parallels , it tells its story as if games were the only medium on Earth .
There are no cut scenes , no paragraphs of exposition to read , and the closest you ’ll get to pop-culture references are Orwell and H.G. Wells .
In their place , Valve ’s artists , technicians , storytellers , and sound engineers create a unique milieu : a distinctly Soviet metropolis being literally consumed by alien architecture .
It tells its story as if games were the only medium on Earth .
That is a really great observation , even if it ’s not true , and I ’m not sure it is .
( Among other things , the story , characters and dialogue are pretty straightforwardly modeled on the tropes of action flicks . )
But the gist of the point — that what makes a game interesting is its desire to be gamelike , to take its reference points from other games , to regard gameness as central — is nicely put .
This is one of the reasons I ’ve always dug third - person video games .
Their camera aesthetics are totally weird and utterly game - like .
When you play , you ’re almost always constantly staring at the back of your character , as you guide it around the world , as per last year ’s Tomb Raider , an early pioneer in the third - person perspective back in the 90s :
This is a camera technique born of pure functionality :
As a player , you need to be seeing the world in front of your character , so the camera - view must always be floating just behind the character , as if you were a spirit anxiously accompanying your creation .
And of course when your character is in tight quarters , like a hallway , the “ floating behind ” camera view gets all screwed up , with the camera often getting stuck behind objects or appearing to float inside walls .
The thing is , the third - person game camera - angle is truly and totally foreign to Hollywood .
I ca n’t imagine any director saying “ guys , guys !
I ’ve got a great idea !
Let ’s shoot our entire movie from about five feet behind behind the protagonist , carefully tracking behind her , so that we almost never see her face ! ”
That third - person angle is a piece of artistry that is utterly gamelike — a bit of aesthetics crafted as if games were , indeed , the only medium on Earth .
Why 18th century books looked like smartphone screens
That ’s one of the opening pages of Conjectures on Original Composition , a book about creative genius published by the English poet Edward Young in 1759 .
It ’s considered one of the first big essays to tout the idea that “ originals ” — writers of deep originality — are more important and awesome than derivative folks .
I heard about Conjectures while reading a different essay this evening , and since I ’m sort of obsessed with tracking the rise of our modern ( and disastrous ) conceit that originality is something that just kind of wells up from inside you I immediately dialed up Conjectures on Google Books to read it .
It ’s a delightful essay , but what struck me immediately was its design :
Those tiny pages , crammed full of large - fonted prose .
It looks just like a book displayed on a smartphone screen .
That small - page format was quite common back in the 18th century .
It ’s known as octavo duodecimo — with pages that are about 6 inches by 9 inches .
The entire Conjectures is only about 8,000 words long , but it was common to print essays in this pretty little style , because it had great ergonomics :
It made for easy one - handed reading and portability .
Pretty much the same advantages as reading on a smartphone , when you think about it .
When it comes to books , I read about half my stuff these days in print , and half in e-format ; and while I own a Kindle , I do n’t use it very much any more — I just read ebooks on my Android phone .
Indeed , reading on my phone has led me to read more books than ever , because the octavo - esque portability means the books are ever with me : I dip in and out while riding the subway , waiting in line at a store , lying in bed falling asleep , or lying in bed awake with “ early waking insomnia ” , yay .
The portability has made it possible for me to read books sufficiently huge that , had I ’d been forced to carry ‘em around , I ’d probably have ditched out and never finished them — things like War and Peace , Middlemarch , and Moby Dick , all of which I read entirely on my smartphone .
In fact , one of the oddly useful things about reading War and Peace on your phone is that the octavo - like format makes the epic enormity of the tome less intimidating :
It ’s just one little page after another , each one oddly inviting .
I tend to blow up the font on my phone to quite large , so each page has only a few hundred words on it , precisely the way that Conjectures is laid out .
Here ’s a page of Conjectures …
And here ’s a page of a book I ’m currently reading on my smartphone ( sorry for the crappy resolution of the font , which looks weird when I size it comparably ) :
The point being , of course , that the ergonomics of smartphones as reading devices are not only kind of rad , but historically so .
These small formats from days of yore also help explain the stupendous productivity of many historic authors .
I ’ll often be reading about a nonfiction essayist from the 17th or 18th or 19th century and the bio will mention he or she wrote 56 books or some other ungodly number , and I ’ll freak out : Man alive !
How can anyone generate so much ?
But then you realize that a “ book ” back then was n’t what we think of as a “ book ” now .
Back then , there were a plurality of book - sized formats that were , like octavo or the slightly - smaller duodecimo , pretty compact , so these “ books ” were only a couple of thousand words long .
( Like the totally fun The Art of Memory by Marius D’assigny , from 1706 . )
Authors who cranked out 40 “ books ” were actually writing pieces that are closer to a long magazine article .
It was n’t until the 20th century arrived that nonfiction books started to congeal into the 300 - page quantum , for a host of economic and cultural and industrial reasons .
To wit :
If you ’re going to charge someone $ 25 for a hardcover nonfiction book and do it via industrial publishing , you have to make the customers feel they ’re getting $ 25 worth , which means the book has to be loooooong … even if the author does not possess an argument requiring 300 pages .
( Thus we find so many books that are really just magazine articles gasified to fill the container . )
The emergence of digital formats for books is changing these industrial economics , with some pretty cool aesthetic and intellectual effects .
If you do n’t need to charge $ 25 for a book , you do n’t need it to necessarily balloon to 300 pages , so you can begin to publish books that look more like … Conjectures or The Art of Memory .
The book fits the length of the utterance , instead of expanding to fill a vessel the dimensions of which were determined by haptic marketing : “ Yeah , this book feels weighty .
I ’m in ! ”
Part of what made me think about these cool , short , old book formats is that the recent discussion / debate about “ long form ” writing .
I ’m thinking particularly of Ben Smith ’s terrific meditation on how they ’re integrating longer pieces into Buzzfeed .
As he notes , when you do n’t have an artificial constraint , form fits function : “ This is more like book - writing , less like the compromises of magazines and newspapers … ”
The only thing I want now is for someone to sample those amazing fonts they used for Conjectures and The Art of Memory , and instal them on my phone .
Holy moses , the fonts that come with the Kindle app on Android are flavorless .
Look at the gorgeous fontistry of those old books !
Just look at it !
UPDATE : In this post I originally misidentified the size of the book as duodecimo size , 5 inches by 7 3/8 inches ; then John Overholt , a curator of early modern books at Harvard , pulled a copy of Conjectures out of his stacks to verify the dimensions : Check out John ’s excellent comment below , which I ’ve excerpted .
Thanks John !
The Essay is actually a small octavo , the next size up from duodecimo , which I have the sense would have been a little beneath the dignity of such a piece .
I did see that there was also a pirated Dublin edition in 12mo in just 60 pages , which would have been set in a much smaller type , to keep the book considerably cheaper than the 1 £ 6s of the London original .
Bonus : John snapped this shot of himself holding the book :
A video game for an audience of one
( This year , I ’m participating in The Pastry Box Project , a very cool joint blog ; I ’ll be doing six posts this year .
My first went up this week , and here ’s a copy of it ! )
Two years ago I was trying to think of something to get for my wife for her birthday , and I was stuck .
So I decided to go the “ heartfelt ” route and make her something by hand :
The personal touch !
But what would I make ?
Well , I ’m a big nerd from way back , and she ’s also something of a nerd too .
So I decided that I ’d make her something peculiarly digital : A personalized video game .
I downloaded a copy of Inform 7 , a free and easy - to - use app that lets anyone create “ text adventure ” games , where the player navigates a world of text by typing commands and reading descriptions of the rooms they enter ( “ Go west ” ; “ open mailbox ” ) .
My wife and I are both in our 40s , so we ’re old enough to remember the first - ever text - adventure games like “ Zork ” .
I still enjoy the stark poetry of “ Zork ” ’s opening scene :
West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house , with a boarded front door .
There is a small mailbox here .
That scene always reminds me of the first few lines of Dante ’s “ Inferno ” :
Midway along the journey of our life
I woke to find myself in a dark wood ,
for I had wandered off from the straight path .
I ’m probably picking up these resonances because I ’m middle - aged , so my grade - 6 days playing “ Zork ” seem awfully far away now , while the cosmic midlife freakouts of the “ Inferno ” are a lot more proximal .
But at any rate , I liked the idea of creating a little playable literary world to give to my wife , a sort of geeky love letter .
I began plotting out a text adventure that was based in our years together , with a few dozens rooms and filled with detail and easter eggs ( hidden stuff you have to discover inside a game ) drawn from our shared experiences .
It was fun and not terribly hard to do ; I ’d never created a text adventure before , but Inform 7 is reasonably straightforward .
After several evenings of work , I had the game done , and on her birthday I loaded it onto her computer and explained what I ’d done .
I was half worried she ’d think I was nuts , but to my great delight she loved it .
Here ’s how the game opened up :
Bedroom
You wake up in your bed at home .
The sun is coming in the windows , and you feel deeply rested .
What time is it ?
You roll over and grab your iphone , and holy moses — it ’s 9:30 am on a Saturday !
You hear a beep and look over at your sidetable , where you see an ipad .
Now , here ’s the thing :
That ’s all you get to see .
I ’m not going to show you any more .
And that ’s because a game like this does n’t quite behave the way games normally do .
Normally , games are a form of mass entertainment .
They ’re a one - to - many medium .
A single entity — sometimes a big corporation , sometimes an indie creator working alone — creates what is ( hopefully ) a fiendishly fun system , and gamers try to master it , playing and replaying it again , slowly getting better and better , as with Call of Duty or Candy Crush .
With games like this , the designers want as many people as possible to play their titles , of course .
The more people they get hooked , the more money they make .
In recent years we ’ve seen the rise of something different : Artistic games , where the designers are aiming to create an expressive act .
They ’re trying to evoke an emotion or a mood , or to make a point .
( A superb example of this sort of art game is Jason Rohrer ’s “ Passage ” . )
These games are n’t designed to get you addicted , seducing you into playing them over and over again .
If you run through “ Passage ” two or three times , you ’ll understand the message and experience Rohrer is trying to communicate , and you probably wo n’t need to play it any more .
Artistic games turn the genre into something that ’s more obviously a speech act — games and their rulesets as a way of talking about the world .
( The scholar and game designer Ian Bogost calls this “ procedural rhetoric ” . )
Nonetheless , these art games share one thing in common with Call of Duty or Candy Crush :
They ’re still a one - to - many medium .
The game designer creates the experience , hoping that many people will play it , much as a poet writes a poem hoping that many people will read it .
The game is made for an audience of many .
The game I made for my wife is something rather different .
It was a game made for an audience of one .
The reason I ’m not showing you the whole game is for the same reasons we do n’t show our love letters to the public .
They ’re private communications , composed with a single person in mind .
Indeed , even if I did put my game online for everyone to play , it would n’t make any sense .
None of the objects inside the rooms have any meaning to anyone but my wife and I .
They ’re a rumination on our shared experiences , so if you did n’t experience them , they wo n’t make much sense .
My wife enjoyed the game ( thank god ) and found it meaningful ; you ’d find it boring gibberish .
All of which makes me realize that the evolution of games as a medium might be entering a very cool and strange phase .
Every year there are more tools for authoring games , ranging from things like Inform 7 to Scratch or Stencyl .
They ’re still kludgy , but getting simpler all the time .
They remind me of early - stage word - processors in the 70s or 80s .
Those tools deindustrialized typography , making it possible for an individual to dash off a document that had a level of formatting previously only available to those who owned a printed press .
As games become easier and quicker to make , they enter similarly new expressive territory .
A tool like Inform 7 deindustrializes the making of games .
And when a medium is deindustrialized , it always get wilder and weirder .
Once millions of people can mess around with it , they inevitably do things that are far more diverse and crazy and unexpected than when the medium was in the hands of only a few huge corporations .
We can now start thinking about dashing off a game as a way to joke with a close friend , to invite someone to a party , or maybe to apologize to someone you ’ve treated poorly .
Games become something you can create for an audience of one .
If you made a game for one person , what would it be like ?
Of Star Wars “ crawl ” poetry and the weirdness of our attention spans
Yesterday I saw a picture on Boing Boing : A “ behind the scenes ” shot of how they made the iconic opening “ crawl ” text for The Empire Strikes Back .
I ’d always assumed , naively , that the crawl was done with computer graphics , but no :
It was a steampunk affair , with the text printed on a piece of glass and filmed at a steep angle by a camera .
But what really struck me was the quote from George Lucas about the formal properties of a crawl :
“ The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you ’re not using too many words that people do n’t understand , ” Lucas has said .
“ It ’s like a poem . ”
Poetry !
Full on !
This immediately made me think of an idea , which I tweeted :
I want to create an online literary journal where the poetry is displayed exclusively in the " text crawl " style of the Star Wars openers .
— Clive Thompson ( @pomeranian99 ) January 22 , 2014
Heh .
One of the things I love about poetry is that because it a ) is often a pretty short form , b ) is more structurally varied than prose and c ) has basically no economic value , it ’s more amenable to screwing around with in nutty new - media settings .
Anyway , only minutes after I tweeted this , my friend Max Whitney set about hunting down a Star Wars “ crawl ” generator — which of course exists — and creating a version of the famous William Carlos Williams poem “ This Is Just To Say ” , which you can see here .
Thank you , multiples !
( That was A PLUG FOR MY BOOK : You can read the section on multiples here . )
The gauntlet thus thrown down , I immediately set about trying to find a poem to crawlify myself .
I thought of Emily Dickinson , and after a bit of hunting ran across “ I took my power in my hand ” , the crawl - version of which you can see above .
I ’d hoped to find something resonant with Star Wars mythology , and man o man , Dickinson kind of knocks it outta the park here :
That poem reads like a spec sheet for Darth Vader ’s psychology .
Frankly , you could reskin the entire original Star Wars trilogy by taking out all of Vader ’s existing dialogue and substituting Dickinson poetry .
I would not be surprised if someone is actually doing that .
So the ball is now rolling :
This morning , @ WaxEBuildup did a version of Lewis Carroll ’s “ Jabberwocky ” .
And by Amy Burvall , here ’s a version of Pablo Neruda ’s love sonnet XVII !
What I particularly dig about crawl poetry is how it riffs of the pace of reading .
Reading is a weird act of attention .
The way we look at text is constantly revving up and down the mental gearbox :
We skim rapidly , then suddenly stop and stare to reread and reread , we peek at the end of a piece of text to see how much farther we have to go , we briefly zone out , our eyes saccade along in little bursts .
In contrast , there ’s some hilariously submissive and unnatural about subjecting ourselves to a poem being read out at a steady pace by a machine .
It foregrounds just how slithy our actual attention really is — and the fact that while it ’s obviously bad for our cognition to be constantly distracted by shiny objects online , the converse is n’t true either : Attentive , absorbed reading is n’t really crawl - like .
Truly absorbed reading is a strange , strange process .
Selfies and Borges
I was in my local branch of the Brooklyn Public Library yesterday when I found this :
The Book of Imaginary Beings , by Jorge Luis Borges .
It ’s a cryptozoological encyclopedia of animals described in myth and literature , which Borges details with typically awesome digressive riffs .
There ’s the “ Squonk ” , which apparently is native to Pennsylvania , is perpetually sad over its wart - encrusted appearance , and thus can be hunted by following “ its tear - stained trail ” .
There ’s “ The Hairy Beast of La Ferté - Bernard , ” which somehow survived the Biblical flood despite not having been on the Ark ; “ Its preferred victims were innocents — maidens and children . ”
There are the “ Brownies , ” helpful little creatures that Robert Louis Stevenson claimed had whispered the plot for The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde into his ears while he slept .
Or there ’s the “ Basilisk ” , whose Medusa - like gaze is fatal , which — as Borges notes — helps explain its desolated environment : “ The Basilisk lives in the desert , then ; or rather , it created the desert .
Birds fall dead at its feet , and fruits rot ; the water in the rivers from which its lakes its thirst is poison for hundreds of years .
That its glance breaks stones and singes grass has been attested by Pliny . ”
Still , my all - time entry in this collection is the one for “ Animals That Live in the Mirror ” .
Given the endless debates over the supposedly narcissistic payload of the selfie , this monster seems awfully contemporary .
Borges begins by detailing the myth of the “ Fish ” , a creature that lives inside mirrors , and then delves into the work of Herbert Allan Giles ’ — a specialist in Chinese history — who tracks the myth back to “ the legendary age of the Yellow Emperor ” .
As the myth goes :
In those days , the world of mirrors in the world of men were not , as they are now , separate and unconnected .
They were , moreover , quite different from one another ; neither the creature nor the colors and shapes of the two worlds were the same .
The two kingdoms — the specular and the human — lived in peace , and one could pass back and forth through mirrors .
One night , however , the people of the mirror invaded this world .
Their strength was great , but after many bloody battles , the magic of the Yellow Emperor prevailed .
The Emperor pushed back the invaders , imprisoning them within the mirrors , and punished them by making them repeat , as though in a kind of dream , all the actions of their human victors .
He stripped them of their strength and their own shape and reduced them to mere servile reflections .
One day , however , they will throw off that magical lethargy .
The first to awaken shall be the Fish .
In the depths of the mirror , we shall perceive a faint , faint line , and the color of the line will not resemble any other .
Then , other forms will begin to awaken .
Gradually they will become different from us ; gradually they will no longer imitate us ; they will break through the barriers of glass or metal , and this time they will not be conquered .
Water - creatures will battle alongside mirror - creatures .
In Yunnan province , people speak not of the Fish but rather the Tiger of the Mirror .
Others believe that before the invasion , we will hear , from the depths of the mirrors , the sound of arms .
This is such a great sci - fi concept :
That our reflections are imprisoned slaves , desperate for freedom — and that perhaps this is true too of our smartphones , filled with smiling ducklipped images of ourselves that long to escape and fight us to the death .

jcham979 and the video literacy of Breaking Bad
SPOILER ALERT :
If you ’re one of those people who are just starting to watch Breaking Bad now , do n’t read this entry , and do n’t watch the video embedded below !
You ’ll hate me .
Though at this point in time , if you ’re just starting in on the show , avoiding spoilers is sort of like trying to avoid learning who won the 2008 presidential election .
Anyway .
Like millions of others I am freaking out over the end of Breaking Bad tonight .
But I ’m a belated fan ; I only got into it very late in the game .
And the weird thing is , what piqued my interest was n’t the show itself , but an absolutely fascinating Youtube clip :
The jcham979 video “ Breaking Bad Finale Theory — A Case For Walt Poisoning Brock ” .
This was a video that appeared in the fourth season , when everyone was arguing about who and what , precisely , was making Brock sick .
In his / her / its video ( the identity of jcham979 has never been made public , near as I can tell ) , Jcham979 assembled a six - minute - long video argument arguing that Walt had poisoned the boy .
It ’s worth rewatching again , now , because not only was jcham979 obviously correct , but the method was such a great example of modern talmudic video - parsing via Tivo and Youtube .
At a pivotal moment at the 3:30 point , jcham979 seals the argument that “ Walt did it ” by throwing down a spectacular frame - by - frame analysis of Jesse being patted down .
The whole video below is worth watching , but check out that 3:30 moment specifically :
The extra -meta - fun part of this video is that it neartly presages Jesse ’s own epiphany earlier this season , when , while looking for his cigarettes , he has a Proustian flashback to precisely this moment — with the same “ aha ” .
I so heavily dug jcham979 ’s video that I put it in my book ( which you can buy !
right now ! here ! ) , in a chapter where I discuss how people are developing new literacies in media like video , photography , and even data .
We ’re in the very early stages of video becoming a plastic as text became under the word processor ; as I wrote :
Until recently , of course , it was n’t possible to do this with the moving image .
In the decades leading up to the twenty - first century , it was difficult to impossible to parse in such detail anything that appeared in movies or on TV .
You could n’t easily rewatch it .
And you certainly could n’t cut and paste together your own video as a method of argument .

“ Sounder and Relay ” : An art installation based on “ Wired Love ”
After posting about Wired Love last night — the novel about two telegraph officers who strike up a remote relationship — I got an email from the artist Silvia Ruzanka .
It turns out she ’s create a couple of pieces based on the novel !
The one above is an installation called “ Sounder and Relay ” , which Silvia describes thusly :
Sounder and Relay is a meditation on online romance in the age of the telegraph .
Two video projections show computer - generated figures in Victorian interiors .
As the two tap messages on their telegraphs , the signals are transmitted across the room through physical antique telegraph equipment .
The text is composed of dialogue excerpts from the novel Wired Love : A Romance in Dots and Dashes .
I wish I knew Morse code so I could figure out what passages of the book they ’re transmitting in this piece !
To be fair , he wrote it in 1949
I saw this in a used - book sale in the Upper West Side of Manhattan .
“ Wired Love ” : A tale of catfishing , OK Cupid , and sexting … from 1880
In the Victorian era , telegraph operators were the first people to live with virtual reality .
Here ’s how the 1880 novel Wired Love : A Romance of Dots and Dashes — the story of Nattie Rogers , a young telegraph operator — begins :
Miss Nattie Rogers , telegraph operator , lived , as it were , in two worlds .
The one her office , dingy and curtailed as to proportions , but from whence she could wander away through the medium of that slender telegraph wire , on a sort of electric wings , to distant cities and towns ; where , although alone all day , she did not lack social intercourse , and where she could amuse herself if she chose , by listening to and speculating upon the many messages of joy or of sorrow , of business and of pleasure , constantly going over the wire .
But the other world in which Miss Rogers lived was very different ; the world bounded by the four walls of a back room at Miss Betsey Kling ’s .
It must be confessed that there are more pleasing views than sheds in greater or less degrees of dilapidation , a sickly grape - vine , a line of flapping sheets , an overflowing ash barrel ; sweeter sounds than the dulcet notes of old rag-men , the serenades of musical cats , or the strains of a cornet played upon at intervals from nine P. M. to twelve , with the evident purpose of exhausting superfluous air in the performer ’s lungs .
The sky above the port was the color of television , tuned to a dead channel .
People , you have no idea how much fun this book is .
And it ’s free to read !
Right here !
I do n’t want to give too much of the plot away — I save my spoilers for below the jump .
But the story , in brief , is that Nattie is at work one day when a telegraph operator in another city , who calls himself “ C ” , begins chatting her up .
They engage in a virtual courtship , things get funny and romantic , until suddenly things take a most puzzling and mysterious turn .
It ’s all quite nuttily modern .
Wired Love anticipates everything we live with in today ’s online , Iphoned courtship : Assessing whether someone you ’ve met online is what they say they are ; the misunderstandings of tone and substance that come from communicating in rapid - fire , conversational bursts of text ; or even the fact that you might not really be sure of the gender / nationality / species of the person you ’re flirting with .
As it turns out , Nattie quickly figures out that “ C ” is , indeed , a man .
But the conversations she and her friends have about her online courtship are utterly wild to read :
They have the arch elocutions of Victorian - era America , mixed with concepts that are so thoroughly modern that book feels like it was written this year , by someone merely emulating the language of 1880 .
Dig this passage , which begins with Nattie talking :
“ You remember my speaking about ‘ C ’ and wondering whether a gentleman or lady ? ” “ Oh , yes ! ” Quimby remembered , and fidgeted on his chair .
“ He proved to be a gentleman . ” “ Oh , yes ; exactly , you know ! ” responded Quimby , looking anything but elated .
“ It must be very romantic and fascinating to talk with some one so far away , a mysterious stranger too , that one has never seen , ” Miss Archer said , her black eyes sparkling .
“ I should get up a nice little sentimental affair immediately , I know I should , there is something so nice about anything with a mystery to it . ”
“ Yes , telegraphy has its romantic side — it would be dreadfully dull if it did not , ” Nattie answered .
“ But — now really , ” said Quimby , who sat on the extreme edge of the chair , with his feet some two yards apart from each other ; “ really , you know , now suppose — just suppose , your mysterious invisible should n’t be — just what you think , you know .
You see , I remember one or two young men in telegraph offices , whose collars and cuffs are always soiled , you know ! ”
“ I have great faith in my ‘ C , ’ ” laughed Nattie .
“ It would be dreadfully unromantic to fall in love with a soiled invisible , would n’t it , ” said Miss Archer , with an expressive shrug of her shoulders .
A “ soiled invisible ” ?
I want to see an entry for that in the Urban Dictionary by tomorrow .
I ’m not going to spoil the book any more , because frankly you all should go and read it right now .
It ’s short , a blast , and you can rip through it in an evening .
( Copies in various formats are all free here via Project Gutenberg ; you can see a typeset copy via Google Books .
I was reminded of Wired Love just now because I read a smart article pointing out how Google Books has rekindled an interest in 19th century literature , because it ’s all out of copyright , scanned , and suddenly super - accessible .
I ’ve read a ton of 19th century lit in the last few years for precisely that reason . )
Okay , now for some spoilers .
A few of the absolutely surreal moments in this book include …

How to spot a faked negative review :
They ’re vague , long , and use lots of exclamation points !!!
By now , it ’s pretty obvious that there is lots of fakery in online reviews .
Most of the time , I assume the faking skews positive : i.e. a manufacturer
Turks a bunch of people to write glowing assessments of their widget on Amazon ; an author goes all sprezzatura and pens delirious self - praise via a network of sock puppets .
But it turns out there are also faked bad reviews — people who trashtalk a product even though they have n’t actually used it or bought it themselves .
Better yet — it ’s possible to recognize faked bad reviews .
According to a fascinating study recently released , faked bad reviews carry several linguistic markers of their fakeitude :
They ’re vaguely worded , longer than other reviews , and have lots of exclamation points !!!!
If you ’re in a hurry and wanna read the bullet - pointed takeaways , skip down to the middle of this entry .
But for those of you awesome people who love to read about clever data - collection protocols , here ’s some background on the study .
It opens with an interesting question : How do you analyze faked bad reviews ?
Well , for starters , you have to collect a bunch of them .
In other words , you have to gather up a bunch of negative reviews written by people who you know did n’t buy the product .
Eric Anderson of Northwestern University and Duncan Simester of MIT hit upon an elegant way to accomplish this .
They got the co-operation of an online brand ( unnamed ) that sells its products direct to customers — via stores and online — and , what ’s more , only sells them direct ; it does n’t sell via any other channels , like big chains .
With this brand , either you buy from them directly or you do n’t buy it at all .
Now , this brand also carefully tracks its online customers .
You need to register to purchase something from the web site , so the brand knows precisely what every online customer has and has n’t bought .
Crucially , the brand also links its customers ’ in - store purchases to their online purchasing identities , so the company knows what each customer has bought both in meatspace and on the intertubes .
What ’s more , to review something on the site you have to be signed in — there are no anonymous reviews .
The brand knows precisely who wrote what .
With this info , the researchers could isolate the “ faked ” bad reviews on the site — i.e. the situations in which a customer reviewed a product that they manifestly had bought neither online nor ( with reasonable certainty ) offline .
Anderson and Simester found 15,759 such reviews .
Interestingly , these reviews were not written by drive - by cranks who signed up for the site just to post trash talk .
No , the fake bad reviews were written by avid customers — people who had , in the past , bought plenty of items from the brand .
But in this case they ’d for some reason reviewed an item without having bought it .
When the researchers analyzed the language traits of these faked negative reviews , several trends things emerged .
The differences between faked and non-faked bad reviews are n’t huge , but they ’re consistent .
Here ’s my redaction of the big ones the researchers found :
They ’re long .
“ Perhaps the strongest cue associated with deception is the number of words : deceptive messages tend to be longer ” — about 36 % , on average .
Fake ones were on average 70.13 words long ; authentic negative reviews were only 52 words .
Why is this ?
Because , as psychologists have long documented , it ’s harder to craft a lie than to tell the truth .

Because , as psychologists have long documented , it ’s harder to craft a lie than to tell the truth .
They ’re vague .
Since the reviewers here are assessing goods they have n’t actually touched or felt , “ these reviews are significantly less likely to include descriptions of the fit or feel of the garments , which can generally only be evaluated through physical inspection . ”
Since the reviewers here are assessing goods they have n’t actually touched or felt , “ these reviews are significantly less likely to include descriptions of the fit or feel of the garments , which can generally only be evaluated through physical inspection . ”
They contain irrelevant details .
Fake reviewers were more likely to fill up their prose with seemingly off - point discussions of stuff not germane to the product — such as mentions of their family .
“ They are also more likely to contain details unrelated to the product ( ‘ I also remember when everything was made in America ’ ) and these details often mention the reviewer ’s family ( ‘ My dad used to take me when we were young to the original store down the hill ’ ) . ”

And my personal favorite mark of inauthenticity : “ multiple exclamation points . ”
Now , there are plenty of caveats with this study .
It ’s possible that some of the reviews were n’t actually fake .
Maybe the reviewer got ahold of the product in some fashion outside the detectable stream of purchases , such as in a gift or Ebay ; or maybe the brand ’s system of tying the physical - store purchases to online purchases is n’t complete enough .
The researchers claim they ’ve ruled these out as best as possible , and while they were clearly quite careful , there ’s always room for error .
It ’s not published and peer - reviewed work .
Nonetheless , if you grant the force of this analysis , it leads to a fun question
Why do customers write fake negative reviews ?
Again , these are n’t just a bunch of randos who hate the brand and are just doing it for the lulz .
On the contrary , they ’re loyal customers : Anderson and Simester found that writers of fake negative reviews continue to buy lots of products from the brand — indeed , slightly moreso than people who do n’t write fake negative reviews .
The researchers offer a different hypothesis :
The explanation that is most consistent with the data is that these are loyal customers acting as self - appointed brand managers .
The review process provides a convenient mechanism for them to give feedback to the firm …
They are loyal to the brand and want an avenue to provide feedback to the company about how to improve its products .
They will even do so on products they have not purchased .
Evidence of this ?
Fake reviews are three times more likely than non -fake reviews to use language that indicates they ’re talking to the company directly .
In a “ real ” review , the author writes phrases like “ if you are looking , ” “ if you need , ” or “ if you want ” .
In other words , they ’re addressing other customers .
But the faked reviews used phrases like “ bring back , ” “ offer more , ” or “ carry more ” .
They were writing for an audience of the company — using the negative review to hector / lecture the brand directly .
It ’s pretty fascinating stuff .
It ’s going to get me to look twice at negative reviews now .

Viewing massive accidents using Google Maps
Remember the wreck of the Costa Concordia ?
The captain ran the ship aground off the Italian island of Giglio , and then was accused of abandoning the vessel before ensuring his passengers got off safely .
( They did n’t ; tragically , 32 died . )
I was recently reading a story in the New York Times about the captain ’s court trial and saw photos of the ship , which is still sitting there , lying on its side in the shallow waters off Giglio .
I remember , back when the catastrophe first occurred , being struck by how uncanny — how almost CGI - like — the pictures of the ship appeared .
It looks so wrong , lying there sideways in the shallow waters , that I had a sort of odd , disassociative moment that occurs to me with uncomfortable regularity these days :
The picture looks like something I ’ve seen in a some dystopic video game , a sort of bleak matte - painting backdrop of the world gone wrong .
( In the typically bifurcated moral nature of media , you could regard this either as a condemnation of video games — i.e. they ’ve trained me to view real - life tragedy as unreal — or an example of their imaginative force :
They ’re a place you regularly encounter depictions of the terrible . )
At any rate , I think what triggers this is the sheer immensity of the ship ; it ’s totally out of scale , as in that photo above , taken by Luca Di Ciaccio .
But the huge size of the ship made me wonder something else .
Is the accident this enormous visible on Google Maps ?
Sure enough , it is .
Here ’s the ship as seen in satellite view :
Click here and it ’ll take you directly to the precise location on Google Maps .
Zoom in and out and check it out .
It ’s an even more uncanny feeling .
One is accustomed to seeing manmade objects via the satellite view in Google Maps ; heck , I ’ve seen my own house .
But one is n’t as accustomed to seeing things that are manmade but are n’t supposed to be there — or at least not in such a wounded , collapsed condition .
When I first started looking for the wreck I did n’t know exactly where I was , so I found the town of Giglio , moved over to the water , zoomed in pretty tightly , and began scrolling up the coast .
I worried I was n’t zoomed in close enough to find the ship ; it ’s difficult to judge precisely how close you are to the ground when you ’re doing satellite view .
But it turned out I was plenty close , because when I finally found the ship the nose jutted into view so enormously it almost filled my entire screen , and I actually yelped in surprise .
Now I ’m wondering :
What other accidents are visible in satellite view ?
Are there any similar catastrophes — collapses , capsizings , etc. — that are out there ?
Since Google updates its satellite view with some regularity , and since most of these really big accidents take months or years to clean up , there must be tons .

Fixing the unfixable
That radio above is the Cambridge Soundworks HD Radio 820HD , a high - end clock - radio from 2007 .
Today , I got an email from James Grimmer , a reader who responded to my column on the fixer movement with a great story of fixing his 820HD .
The manufacturer had abandoned the device , it had n’t been designed to be disassembled in the first place — but when Grimmer got the radio open , all it needed were some a few cheap fixes .
If devices like this were designed to be easily opened , it ’d be a lot easier to fix them .
Forthwith :
Amen to your article on The Fixer ’s Movement .
When I was a kid , my dad taught me how to fix just about anything .
His motto was , “ It ’s already broken , so you have nothing to lose because a repair shop will charge you more than it ’s worth to fix it . ”
I ’ve been fixing my friends ’ and our electronics , appliances , plumbing , wiring , ( to be fair , I should admit I apprenticed as a plumber and worked with skilled electricians and carpenters who taught me a lot ) for a long time now , and have rarely been stymied , although I had one experience that sums up much of what you said in the article .
A few years ago , I bought the highly touted Cambridge HD820 radio .
It had great sound for such a small box , and HD radio doubled the kind of programming I liked .
After two years , it failed — weak signal and constant buzzing regardless of volume level .
I guessed power supply and possibly antenna , but was completely stymied on how to get the radio disassembled — it was entirely sealed with no discernible entry points .
I called Cambridge , and they answered that they had no repair service nor any service manual , and that they had discontinued the model ( that had been jobbed out to a Korean manufacturer ) .
They simply offered no help or advice at all .
I found the manufacturer and got nearly the same story there , but the operator who answered remembered that the disassembly bolts were concealed underneath the metal grills ( that were glued to the face of the speakers . )
She said I ’d have to destroy the grills to get inside the cabinet .
It turned out I did n’t have to — I took my long Rapala filet knife and carefully sliced underneath the grills ’ covers .
Got to what turned out to be 18 disassembly bolts and screws .
Once I could see the boards , it was obvious that everything had been hot - glued into place , so it took another hour to free up the boards without cracking them .
Then I could see the bad connection on the antenna — easy fix .
I could also see where the buzz came from — two visibly expanding capacitors in the power supply — another easy fix .
Now it works great , and it has been assembled far more sensibly for repair .
Why could n’t they have designed it that way in the first place ?
How much do I desire to deal with Cambridge again ( no hope for service two years after purchase ) ?
I ’d add that those capacitors have been a haunting feature of about half the items I ’ve repaired for people lately , especially in cheap DVD players and boom boxes .
More than a few of those blown capacitors were 16 volt in circuits that called for 35 volt capacitors .
I ca n’t believe an EE would mistakenly do that , so either the marketing people OK ’d the slightly cheaper 16 volters to increase profits by 5 cents , or the EE ’s were instructed to use capacitors that would kill the player within two years .
Another bugaboo is cheap switches and relays on appliances .
Our dryer failed , and a repair shop quoted over $ 100 for a fix .
I just took my VOM and ran through the circuit , found a faulty microswitch , learned that the manufacturer wanted $ 40 for it on its website , and then found the same switch in an online parts bin for $ 7 .
They had also , interestingly , installed the switch with machine screws from the back side of the drum , so it took a small offset Phillips screwdriver to get them out .
When I reinstalled the switch , I drilled the threads out of the hole and installed small bolts and nuts to make further replacements easy .
Was someone at the manufacturer deliberately making that switch so hard to get at ( unless one happens to have small offset screwdriver ) that most people would think a repairman was necessary ?
On a larger , older scale , our house was built in 1957 .
The main plumbing stack cleanout in the basement was done with a straight
Tee facing a wall that was very near the wall .
Opening that cleanout and getting a big snake through it was a real knuckle - busting , acrobatic act .
That design made sense in no way whatsoever .
Not even our sewer guy liked dealing with that location .
First , why not locate it facing out ?
Second , why not a sanitary Tee ?
Third , how did inspectors let that pass ?
( This was the same crew , I should add , who allowed cast iron to be connected to clay pipe with mortar .
Guess how long it took for roots to break through that mortar ?
Our whole neighborhood has been dug up to correct that deficiency .
I took out the stack , replaced it with ABS , and installed a sanitary Tee cleanout — not an easy fix .
Would legislation help ?
I do n’t know .
It may be that consumer magazines like yours and consumer websites and rating services have more influence without the time , expense , and corruption of a set of laws that manufacturers would figure out how to avoid .
These companies do , however , have a terrible time finding their way around criticisms in popular media .
On the value of imagining yourself as a mosquito , or a beam of light
In Brooklyn where I live , the mosquitos are brutal in the summer .
I ’ve tried everything to fight them : Mosquito - repellent candles , bug zappers , those vaguely snake - oilian machines that use propane to try and trap insects .
None of it worked .
I ’d resigned myself to simply never sitting in my backyard or front stoop for the months of July or August .
Then I read a clever solution in yesterday ’s New York Times :
An oscillating fan .
If you set an oscillating fan near where you ’re sitting , it prevents mosquitos from clustering .
Why ?
An incredibly simple reason :
They ’re not strong enough to fight against the wind .
The author of the article , William Broad , discovered this nifty hack while visiting with some friends .
They set out a fan , nobody got bit , and Broad , amazed , asked them :
Where had the idea come from ?
As we left , I asked our hosts about the fan idea ; they credited a mutual friend at the barbecue .
He , in turn , paid tribute to a friend of his : Frank Swift , president of Swift Food Equipment Inc. in Philadelphia .
So I reached out to Mr. Swift , who replied by e-mail .
“ The solution came from trying to think like a bug , ” he explained , “ and realizing I do n’t like flying into a 15 m.p.h. wind . ”
I love it :
He imagined himself in the position of the mosquito .
This is not something we ’re often told to do when brainstorming a solution to a problem .
Sure , we ’re frequently told that it ’s important to empathize with the humans ; they ’re the reason the problem is being solved , right ?
But we ’re rarely told that a crucial imaginative task , a critical bit of cognition , is to put ourselves in the position of a nonhuman thing , and see the world from that perspective .
Yet the thing is , the world is awfully interesting when you view it from the perspective of inanimate objects .
Albert Einstein began developing his deep insights into the nature of space and time when , at the age of 16 , he imagined himself riding a beam of light :
Seeing the world from the viewpoint of light , as it were .
In 1905 , when wrestling with the apparent paradoxes of physics that are introduced by the speed of light being constant and unsurpassable , he looked up at the clock tower in Bern and again imagined the perspective of light racing away from the tower .
Boom :
In a flash , he envisioned the answer .
He realized the clock would appear stopped , because the light from the tower could never catch up to a beam of light that was racing away from it .
As Michio Kaku writes :
Then suddenly it hit him , the key to the entire problem .
Einstein recalled , “ A storm broke loose in my mind . ”
The answer was simple and elegant : time can beat at different rates throughout the universe , depending on how fast you moved .
Think like light , think like a mosquito .
This idea — how does our world appear to things around us — is n’t an entirely new idea , obviously ; it ’s part of Bruno Latour ’s actor - network theory .
My personal favorite exploration of it is Ian Bogost ’s fun , recent book Alien Phenomenology , Or What It ’s Like To Be a Thing .
Anyway , now I vow to start approaching problems by imagining the mental state of the inanimate objects involved .
( As Broad notes , apparently the mosquito - fan idea is a venerable piece of folk wisdom , so I guess people have been successfully thinking like bugs for some time . )
Probably true .
How to Find Your Own Purpose Something motivates you to get up each day .
That something says a good deal about your current central purpose in life .
If you eventually get out of bed because you dont want to be sacked from your job , then your purpose has to do with money and security .
If you get up because of what people might think if you didnt , then you are motivated by a fear of disapproval .
A persons life is already an expression of their purpose , whether this purpose operates consciously or subconsciously .
If you are driven by a purpose you re not conscious of , then its likely to have roots in fear .
Motivation of this kind is usually conditioned into us , whether we like it or not .
Some people dont believe in purpose  just get on with life , take things as they come  these are common phrases , yet they are also clear descriptions of purpose masquerading as lack of purpose .
The unspoken purpose here is continued physical survival .
Basic survival and social conformity are common motivations , but why limit yourself to mundane , inferior soap - opera scenarios when you can reach for the stars ?
Dont Wait to be Told
You dont need permission to decide your own purpose .
No boss , teacher , parent , priest or other authority can decide this for you .
Purpose has nothing to do with sacrifice , getting approval , being selfless  or conforming to somebody elses idea of the correct way to live .
It doesnt mean giving up something you like for something more worthy  .
Your purpose is derived from what you most value .
It pays , therefore , to resolve conflicting values so that you avoid being a slave to someone elses purpose .
Purpose is not achievement .
For example , achievement can mean being successful at a job you dont want , to enable you to afford an expensive car you dont need , in order to impress a girlfriend you dont like ...
A purpose is something you express continually in order to bring you pleasure , not a list of things you have to achieve .

OCaml and Emily In a Walnut
Custom Designed For C++ and Java Programmers
by Marc Stiegler
Introduction
So , perhaps you are a C++ programmer , and you have noticed that , although you personally have never ever introduced a buffer overflow security breach , that notorious individual named Someone Else -- a member of every programming team -- probably has .
As a consequence , if your product becomes popular , it is going to be a disaster .
Or , perhaps you are a Java programmer , your software seems sluggish , you are worried that the complaints will reduce sales , and you 're worried you really need that factor of 2 performance that C++ still gives you , despite all the optimizations and all the compilation strategies the Java community has devised .
Do not despair .
There is another programming language that can reduce the amount of code you have to write , increase your productivity , give you performance comparable to that of C++ , while protecting you not only from buffer overflow bugs , but also from other security breaches .
OCaml has been around longer than Java ; it is a mature language , robust and reliable for use in significant projects .
It uses inference - based static type checking .
This means you rarely have to write type declarations , but you get all the correctness benefits that Java and C++ programmers expect from their compilers .
It is memory safe , so no buffer overflows .
And it is fast , as fast or faster than C++ for many applications .
Emily is a design rule verifier for OCaml that implements the Principle of Least Authority ( POLA ) at the individual object level .
With Emily , you can prove that large swaths of code employ little or no authority , allowing you to know that those parts of the program cannot cause harm .
This allows you to focus your security review resources on a much smaller part of the system , dramatically reducing the " attack surface " available for crackers and other sport enthusiasts .
A longer discussion of these features of OCaml and Emily can be found in the HP Technical Report , " Emily : A High Performance Language for Breach - Resistant Server , Multimedia , and Rendering Applications " .
Here we will run you quickly through the basics of using OCaml and Emily .
There are many other books and documents you can find about OCaml .
If you have a background in functional programming , you should probably read one of those , not this .
Most literature on OCaml is written with an eye to hammering the Java or C++ programmer into functional programming shape before letting him loose with code .
Here , however , we will focus on teaching the language for people who are already familiar with imperative programming , who like imperative programming , and who will find it quicker and easier to learn if taught in an imperative programming style .
However , even with this orientation , the reference manual shipped with the OCaml distribution ( current release named ocaml - 3.09 - refman.pdf ) is a crucial document .
In particular , Chapter IV is the documentation for the libraries .
We will use only a tiny part of the libraries here .
Indeed we fiercely minimize the number of functions from the libraries that we call .
Browsing the libraries is important to give you a sense of what you can do that we have left out of this document .
For a person from a C++ background , the syntax of OCaml has many quirks .
Of course , C++ has even more quirks ... but if you 've grown accustomed to the C++ quirks , they are invisible .
OCaml quirks are the same way .
Once you 've become accustomed to them , they too will disappear into the background .
Stick with it , the reward is substantial .
Hello World and Factorial
Once you 've installed OCaml , bring up the interactive environment .
Open a command shell and start " ocaml " , which will give you a simple prompt .
Type the helloWorld program :
# print_string " Hello World
" ; ;
Hello World
- : unit = ()
#
The function print_string prints the string given to it as a parameter .
The line " - unit = ( ) " is telling you the type of the value returned by the function , in this case the " unit " , which is approximately the same as returning void .
The double semi-colon denotes the end of a top - level expression in the interactive environment ; the interactive environment will not evaluate a block of code until it encounters the double semi-colon .
Let 's look at another classic mini-program , the factorial function .
Since this program is written in a nearly functional style even in C++ , we will show it both ways : as an imperative program and as a functional program :
# (* factorial function , imperative style *)
let fac n =
let result = ref 1 in
for i = 1 to n do
result := ! result * i ;
done
! result ; ;
val fac : int -> int = < fun >
# fac 6 ; ;
- : int = 720
# # (* factorial function , functional style *)
let rec fac n =
if ( n <= 1 ) then 1
else n * ( fac ( n - 1 ) ) ; ;
val fac : int -> int = < fun >
# fac 3 ; ;
- : int = 6
#
Features to note :
The form (* ... *) denotes a comment .
Comments can be nested ( though syntax highlighters often fail to understand this , which can cause excruciating confusion if you 've come to assume your highlighter is always correct ) .
We start the definition of a function or a variable with the keyword let .
If the function or variable is at the top level , we end it with the double semi-colons .
However , when nested , the full structure one uses is " let variablename = variablevalue in body " .
In simple definitions , we put the in at the end of the line , and do not indent the next line .
For the most part , a C++ programmer can think of it as the end - of - definition symbol , close enough to being the semi-colon after an assignment so you can do some programming while you get more comfortable with the language .

Most " variables " in OCaml are in fact constants , i.e. , they are invariant , making the term " variable " an odd name .
If you say
let x = 3 in
let y = 4 in
x + y
the x and the y are constants that can not be reassigned .
To make a variable that can actually change its value , we must make it a ref .
Here we have made the variable result a ref .
the x and the y are constants that can not be reassigned .
To make a variable that can actually change its value , we must make it a .
Here we have made the variable result a .
To dereference a ref , use the exclamation mark ; to assign a new value to the ref , use the " : = " assignment operator .
Hence the line
result := !result * i ;
dereferences the result to get its contents , multiplies that content by i , and assigns the outcome of that multiplication to the result .
, use the exclamation mark ; to assign a new value to the ref , use the " : = " assignment operator .
Hence the line result := ! result * i ; dereferences the result to get its contents , multiplies that content by i , and assigns the outcome of that multiplication to the result .
Use the semi-colon to terminate imperative statements .
The earlier print_string , if embedded in a function , would be terminated with a semicolon , as is the reassignment statement and the for loop .
A function returns the result of evaluating the last expression in its body .
There is no separate return statement .
In the imperative version of fac , we dereference the result as the last line ; in the functional version , the function returns whatever value the if expression computes .
expression computes .
A recursive function needs to use the keyword rec to alert the compiler .
to alert the compiler .
The type signature inferrred by OCaml to describe this function is worth examining more closely .
The type signature is " int - > int " , which says , the fac function should be given one integer , and it will return one integer .
Both versions have this same type signature , as they should .
If you were to do a benchmark on these two versions of factorial , you would find that the imperative version runs faster .
To run as fast as the imperative version , the functional version would have to be rewritten to be tail - recursive , which is beyond the scope of this introduction .
On the other hand , the function version of fac is only three lines long , while the imperative version is 6 lines .
In this particular case , the functional version is not only shorter , it is quicker to write , easier to read , and simpler to maintain .
It is also fast compared to Java .
But in that inner tight loop where performance is everything , imperative is the answer .
The if expression can have several statements inside each clause , but if this is done , they must be enclosed in parentheses or a begin - end clause , i.e. , in some circumstances you use parentheses ( or begin ... end ) the way you use braces in C ++:
# if true then (
print_endline " abc " ;
print_endline " def " ;
) else print_endline " woa " ; ;
abc
def
- : unit = ()
Because the if expression returns a value , and because OCaml type checks that value , the then and else clauses must return the same result .
In general , when an if clause is used imperatively , the returned value will be unit for both clauses .
If , however , you use a function that returns a value as well as performing a side effect , you will get a type mismatch that will puzzle you endlessly .
Put a unit object as the last value to be returned : " ( ) " , and the type mismatch should be cleared up .
Or put the keyword ignore in front of that last function to cause a unit value to be returned .
Simple Pattern Matching : Switch - like statements and exception handling
OCaml uses the match - with expression for many kinds of pattern matching .
You can think of the match - with as a switch statement on steroids .
First , we look at the match expression doing a simple switch statement job :
# let x = 3 in
match x with
| 1 -> print_string " it is a 1
"
| 3 -> print_string " it is a 3
"
| _ -> print_string " it is something else " ; ;
it is a 3
- : unit = ()
The underbar clause in the match is the catchall , comparable to the default : clause in a switch statement .
If you do not have separate cases for all possible matches , you will get a syntax warning if you do not include the catchall .
The match expression , like the if expression , returns a value .
In the example above , it returns a " unit " value since that is the value returned by the print_string .
But it can return other values , as shown here :
# let isEven num = match num mod 2 with
| 0 -> true
| 1 -> false
| _ -> raise ( Failure " unlikely outcome " ) ; ;
val isEven : int -> bool = < fun >
# isEven 3 ; ;
- : bool = false
Here we also show a simple throw of an exception : we raise the builtin exception Failure that takes a string argument .
During the catch ( which is performed in the with part of a try - with ) , we can extract the string :
# try
raise ( Failure " abc " )
with
| Failure description -> print_string ( description ^ "
" )
| _ -> print_string " surprise " ; ;
abc
- : unit = ()
Yes , exceptions are handled with pattern matching as well .
The passage " Failure description -> " matches exceptions of the type Failure , and loads the variable description with the contents of the exception .
As an aside , note the use of " ^ " for concatenating strings .
Match clauses , like the then and else clauses of an if , must all return the same type of value .
There is another subtle difference between the match and if expressions .
If a match clause has multiple statements , the statements do not have to be grouped by either a set of parentheses or a begin - end block .
This sounds attractive , but in fact can cause a problem when you nest matchers , or when you try to follow a match expression with something else that should be done no matter which match clause is evaluated .
See the Gotchas section later for more details .
We will do much more with pattern matching later .
The Cat Program
Let 's stretch the machinery we 've learned and write a useful program .
We will write the Linux bash command " cat " .
Cat copies the contents of stdin to stdout .
Here is the program :
try
while true do
output_char stdout ( input_char stdin )
done
with eof -> ()
In this example , there is no pound sign at the beginning , and there is no double - semi- colon at the end .
That is because we are not running it in the interpreter , rather we are compiling it as a program .
Put this source in a file " cat.ml " and compile with the command line " ocamlopt - o cat.exe cat.ml " .
You should be able to use the result just like the normal cat command ( note : if running on Windows using the MSVS compiler , there are a number of *.lib files that will have to be included in the default compilation directory .
If you figure out a better solution , please contact the author ) .
Note the form of the while - do - done construct .
Also note that this with clause has a single pattern against which to match .
This single pattern is simply a variable into which the exception will be loaded .
We have called the caught exception " eof " , suggesting end - of - file , but any exception would be caught and would be filled into this variable , which could be raised again if appropriate .
In this particular example , no matter what the exception is , we are happy to just let the program proceed through the last expression in the source .
When the last expression is completed , the program terminates automatically , i.e , no explicit " exit " is required .
Had we wanted to do something different if we caught a real eof exception , we would have matched for the builtin exception End_of_file .
This exception does not have content like the Failure exception , so the match would not include a variable , only the exception name , i.e. ,
with
| End_of_file ->
The cat program also introduces the builtin in_channel and out_channel , stdin and stdout .
The builtin function output_char takes as arguments an out_channel and a char , returning unit .
The function input_char takes an in_channel as an argument , and returns a char .
Arrays
OCaml has arrays , their types are implied by the type of the element :
# let numbers = [ | 1 ; 2 ; 3 | ] ; ;
val numbers : int array = [ |1 ; 2 ; 3 | ]
# numbers .
( 1 ) ; ;
- : int = 2
# numbers .
(1 ) <- 5 ; ;
- : unit = ()
The " < - " operator is used to reassign the elements of the array .
You can make an " empty " array like this :
# let charArray = Array.make 3 'a' ; ;
val charArray : char array = [ |'a ' ; 'a ' ; ' a ' | ]
This make function ( in the Array module , which we 'll discuss later ) takes two arguments , a length and an initial value to load into each element of the array .
So it is not really empty .
Strings are indexed in a similar matter :
# let title = " president " ; ;
val title : string = " president "
# title . [ 1 ] ; ;
- : char = 'r '
Strings use square brackets rather than parentheses to offset the index .
Strings are mutable , just like arrays .
Resist the temptation to use this feature .
You need to use this feature when reading from an in_channel , but do not use it elsewhere .
Eventually the Emily design rule verifier will throw mutable strings back at you if you try to use them .
Records , and an Intro to Objects
There are several ways you can construct object - like components in OCaml .
Functions can be passed around like objects and can be thought of as objects with a single method , as shown here .
# let observer ( ) = print_string " observed event
" ; ;
val observer : unit -> unit = < fun >
# let notify obs = obs ( ) ; ;
val notify : ( unit -> ' a ) -> ' a = < fun >
# notify observer ; ;
observed event
- : unit = ()
In this observer example , the notifier is handed the observer function .
The notifier then invokes the function with the appropriate arguments .
In this example , the observer function expects no parameters , i.e. , it receives a unit argument , denoted by the " ( ) " .
Another way to make objects is to use Modules .
Modules are best for maximum performance .
They are explained late in this walnut .
Another way to make objects is to use classes , which give performance that is disappointing compared to C++ ( though still excellent compared to Java ) .
But the simplest way to make things that act like objects may be to just use records .
Records must have explicit types declared :
# type point = {x:int ; y:int} ; ;
type point = { x : int ; y : int ; }
# let origin = {x=0 ; y=0} ; ;
val origin : point = {x = 0 ; y = 0}
# origin.x ; ;
- : int = 0
We declare the types of the x and y fields of the record using a colon to separate the variable from the type .
When we actually create a record that matches this declaration , we assign the fields values using the equal sign .
We access each field using a dot notation .
We can easily build a constructor for record - style objects ( assuming we have already defined the type point ) :
# let makePoint newX newY = {x = newX ; y = newY} ; ;
val makePoint : int -> int -> point = < fun >
# let point1 _2 = makePoint 1 2 ; ;
val point1 _2 : point = {x = 1 ; y = 2}
# point1_2.x ; ;
- : int = 1
The makePoint function manufactures a new record , given x and y values .
The last thing that makePoint does ( which also happens to be the only thing it does ) is create a record , so the record is returned as the result of evaluating makePoint .
Records can hold functions as well as data .
Here is a fancier makePoint that allows an existing point to manufacture an offset point :
# type point = {x:int ; y:int ; offset : int -> int -> point} ; ;
type point = { x : int ; y : int ; offset : int -> int -> point ; }
# let rec makePoint newX newY =
let makeOffset of fX offY = makePoint ( offX + newX ) ( offY + newY ) in
{x = newX ; y = newY ; offset = makeOffset} ; ;
val makePoint : int -> int -> point = < fun >
# let point1_3 = makePoint 1 3 ; ;
val point1_3 : point = {x = 1 ; y = 3 ; offset = < fun>}
# let point2_4 = point1_3.offset 1 1 ; ;
val point2_4 : point = {x = 2 ; y = 4 ; offset = < fun>}
This example illustrates several points :
Note how , in this example , makePoint manufactures several different things : first it manufactures a makeOffset function just for this point , then it manufactures and returns the point 's record ( which uses the makeOffset function in its definition ) .
The makeOffset function declared inside the makePoint function has enduring access to the arguments passed in to makePoint , namely newX and newY .
The arguments passed in are not transient ghosts as they are in C++ or Java .
So you do not have to declare instance variables , and copy the arguments into the instance variables , in order to keep the argument value around .
Instead , you can just use the arguments ; they remain in the scope of the elements that use them .
Let us quickly assess how these arguments appear to the garbage collector : as long as the point manufactured by makePoint exists , the function makeOffset must exist .
As long as the function makeOffset exists , the newX and newY arguments must exist .
When the point is garbage collected , the makeOffset function may be garbage collected ( unless the function is independently referenced somewhere ) .
When the makeOffset function is garbage collected , the newX and newY arguments may be garbage collected ( unless they are referenced somewhere else , impossible in this case since integers are passed by copy ) .

When the makeOffset function is garbage collected , the newX and newY arguments may be garbage collected ( unless they are referenced somewhere else , impossible in this case since integers are passed by copy ) .
The type signature of makeOffset is this : given two integers , return a point .
This is represented as " int -> int -> point " .
We will discuss type declarations more in the next section .
The makePoint function is recursive , because the makeOffset function inside it calls make Point itself .
This version of the point type is also recursive : inside the declaration of the point type , we see a reference to the point type .
We do not need a special syntax ( like rec ) to enable a type to recursively reference itself .
This makePoint function , which manufactures other functions that are placed inside of records , will look strange , even disturbing , to the C++ or Java programmer .
Java actually has a mechanism quite similar to this , the inner class .
However , the syntax is sufficiently different that the similarities may be hard to recognize .
If this form is too alien for comfort in constructing objects , use the class keyword introduced later , or use Modules introduced much later , to make objects .
Finally , records can contain mutable fields , i.e. , true variables that can be reassigned :
# type personalData = {name : string ; mutable phoneNumber : int} ; ;
type personalData = { name : string ; mutable phoneNumber : int ; }
# let john = {name = " John " ; phoneNumber = 1234567} ; ;
val john : personalData = {name = " John " ; phoneNumber = 1234567}
# john.phoneNumber <- 7654321 ; ;
- : unit = ()
# john.phoneNumber ; ;
- : int = 7654321
To reassign a new value to a mutable element of a record , use the " < - " operator .
It may seem irritating that there are two operators for reassignment , i.e. , mutation .
Array elements and records use the " < - " operator , and the ref variable uses the " := " operator .
In fact , the ref is really a syntactic shortcut for a record with a single mutable element " contents " :
# let z = ref 0 ; ;
val z : int ref = {contents = 0}
# z.contents <- 1 ; ;
- : unit = ()
# z.contents ; ;
- : int = 1
# !z ; ;
- : int = 1
So we see that " < - " is the primitive reassignment operator , and " : = " is a syntactic shortcut .
Classes
If you come from C++ or Java , it may seem inconceivable to do object - oriented programming without classes .
However , as mentioned earlier , there are other alternatives in OCaml .
Usually the other alternatives will be more appropriate .
From a C++ or Java background , it only makes sense to learn OCaml and Emily if you need hot performance and / or superior breach - resistant security .
If you need performance , you should use Modules .
If you need more exotic forms of secure cooperation inside the program , you should use record - making functions like the makePoint shown earlier .
Such records enable intermediation , which is key to more sophisticated security policy enforcement ( see A PictureBook of Secure Cooperation for more on this topic ) .
However , simple classes for simple objects are easy to learn and use :
# class point ( x:int ) ( y:int ) = object
method getX ( ) = x
method getY ( ) = y
end ; ;
class point :
int ->
int -> object method getX : unit -> int method getY : unit -> int end
# let origin = new point 0 0 ; ;
val origin : point = < obj >
# origin#getX ( ) ; ;
- : int = 0
The message name separator is a sharp , not a dot .
We had to specify types for the constructor arguments to prevent an ambiguity in type inference that the compiler cannot resolve .
The traditional features of class - based object - orient programming , such as private instance variables , inheritance , etc. , are available .
But they are beyond the scope of this introduction .
More Type Declarations
We have already seen type declarations for strings and ints , and for a couple of simple functions .
A few of the builtins are :
int , int32 , int64 , nativeint
float , float32 , float64
string
char
bool
All these primitive types can be included in the type declarations for functions .
Here is the signature for a fancy function that receives two arguments , a bool and a simple function that receives nothing ( unit ) and returns an integer .
Upon receiving the bool and the simple function , the fancy function returns a char :
type fancyFunc = bool -> ( unit -> int ) -> char
You can declare types that have to - be - determined elements .
These are known as parameterized types .
You denote an unspecified parameter with a tick in front of the element name .
Here we create both a parameterized type , and a function that processes a parameterized array ( i.e. , an array for which we do not know the type of the contents ) :
# type 'a lengthCounter = ' a array -> int ; ;
type 'a lengthCounter = ' a array -> int
# let counter a = Array . length a ; ;
val counter : ' a array -> int = < fun >
# counter [ | 1 ; 2 | ] ; ;
- : int = 2
This counter function is a function that generically processes any array , regardless of what kind of contents the array may have .
Using parameterized types in this fashion is similar to using templates in C ++.
An important kind of type is the variant type .
The variant type allows you to pass any of several different kinds of data in a single argument :
type nameOrPhone = Name of string |
Phone of int | Neither
The names of the variants must be capitalized .
You can have variants that are simple tokens ( " Neither " ) , and variants that contain data or other types .
Using variants effectively depends upon pattern matching , discussed next .
Pattern Matching with Types
We can match on the cases in a variant type and perform different operations depending on which one we have received :
# type nameOrPhone =
Name of string |
Phone of int | Neither ; ;
type nameOrPhone = Name of string |
Phone of int | Neither
# let printNameOrPhone a = match a with
| Name name -> print_string ( name ^ "
" )
| Phone num -> print_int num ;
print_string "
"
| Neither -> print_string
" Neither name nor phone
" ; ;
val printNameOrPhone : nameOrPhone -> unit = < fun >
# printNameOrPhone ( Name " Joe " ) ; ;
Joe
- : unit = ()
This print function takes any object of the type nameOrPhone and prints it .
Sometimes it will receive a string , sometimes a number , sometimes neither .
It handles each one appropriately .
Note , however , that we must do some explicit " typing " : when we invoke the function , we cannot just send it a string or a number , we must send it a variant , i.e. , ( Name " abc " ) or ( Phone 123 ) .
Printf
OCaml has a bagful of print statements : print_string , print_int , etc .
It can be quite tiresome to build a complex output stream .
For those who prefer C tradition , there is a printf statement :
# Printf.printf " printing string : %s
" " using - printf " ; ;
printing string : using - printf
- : unit = ()
Printf is part of the Printf module , which has a full complement of printf - style functions .
Gotchas
We have covered enough to do some interesting programming .
We should probably take some time to cover some gotchas before proceeding further , in case you want to go off and build something sooner rather than later .
It would be a shame to come this far , feel so confident you understand what OCaml is about , and then give up in a fit of swearing because of the compiler 's senseless error messages .
As mentioned in the Introduction , OCaml has its fair share of peculiarities .
These peculiarities seem particular peculiar coming from a C++ tradition .
Here we list some of the surprises that left the author baffled and frustrated , in hopes that you will be able to learn from his experience .
No overloading
OCaml has polymorphism , but it does not have overloading .
Coming from a C++ tradition , one has the concept of overloading so ingrained that this is hard to think about coherently .
The consequence first leaps out at you when using floating point numbers .
The integer operators , plus , minus , division , and multiplication , cannot be used for floats .
Instead , each integer operator is postfixed with a dot to form the floating point operator :
# let z = 3.1 +. 2.0 *. 2.7 ; ;
val z : float = 8.5
OCaml will not cast ints to floats for you , either .
Fortunately , there is a comprehensive collection of transforming functions for the builtin types , following the form of this example :
# float_of_int 3 ; ;
- : float = 3 .
Simple function names can still be used by discriminating among them using the module name :
# String.length " abc " ; ;
- : int = 3
# Array.length [ |1 | ] ; ;
- : int = 1
In this example , strings and arrays both have a function named " length " associated with them , but the programmer must differentiate , or the compiler will be unable to disambiguate the functions and the types .
Currying
A powerful feature that can drive those of us from a C++ background crazy is implicit currying .
If a function that needs two arguments is given only one argument , the compiler does not immediately throw a type checking failure .
Rather , the result of this operation is a new function , that only needs one argument to produce the result of the original function :
# let adder x y = x + y ; ;
val adder : int -> int -> int = < fun >
# let ad d2 = adder 2 ; ;
val add2 : int -> int = < fun >
# add2 3 ; ;
- : int = 5
We manufactured the function add2 by feeding the original adder function only one of its two needed arguments .
This can be cool , but it means that , if you feed a function too few arguments by accident , you can be surprised , thousands of lines of code later , when your program tries to use the result and throws a type mismatch error :
# let resultInt = adder 8 ; ;
val resultInt : int -> int = < fun >
# let diff = 7 - resultInt ; ;
Characters 15 - 24 :
let diff = 7 - resultInt ; ;
^^^^^^^^ ^
This expression has type int -> int but is here used with type int
ResultInt is the result of accidentally forgeting the second argument to adder .
The compiler does n't immediately indicate a problem ; as far as the compiler knows , it is just fine for resultInt to be a function that , given an int , will return an int .
But later in the program , when we try to subtract resultInt , the compiler complains with a type mismatch .
The clue that alerts you that you have suffered a currying catastrophe is the shape of the type mismatch .
If you experienced accidental currying , the signature on the mismatch will be a function that returns an object of the correct type , but which needs a smaller number of arguments .
With this clue , finding the problem is usually straightforward .
No Null
There is no general purpose null in OCaml .
Many programmers from a C++ tradition are surprised by how minor a problem this is .
Often , if a variable contains a null , there is a bug in the program ; these types of bugs are not possible in OCaml .
In circumstances where a null makes sense , since one uses variant types for many things anyway , creating a " null " type as a part of the variant is straightforward .
We showed this technique earlier when we created the nameOrPhone type , which had the third variant Neither .
OCaml does have a general - purpose builtin variant type with this signature :
type 'a option =
Some of ' a | None
You can use this variant with types for which you do n't have a " nothing there " variant or value :
# let ad d2 x = match x with
| Some intx -> intx + 2
| None -> 2 ; ;
val add2 : int option -> int = < fun >
# add2 ( Some 3 ) ; ;
- : int = 5
So you can always have a null , or at least a None , if you really want it .
Nested match expressions , match expressions followed by additional statements
Earlier we referred to a problem with nesting match expressions .
The nested match must be enclosed in parentheses , otherwise the compiler cannot tell where the inner match ends and the outer match starts again :
# let nested Match x c = match x with
| 1 -> ( match c with
| 'a ' -> print_string " 1a
"
| _ -> print_string " 1 followed by unknown
"
)
| _ -> print_string " not a 1 " ; ;
val nestedMatch : int -> char -> unit = < fun >
# nestedMatch 1 'b ' ; ;
1 followed by unknown
- : unit = ()
You also have to completely enclose the match , with all its clauses , if you wish to have something that happens after the match clause has completed , i.e. , something that happens no matter which clause is selected and evaluated .
Ambiguous Types
Sometimes the compiler will be unable to infer the types of the objects .
You can help OCaml by specifying the types of the objects explicitly , with the colon - type declaration that we saw briefly in the class point definition :
# let rec fac ( n : int ) =
if ( n <= 1 ) then 1 else n * fac ( n - 1 ) ; ;
val fac : int -> int = < fun >
The explicit typing of the argument n was unnecesary here for the compiler .
But it might be helpful to the human who is trying to read the code during maintenance .
Modules
Modules can be used for manufacturing objects .
They are also the basic mechanism for building library packages .
First we look at them as object manufacturing systems , then as library package systems .
We will implement point objects once again .
First we will implement the signature for point objects :
# module type PointSig = sig
type p
val getX : p -> int
val getY : p -> int
val offset : p -> int -> int ->
p
val make : int -> int -> p
end ; ;
module type PointSig =
sig
type p
val getX : p -> int
val getY : p -> int
val offset : p -> int -> int ->
p
val make : int -> int -> p
end
This signature declares the types of objects and the functions associated with those types .
Here we 've defined the abstract type p , with no description of its contents , which will be our point objects .
Had we declared the full description of the p type , its contents would have been visible to users of the module , which is sometimes desireable .
This is followed by declarations of the functions , of which the most complex is the offset function .
As you can see from the declaration , given a point and a pair of ints , the offset function returns a new point .
Now we define the Point module , which is associated with the signature as part of its construction :
# module Point : PointSig = struct
type p = {x : int ; y : int}
let getX point = point .x
let getY point = point .y
let make newX newY = {x = newX ; y = newY}
let offset point of fX offY =
make ( point.x + offX ) ( point.y + offY )
end ; ;
module Point : PointSig
Inside the Point module , we fully define the point type and the functions .
Note that these functions are top - level functions , and do not use the in keyword to end the definition .
Now we can use them .
# let origin = Point. make 0 0 ; ;
val origin : Point.p = < abstr >
# let p11 = Point.offset origin 1 1 ; ;
val p11 : Point.p = < abstr >
We prefix the function with the name of the module to disambiguate which make function we are using .
There is an " open module " statement that will set the specified module as the default module , so that the module prefix is unnecessary , but this is almost always a bad idea .
To create a module library package , we use the file suffix to tell us whether we have a module or a module signature , and we associate a module with its signature by giving both files the same name .
In this example , we would create a signature file Point.mli and a module file Point.ml .
We would strip off the first and last lines ( the module Point ... line and the end line ) , since that information is delivered with the file name and file extension .
We can precompile the module signature and definition as a library , or compile them together with the main program ; see the ocamlopt documentation for more detail .
The *.mli files are more like C++ header files than they are like Java interface files ; if you think of them as header files you will be in good shape .
If you write a module definition without an associated signature , OCaml will simply create a signature for the module in which everything is public and nothing is abstract or hidden .
Objects created as modules yield high performance code .
The style and layout of modules may feel a bit alien , but you can't beat the numbers .
Other types of objects can be declared and defined as parts of modules .
You can put class definitions in modules , and the simple record - based objects described earlier can be put into modules as well .
Some people feel that you do n't have real objects unless you have inheritance .
You can do inheritance with modules and record - based objects , but it is n't pretty , and it is n't in the scope of this document .
In the last few years the author has come to the conclusion that inheritance is usually a bad idea .
One should use delegation instead .
Unfortunately , delegation is also beyond the scope of this document .
But you can read more about it ( and about the techniques that one would apply to record - based objects to get inheritance ) in E in a Walnut .
Lists and Tuples
Up to this point we have tried to focus on making OCaml comfortable and familiar to the C++ or Java programmer .
Sometimes this has not been as easy or even as possible as one would like , because OCaml is a very different language .
But the goal has , to this moment , always been maximum familiarity within the constraint of showing enough stuff so you can get real work done .
We have shown , hopefully , that it is possible to get work done in a C++ , imperative fashion .
We could stop discussing OCaml here , and go on to describe Emily .
But it would be a shame to completely disregard a couple of basic pieces of machinery OCaml has for enabling high speed production of compact , readable code .
Here we give just a taste of tuples and lists .
All the other texts on OCaml give glorious , exhausting detail on these parts of OCaml , so we just barely introduce them here .
Lists can be thought of as immutable vectors .
Any element can be indexed via the nth function in the List module :
# let lst = [ 1 ; 2;3 ] ; ;
val lst : int list = [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ]
# List.nth lst 2 ; ;
- : int = 3
We can create a new list that appends a new element to the top of an existing list with a double - colon :
# let list2 = 4 :: lst ; ;
val list2 : int list = [ 4 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ]
Note that the appended item goes to the head of the list , i.e. , element number 0 .
And we can engage the many compact and powerful list processing functions offered by the List module .
In this example we use the map function to create a list in which each element is created by multiplying an element of list2 by 3 :
# let listTimes3 = List.map ( fun n -> n * 3 ) list2 ; ;
val listTimes3 : int list = [ 12 ; 3 ; 6 ; 9 ]
This example uses an anonymous function , which uses the fun keyword and the " - > " operator to create the definition ; we could have defined a named function beforehand and used that in the map function instead .
Perhaps most interesting , we can do pattern matching on the elements of the list :
# type intOrString =
Int of int | Str of string ; ;
type intOrString =
Int of int | Str of string
# let thingsList = [ Int 1 ; Str " abc " ; Int 2 ; Str " def " ] ; ;
val thingsList : intOrString list =
[ Int 1 ; Str " abc " ; Int 2 ; Str " def " ]
# match thingsList with
| Str a :: Int x :: remainder -> ()
| Int y :: Str b :: remainder -> print_string " got int string at head
"
| _ -> ( ) ; ;
got int string at head
- : unit = ()
You can quickly sort out what kinds of things you got in a list by using pattern matching .
Here we zoomed right in on the lists that had an Int followed by a Str at the head of the list .
The variable " remainder " contains the part of the string that was unmatched .
Had we put the empty list " [ ] " instead of a variable name for the third element of the match , the pattern would have only matched lists that were exactly length 2 , i.e. , lists that had an Int and a Str and nothing else .
Tuples are not as malleable as lists , but they can contain objects of different types ( unlike lists , in which all elements have to be of the same type -- the saving grace being , the type of the list elements can be a variant type ) .
Here is a tuple with an int and a char , and a pattern that matches them :
# let joe = ( " Joe " , 9417758 ) ; ;
val joe : string * int = ( " Joe " , 9417758 )
# let ( joeName , joePhone ) = joe ; ;
val joeName : string = " Joe "
val joePhone : int = 9417758
Here we create the joe tuple that contains a string and an int .
Note the type description of a tuple separates the types of the individual element with a star .
Having created the joe tuple , we then use a pattern match ( a pattern match that does n't even need the match construct ) to pluck out the elements into separate variables .
Tuples can be quickly constructed ( they need no type declaration like a record ) and quickly taken apart into their individual components ( with a pattern match ) .
So the next time you find yourself wishing you could return a pair of values from a function or method , rather than inventing a new type just to carry the answer back , you can construct the tuple , and the recipient can disassemble it into its components in a flash .
Putting tuples and lists together in a tiny example ,
# let database = [ ( " Joe " , 1234567 ) ; ( " Amy " , 7654321 ) ; ( " Bob " , 2976869 ) ] ; ;
val database : ( string * int ) list =
[ ( " Joe " , 1234567 ) ; ( " Amy " , 7654321 ) ; ( " Bob " , 2976869 ) ]
# let retrieve name = List.find
( fun next ->
let ( dbName , phone ) = next in
name = dbName )
database ; ;
val retrieve : string -> string * int = < fun >
# let ( name , phone ) = retrieve " Amy " ; ;
val name : string = " Amy "
val phone : int = 7654321
Here we have built a tiny database , built a tiny data retriever , and extracted a complete database record .
Is it short , sweet , and clear ?
If it is , great , if it is not , please disregard .
Emily
Emily , as noted earlier , is a design style verifier for OCaml that enables Principle of Least Authority confinement down to the individual object level .
With Emily , one can prove ( in the engineering sense , not the mathematical sense ) that many ( indeed , most ) of the objects in your program do not have enough authority to do any harm , thus reducing the attack surface for the cracker , and reducing the amount of code a security review team needs to inspect to ensure the system is robust against diverse types of attacks .
To use Emily , or to really convince yourself Emily is a good idea , you should start out by reading the HP Tech Report , Emily : A High Performance Language for Breach Resistant Server , MultiMedia , and Rendering Applications .
Here we will focus on how to use the Emily tools , notably emilyopt , the verifier / compiler / linker .
We will build a powerbox even simpler than the powerbox presented in the tech report , and an application that uses it .
Our powerbox will be a simplification of the " sash " powerbox in the tech report .
Here we build minisash .
Our minisash powerbox simply confers to the application the stdin and stdout channels .
This tiny bit of authority is actually enough to run more than one application ; here , we will build a cat command , a POLA - confined version of the cat program we wrote earlier that copies stdin to stdout .
Make a folder named minisash .
Into this folder place the following files :
A file named " powerbox.ml " , that has the following single line of code :
CapMain.start stdin stdout
This line of code simply invokes the start function in the CapMain module of the application , passing in the stdin and stdout authorities .
A file named " stdLib.txt " , containing a single line with the path to the ocaml standard library folder .
A file named " safeStdLib.txt " , containing a single line with the path to the safe , non-authority - bearing , version of the stdlib .
This folder is a part of your Emily distribution .
A folder named " safePowerLib " .
This is the folder that contains interface declarations for objects and functions passed between the powerbox and the application .
In minisash we only pass the standard in_channel and out_channel objects , so no interfaces are needed , and this folder remains empty ..
A file names " safePowerLib.txt " that contains the path to the safePowerLib folder .
A file named " libs.txt " that contains nothing .
This is the list of libraries , modules , etc. , from both the powerbox and the stdlib that are needed for the link step .
None are needed for this simple application .
Make a scond folder named " cat " .
Into this folder place the following files :
A file named " CapMain.ml " with the following code :
let start inchan outchan = try
while true do
output_char outchan ( input_char inchan )
done
with eof -> ()
This is the main body of the cat program .
Unsurprisingly , it looks much like the cat program earlier , wrapped up as a function in the CapMain module to be called by the powerbox .
The special feature is what this version of cat cannot do -- it cannot do anything except read from inchan and write to outchan .
It can not open any files , connect to the network , or pop an annoying dialog .
It can only do what you intended for it to do -- it is confined by the Principle of Least Authority , so that it has just enough power to carrying out your wishes , neither more nor less .
You can hire a world - class cracker to write your cat program , and use his code feeling comfortable and secure ( well , not quite , since Emily itself has not had a security review , but the design rules it enforces are theoretically able to supply such a feeling of comfortable security ) .
A file named " order.compile " , with the single line CapMain .ml in it .
Now compile :
emilyopt minisash cat safecat.exe
This should create the executable file safecat.exe .
A Little Fancy Emily Footwork
Earlier a claim was made that Emily could support exotic security policies .
We now try to show a simple example of a complex policy .
Consider the following scenario :
You hire a consultant to build a particular complex piece of code for your system .
You are using Emily for development , but you are using Emily in a casual fashion , and are using the following form of file object :
type file = {getText : unit -> string ; setText : string -> unit}
let makeFile path = {
getText = ( fun ->
let chan = open_in path in
let length = in_channel_length chan in
let buf = String . make length ' ' in
input chan buf 0 length ;
close_in chan ;
buf ) ;
setText = ( fun text ->
let chan = open_out path in
Printf.fprintf chan " %s " text ;
close_out chan )
}
The file type is public , i.e. , it is included in the safePowerLib files with which the application is compiled .
The makeFile function is private to the powerbox , since it uses full - authority calls to OCaml .
So the application can use files that are handed to it , but cannot access random files at leisure just by guessing a path and using magic to open a channel .
Now the consultant has just finished up work on your stuff , and preliminary testing suggests it does what it is supposed to do .
You call to tell the consultant that you are pleased with his work , but the FBI answers the phone and explains that the consultant has just been thrown in jail , he is the guy who put the back door in FrontPage Express back in 1999 when he worked at Microsoft , a back door that was not discovered for three years ( yes , this part of the scenario is based on a true story ) .
The consultant gave you code that did everything you wanted .
The nagging question is , is the code doing a few things on the side that maybe you wish it were n't ?
You are suddenly sensitive to the fact that the one file you hand to his subsystem is the key file for the entire system , and that sometimes it holds proprietary data .
Gulp .
The code he has written is arcane and hard to read .
The guy really is a wizard .
Who knows what he 's hidden there ?
Suddenly you have a dramatic trust realm boundary in the middle of your system .
You inform your team of the problem .
Two of your programmers handle the file on its way to the consultant 's subsystem .
The first programmer knows that the consultant only needs read authority .
So he creates an intermediary file object .
It is a file object because it meets the type specification of a file , but this file object will throw an exception if you try to use the setText function :
let makeReadOnly file = {
getText = file.getText ;
setText = fun text -> raise ( Failure " Read Only " )
}
You use makeReadOnly to manufacture a ReadOnly facet on the file , and send that on to the subsystem .
Whew !
Ok , now the consultant system at least can't corrupt your data .
It still makes you nervous , though , that he can read the file even at times when the file is undergoing proprietary transformations .
Another programmer , who is receiving the readOnly facet and is going to hand it on to the consultant subsystem , runs the readOnly object through another intermediary , a toggleable intermediary :
type on Off = On | Off
let makeToggledFilePair file =
let accessAllowed = ref On in
let toggle setting = accessAllowed := setting in
let toggled File = {
getText = ( fun -> match accessAllowed with
| On -> file.getText ( )
| Off -> raise ( Failure " Access off " ) ;
setText = ( fun text -> match accessAllowed with
| On -> file.setText text
| Off -> raise ( Failure " Access off " )
} in
( toggled File , toggle )
The function makeToggledFilePair , when given a file object , will produce a tuple with 2 parts : the first part is another kind of object that meets the file specification , and the second is a toggle for the file : invoke " toggle On " , and the intermediating object lets requests go through .
Invoke " toggle Off " , and all access is denied .
Now you can ensure that the consultant subsystem has only read authority , when and only when it is supposed to have read authority .
If you look at this example and wonder if the resulting code is not only more secure , but is also more likely to warn you early if there is a bug , the answer is , " Yes , of course . "
Lots of normal bugs will be blocked by implementing principle of least authority security .
Security and reliability are intimately related .
At least , they should be .
If in your world they are not related , you are not using appropriate security techniques .
Conclusion With a Bite
You have now learned how to use software development tools for which strong security claims may be meaningfully analyzed .
You are well on your way to writing new , fast software that will leave the world of crackers staring at your program in frustrated disbelief .
Everyone knows , after all , that the crackers have the programmers on the run .
We are outgunned , outclassed , outmatched , and no one can stop a cracker .
It is time to turn the tables .
You now have the power to do so .
The State of the Onion 10
Welcome to the tenth State of the Perl Onion .
For those of you who are unfamiliar with my methods , this is the annual speech wherein I ramble on about various things that are only marginally related to the state of Perl .
I ’ve gotten pretty good at rambling in my old age .
In the Scientific American that just came out , there ’s an article on chess experts , written by an expert , on what makes experts so expert .
This expert claims that you can become an expert in just about anything if you study it persistently for ten years or so .
So , since this is my tenth State of the Onion , maybe I ’m about to become an expert in giving strange talks .
One can only hope ( not ) .
Speaking of chess , how many of you recognize this ?
Does this help ?
This is , of course , the mnemonic for the old Linnean taxonomy of biological classification .
Those of you who understand computers better than critters can think of these as nested namespaces .
This is all about describing nature , so naturally , different languages care about different levels .
For instance , PHP is n’t much into taxonomy , so everything in PHP is just its own species in a flat namespace .
Congratulations , this is your new species name :
Ruby , of course , is interested primarily in Classes .
Python , as the “ anti- Perl , ” is heavily invested in maintaining Order .
Now , you might be smart enough to program in Haskell if you ’ve received a MacArthur Genus award .
… used to be I could n’t spell “ genus , ” and now I are one …
Moving right along toward the other end of the spectrum , we have JavaScript that kind of believes in Phyla without believing in Classes .
And at the top of the heap , playing king of the mountain , we have languages like C# and Java .
The kingdom of Java only has one species .
The kingdom of C# has many species , but they all look like C# .
Well , that leaves us with families .
I expect I have a pretty good excuse for thinking a lot about families lately , and here is my excuse :
This is Julian , my grandson .
Julian , meet the open source hackers .
Open source hackers , meet Julian .
Many of you will remember my daughter Heidi from previous OSCONs .
A couple years ago she married Andy , and Julian is the result .
I think he ’s a keeper .
Julian , I mean .
Well , and Andy too .
Andy obviously has his priorities straight .
I would certainly recommend him as a son - in - law to anyone .
( Wait , that does n’t quite work …)
There are many definitions of family , of course .
Here ’s a mommy and a daddy truck .
They live on a truck farm , and raise little trucks .
Out in California , the word “ family ” keeps leaping out at me from various signs .
People use the word “ family ” in some really weird ways .
There was a Family Fun Center , with a miniature golf course .
I believe that sign .
At least for the golf .
As a parent , I ’m not sure the game arcade is for the whole family .
I ’m an expert in staying out of loud places .
But the sign that said “ Farmers Feed America– Family Water Alliance ” … I suspect the word “ family ” is in there more for its PR value than anything else .
And , of course , “ family planning ” is for when you plan not to have a family .
Go figure .
All of my kids were unplanned , but that does n’t mean they were unwanted .
Many of you know that I have four kids , but in a strange way , I really have five , if you count Perl .
Geneva thinks of Perl as more or less her twin sister , since they were both born in 1987 .
But then , Geneva is strange .
Some people think Perl is strange too .
That ’s okay–all my kids are a little strange .
They come by it naturally .
Here ’s a self - portrait of the other end of Geneva .
Here ’s what you usually see of Lewis .
Here ’s some of Aron , pulling the door that says “ push . ”
And here ’s Heidi .
She always was a pale child .
Actually , here ’s the real picture .
You can see she ’s actually quite sane .
Compared to the rest of us .
Here ’s a picture of my wife Gloria .
Here ’s another picture of my wife .
Well , her arms .
The feet are my mom’s .
Actually , this is really a picture of my granddog , Milo .
He ’s the one on the right .
I ’ve talked before about how the stages in Perl ’s life are very much like that of a kid .
To review :
This extended metaphor can be extended even further as necessary and prudent .
Actually , it ’s probably unnecessary and imprudent , but I ’ll extend it anyway , because I find the metaphor useful .
Perl , my fifth child , is showing various signs that she is about to grow up , and as a pseudo - parent , that makes me pseudo - proud of her .
But there are other ways the metaphor makes me happy .
For instance , it gives me another argument about the name of Perl 6 .
From time to time , people have suggested that Perl 6 is sufficiently different from Perl 5 that she should be given a new name .
But we do n’t usually rename our kids when they grow up .
They may choose to rename themselves , of course .
For the moment I think Perl would like her name to stay Perl .
Now , I know what some of you are thinking : in anthropomorphizing Perl this way , Larry has gone completely off the deep end .
That ’s not possible –I started out by jumping off the deep end , and I have n’t noticed the water getting any shallower lately .
But in justification of my metaphor , let me just say that when I say “ Perl ” here , I ’m not just talking about the language , but the entire culture .
There are a lot of people who worked hard to raise
Perl up to where she is today , and a bunch more people working hard to send her off to college .
It ’s the collective aspirations of those people that is the real personality of Perl .
When we first announced the Perl 6 effort back in 2000 , we said it would be the community redesign of Perl .
That continues to be the case today .
It may look like I ’m making all these arbitrary decisions as the language designer , but as with a teenager , you somehow end up making most of your decisions consistent with what they want .
With what the Perl community wants , in this case .
If a teenager does n’t want to listen to you , you ca n’t make ‘em .
The fact is , Perl would be nothing without the people around her .
Here ’s a new acronym :
or if you like :
It really helps to have an extended family to raise a kid well .
American culture has been somewhat reductionist in this respect , but a lot of other cultures around the world understand the importance of extended family .
Maybe it ’s just because Americans move around so much .
But it ’s a healthy trend that young people these days are manufacturing their own extended families .
At the church I go to , we call it “ Doing Life Together . ”
Here in the extended Perl family , we ’re doing life together too .
We have people in our family like Uncle Chip and Aunt Audrey .
There ’s Cousin Allison , and Cousin Ingy , and Cousin Uri , and our very own Evil Brother Damian .
I think Randal occasionally enjoys being the honorary black sheep of the family , as it were .
It all kind of reminds me of the Addams family .
Hmm .
I watched The Addams Family a lot when I was young .
Maybe you should call me Gomez , and call Gloria , Morticia .
I must confess that I do love it when my wife speaks French .
It gives me déjà vu all up and down my spine .
It ’s okay for me to tell you that because I live in a fishbowl .
I ’m not sure who gets to be Lurch .
Or Thing .
Anybody wanna volunteer ?
We ’re always looking for volunteers in the Perl community .
Do n’t be scared .
The Addams family can be a little scary , and so can the Perl family , but you ’ll notice we ’re also affectionate and accepting .
In a ghoulish sort of way .
We could take this TV family metaphor a lot further , but fortunately for you I never watched the Partridge Family or The Brady Bunch or All in the Family or Father Knows Best .
Those of you who were here before know I mostly watched The Man From U.N.C.L.E .
I also watched Combat , a World War II show .
But I was kind of a gruesome little kid that way .
I like gruesome shows .
Maybe that explains why I liked the Addams family .
Hmm .
I once sat on the lap of the Santa Claus at Sears and asked for all five toy machine guns listed in the Sears catalog that year .
For some reason I did n’t get any of them .
But I suppose my family loved me in spite of my faults .
My role models in parenting obviously did n’t come from TV .
Or maybe they did .
You know , that would explain a lot about how my family turned out .
In actual fact , the picture above is another self - portrait done by my daughter Geneva .
Anyway , I love my own family , even if they ’re kind of peculiar at times .
Last month we were staying at a Motel 6 in Medford , Oregon .
Gloria kindly went off to fetch me a cup of coffee from the motel lobby , and then she came to this door and stood there for a while wondering how to pull the door open with her hands full .
Then she realized that the door must have been designed by someone who thinks there should be only one obvious way to do it .
Because , the fact is , you can either pull or push this door , despite what it says .
I suggested we should start marking such pushmepullyu doors with a P* .
We obviously need more globs in real life .
Anyway , back to my weird family –this summer as we were driving around , we had a great literary discussion about how Tolstoy debunks the Great Man theory of history in War and Peace .
After discussing the far - too - heavily overloaded namespace in Russian novels and the almost complete absence of names in the Tale of Genji , we tried to decide if the Tale of Genji was the first novel or not , and decided that it was really the first soap opera .
Of course , then there had to be a long discussion of what really was the first novel–Tale of Genji , Madame Bovary , or Sense and Sensibility .
Then there ’s the first romance , first mystery , first fantasy , first science fiction , first modern novel , etc .
One interesting fact we noted was that the first in a genre almost always has to officially be some other genre too .
For example , the Tale of Genji was written in the existing form of explication of some haiku .
Transitional forms are important in biological evolution as well , as one species learns to become another species .
That ’s why we explicitly allow people to program babytalk in Perl .
The only way to become smart is to be stupid first .
Puts a new spin on the Great Man theory of history .
So then , as we were driving we saw a cloud formation resembling Thomas Jefferson , which led us to speculate on the Great Documents theory of history .
“ Liberty , Equality , Fraternity ” brought up the Great Slogans theory of history .
Back to Tolstoy : “ Moscow did n’t burn because Napoleon decided to burn it .
Moscow burned because it was made of wood . ”
Those of you who attended YAPC Chicago may recognize that as the Great Cow theory of history .
Or maybe the lantern was really kicked over by a camel , and there was a coverup .
Anyway , back to the family again , presuming the house has n’t burned down .
They say that “ A family is where , when you have to go there , they have to take you in . ”
Arguably , regardless of your viewpoint , many people have been , um , taken in by Perl culture .
Sorry .
I have a low taste for taking people in with puns .
But hey , taking people in is good .
And stray kitties .
Some families just naturally accumulate strays .
My wife and I were both fortunate enough to grow up in families that took in strays as a matter of course .
We have a number of honorary members of our own family .
I think a good family tends to Borg people who need to be taken in .
It ’s a lot like the way Audrey hands out commit bits to Pugs left and right .
It all one big happy hivemind .
Er , I mean family .
Now , it ’s all well and good to get people in the door , but that ’s only the beginning of accessibility .
Whenever you get someone new in the family , either by birth or by adoption , where do you go from there ?
You have to raise your kids somehow , and they ’re all different .
Raising different kids requires different approaches , just like computer problems do .
So , then , how do we raise a family according to the various computing paradigms ?
Imperative programming is the Father Knows Best approach .
It only works at all when Father does know best , which is not all that often .
Often Mother knows “ bester ” than Father .
Hi , Gloria .
And a surprising amount of the time , it ’s the kids who know “ bestest . ”
For some reason the Von Trapp family comes to mind .
I guess you have to structure your family to make the Sound of Music together .
“ Look , if you hit your sister , she will hit you back .
Duh . ”
Obviously anyone who does n’t program their family functionally has a dysfunctional family .
But what does it mean to have a functional family ?
“ Being hit back is a function of whether you hit your sister . ”
On the surface , everything appears to be free of side effects .
Certainly when I tell my kids to mind their manners it often seems to have no lasting effect .
Really , though , it does , but in the typical family , there ’s a lot of hidden state change wound in the call stack .
We first learn lazy evaluation in the family .
“ Do n’t take the last piece of candy unless you really want it . ”
“ Please define whether you really care , and exactly how much you care . ”
“ I ’m sure I care more than you do . ”
That ’s almost a direct quote from Heidi when she was young : “ But I want it more than you do . ”
Functional programming tends to merge into declarative programming in general .
I married into a family where you have to declare whether you want the last piece of cheesecake , or you ’re unlikely to get it .
Unfortunately , I grew up in more of a culture where it was everyone ’s responsibility to let someone else have the cheesecake .
This algorithm did not always terminate .
After several rounds of , “ No , you go ahead and take it , no you take it , no you take it … ”
In the end , nobody was really sure who wanted the cheesecake .
I guess you say it was a form of starvation .
But when I married into my wife ’s family I found out that I definitely would n’t get the cheesecake until I learned to predeclare .
Let ’s see , inheritance is obviously important , or you would n’t have a family in the first place .
On the other hand , the family is where culture is handed down in the form of design patterns .
A good model of composition is important–a lot of the work of being a family consists of just trying to stay in one spot together .
As a form of composition , we learn how to combine our traits constructively by playing various roles in the family .
Sometimes those are fixed roles built at family composition time , and sometimes those are temporary roles that are mixed in at run time .
Delegation is also important .
I frequently delegate to my sons : “ Lewis , take the trash out . ”
That ’s Design By Contract .
“ Keep your promises , young man ! ”
Metaprogramming .
“ Takes one to know one ! ”
Aspected - oriented programming comes up when we teach our kids to evaluate their methods in the broader context of society :
“ Okay kid , now that you ’ve passed your driver ’s test , you still have to believe the stop signs , but when the speed limit sign says 65 , what it really means is that you should try to keep it under 70 .
Or when you ’re in Los Angeles , under 80 . ”
But I think the basic Perl paradigm is “ Whatever - oriented programming . ”
Your kid comes to you and says , “ Can I borrow the car ? ”
You say : “ May I borrow the car ? ”
They say : “ Whatever … ”
Should I push the door or pull it ?
Actually , “ whatever ” is such an important concept that we built it into Perl 6 .
This is read , “ from one to whatever . ”
You might ask why we ca n’t just say “ from one to infinity ” :
The problem is that not all operators operate on numbers :
Not all operators are ranges .
Here ’s the sibling argument operator , which repeats the same words an arbitrary number of times :
Perl has always been about letting you care about the things you want to care about , while not caring about the things you do n’t want to care about , or that maybe you ’re not quite ready to care about yet .
That ’s how Perl achieves both its accessibility and its power .
We ’ve just baked more of that “ who cares ? ” philosophy into Perl 6 .
A couple of years ago , Tim O’Reilly asked me what great problem Perl 6 was being designed to solve .
This question always just sat in my brain sideways because , apart from Perl 0 , I have never thought of Perl as the solution to any one particular problem .
If there ’s a particular problem that Perl is trying to solve , it ’s the basic fact that all programming languages suck .
Sort of the concept of original sin , applied to programming languages .
As parents , to the extent that we can influence the design of our kids , we design our kids to be creative , not to solve a particular problem .
About as close as we get to that is to hope the kid takes over the family business , and we all know how often that sort of coercion works .
No , instead , we design our kids to be ready to solve problems , by helping them learn to be creative , to be socially aware , to know how to use tools , and maybe even how to manufacture the tools for living when they ’re missing .
They should be prepared to do … whatever .
Trouble is , it takes a long time to make an adult , on the order of 20 years .
Most insects do n’t take 20 years to mature .
Apparently it takes you ten years to become an expert in being a kid , and then another ten years to become an expert in not being a kid .
Some people never manage the second part at all , or have a strange idea of adulthood .
Some people think that adulthood is when you just bake all your learning into hardware and do n’t learn anything new ever again , except maybe a few baseball scores .
That ’s an oversimplified view of reality , much like building a hardwired Lisp machine .
Neoteny is good in moderation .
We have to be lifelong learners to really be adults , I think .
No , adulthood is really more about mature judgment .
I think an adult is basically someone who knows when to care , and how to figure out when they should care when they do n’t know offhand .
A teenager is forever caring about things the parents think are unimportant , and not caring about things the parents think are important .
Well , hopefully not forever .
That ’s the point .
But it ’s certainly a long process , with both kids and programming languages .
In computer science , it is said that premature optimization is the root of all evil .
The same is true in the family .
In parenting terms , you pick your battlefields , and learn not to care so much about secondary objectives .
If you ca n’t modulate what you care about , you ’re not really ready to parent a teenager .
Teenagers have a way of finding your hot buttons and pushing them just to distract you from the important issues .
So , do n’t get distracted .
There are elements of the Perl community that like to push our collective hot buttons .
Most of them go by the first name of Anonymous , because they do n’t really want to stand up for their own opinions .
The naysayers could even be right : we may certainly fail in what we ’re trying to do with Perl 6 , but I ’d just like to point out that only those people who put their name behind their opinions are allowed to say “ I told you so . ”
Anonymous cowards like the “ told you so ” part as long as it does n’t include the “ I . ” Anonymous cowards do n’t have an “ I , ” by definition .
Anyway , do n’t let the teenage trolls distract you from the real issues .
As parents we ’re setting up some minimum expectations for civilized behavior .
Perl should have good manners by default .
Perl should be wary of strangers .
But Perl should be helpful to strangers .
While we ’re working on their weaknesses , we also have to encourage our kids to develop where they have strengths , even if that makes them not like everyone else .
It ’s okay to be a little weird .
Every kid is different .
At least , all my kids are really different .
From each other , I mean .
Well , and the other way too .
I guess my kids are all alike in one way .
None of them is biddable .
They ’re all arguers and will happily debate the merits of any idea presented to them whether it needs further discussion or not .
They ’re certainly unlikely to simply wander off to the slaughter with any stranger that suggests it .
This is the natural result of letting them fight as siblings , with supervision .
It ’s inevitable that siblings will squabble .
Your job as parent is to make sure they fight fair .
It helps a lot if the parents have already learned how to fight fair .
What I mean by fight fair is that you fight about what you ’re fighting about –you do n’t fight the other person .
If you find yourself dragging all sorts of old baggage into an argument , then you ’re fighting the person , you ’re not fighting about something anymore .
Nothing makes me happier as a parent than to hear one of my kids make a logical argument at the same time as they ’re completely pissed off .
If you teach your kids to argue effectively , they ’ll be resistant to peer pressure .
You ca n’t be too careful here .
There are a lotta computer languages out there doing drugs .
As a parent , you do n’t get into a barricade situation and isolate your kids from the outside world forever .
Moving out and building other relationships is a natural process , but it needs some supervision .
Perl is learning to care deeply about things like :
This final point is crucial , if you want to understand the state of Perl today .
Perl 6 is all about reconciling the supposedly irreconcilable .
Reconciling the seemingly irreconcilable is part of why Perl 6 taking so long .
We want to understand the various tensions that have surfaced as people have tried to use and extend Perl 5 .
In fact , just as Perl 1 was an attempt to digest Unix Culture down into something more coherent , you can view Perl 6 as an attempt to digest CPAN down into something more coherent .
Here are some of the irreconcilables we run into when we do that :
OO brings us a world of choices :
Do we even have classes at all ?
And if we do , how do they inherit and dispatch ?
Is our type system more general than our class system ?
Plus a grab bag of other issues :
And finally , the biggie :
Reconciling these known conflicts is all well and good , but our goal as a parent must be a bit larger than that .
Just as a child that leaves the house today will face unpredictable challenges tomorrow , the programming languages of the future will have to reconcile not only the conflicting ideas we know about today , but also the conflicting ideas that we have n’t even thought of yet .
We do n’t know how to do that .
Nobody knows how to do that , because nobody is smart enough .
Some people pretend to be smart enough .
That ’s not something I care about .
Nevertheless , a lot of smart people are really excited about Perl 6 because , as we go about teaching Perl how to reconcile the current crop of irreconcilables , we ’re also hoping to teach Perl strategies for how to cope with future irreconcilables .
It ’s our vision that Perl can learn to care about what future generations will care about , and not to care about what they do n’t care about .
That ’s pretty abstruse , I ’ll admit .
Future - proofing your children is hard .
Some of us get excited by the long - term potential of our kids .
But it ’s also exciting when you see their day - to - day progress .
And we ’ve make a lot of progress recently .
In terms of Audrey ’s Perl 6 timeline , we ’re right at that spot where it says “ hack , hack , hack . ”
In a year or so we ’ll be up here saying , “ What ’s the big deal ? ”
This is the year that Perl 6 will finally be bootstrapped in Perl 6 , one way or another .
Actually , make that one way and another .
There are several approaches being pursued currently , in a kind of flooding algorithm .
One or another of those approaches is bound to work eventually .
Now , anyone who has been following along at home knows that we never , ever promise a delivery date for Perl 6 .
Nevertheless , I can point out that many of us hope to have most of a Perl 6 parser written in Perl 6 by this Christmas .
The only big question is which VM it will compile down to first .
There ’s a bit of a friendly race between the different implementations , but that ’s healthy , since they ’re all aiming to support the same language .
So one of the exciting things that happened very recently is that the Pugs test suite was freed from its Haskell implementation and made available for all the other implementations to test against .
There are already roughly 12,000 tests in the test suite , with more coming every day .
The Haskell implementation is , of course , the furthest along in terms of passing tests , but the other approaches are already starting to pass the various basic sanity tests , and as many of you know , getting the first test to pass is already a large part of the work .
So the plan is for Perl 6 to run consistently on a number of platforms .
We suspect that eventually the Parrot platform is likely to be the most efficient way to run Perl 6 , and may well be the best way to achieve interoperability with other dynamic languages , especially if Parrot can be embedded whole in other platforms .
But the other virtual machines out there each have their own advantages .
The Haskell implementation may well turn out to be the most acceptable to academia , and the best reference implementation for semantics , since Haskell is so picky .
JavaScript is already ubiquitous in the browsers .
There are various ideas for how to host Perl 6 on top of other VMs as well .
Whatever .
But the VM that works the best for Perl right now is , in fact , Perl 5 .
We ’ve already bootstrapped much of a Perl 5 compiler for Perl 6 .
Here ’s a picture of the approach of layering Perl 6 on Perl 5 .
Here in the middle we have the Great Moose theory of history .
Other stuff that ’s going on :
In addition to lots of testing and documentation projects , I ’m very happy that Sage La Torra is working on a P5 - to - P6 translator for the Google Summer of Code .
Soon we ’ll be able to take Perl 5 code , translate it to Perl 6 , and then translate it back to Perl 5 to see how well we did .
Another bootstrapping approach is to take our current Haskell codebase and translate to Perl 6 .
That could be very important long term in keeping all the various implementations in sync .
There are many , many other exciting things going on all the time .
Hang out on the mailing lists and on the IRC channels to find out more .
If you care .
Perl is growing up , but she ’s doing so in a healthy way , I think .
Those of us who are parents tend to try to discourage our kids from getting married too young , because we know how much people change around their twentieth year .
Around the age of 19 or 20 is when we start that last major rewiring of our brains to become adults .
This year , Perl will be 19 going on 20 .
She ’s due for a brain rewiring .
In previous years , Perl was just trying to act grownup by ignoring her past .
This year , I ’m happy to report that instead of just trying to act grownup , Perl is going back and reintegrating her personality to include the positive aspects of childhood and adolescence .
I do n’t know where Perl will go in the next ten or twenty years .
It ’s my job to say , “ I do n’t care anymore , ” and kick her out of the house .
She ’s a big girl now , and she ’s becoming graceful and smart and wise , and she can just decide her future for herself .
Whatever .
Thanks for listening , and for learning to care , and for learning to not care .
Have a great conference !
I do n’t care how !
There are a couple of reasons why Amazon grew to dominate the e-book market early in the game .
First , the store ’s selection is first - rate .
A ton of content is key .
But the real brilliance on the part of Amazon was the way the store tied into the Kindle Reader .
Buy a book online and the Amazon website makes it very easy to pop that new book onto a Kindle compatible reading device .
It does n’t matter if that reading devices is a Kindle branded reader , iPad , iPhone , Android device , or even a laptop / desktop Mac or PC .
Just click the buy button on Amazon.com and select your destination device ( assuming you have more than one device registered in your Amazon account ) .
Amazon ’s backend infrastructure takes care of the rest .
Just buy the book and start reading … very easy .
But what if you buy a book from Smashwords or you download it directly from an author ’s website ?
If that book was n’t purchased through the Amazon store , getting it onto your device suddenly becomes a lot less intuitive .
Actually , it can be a down right painful experience …
Until you know the tricks .
But there is good news .
There are a number of ways to get those books onto your Kindle compatible device .
Since Kindle compatible books can be read on actual Kindle branded devices such as the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Fire , as well as all of Apple ’s iOS based devices : iPhone , iPod Touch , iPad , and just about every Android based device ever produced , the method for manually moving a book onto each gadget differs depending on the device in question .
We ’re going to cover some of the most common devices and their associated options .
The traditional gold standard has always been drag & drop over a USB connection , so we ’ll start there .
But Amazon has built some powerful backend infrastructure that can be leveraged , allowing you to drop a new book on your Kindle from just about anywhere at any time .
We ’ll take a closer look at everything you need to know .
My favorite method of the three involves a cool utility for Mac and PC computers called Send To Kindle .
Once you install it and set it up , it ’s just about the easiest of the three methods that I cover .
Since it builds on the infrastructure that Amazon has built to support the Kindle and Kindle compatible devices , I ’ve left it for last .
That said , this method is my favorite and worth considering when you select the option best suited for your needs .
Good Old Fashioned Drag & Drop :
Devices built by Amazon such as the original Kindle Readers , the Kindle Paperwhite , and even the Kindle Fire make it relatively easily to move a book to a device .
Just plug the device into your computer using the USB cable that came with the device .
The Kindle ’s internal storage should appear on your Mac or PC as if it were a USB flash drive .
Just browse to the drive and open it .
Look for a folder called Documents .
Toss your .mobi file in there and then eject / dismount the Kindle drive .
The next time you look at the list of books on your device , the new book should be a part of your catalog .
The Power of Your Amazon Account :
Just because you did n’t buy your book through Amazon.com does n’t mean you ca n’t leverage Amazon ’s system to move that book onto any device that has been linked to your Amazon account .
It ’s a little known fact that any device running the Kindle software already has an intimate relationship with Amazon .
As soon as you launch the Kindle software on a device for the first time ( Kindle , Kindle Fire , iPad , iPod Touch , iPhone , Android phone , Android tablet , Mac , or PC ) , the software makes you login to your Amazon account .
When you supply your Amazon username and password , that device is registered , or attached , to your Amazon account .
And you can use that to help move non-Amazon books to your Kindle compatible reader .
Every device that is registered to an Amazon account is assigned a unique email address , automatically .
Let me take a moment to explain exactly what that means .
The device receives its own email address .
Just like you have an email address that you use to communicate with friends , your Kindle Reader is issued its own unique email address by Amazon .
You can use that email address to send books directly to your device via email .
Once you know the email address of your Kindle device , simply create a new message using your normal email client ( Gmail , Yahoo Mail , Apple Mail , Outlook , Outlook Express , Windows Live Mail ) .
Enter the email address of your Kindle device in the To field of the outgoing message .
Put anything you want in the subject line .
But in the body of the message , add your .mobi formatted e-book as an attachment .
As long as the file is a .mobi formatted file and the file is not compressed , as soon as you click send , the message goes off to Amazon ’s servers .
Minutes later that book will appear on the intended device .
It ’s that easy !
There are just a few additional notes to keep in mind .
First , you need to know the email address that Amazon automatically assigned to your device .
Plus , if you have more than one Kindle compatible device registered on your Amazon account , you need to keep track of the email address belonging to each device .
Finding the right email address is easy .
You just need to know where to look on the Amazon web site .
Start by going to Amazon.com and clicking on the Your Account link at the top right side of any given page .
Then scroll down the page and look for a link called Manage Your Kindle .
It ’s located in the Digital Content area near the bottom of the page .
If you ’re not already logged into your Amazon account , you ’ll be prompted to enter your username and password once you click this link .
If you ’re not asked to login , you must already be logged in .
Just keep going .
The page you land on should be titled Your Kindle Library .
This page likely has a list of every book you ’ve purchased through Amazon using this account .
Look for the list of links down the left side of the page .
Click on Manage Your Devices under Your Kindle Account about halfway down the page .
This will show you every device that has been linked to your account .
If you ’re like me , it ’s a long list .
But I ’m a geek .
I have a lot of gadgets .
Odds are good that you have only one or two devices .
When you select your device from the list , the page will show you the email address that was automatically assigned to it .
It will likely be someting@kindle.com , or at least something very similar .
That ’s the address you want to make note of .
That ’s the address you ’ll be emailing your books to if you want to let Amazon ’s servers pop the book onto your reader for you .
There ’s another consideration worth mentioning .
You might be wondering why you do n’t get spam emails on your device if each one has an email address linked to it .
Amazon only allows certain email addresses to send messages to these special email accounts .
By default , the email address you use as part of your Amazon.com login is allowed to send documents to any device registered to your account .
For most people , this will be the account they would be emailing from anyway , so it ’s not even a concern .
But if you ’re like me and have more than one email address that you use on a regular basis , you might want to register those additional addresses with your account so they will have permission to send books to your devices .
That way you do n’t have to worry about remembering to email a book only from the correct email account .
To add email addresses that are authorized to send to your Kindle device , or just to double - check which of your email addresses are currently allowed to send to your devices , return to the Your Kindle Library page as described above .
Click the Personal Document Settings link on the left side of the page ( about half way down the page under Your Kindle Account ) .
Scroll down the resulting page and look at the section titled Approved Personal Document E-mail List .
Email addresses listed here are allowed to send books to any device attached to the account .
If you want to add additional addresses , add them here .
There ’s one more thing to note while you ’re on this page .
Look up one section on the page at the heading called Whispernet Delivery Options .
If you have a Kindle branded device that incorporates a 3G modem , you might be charged for sending books to your devices via this method .
Please note that this is only an issue if the target device is connected to a cellular service when the document is transferred .
If that device is instead connected to wi-fi at the time , there is no charge since the content will be delivered over the wi-fi connection .
This is really only a concern for the older Kindle branded devices that incorporated an internal cellular chipset .
The majority of Kindle compatible devices connect to the internet via wi-fi .
Devices such as iPhone , iPad , and Android phones will receive the incoming data through whatever service is connecting them to the internet and there will not be any additional charge from Amazon .
The note in this area of the Amazon page makes an attempt to explain the rare case where a charge would be involved .
It is not a factor that will affect most users .
Send to Kindle :
Amazon offers a handy tool that you can install on your Mac or Windows PC .
Once you install this application and provide it the login information for your Amazon account , it will allow you to send documents to your Kindle devices without sending an email or mounting your device using USB .
Just launch the application on the computer , select the .mobi file to transfer , then select the device you want the book delivered to .
Click send and you ’re done .
It might take a minute or two for the book to actually land on the destination device , but it does n’t get much easier than that !
Modern Devices :
More cutting edge devices like the iPad , iPhone , and just about all Android based devices have another option worth mentioning .
Assuming you already use the device to check some kind of email account , you could simply email the .mobi file to the email account you access from that device .
When you view the message on the device , you should be able to see the .mobi file as an attachment .
When you tap to open it , the software should ask you what app you want to use to read the file .
Just select the Kindle app and the .mobi file should be added to your library , automatically .
Miscellaneous :
In truth , there are other ways to move that .mobi file to different devices .
Many of them support shared drive services such as Dropbox , Box.com , and Google Drive .
If you store new books on one of these shared drives and access it from your mobile device , most of them will require the you to select the app you want to use to open the file .
Just like in the case above , selecting the Kindle app should automatically make the book a part of the local Kindle library .
These are just a few of they methods for sideloading content onto a Kindle compatible device .
Above all else , make sure the file being sent is in .mobi format .
If it ’s not , the Kindle app wo n’t be able to read it .
If you have a .epub file , the Kindle app ca n’t read it .
There are other apps out there for reading .epub .
They are not difficult to find .
And , if you ’re looking to load your book into iBooks on an Apple iOS based device , that ’s a subject we ’ll cover in a future post .

U.S. Special Forces teams sent overseas on secret spying missions have clashed with the CIA and carried out operations in countries that are staunch U.S. allies , prompting a new effort by the agency and the Pentagon to tighten the rules for military units engaged in espionage , according to senior U.S. intelligence and military officials .
The spy missions are part of a highly classified program that officials say has better positioned the United States to track terrorist networks and capture or kill enemy operatives in regions such as the Horn of Africa , where weak governments are unable to respond to emerging threats .
But the initiative has also led to several embarrassing incidents for the United States , including a shootout in Paraguay and the exposure of a sensitive intelligence operation in East Africa , according to current and former officials familiar with the matter .
And to date , the effort has not led to the capture of a significant terrorism suspect .
Some intelligence officials have complained that Special Forces teams have sometimes launched missions without informing the CIA , duplicating or even jeopardizing existing operations .
And they questioned deploying military teams in friendly nations -- including in Europe -- at a time when combat units are in short supply in war zones .

The program was approved by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks , and is expected to get close scrutiny by his successor , Robert M. Gates , who takes over today and has been critical of the expansion of the military ’s intelligence operations .
Senior officials at the CIA and the Pentagon defended the program and said they would urge Gates to support it .
But they acknowledged risks for the United States in its growing reliance on Special Forces troops and other military units for espionage .
“ We are at war out there and frankly we need all the help that we can get , ” said Marine Maj .
Gen. Michael E. Ennis , who since February has served as a senior CIA official in charge of coordinating human intelligence operations with the military .
“ But at the same time we have to be very careful that we do n’t disrupt established relationships with other governments , with their liaison services , or [ do ] anything that would embarrass the United States . ”
Ennis acknowledged “ really egregious mistakes ” in the program , but said collaboration had improved between the CIA and the military .

“ What we are seeing now , primarily , are coordination problems , ” Ennis said in an interview with The Times .
“ And really , they are fewer and fewer . ”
The issue underscores the sensitivity of using elite combat forces for espionage missions that have traditionally been the domain of the CIA .
After Sept. 11 , the Bush administration gave expanded authority to the Special Operations Command , which oversees the Army Green Berets , Navy SEALs and other elite units , in the fight against terrorism .
At the same time , Rumsfeld , who lacked confidence in the CIA , directed a major expansion of the military ’s involvement in intelligence gathering to make the Pentagon less dependent on the agency .
Officials said this led to the secret deployment of small teams of Special Forces troops , known as military liaison elements , or MLEs , to American embassies to serve as intelligence operatives .
Members of the teams undergo special training in espionage at Ft. Bragg and other facilities , according to officials familiar with the program .

The troops typically work in civilian clothes and function much like CIA case officers , cultivating sources in other governments or Islamic organizations .
One objective , officials said , is to generate information that could be used to plan clandestine operations such as capturing or killing terrorism suspects .
Ennis said MLE missions were “ low level ” compared with those of the CIA .
“ The MLEs may come and go , ” he said , “ but the CIA presence is there for the long term . ”
In a written response to questions from The Times , a spokesman for the Special Operations Command in Tampa , Fla. , described MLEs as “ individuals or small teams that deploy in support of ( regional military commanders ) in select countries , and always with the U.S. ambassador and country team ’s concurrence and support . ”
But critics point to a series of incidents in recent years that have caused diplomatic problems for the United States .

In 2004 , members of an MLE team operating in Paraguay shot and killed an armed assailant who tried to rob them outside a bar , said former intelligence officials familiar with the incident .
U.S. officials removed the members of the team from the country , the officials said .
In another incident , members of a team in East Africa were arrested by the local government after their espionage activity was discovered .
“ It was a compromised surveillance activity , ” said a former senior CIA official familiar with the incident .
The official said members of the unit “ got rolled up by locals and we got them out . ”
The former official declined to name the country or provide other details .
He said it was an isolated example of an operation that was exposed , but that coordination problems were frequent .

“ They ’re pretty freewheeling , ” the former CIA official said of the military teams .
He said that it was not uncommon for CIA station chiefs to learn of military intelligence operations only after they were underway , and that many conflicted with existing operations being carried out by the CIA or the foreign country ’s intelligence service .
Such problems “ really are quite costly , ” said John Brennan , former director of the National Counterterrorism Center .
“ It can cost peoples ’ lives , can cost sensitive programs and can set back foreign policy interests . ”
Brennan declined to comment on specific incidents .
There have also been questions about where teams have been sent .
Although conceived to bolster the U.S. presence in global trouble spots , the units have carried out operations in friendly nations in Europe and Southeast Asia where it is more difficult to justify , officials said .

On at least one occasion , a team tracked an Islamic militant in Europe .
“ They were trying to acquire certain information about a certain individual , ” said a former high - ranking U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The official declined to name the country , but said it was a NATO ally and that the host government was unaware of the mission .
Critics said such operations risked angering U.S. allies with a dubious prospect for payoff .
In some countries where MLE teams are located , “ There ’s not a chance ... we ’re going to send somebody in there to snatch somebody unilaterally , ” said a government official who is familiar with the program .
At a time when the military is stretched thin , the official questioned the priority of using Special Forces for espionage , noting that the MLE program has not produced a significant success in terms of disrupting a plot or capturing a terrorist suspect .
“ These are a highly trained , short - supply resource of the U.S. government , ” the official said .
“ What ... are they doing there instead of Pakistan or Afghanistan ? ”

Gates , the former director of the CIA who is to run the Pentagon , has voiced concern over the military ’s encroachment on CIA missions .
In an opinion piece published this year , Gates said that “ more than a few CIA veterans , including me , are unhappy about the dominance of the Defense Dept. in the intelligence arena and the decline in the CIA ’s central role . ”
In response to such conflicts , the Bush administration previously designated the CIA director as the head of all U.S. human spying operations overseas , with CIA station chiefs serving as coordinators in specific countries .
Ennis , whose position at the CIA was created last year , said the agency and the Pentagon were developing a more rigorous system for screening proposed military intelligence operations .
“ Like a pilot with a checklist , ” CIA station chiefs will be required to sign off on all aspects of a proposed military intelligence operation before it is allowed to proceed , Ennis said .
The CIA station chief , he added , “ would look at the risk in terms of embarrassment to the government .
Do they have the right level of training to do what they claim that they want to do , and is this already being done somewhere else ? ”

Col .
Samuel Taylor , director of public affairs for the Special Operations Command , dismissed the suggestion of coordination problems with other agencies , saying , “ We have an excellent , effective and productive working relationship with the CIA . ”

Admit it .
Queen 's Greatest
Hits is in your record collection , is n't it ?
If not then you are bucking convention as today it is named the best selling album of all time .
Researchers at the Official UK Charts Company have produced a list which , oddly , has never been compiled before - the top 100 best - sold albums in the UK .
And the Queen album , which is often stored in the car glove compartment if anecdotal evidence is to be believed , comes an easy first , selling 5,407,587 copies , ahead of The Beatles ' Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , with 4,803,292 , and Oasis 's What 's The Story Morning Glory , selling 4,304,504 .
Queen 's Brian May said : " I 'm really pleased - it did make me sit up and take notice .
I thought it would have been Sgt Pepper .
It is incredible how the appeal does seem to have broadened as well .
In the audience for the musical there is a big age range and the kids know all the words to the songs . "
May said he regularly checked out the Queen musical We Will Rock You , playing in London .
" I was in there last night and there was standing room only . "
To arrive at the list four researchers trawled through sales figures covering the past 50 years , even going back to 1950s Woolworth 's till receipts .
Surprisingly the Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , Sting , and the Sex Pistols are not on the list .
Jason Donovan is there , though just , at 100 , with 10 Good Reasons .
At 93 is Terence Trent D'Arby 's debut album .
And perhaps 2,336,086 people should today be hanging their heads in shame , for putting Robson & Jerome 's eponymous album in the chart at number 43 .
One of the biggest winners is Robbie Williams , who has six albums on the list at numbers 30 , 49 , 51 , 58 , 60 and 61 , after only a decade as a solo artist .
John Kearns , producer of the music channel VH1 , which presents the list this Saturday , admitted there were a lot of music lists around , but added : " The beauty of this is it 's a real list based on what the public buy - this is totally based on sales .
Very often you 'll watch the TV and you 've got people like myself giving opinions , but this is about people parting with their cash . "
He said there were surprises " but in a way Queen makes sense , they 're one of the most exciting bands ever " .
The list also shines a light on the money to be made from musical soundtracks .
The War of the Worlds is number 35 , The Sound of Music is 36 , and Grease is 39 .

Jaberón - amalando noemas ...
Esta es una versión personal en castellano argentino de Jabberwocky , el famoso poema nonsense de Lewis Carroll en A Través del Espejo y lo que Alicia Encontró allí .
Lo hice en endecasílabos y con rima .
No traté de traducir los vocablos nonsense respetando los sentidos evocados , sino hacer una adaptación castellanizada de los términos en el inglés de Carroll .
' Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
All mimsy were the borogoves , And the mome raths outgrave .
Brillisaba , y los tovos frixalosos
En la guaba girsaban y gimblaban : Estaban los borgovios mimasosos , Y el momio rafalugas arragraba .
" Beware the Jabberwock , my son !
The jaws that bite , the claws that catch !
Beware the Jubjub bird , and shun The frumious Bandersnatch . "
" ¡ Che , pibe , guarda con el Jaberón !
¡ Que te quiere cachar , te va a lastrar !
Ojito al ave Jubojú , y rajá Del frámido y frumioso Bandernón . "

Un cacho el fero mánjico mispió -- Torró por los arbustos Tuntumanos Y un toque , contemplando , él esperó .
And , as in uffish thought he stood , The Jabberwock , with eyes of flame , Came whiffling through the tulgey wood , And burbled as it came !
Mientras pensaba , en úfido reposo , El Jaberón , con ojos como lava , Resoflando cruzó el bosque tulgoso , ¡Y al tiempo que venía borbellaba !
One , two !
One , two !
And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker - snack !
He left it dead , and with its head
He went galumphing back .
¡ Uno , dos !
¡ Uno , dos !
Y más y más ¡ El filo vorpalino hizo tris , tras !
Muerto lo abandonó , y con su cabeza , Regresó , galompando , así nomás .
" And hast thou slain the Jabberwock ?
Come to my arms , my beamish boy !
O frabjous day !
Calloh ! Callay ! "
He chortled in his joy .
" ¿Y , entonces , lo mataste al Jaberón ?
¡ Dáme un abrazo , pibe , sos un groso !
¡ Qué día frabuyón !
¡ Redón ! ¡ Redón ! " Murmuraba entre risas , en su gozo .
' Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
All mimsy were the borogoves , And the mome raths outgrave .
Brillisaba , y los tovos frixalosos
En la guaba girsaban y gimblaban : Estaban los borgovios mimasosos , Y el momio rafalugas arragraba .

( And if you notice any errors in this article , please -- keep them to yourself . )
WASHINGTON , Sept. 12 , 2006  -- Earl Devaney , the inspector general of the Department of the Interior , will give a blunt assessment of the level of ethics there in testimony to be presented to a congressional subcommittee Wednesday .
" Simply stated , short of a crime , anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of the Interior , " Devaney will tell the subcommittee , according to an advance copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News .
Devaney was asked to investigate a controversy that 's been brewing on Capitol Hill for months over what critics call a giant giveaway to the major oil companies .
The giveaway , according to the critics , stems from leases issued by the government to oil companies in the late 1990s that exempted them from paying royalties on deepwater drilling , regardless of how much profit they ultimately reaped from that exploration .
The issue has taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the recent discovery of huge new oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico .
The federal government could lose more than a billion dollars in royalty payments from this new source alone .
Over the long term , the leases could cost the government as much as $ 20 billion , according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office .
Devaney did not find evidence of outright collusion between Interior Department officials and oil companies over the leases in question -- writing that " we do not have a ' smoking gun . ' "
Instead , he blames the leases on " bureaucratic bungling , " calling it a " very costly mistake which might never have been aired publicly absent The New York Times , " and inquiries by Congress .
The Times first reported the omission of price thresholds in the leases .
But Devaney 's overall indictment of the department 's practices is stinging .
" Over the course of this seven - year tenure , I have observed one instance after another when the good work of my office has been dynamically disregarded by the department , " he writes in his testimony .
" Ethics failures on the part of senior department officials , taking the form of appearances of impropriety , favoritism and bias have been routinely dismissed with a promise ' not to do it again . ' "
Devaney says previous reports of his that have chronicled such things as complex efforts to hide the true nature of agreements with outside parties , massive project collapses and bonuses awarded to the very people whose programs had failed were met with " vehement challenges " to the quality of his work .
He also describes high - level officials -- political appointees -- who were forced to leave after investigations into poor judgment or misconduct who were nevertheless sent off " with a party paying tribute to their good service . "
It is not a partisan indictment , because the problems Devaney cites occurred under both Democratic and Republican administrations .
The controversial leases were issued during the Clinton administration , but Devaney also mentions how disappointed he was when former Interior Secretary Gale Norton , a Bush appointee , failed to take action against one high - level official .
Still , he says he is hopeful things may change under new Secretary Dirk Kempthorne .
Ledley King is the latest high profile English footballer who has broken a metatarsal in his foot .
This season England stars , Ledley King , Michael Owen and Ashley Cole have all fallen foul to the same injury .
Reminding me of the 2002 World Cup preparation , where David Beckham , Danny Murphy , Gary Neville and Trevor Sinclair all injured their metatarsals .
Oh , and do n’t forget Wayne Rooney broke his in the Euro 2004 and Stephen Gerrard shortly after it .
That ’s nine English players off of the top of my head .
What is the Metatarsal ?
They are the five long bones at the front of your feet .
They help share the load of the body and adjust to cope with uneven ground .
Bladed Football Boots
The reason that bladed football boots have come under attack , is due to the regularity of this type of injury of late , which coincides with the introduction of the bladed football boot .
Bladed football boots have also been banned by some clubs , Manchester United being one of them .
Prior to 2002 , I did n’t even know I had a metatarsal , let alone 10 of them .
Nowadays , any football follower will now be familiar with the term metatarsal .
So back to the blade .
There are two main reasons that a bladed football boot can be held responsible for the injury .
1 . The thin blades on the soles can penetrate through a football boot .
Due to it ’s blade like feature , if on impact it hits the metatarsal this breaks the bone .
2 . Due to the rigidity of the boot with the blade deep in the ground , bladed football boots do not have ‘ give ’ in them when turning .
When twisting , the metatarsal can be put under extreme pressure when the football boot is fixed and ultimately can break .
This website is not going to be able to protect our delicate stars for the forthcoming World Cup , but do n’t you agree that something needs to be done , for England ’s sake ?
Gardasil , the new vaccine against human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -- which causes cervical cancer and genital warts -- is now available nationwide .
Here is what you need to know now about this new vaccine .
1 . What is Gardasil ?
Gardasil is a vaccine , licensed for use in June 2006 , by the FDA .
It targets four strains of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -- HPV - 6 , 11 , 16 , and 18 .
HPV - 16 and HPV - 18 account for about 70 % of all cervical cancers .
HPV - 6 and - 11 cause about 90 % of genital warts .
HPV is also linked to anal cancer .
2 . How does HPV spread ?
Sexual activity spreads the virus , a very common one .
It 's one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) in the country , according to the CDC , with more than 20 million people currently infected and another 6.2 million contracting the virus each year .
About half of those with HPV are aged 15 to 24 .
Surveys suggest 3.7 % of U.S. girls have sex by age 13 , and 62.4 % have had sex by the 12th grade .
3 . Who should get the vaccine ?
Gardasil is approved by the FDA for girls and women ages 9 to 26 .
The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that the vaccine be given routinely to girls at age 11 to 12 years old , although doctors may choose to vaccinate girls as young as 9 .
The CDC also recommends the vaccine for women age 13 to 26 who did not receive the vaccine at an earlier age .
However , if a girl or woman is already infected with HPV , the vaccine will not prevent that strain of HPV from causing disease .
It will protect against new infections with other strains of HPV included in the vaccine .
The vaccine is also being studied in women up to age 45 , although that group may be targeted for the vaccine later .
The vaccine is being studied in males , too .
Men can get HPV infections and can pass the virus to their sex partners .
HPV causes genital warts and is associated with rare cases of cancer of the penis .
Particularly in gay men , HPV is linked to anal cancers .
Merck is currently testing Gardasil in men , including gay men .
To the best of my recollection , I ’ve never been lost in the woods ( or elsewhere away from civilization ) — or at least not sufficiently lost that I did n’t have a general sense of which direction I needed to go .
But if I were , I ’d have many options for getting my bearings .
I recall learning , as a kid , that moss always grows on the north side of a tree , and then learning later on that under the right conditions , moss can grow on any side of a tree .
When there ’s no moss , or when the moss steers you wrong , you can use any of numerous other tricks to find north .
Some of these do n’t work especially well in dense foliage , in all weather conditions , or in all parts of the globe , but in almost any situation one of these ideas should do the trick .
This is by no means an exhaustive list , of course , but it should put you on the right track , both literally and metaphorically .
( Several of these suggestions were adapted and condensed from How to Find True North Without a Compass at wikiHow . )
Look for moss ; it usually grows on the north ( i.e. , least sunny ) side of trees and rocks — or at least , grows most plentifully there .
( If you ’re south of the Tropic of Capricorn , the south side of a tree should be least sunny , but since well over 95 % of the world ’s population lives north of that latitude , I felt it relatively safe to generalize . )
Look for spider webs , which tend to appear on the south sides of trees .
( Again , note the qualification about your latitude . )
Put a stick in the ground vertically , and note where the end of its shadow is .
Wait a little while , and mark where the end is now .
The line going between those two points should run approximately east–west ; you can then tell by the direction of the sun ’s movement which way is north .
Watch the sun , which rises ( more or less ) in the east and sets ( more or less ) in the west .
But since the exact position of the sun varies by season and latitude , this is rather inaccurate .
In the northern hemisphere , if it ’s night and the sky is clear , you can usually pick out the north star ( Polaris ) as the brightest one in the handle of the Little Dipper .
If you ’re facing that star , you ’re pointing north .
In the southern hemisphere , find the Southern Cross .
Note the direction of the long axis of the cross .
Follow that imaginary line for a distance equal to five times the length of the cross and fact the point in space where it would end .
You ’re now facing directly south ; spin around 180° to find north .
Hold an analog watch horizontally .
In the northern hemisphere , point the hour hand toward the sun ; in the southern hemisphere , point the 12 toward the sun .
Either way , the north - south line runs halfway between the hour hand and the 12 ( or 1 , if Daylight Saving Time is in effect ) .
To figure out which is which , note the sun ’s direction of movement .
Note the direction in which the highest clouds move , which is generally west - to - east .
( This can provide only a very rough approximation at best , and does n’t work everywhere . )
If you ’re in a part of the world where Traveler ’s Palms grow , find one .
Chances are the axis of the branches runs east - west ; as usual , determine north from the direction of the sun .
If you ’re near a body of water where birds , fish , or amphibians are breeding , keep in mind that they often prefer to breed on the west side .
Use a compass .
( You did bring a compass , right ? )
Make a compass by carefully floating a magnetized needle on the surface of water that ’s sitting in a very still container .
( You did bring a needle , right ? )
Use a GPS receiver .
I mean , there ’s probably one in your smartphone , and maybe another one in your smartwatch , or you can go old school and get a standalone GPS receiver .
Even without a network connection ( since “ lost in the woods ” may also imply “ no signal ” ) most GPS - equipped devices include electronic compasses and can therefore tell you the direction you ’re facing .
But even if your device lacks an electronic compass , you can work out which way is north by taking two or more GPS readings some distance apart and doing some simple geometry .
( You do remember your geometry , right ? )
Of course , if you ’re lost in the woods , you ’re probably also unable to search the web for how to find north .
So if you expect to spend time in the wilderness , finding north should be one of those things you practice in advance , like making fire , purifying water , and avoiding dangerous wildlife .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on another of our sites , SenseList , on October 2 , 2006 .
Astronomersannounced today the discovery of what is possibly the smallest planet knownoutside our solar system orbiting a normal star .
Its orbit isfarther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun .
Most known extrasolarplanets reside inside the equivalent of Mercury 's orbit .
The planetis estimated to be about 5.5 times as massive as Earth and thought to be rocky .
It orbits a red dwarf star about 28,000 light - years away .
Red dwarfs are aboutone - fifth as massive as the Sun and up to 50 times fainter .
But they are amongthe mostcommon stars in the universe .
So thefinding suggests rocky worlds may be common .
" Theteam has discovered the most Earth - like planet yet , " said Michael Turner , assistantdirector for the mathematical and physical sciences directorate at the NationalScience Foundation , which supported the work .
Thediscovery is detailed in the Jan. 26 issue of the journal Nature .
More tocome
Priorto this discovery , the smallest extrasolar planet found around a normal starwas about 7.5 Earthmasses .
Earth - sized planets have been detected , but only around dyingneutron stars .
Thenewfound planet , named OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390Lb , is probably too cold to supportlife as we know it , astronomers said .
With a surface temperature of - 364 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 220 degrees Celsius ) , it is nearly as frigidas Pluto .
Itwas discovered using a technique called " gravitationalmicrolensing , " whereby light from a distant star is bent and magnified bythe gravitational field of a foreground star .
The presence of a planet aroundthe foreground star causes light from the distant star to become momentarilybrighter .
Astronomershailed the discovery as the first of a new class of small , rocky worlds locatedat far - out distances from their stars .
The planetand star are separated by about 2.5 astronomical units ( AU ) .
One AU is equal tothe distance between the Earth and the Sun .
Until now , no small planet had beenfound farther than 0.15 au from its parent star .
Thefinding means planet hunters are one step closer to detecting their holygrail : a habitable Earth - like planet that can sustain liquid water andsupport life .
" Wemay predict with reasonable probability that microlensing will discover planetswith masses like that of Earth at a similar distance from their stars and withcomparable surface temperature , " said study co-author Bohdan Paczynski from Princeton University .
Newoutlook
Of the morethan 150 planets have been discovered so far , most were found using the Dopplertechnique , in which astronomers look for wobbles in a star caused by thegravitational pull of a planet .
This method has uncovered dozens of huge worldsbut can't spot small planets that are far from their stars .
Microlensingcan detect small planets , but it is 50 times more likely to find a gas - giantplanet like Jupiter .
" Microlensingshould have discovered dozens of Jupiters by now if they were as common asthese five - Earth - mass planets , " said study co-author David Bennett .
Thatsuggests most of our galaxy 's planets are small and rocky .
Thisprediction agrees with the standard model for solar system formation , known asthe " coreaccretion " model .
It goes like this :
Dust around newborn stars forms clumpsthat stick together and eventually become asteroids , comets and planetprecursors .
In this scheme , relatively few planets successfully become gasgiants , and they are outnumbered by small , rocky worlds .
" It 'sincredible to think that we went from 10 years ago having no planet to nowhaving over 100 gas giants and even starting to find the first terrestrialplanets , " said Alan Boss , a theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washingtonwho did not participate in the discovery .
" That 's just an amazing leap . "
Shortcoming
Since staralignments are unique events , a microlensing experiment can never be repeated .
Todd Henry , an astronomer at Georgia State University who was not involved inthe study , said the discovery was an " intriguing result from this particulartechnique , but unfortunately you can't follow it up . "
Manyastronomers view the lack of repeatability as an acceptable trade - off , however , because thousands of star systems can be screened in a relatively short periodof time compared to other techniques .
" You can ' tlearn a whole lot about the details of individual systems ... but it 's awonderful alternative for learning about what the mass distribution ofextrasolar planets might be and the frequency at which they occur , " said DavidLatham , an astronomer at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics whowas not part of the study .
In atelephone interview , Jean - Phillipe Beaulieu , a co-author in the study , saidthat while the observations can never be repeated , the discovery wassimultaneously verified by different telescopes around the world .
Themicrolensing event was detected July 11 by telescopes in the OGLE ( Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ) project .
Planet - hunters are veryprotective of their data and cooperation between different teams is rare .
Butastronomers around the globe were alerted so the event could be detected bymultiple telescopes .
" The onlyway to realize the full scientific benefit of our observations is to share thedata with our competition , " said Paczynski , an OGLE co-founder .
Overall , the study involved 73 researchers from 32 institutions worldwide .
" The factthat they 've got a whole bunch of folks using multiple telescopes all observing the same event and calibrating themselves self - consistently makes the data lookvery sound , " Boss said .
" I think it 's a pretty solid detection . "
Embrace your bottom !
Just a thought from 13 September 2005 about Design , Powazek , Weblogs .
I mentioned this idea briefly when I posted about the recent redesign , but I wanted to expand it further .
Web designers of the world , let 's talk about your bottoms .
When you 're designing pages - specifically content pages - what is the best possible thing that could happen ?
I mean after the user has bought a computer , gotten internet connectivity , figured out how to use a browser , and somehow found their way to your site ... what is the single best thing that they could do ?
Read .
That 's right , read .
And read all the way to the bottom of the page .
In this business , a user that actually reads all the way to the bottom of a page is like gold .
They 're your best , most engaged , happiest users .
You know , because they have n't clicked away .
They did the best possible thing they could do , and now they 're at the bottom of the page .
And how do you reward them ?
With a copyright statement .
Maybe , if they 're lucky , some bland footer navigation .
If you ask me , that 's just rude .
It 's time we designers start thinking about page footers as part of the experience design of a complete site .
The bottom of a page is the kiss at the end of the date - and we 're making sites that end without even a handshake .
Take the usual site :
The top is crowded with navigation , the middle is primarily devoted to the main content , with about a third of the vertical space devoted to distracting sidebar items .
Those sidebar items are great for readers who just are n't engaged in whatever they 're reading .
They can skim down a paragraph or two and then link away to the next thing .
But do you really want to optimize your site for the least engaged ?
Your engaged users - the ones who really like you , yaknow , more than a friend - are sticking with that main content .
Everything in the sidebar just makes it harder to focus on your content .
Then , when they get to the end , when they 're ready for something else to do , when they 're ready for that end of the date smooch ... that 's the moment it 's all been leading up to .
That 's when users are most open to suggestions of where else to go , maybe do a search , maybe even click on an ad .
It 's those engaged users we should be optimizing for .
Because by creating a web experience that 's encouraging and engaging to the people who actually want to read your site , you create more of them !
Pretty soon , that 's all you have .
We may even wind up with a web of people who actually like to read .

Summary
Algorithmic stemmers continue to have great utility in IR , despite the promise of out - performance by dictionary - based stemmers .
Nevertheless , there are few algorithmic descriptions of stemmers , and even when they exist they are liable to misinterpretation .
Here we look at the ideas underlying stemming , and on this website define a language , Snowball , in which stemmers can be exactly defined , and from which fast stemmer programs in ANSI C or Java can be generated .
A range of stemmers is presented in parallel algorithmic and Snowball form , including the original Porter stemmer for English .
1 Introduction
There are two main reasons for creating Snowball .
One is the lack of readily available stemming algorithms for languages other than English .
The other is the consciousness of a certain failure on my part in promoting exact implementations of the stemming algorithm described in ( Porter 1980 ) , which has come to be called the Porter stemming algorithm .
The first point needs some qualification : a great deal of work has been done on stemmers in a wide range of natural languages , both in their development and evaluation , ( a complete bibliography cannot be attempted here ) .
But it is rare to see a stemmer laid out in an unambiguous algorithmic form from which encodings in C , Java , Perl etc might easily be made .
When exact descriptions are attempted , it is often with approaches to stemming that are relatively simple , for example the Latin stemmer of Schinke ( Shinke 1996 ) , or the Slovene stemmer of Popovic ( Popovic 1990 ) .
A more complex , and therefore more characteristic stemmer is the Kraaij - Pohlmann stemmer for Dutch ( Kraaij 1994 ) , which is presented as open source code in ANSI C .
To extract an algorithmic description of their stemmer from the source code proves to be quite hard .
The disparity between the Porter stemmer definition and many of its purported implementations is much wider than is generally realised in the IR community .
Three problems seem to compound : one is a misunderstanding of the meaning of the original algorithm , another is bugs in the encodings , and a third is the the almost irresistible urge of programmers to add improvements .
For example , a Perl script advertised on the Web as an implementation of the Porter algorithm was tested in October 2001 , and it was found that 14 percent of words were stemmed incorrectly when given a large sample vocabulary .
Most words of English have very simple endings , so this means that it was effectively getting everything wrong .
At certain points on the Web are demonstrations of the Porter stemmer .
You type some English into a box and the stemmed words are displayed .
These are frequently faulty .
( A good test is to type in agreement .
It should stem to agreement — the same word .
If it stems to agreem there is an error . )
Researchers frequently pick up faulty versions of the stemmer and report that they have applied ‘ Porter stemming ’ , with the result that their experiments are not quite repeatable .
Researchers who work on stemming will sometimes give incorrect examples of the behaviour of the Porter stemmer in their published works .
To address all these problems I have tried to develop a rigorous system for defining stemming algorithms .
A language , Snowball , has been invented , in which the rules of stemming algorithms can be expressed in a natural way .
Snowball is quite small , and can be learned by an experienced programmer in an hour or so .
On this website a number of foreign language stemmers is presented ( a ) in Snowball , and ( b ) in a less formal English - language description .
( b ) can be thought of as the program comments for ( a ) .
A Snowball compiler translates each Snowball definition into ( c ) an equivalent program in ANSI C or Java .
Finally ( d ) standard vocabularies of words and their stemmed equivalents are provided for each stemmer .
The combination of ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) can be used to pin down the definition of a stemmer exactly , and it is hoped that Snowball itself will be a useful resource in creating stemmers in the future .
2 Some ideas underlying stemming Work in stemming has produced a number of different approaches , albeit tied together by a number of common assumptions .
It is worthwhile looking at some of them to see exactly where Snowball fits into the whole picture .
A point tacitly assumed in almost all of the stemming literature is that stemmers are based upon the written , and not the spoken , form of the language .
This is also the assumption here .
Historically , grammarians often regarded the written language as the real language and the spoken as a mere derivative form .
Almost in reaction , many modern linguists have taken a precisely opposite view ( Farmer , 1965 pp 2 - 3 ) .
A more balanced position is that the two languages are distinct though connected , and require separate treatment .
One can in fact imagine parallel stemming algorithms for the spoken language , or rather for the phoneme sequence into which the spoken language is transformed .
Stress and intonation could be used as clues for an indexing process in the same way that punctuation and capitalisation are used as clues in the written language .
But currently stemmers work on the written language for the good reason that there is so much of it available in machine readable form from which to build our IR systems .
Inevitably therefore the stemmers get caught up in accidental details of orthography .
In English , removing the ing from rotting should be followed by undoubling the tt , whereas in rolling we do not undouble the ll .
In French , removing the er from ennuyer should be followed by changing the y to i , so that the resulting word conflates with ennui , and so on .
The idea of stemming is to improve IR performance generally by bringing under one heading variant forms of a word which share a common meaning .
Harman ( 1991 ) was first to present compelling evidence that it may not do so , when her experiments discovered no significant improvement with the use of stemming .
Similarly Lennon ( 1981 ) discovered no appreciable difference between different stemmers running on a constant collection .
Later work has modified this position however .
Krovetz ( 1995 ) found significant , although sometimes small , improvements across a range of test collections .
What he did discover is that the degree of improvement varies considerably between different collections .
These tests were however done on collections in English , and the reasonable assumption of IR researchers has always been that for languages that are more highly inflected than English ( and nearly all are ) , greater improvements will be observed when stemming is applied .
My own view is that stemming helps regularise the vocabulary of an IR system , and this leads to advantages that are not easily quantifiable through standard IR experiments .
For example , it helps in presenting lists of terms associated with the query back to the IR user in a relevance feedback cycle , which is one of the underlying ideas of the probabilistic model .
More will be said on the use of a stemmed vocabulary in section 5 .
Stemming is not a concept applicable to all languages .
It is not , for example , applicable in Chinese .
But to languages of the Indo - European ( * ) group ( and most of the stemmers on this site are for Indo - European languages ) , a common pattern of word structure does emerge .
Assuming words are written left to right , the stem , or root of a word is on the left , and zero or more suffixes may be added on the right .
If the root is modified by this process it will normally be at its right hand end .
And also prefixes may be added on the left .
So unhappiness has a prefix un , a suffix ness , and the y of happy has become i with the addition of the suffix .
Usually , prefixes alter meaning radically , so they are best left in place ( German and Dutch ge is an exception here ) .
But suffixes can , in certain circumstances , be removed .
So for example happy and happiness have closely related meanings , and we may wish to stem both forms to happy , or happi .
Infixes can occur , although rarely : ge in German and Dutch , and zu in German .
One can make some distinction between root and stem .
Lovins ( 1968 ) sees the root as the stem minus any prefixes .
But here we will think of the stem as the residue of the stemming process , and the root as the inner word from which the stemmed word derives , so we think of root to some extent in an etymological way .
It must be admitted that when you start thinking hard about these concepts root , stem , suffix , prefix ... they turn out to be very difficult indeed to define .
Nor do definitions , even if we arrive at them , help us much .
After all , suffix stripping is a practical aid in IR , not an exercise in linguistics or etymology .
This is especially true of the central concept of root .
We think of the etymological root of a word as something we can discover with certainty from a dictionary , forgetting that etymology itself is a subject with its own doubts and controversies ( Jesperson 1922 , Chapter XVI ) .
Indeed , Jesperson goes so far as to say that ‘ It is of course impossible to say how great a proportion of the etymologies given in dictionaries should strictly be classed under each of the following heads : ( 1 ) certain , ( 2 ) probable , ( 3 ) possible , ( 4 ) improbable , ( 5 ) impossible — but I am afraid the first two classes would be the least numerous . ’
Here we will simply assume a common sense understanding of the basic idea of stem and suffix , and hope that this proves sufficient for designing and discussing stemming algorithms .
We can separate suffixes out into three basic classes , which will be called d- , i- and a -suffixes .
An a -suffix , or attached suffix , is a particle word attached to another word .
( In the stemming literature they sometimes get referred to as ‘ enclitics ’ . )
In Italian , for example , personal pronouns attach to certain verb forms : mandargli = mandare + gli = to send + to him mandarglielo = mandare + gli + lo = to send + it + to him a -suffixes appear in Italian and Spanish , and also in Portuguese , although in Portuguese they are separated by hyphen from the preceding word , which makes them easy to eliminate .
An i-suffix , or inflectional suffix , forms part of the basic grammar of a language , and is applicable to all words of a certain grammatical type , with perhaps a small number of exceptions .
In English for example , the past of a verb is formed by adding ed.
Certain modifications may be required in the stem : fit + ed -> fitted ( double t ) love + ed -> loved ( drop the final e of love ) but otherwise the rule applies in a regular way to all verbs in contemporary English , with about 150 ( Palmer , 1965 ) exceptional forms , bear beat become begin bend .... bore beat became began bent A d- suffix , or derivational suffix , enables a new word , often with a different grammatical category , or with a different sense , to be built from another word .
Whether a d - suffix can be attached is discovered not from the rules of grammar , but by referring to a dictionary .
So in English , ness can be added to certain adjectives to form corresponding nouns ( littleness , kindness , foolishness ... ) but not to all adjectives ( not for example , to big , cruel , wise ... ) d-suffixes can be used to change meaning , often in rather exotic ways .
So in italian astro means a sham form of something else : medico + astro = medicastro = quack doctor poeta + astro = poetastro = poetaster Generally i-suffixes follow d-suffixes .
i- suffixes can precede d-suffixes , for example lovingly , devotedness , but such cases are exceptional .
To be a little more precise , d- suffixes can sometimes be added to participles .
devoted , used adjectivally , is a participle derived from the verb devote , and ly can be added to turn the adjective into an adverb , or ness to turn it into a noun .
The same feature occurs in other Indo - European languages .
Sometimes it is hard to say whether a suffix is a d - suffix or i-suffix , the comparative and superlative endings er , est of English for example .
A d-suffix can serve more than one function .
In English , for example , ly standardly turns an adjective into an adverb ( greatly ) , but it can also turn a noun into an adjective ( kingly ) .
In French , ement also standardly turns an adjective into an adverb ( grandement ) , but it can also turn a verb into a noun ( rapprochement ) .
( Referring to the French stemmer , this double use is ultimately why ement is tested for being in the RV rather than the R2 region of the word being stemmed . )
It is quite common for an i-suffix to serve more than one function .
In English , s can either be ( 1 ) a verb ending attached to third person singular forms ( runs , sings ) , ( 2 ) a noun ending indicating the plural ( dogs , cats ) or ( 3 ) a noun ending indicating the possessive ( boy ’s , girls ’ ) .
By an orthographic convention now several hundred years old , the possessive is written with an apostrophe , but nowadays this is frequently omitted in familiar phrases ( a girls school ) .
( Usage ( 3 ) is relatively rare compared with ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : there are only nine uses of ’s in this document . )
Since the normal order of suffixes is d , i and a , we can expect them to be removed from the right in the order a , i and d .
Usually we want to remove all a- and i-suffixes , and some of the d-suffixes .
If the stemming process reduces two words to the same stem , they are said to be conflated .
3 Stemming errors , and the use of dictionaries
One way of thinking of the relation between terms and documents in an IR system is to see the documents as being about concepts , and the terms as words that describe the concepts .
Then , of course , one word can cover many concepts , so pound can mean a unit of currency , a weight , an enclosure , or a beating .
Pound is a homonym .
And one concept can be described by many words , as with money , capital , cash , currency .
These words are synonyms .
There is a many - many mapping therefore between the set of terms and the set of concepts .
Stemming is a process that transforms this mapping to advantage , on the whole reducing the number of synonyms , but occasionally creating new homonyms .
It is worth remembering that what are called stemming errors are usually just the introduction of new homonyms into vocabularies that already contain very large numbers of homonyms .
Words which have no place in this term - concept mapping are those which describe no concepts .
The particle words of grammar , the , of , and ... , known in IR as stopwords , fall into this category .
Stopwords can be useful for retrieval but only in searching for phrases , ‘ to be or not to be ’ , ‘ do as you would be done by ’ etc .
This suggests that stemming stopwords is not useful .
More will be said on stopwords in section 7 .
In the literature , a distinction is often made between under - stemming , which is the error of taking off too small a suffix , and over - stemming , which is the error of taking off too much .
In French , for example , croûtons is the plural of croûton , ‘ a crust ’ , so to remove ons would be over - stemming , while croulons is a verb form of crouler , ‘ to totter ’ , so to remove s would be under - stemming .
We would like to introduce a further distinction between mis-stemming and over - stemming .
Mis -stemming is taking off what looks like an ending , but is really part of the stem .
Over - stemming is taking off a true ending which results in the conflation of words of different meanings .
So for example ly can be removed from cheaply , but not from reply , because in reply ly is not a suffix .
If it was removed , reply would conflate with rep , ( the commonly used short form of representative ) .
Here we have a case of mis-stemming .
To illustrate over - stemming , look at these four words , verb adjective First pair : prove provable Second pair : probe probable Morphologically , the two pairs are exactly parallel ( in the written , if not the spoken language ) .
They also have a common etymology .
All four words derive from the Latin probare , ‘ to prove or to test ’ , and the idea of testing connects the meanings of the words .
But the meanings are not parallel .
provable means ‘ able to be proved ’ ; probable does not mean ‘ able to be probed ’ .
Most people would judge conflation of the first pair as correct , and of the second pair , incorrect .
In other words , to remove able from probable is a case of over - stemming .
We can try to avoid mis-stemming and over - stemming by using a dictionary .
The dictionary can tell us that reply does not derive from rep , and that the meanings of probe and probable are well separated in modern English .
It is important to realise however that a dictionary does not give a complete solution here , but can be a tool to improve the conflation process .
In Krovetz ’s dictionary experiments ( Krovetz 1995 ) , he noted that in looking up a past participle like suited , one is led either to suit or to suite as plausible infinitive forms .
suite can be rejected , however , because the dictionary tells us that although it is a word of English it is not a verb form .
Cases like this ( and Krovetz found about 60 ) had to be treated as exceptions .
But the form routed could either derive from the the verb rout or the verb route :
At Waterloo Napoleon ’s forces were routed
The cars were routed off the motorway Such cases in English are extremely rare , but they are commoner in more highly inflected languages .
In French for example , affiliez can either be the verb affiler , to sharpen , with imperfect ending iez , or the verb affilier , to affiliate , with present indicative ending ez : vous affiliez = vous affil - iez = you sharpened vous affiliez = vous affili-ez = you affiliate
If the second is intended , removal of iez is mis-stemming .
With over - stemming we must rely upon the dictionary to separate meanings .
There are different ways of doing this , but all involve some degree of reliance upon the lexicographers .
Krovetz ’s methods are no doubt best , because the most objective : he uses several measures , but they are based on the idea of measuring the similarity in meaning of two words by the degree of overlap among the words used to define them , and this is at a good remove from a lexicographer ’s subjective judgement about semantic similarity .
There is an interesting difference between mis-stemming and over - stemming to do with language history .
The morphology of a language changes less rapidly than the meanings of the words in it .
When extended to include a few archaic endings , such as ick as an alternative to ic , a stemmer for contemporary English can be applied to the English of 300 years ago .
Mis -stemmings will be roughly the same , but the pattern of over - stemming will be different because of the changing meaning of words in the language .
For example , relativity in the 19th century merely meant ‘ the condition of being relative to ’ .
With that meaning , it is acceptable to conflate it with relative .
But with the 20th century meaning brought to it by Einstein , stemming to relativ is over - stemming .
Here we see the word with the suffix changing its meaning , but it can happen the other way round .
transpire has come to mean ‘ happen ’ , and its old meaning of ’ exhalation ’ or ‘ breathing out ’ is now effectively lost .
( That is the bitter reality , although dictionaries still try to persuade us otherwise ) .
But transpiration still carries the earlier meaning .
So what was formerly an acceptable stemming may be judged now as an over - stemming , not because the word being stemmed has changed its meaning , but because some cognate word has changed its meaning .
In these examples we are presenting words as if they had single meanings , but the true picture is more complicated .
Krovetz uses a model of word meanings which is extremely helpful here .
He makes a distinction between homonyms and polysemes .
The meaning of homonyms are quite unrelated .
For example , ground in the sense of ‘ earth ’ , and ‘ ground ’ as the past participle of ‘ grind ’ are homonyms .
Etymologically homonyms have different stories , and they usually have separate entries in a dictionary .
But each homonym form can have a range of polysemic forms , corresponding to different shades of meaning .
So ground can mean the earth ’s surface , or the bottom of the sea , or soil , or any base , and so the basis of an argument , and so on .
Over time new polysemes appear and old ones die .
At any moment , the use of a word will be common in some polysemic forms and rare in others .
If a suffix is attached to a word the new word will get a different set of polysemes .
For example , grounds = ground + s acquires the sense of ‘ dregs ’ and ‘ estate lands ’ , loses the sense of ‘ earth ’ , and shares the sense of ‘ basis ’ .
Consider the conflation of mobility with mobile .
mobile has acquired two new polysemes not shared with mobility .
One is the ‘ mobile art object ’ , common in the nursery .
This arrived in the 1960s , and is still in use .
The other is the ‘ mobile phone ’ which is now very dominant , although it may decline in the future when it has been replaced by some new gadget with a different name .
We might draw a graph of the degree of separation of the meanings of mobility and mobile against time , which would depend upon the number of polysemes and the intensity of their use .
What seemed like a valid conflation of the two words in 1940 may seem to be invalid today .
In general therefore one can say that judgements about whether words are over - stemmed change with time as the meanings of words in the language change .
The use of a dictionary should reduce errors of mis-stemming and errors of over - stemming .
And , for English at least , the mis-stemming errors should reduce well , even if there are problems with over - stemming errors .
Of course , it depends on the quality of the dictionary .
A dictionary will need to be very comprehensive , fully up - to - date , and with good word definitions to achieve the best results .
Historically , stemmers have often been thought of as either dictionary - based or algorithmic .
The presentation of studies of stemming in the literature has perhaps helped to create this division .
In the Lovins ’ stemmer the algorithmic description is central .
In accounts of dictionary - based stemmers the emphasis tends to be on dictionary content and structure , and IR effectiveness .
Savoy ’s French stemmer ( Savoy , 1993 ) is a good example of this .
But the two approaches are not really distinct .
An algorithmic stemmer can include long exception lists that are effectively mini-dictionaries , and a dictionary - based stemmer usually needs a process for removing at least i-suffixes to make the look - up in the dictionary possible .
In fact in a language in which proper names are inflected ( Latin , Finnish , Russian ... ) , a dictionary - based stemmer will need to remove i-suffixes independently of dictionary look - up , because the proper names will not of course be in the dictionary .
The stemmers available on the Snowball website are all purely algorithmic .
They can be extended to include built - in exception lists , they could be used in combination with a full dictionary , but they are still presented here in their simplest possible form .
Being purely algorithmic , they are , or ought to be , inferior to the performance of well - constructed dictionary - based stemmers .
But they are still very useful , for the following reasons :
1 ) Algorithmic stemmers are ( or can be made ) very lean and very fast .
The stemmers presented here generate code that will process about a million words in six seconds on a conventional 500MHz PC .
Nowadays we can generate very large IR systems with quite modest resources , and tools that assist in this have value .
2 ) Despite the errors they can be seen to make , algorithmic stemmers still give good practical results .
As Krovetz ( 1995 ) says in surprise of the algorithmic stemmer , ‘ Why does it do so well ? ’ ( page 89 ) .
3 ) Dictionary - based stemmers require dictionary maintenance , to keep up with an ever - changing language , and this is actually quite a problem .
It is not just that a dictionary created to assist stemming today will probably require major updating in a few years time , but that a dictionary in use for this purpose today may already be several years out of date .
We can hazard an answer to Krovetz ’s question , as to why algorithmic stemmers perform as well as they do , when they reveal so many cases of under - , over - and mis-stemming .
Under - stemming is a fault , but by itself it will not degrade the performance of an IR system .
Because of under - stemming words may fail to conflate that ought to have conflated , but you are , in a sense , no worse off than you were before .
Mis -stemming is more serious , but again mis-stemming does not really matter unless it leads to false conflations , and that frequently does not happen .
For example , removing the ate ending in English , can result in useful conflations ( luxury , luxuriate ; affection , affectionate ) , but very often produces stems that are not English words ( enerv-ate , accommod - ate , deliber - ate etc ) .
In the literature , these are normally classed as stemming errors — overstemming — although in our nomenclature they are examples of mis-stemming .
However these residual stems , enerv , accommod , deliber ... do not conflate with other word forms , and so behave in an IR system in the same way as if they still retained their ate ending .
No false conflations arise , and so there is no over - stemming here .
To summarise , one can say that just as a word can be over - stemmed but not mis-stemmed ( relativity -> relative ) , so it can be mis-stemmed but not over - stemmed ( enervate -> enerv ) .
And , of course , even over - stemming does not matter , if the over - stemmed word falsely conflates with other words that exist in the language , but are not encountered in the IR system which is being used .
Of the three types of error , over - stemming is the most important , and using a dictionary does not eliminate all over - stemmings , but does reduce their incidence .
4 Stemming as part of an indexing process Stemming is part of a composite process of extracting words from text and turning them into index terms in an IR system .
Because stemming is somewhat complex and specialised , it is usually studied in isolation .
Even so , it cannot really be separated from other aspect of the indexing process :
1 ) What is a word ?
For indexing purposes , a word in a European language is a sequence of letters bounded by non-letters .
But in English , an internal apostrophe does not split a word , although it is not classed as a letter .
The treatment of these word boundary characters affects the stemmer .
For example , the Kraaij Pohlmann stemmer for Dutch ( Kraaij , 1994 , 1995 ) removes hyphen and treats apostrophe as part of the alphabet ( so ’s , ’ tje and ’je are three of their endings ) .
The Dutch stemmer presented here assumes hyphen and apostrophe have already been removed from the word to be stemmed .
2 ) What is a letter ?
Clearly letters define words , but different languages use different letters , much confusion coming from the varied use of accented Roman letters .
English speakers , perhaps influenced by the ASCII character set , typically regard their alphabet of a to z as the norm , and other forms ( for example , Danish å and ø , or German ß ) as somewhat abnormal .
But this is an insular point of view .
In Italian , for example , the letters j , k , w , x and y are not part of the alphabet , and are only seen in foreign words .
We also tend to regard other alphabets as only used for isolated languages , and that is not strictly true .
Cyrillic is used for a range of languages other than Russian , among which additional letters and accented forms abound .
In English , a broad definition of letter would be anything that could be accepted as a pronounceable element of a word .
This would include accented Roman letters ( naïve , Fauré ) , and certain ligature forms ( encyclopædia ) .
It would exclude letters of foreign alphabets , such as Greek and Cyrillic .
The a to z alphabet is one of those where letters come in two styles , upper and lower case , which historically correspond ( very roughly ) to the shapes you get if you use a chisel or a pen .
Across all languages , the exact relation of upper to lower case is not so easy to define .
In Italian , for example , an accented lower case letter is sometimes represented in upper case by an the unaccented letter followed by an apostrophe .
( I have seen this convention used in modern Italian news stories in machine readable form . )
In fact the Porter stemmer ( which is for English ) assumes the word being stemmed is unaccented and in lower case .
More exactly , a , e , i , o , u , and sometimes y , are treated as vowels , and any other character gets treated as a consonant .
Each stemmer presented here assumes some degree of normalisation before it receives the word , which is roughly ( a ) put all letters into lower case , and ( b ) remove accents from letter - accent combinations that do not form part of the alphabet of the language .
Each stemmer declares the letter - accent combinations for its language , and this can be used as a guide for the normalisation , but even so , we can see from the discussion above that ( a ) and ( b ) are not trivial operations , and need to be done with care .
( Incidentally , because the stemmers work on lower case words , turning letters to upper case is sometimes used internally for flagging purposes . )
3 ) Identifying stopwords .
Invariant stopwords are more easily found before stemming is applied , but inflecting stopwords ( for example , German kein , keine , keinem , keinen ... ) may be easier to find after — because there are fewer forms .
There is a case for building stopword identification into the stemming process .
See section 7 .
4 ) Conflating irregular forms .
More will be said on this in section 6 .
5 The use of stemmed words
The idea of how stemmed words might be employed in an IR system has evolved slightly over the years .
The Lovins stemmer ( Lovins 1968 ) was developed not for indexing document texts , but the subject terms attached to them .
With queries stemmed in the same way , the user needed no special knowledge of the form of the subject terms .
Rijsbergen ( 1979 , Chapter 2 ) assumes document text analysis : stopwords are removed , the remaining words are stemmed , and the resulting set of stemmed word constitute the IR index ( and this style of use is widespread today ) .
More flexibility however is obtained by indexing all words in a text in an unstemmed form , and keeping a separate two - column relation which connects the words to their stemmed equivalents .
The relation can be denoted by R(s , w ) , which means that s is the stemmed form of word w .
From the relation we can get , for any word w , its unique stemmed form , stem(w ) , and for any stem s , the set of words , words (s ) , that stem to s .
The user should not have to see the stemmed form of a word .
If a list of stems is to be presented back for query expansion , in place of a stem , s , the user should be shown a single representative from the set words (s ) , the one of highest frequency perhaps .
The user should also be able to choose for the whole query , or at a lower level for each word in a query , whether or not it should be stemmed .
In the absence of such choices , the system can make its own decisions .
Perhaps single word queries would not undergo stemming ; long queries would ; stopwords would be removed except in phrases .
In query expansion , the system would work with stemmed forms , ignoring stopwords .
Query expansion with stemming results in a much cleaner vocabulary list than without , and this is a main strength of using a stemming process .
A question arises : if the user never sees the stemmed form , does its appearance matter ?
The answer must be no , although the Porter stemmer tries to make the unstemmed forms guessable from the stemmed forms .
For example , from appropri you can guess appropriate .
At least , trying to achieve this effect acts as a useful control .
Similarly with the other stemmers presented here , an attempt has been made to keep the appearance of the stemmed forms as familiar as possible .
6 Irregular grammatical forms
All languages contain irregularities , but to what extent should they be accommodated in a stemming algorithm ?
An English stemmer , for example , can convert regular plurals to singular form without difficulty ( boys , girls , hands ... ) .
Should it do the same with irregular plurals ( men , children , feet , ... ) ?
Here we have irregular cases with i-suffixes , but there are irregularities with d-suffixes , which Lovins calls ‘ spelling exceptions ’.
absorb / absorption and conceive / conception are examples of this .
Etymologically , the explanation of the first is that the Latin root , sorbere , is an irregular verb , and of the second that the word conceive comes to us from the French rather than straight from the Latin .
It is interesting that , even with no knowledge of the etymology , we do recognise the connection between the words .
Lovins tries to solve spelling exceptions by formulating general respelling rules ( turn rpt into rb for example ) , but it might be easier to have simply a list of exceptional stems .
The Porter stemmer does not handle irregularities at all , but from the author ’s own experience , this has never been an area of complaint .
Complaints in fact are always about false conflations , for example new and news .
Possibly Lovins was right in wanting to resolve d-suffix irregularities , and not being concerned about i-suffix irregularities .
i- suffix irregularities in English go with short , old words , that are either in very common use ( man / men , woman / women , see / saw ... ) or are used only rarely ( ox / oxen , louse / lice , forsake / forsook ... ) .
The latter class can be ignored , and the former has its own problems which are not always solved by stemming .
For example man is a verb , and saw can mean a cutting instrument , or , as a verb , can mean to use such an instrument .
Conflation of these forms frequently leads to an error like mis-stemming therefore .
An algorithmic stemmer really needs holes where the irregular forms can be plugged in as necessary .
This is more serviceable than attempting to embed special lists of these irregular forms into software .
7 Stopwords
We have suggested that stemming stopwords is not useful .
There is a grammatical connection between being and be , but conflation of the two forms has little use in IR because they have no shared meaning that would entitle us to think of them as synonyms .
being and be have a morphological connection as well , but that is not true of am and was , although they have a grammatical connection .
Generally speaking , inflectional stopwords exhibit many irregularities , which means that stemming is not only not useful , but not possible , unless one builds into the stemmer tables of exceptions .
Switching from English to French , consider être , the equivalent form of be .
It has about 40 different forms , including , suis es sommes serez étaient fus furent sois été ( and suis incidentally is a homonym , as part of the verb suivre . )
Passing all forms through a rule - based stemmer creates something of a mess .
An alternative approach is to recognise this group of words , and other groups , and take special action .
The recognition could take place inside the stemmer , or be done before the stemmer is called .
One special action would be to stem ( perhaps one should say ‘ map ’ ) all the forms to a standard form , ETRE , to indicate that they are parts of the verb être .
Deciding what to do with the term ETRE , and it would probably be to discard it , would be done outside the stemming process .
Another special action would be to recognize a whole class of stopwords and simply discard them .
The strategy adopted will depend upon the underlying IR model , so what one needs is the flexibility to create modified forms of a standard stemmer .
Usually we present Snowball stemmers in their unadorned form .
Thereafter , the addition of stopword tables is quite easy .
8 Rare forms Stemmers do not need to handle linguistic forms that turn up only very rarely , but in practice it is hard to design a stemmer with all rare forms eliminated without there appearing to be some gaps in the thinking .
For this reason one should not worry too much about their occasional presence .
For example , in contemporary Portuguese , use of the second person plural form of verbs has almost completely disappeared .
Even so , endings for those forms are included in the Portuguese stemmer .
They appear in all the grammar books , and will in any case be found in older texts .
The habit of putting in rare forms to ‘ complete the picture ’ is well established , and usually passes unnoticed .
An example is the list of English stopwords in van Rijsbergen ( 1979 ) .
This includes yourselves , by analogy with himself , herself etc. , although yourselves is actually quite a rare word in English .

A father and his eight - year - old son got off a train at Blackpool on a Friday evening two weeks ago to be confronted by a number of police officers moving passengers towards a scanner .
There was a mildly threatening manner about them and it was clear that they expected everyone to pass through the scanner , which they said was being used to search for knives .
The man , whose name is Danny , quietly told the police that unless they had a very good reason , he would not be searched .
One or two passengers hesitated , then joined him in refusing to go through the scanner .
The police were clearly disgruntled , but could n't do anything because Danny was right : they had to have reasonable grounds for suspecting he was carrying a knife in order to search him .
' I am not some rabid left winger or civil libertarian , ' he wrote in an email to me .
' It just seems we are allowing a police state to be developed without an argument . '
On the phone , he seemed to modify this by saying that the police behaviour had been oppressive .
Thank
God there are still people like Danny who know the law and understand that part of its fragile essence is the respect for the rights of the innocent citizen when confronted with authority .
The British Transport Police may insist that its Operation Shield , as this random trawl is known , is for the common good in that it fights knife crime , but think twice about the attitude it betrays and you realise that it is another small erosion in the esteem for the individual .
Such behaviour makes everyone a suspect .
Tony Blair talks incessantly about respect , yet there are few who have done more to degrade authority 's respect for the public .
Nowhere is that better seen than in the behaviour of the police , which gradually becomes more coercive and imbued with the idea that we are all bad hats until we prove otherwise .
We now live in a country where the idea of wrongful arrest has become a historic curiosity and where anyone can be arrested for the slightest offence and compelled to become part of the government 's DNA database .
We live in a country where young boys - one was just seven - are taken aside and questioned for trying to knock conkers out of chestnut trees on public ground .
Where a grandmother whose neighbour accused her of not returning a ball kicked into her garden was arrested , fingerprinted and required to give her DNA .
The police went through every room in her house , even her daughter 's drawers , before letting her go without charge or caution .
Where two sisters can be arrested after a peaceful protest about climate change , held in solitary confinement for 36 hours without being allowed to make a phone call , then told not to talk to each other as a condition of their bail .
As this paper reported , their money , keys , computers , discs and phones were confiscated , their homes searched .
There is much more , all of it enabled by Blair 's laws and encouraged by a vindictive and erroneous contention that defendants ' rights must be reduced in the pursuit of more and quicker prosecutions .
Our prisons are full , problem teenagers are , by default , exiled to a kind of outlawry and every citizen becomes the subject of an almost hysterical need by the authorities to check up on and chivvy them .
The government regards us not just as wedded to too many regrettable vices - smoking , speeding , drinking too much , eating unhealthy food and taking no exercise - but also as innately prone to law - breaking .
Perhaps with good reason , since , according to the Liberal Democrat homes affairs spokesman , Nick Clegg , some 3,000 criminal offences have been created by Labour .
The more crimes there are , the more criminals there will be .
Mass surveillance has begun on our motorways and in our town centres .
Metropolitan drivers increasingly find themselves pressed into numberplate - recognition camera traps on the same principle that inspires Operation Shield .
Everyone has something to hide unless they can prove otherwise , which is why the police also enthusiastically pursue samples for the DNA database .
( Incidentally , by next year , the total number of profiles will rise to three million , one in five of which will belong to black people . )
The police are in their very own heaven and demand more and more powers of instant justice , a contradiction in terms if ever there was one .
These will allow them to crush people 's cars , issue more on - the - spot fines and ban ' undesirables ' from any area they choose without having to go to court .
Even parish councils are to become part of this culture of minatory bossiness .
Instead of having to apply to central government to introduce new bylaws , they are to be given powers by Ruth Kelly , the Communities and Local Government Minister , to levy instant £ 100 fines for skateboarding , not cleaning up dog mess , busking and , no doubt , scrumping for apples and playing Pooh sticks .
How will it end - with CCTV cameras watching small boys for inappropriate behaviour in the vicinity of horse chestnuts ?
In his frantic terminality , Blair plans the sinister information - sharing index , otherwise known as the universal child register , and last week was musing that we should all have our DNA stored on the national base .
Link this to his earlier remarks about identifying problem children who might grow up to be a menace to society by intervening before they were born and you begin to feel the chill of the technology - driven authoritarianism .
What runs through all this seems to be a rather surprising dislike of the British people .
It was once possible to believe the government 's unusual attention to law , order and behaviour was benevolent yet ill - conceived .
Now it looks more like the result of late - onset sociopathy , influenced by a long period in power and the degenerate entanglement between Downing Street and the seething red - top newspapers .
The prevailing account of Britain in the current political establishment has become deeply pessimistic and , to my mind , wrong .
Yes , we have problems with home - grown terrorism , loutishness , a swelling underclass , unintegrating minorities , but there is another story .
Britain is also a success and it should occur to one of our political leaders to defy the orthodoxy of decline and compliment the nation on its adaptability and deep reserves of virtue and toleration .
Think of the charitable activity in this country , of the level of public debate that wells up in BBC programmes such as Any Questions , the deep interest in history , the eagerness of the audiences at arts festivals all over Britain , the humour and generosity of spirit , the commitment to local communities , to understanding each other 's needs and of the array of passions and hobbies which absorb so many millions of people whose quiet , law - abiding fulfilment as Britons goes undescribed by the furious negativity of the moment .
It is these people , with their stored - up virtue and unself - conscious decency , who the government seeks to turn into suspects and infantilise by its morbid intrusion .
It is not the government 's business to encroach on our experience as individuals in a democracy , to threaten us with so much oppressive legislation and always to assume our guilt .
But there is another reason and that is because we are soon going to have to have the debate about individual liberty in the context of rapid climate change .
That will only work if the government treats us like adults and says : ' Look , this is potentially the greatest crisis civilisation has ever faced and we need your help . '
The resulting contract must be between equals - the people and the state - and in a relationship where respect flows both ways .
That , ultimately , is what this nagging and suspicious government threatens .

Do n't worry , the scientists can't read your most fantastic or lurid imaginings .
What the Caltech researchers can do is spot the flicker of activity that occurs while you contemplate moving your hand .
The research is expected to improve efforts to build neural prostheses , devices that link a paralyzed person 's mind to an external device with the help of brain electrodes and a computer .
Several research programs are making progress on similar aspects of mind control over movement .
Patients have shown the ability to move a cursor on a screen with nothing but brainpower , for example .
And a monkey has been trained to feed itself with a robotic arm .
But the new study , announced this week , predicted where a patient would move his hand based on brain activity the instant prior .
It promises a more effective way to convert desire into movement for paralyzed patients .
The research is reported in the online version of the journal Nature Neuroscience .
" Just the fact that these spatial signals are there is important , " said Daniel Rizzuto , a postdoctoral researcher at Caltech who worked on the study .
" Based upon previous work in monkeys , people were saying this was not the case . "
The research was led by Richard Andersen , a neuroscientist at Caltech , known formally as the California Institute of Technology .
Planning central
The planning of movement occurs in the brain 's ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( vPF ) , the scientists found .
The study subjects were epilepsy patients , who were already being analyzed with implanted electrodes in an effort to determine where in the brain their seizures occur .
" So for a couple of weeks these patients are lying there , bored , waiting for a seizure , " Rizzuto said , " and I was able to get their permission to do my study , taking advantage of the electrodes that were already there . "
The patients watched a computer screen for a flashing target , remembered the target 's location , and then reached to that location .
Anderson and Rizzuto believe the planning areas of the brain are less susceptible to damage than the regions that actually initiate movement .
With spinal cord injuries , for example , communication to and from the primary motor cortex is cut off , Rizzuto said .
But the brain continues to plan .
By tapping into these plans , the goal of generating movement becomes just an engineering problem involving a computer and a robotic arm , the scientists figure .
" The next project that we are currently undertaking is to place paralyzed patients into an MRI scanner to record their brain activity while they imagine making arm movements , " he told LiveScience .
" By analyzing the brain activation of paralyzed patients compared with normal subjects we can get an indication of which brain areas reorganize after paralysis . "
Multitasking
In the recent tests , there is a computer processing time lag of less than a second that Rizzuto says should not be a problem .
" If you are hooked up to a neural prosthetic and we predict that you are thinking of reaching to the coffee cup in front of you , then the best path to reach that goal can be automatically computed by an expert computer system that then controls the trajectory of the arm , " Rizzuto told LiveScience .
" This also allows you to do other things while the arm is moving , rather than focusing upon the trajectory of the arm the whole time . "
Eventually the research will lead to human tests to see whether the planning can in fact be converted to movement .
" After this we hope to implant paralyzed patients with electrodes so that they may better communicate with others and control their environment , " Rizzuto said .
Rizzuto predicts FDA approval for the first neural prosthetic device could come in five to eight years .
He and others will discuss their work Sunday , March 20 at 10 p.m. ET ( 7 p.m. PT ) on a SETI Institute talk program carried live on the Internet .

A new breed of technologists envisions a democratic world improved by the Internet 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
Behind the random silliness of YouTube videos and the juvenile frivolity of MySpace Web sites lies a powerful idea : Everyday people are using technology to gain control of the media and change the world .
At least that 's what a new breed of Internet technologists and entrepreneurs want us to believe .
The new Internet boom commonly referred to as Web 2.0 is really an exercise in digital democracy .
Dubbed Digital Utopians by some , and Web 2.0 innovators by others , this latest wave of tech gurus champion community over commerce , sharing ideas over sharing profits .
By using Web sites that stress group thinking and sharing , these Internet idealists want to topple the power silos of Hollywood , Washington , Wall Street and even Silicon Valley .
And like countless populists throughout history , they hope to disperse power and control , an idea that delights many and horrifies others .
Tim O'Reilly is the founder and chief executive of O'Reilly Media in Sebastopol , a tech publisher and event organizer who hung a name on the movement with his Web 2.0 Conference , which will be held this year starting Tuesday in San Francisco .
In his manifesto on the movement last fall , O'Reilly wrote glowingly about " the wisdom of crowds " and the " architecture of participation . "
Winners on the Internet " have embraced the power of the web to harness collective intelligence , " O'Reilly wrote , populating " a world in which ' the former audience , ' not a few people in a back room , decides what 's important . "

Indeed , millions of people each month visit social networking destinations like MySpace , online encyclopedias like Wikipedia and video - sharing sites like YouTube .
Political groups like MoveOn.org have galvanized grassroots organizing .
News aggregators like Digg.com have given editing power to readers .
Combined , these Web sites have changed the landscape of countless industries and some have become worth billions .
They have also tapped a nerve , resonating with people who feel powerless to affect the major power structures .
The core of the Web 2.0 movement resurrects an age - old debate about governance and democracy , one that was argued by political philosophers such as Jean - Jacques Rousseau and Alexis de Tocqueville :
Are the benefits of democracy -- taking advantage of what Web 2.0 proponents call the wisdom of the crowds -- worth risking the dark side of mob rule ?
Chris Messina thinks so .
Messina , 26 , is a blogger , activist and " open - source evangelist , " a charismatic geek spreading the notion of digital democracy .
" There is more potential today for individuals to change their destiny than there 's been in ages , " Messina said .
" We need to get back to the idea that anyone can dream big and make it happen . "
Like any popular movement , it also has its critics .
Andrew Keen warns against the dangers of embracing technology 's level playing field .
Keen , 46 , a former professor and philosopher turned tech entrepreneur , published a tract this year , " Web 2.0 Is Reminiscent of Marx , " and is working on a book lambasting " The Cult of the Amateur . "
If people are absorbed with content created by fellow amateurs , Keen argues , will they ever know greatness ?
If bloggers disrupt mass media , will they follow journalistic rules of fairness ?
Can an army of amateur journalists adequately replace corporate news - gathering ?
Will sophomoric
YouTube videos take the place of great films ?
Keen dismisses what he calls the " militant and absurd " buzzwords of Web 2.0 : Empowering citizen media , radically democratize , smash elitism , content redistribution , authentic community .
Yet those buzzwords pop up nearly everywhere .
Google 's deal to buy video startup YouTube for $ 1.65 billion provides a glimpse at the potential future of media , one in which programs are made not by polished production companies but by anyone with a low - cost camcorder .
In this world , programming decisions rest with what Web 2.0 calls the community and what critics deride as the mob instead of with cadres of networking executives .
Rather than turning to the mass media , people can get their information from blogs , podcasts and even MySpace pages .
Rather than dialing up a radio station churning out a corporate playlist , anyone can put his idiosyncratic broadcasts online at sites like Mercora and Lala.com .
" Everything is getting flatter , " said Ori Brafman of San Francisco , an entrepreneur and author .
" The amateurization is a wonderful thing . "
Brafman is co-author of " The Starfish and the Spider , " a book about " the unstoppable power of leaderless organizations . "
Spiders , in the title metaphor , are crippled or dead when they lose a limb ; starfish , on the other hand , can grow new arms .
In the book , Wikipedia -- a Web site on which users , not experts , write and edit a free online encyclopedia -- is identified as a classic starfish organization .
" When you put people in this kind of an open system , it brings out a different side of people , " Brafman says .
" They know the system is based on trust and shared responsibility .
People step up to the bat and perform . "
Not exactly , says Nicholas Carr , an author and blogger who joins Keen 's contrarian view of Web 2.0 .
Carr calls Wikipedia " at once a major achievement and a mediocre piece of work . "
" Does something like Wikipedia change the economics of producing an encyclopedia ( written by experts ) ?
As soon as you have a mediocre product that 's free , is that going to destroy the possibility of having a superior product that costs something ? " he asks .
Idealism in technology
The notion of a Digital Utopia has been around since the early days of computing .
Many of the industry 's pioneers saw their machines as tools that could make life easier and unite humanity .
Some of the earliest successes on the Internet have an almost direct lineage to the liberal politics of the 1960s anti-war and civil rights movements .
Former Merry Prankster Stewart Brand was the brains behind the Well , an early online community that took its name in part from his Whole Earth Review .
New York
Times technology reporter John Markoff argues in his book , " What the Dormouse Said , " that the '60s counterculture played a pivotal role in shaping the personal computing industry .
Underpinning the technology movement has always been a sense of community .
" Take the Summer of Love , " said Brewster Kahle , 45 , founder of the Internet Archive in San Francisco , a digital archiving and storage site .
" A tradition was started then of recording concerts of those bands and passing the tapes around .
But they had a firm rule that you could n't make any money .
If you did n't make any money at all , it was OK to share the love . "
That tradition has migrated to the online world , Kahle said , not just to his site but to a renewed resistance to copyright and a love of sharing information , whether it is music or knowledge .
The Utopian life
Today 's Digital Utopian takes many forms , from the aging '60s hippie to the tech - savvy youthful idealist .
They share little physically , but most everything mentally .
The Utopians attend loosely organized gatherings , often called un-conferences , where there is no agenda other than participation .
Messina and his girlfriend , Tara Hunt , have spearheaded a series of events known as BarCamp , where ad - hoc groups bring sleeping bags and food to an office that a company has donated for the occasion , and then stay up late engaging in freewheeling roundtable discussions about how to use the latest technological innovations .
BarCamp events have been held around the world ; when one is arranged , it 's posted online at www.barcamp.org, and anyone can show up .
" Most of these un-conference things are a big experiment , " Messina said at WineCamp , at which geeks gathered in a Calaveras County vineyard to figure out ways they could use technology to help nonprofit groups .
" It 's up to each one of us to make it interesting . "
Utopians ' favored reading material includes " The Long Tail , " in which Wired editor Chris Anderson contends the Internet makes it possible to no longer rely on hits ( most notably movies , books and music ) but to make big bucks by selling niche products along the tail of the demand curve .
" People are taking advantage of all of these powerful forces , " he said .
" The world is changing . "
The modern Digital Utopian uses the Internet constantly and extensively to share information and ideas at social networking sites and communities .
It all adds up to a shared experience , and a generally shared philosophy centered on technology and idealism .
And where there is a point of view , a counterpoint is sure to emerge .
The critics and the co-opters
Web 2.0 has inspired its share of critics , social commentators who wonder if something valuable may get lost in the online hubbub .
Can the community produce a collaborative decision ?
Not usually , Keen says , contending that often a great leader is needed to take charge , whether it 's Bismarck uniting Germany or Steve Jobs developing the iPod .
These things do n't happen by putting every decision up for a vote , like a California ballot measure .
Keen , who spurred the debate by coining the phrase Digital Utopian , runs a curmudgeonly blog , The Great Seduction , on the intersection of technology , media and culture , at andrewkeen.typepad.com .
Oddly enough , the Utopians may become victims of their own success .
While they advocate a world in which people can share content without concern for profit , much of what they are creating is becoming a tool of the corporate culture they decry .
MySpace , the most popular social networking site , is owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
YouTube , which was built so that people could share their videos with each other , has been bought by Google .
And even though Google 's motto is " Do n't be evil , " it is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to make money .
O'Reilly says this is the natural order of things .
He said the term came from the wreckage of the dot - coms several years ago .
Even though many businesses folded , the Internet continued to grow , mature and become more indispensable .
Yet while people , perhaps reacting to the greed that fueled the IPOs of the dot - com years , saw in Web 2.0 a chance to create a new collectivism , O'Reilly said , " I do n't see it that way at all . "
Web 2.0 , he says , is about business .
He says many tech movements start out with similar idealism , only to give way to capitalism .
For instance , O'Reilly says , Napster introduced file sharing , but now iTunes has people comfortable with paying for music online .
" You do a barn raising at a particular stage of society , " he said , " and then the developers come in .
...
It always happens that way . "
In Part One of this series , Boyd Multerer told us all about XNA .
Now , in Part Two , Frank Savage shows it all to us .
Frank will talk about XNA from his perspective , deploy an XNA project to an Xbox 360 , modify the application , and also give a debugging demonstration .
All of this is done at 1080 p , showing off both the 360's recently acquired ability to support this resolution , as well as the power of XNA .
It 's really quite amazing : High frame rates at 1080 p under managed code using only a single core of the three available .
I think it 's reasonable to say that XNA is going to change the way people do homebrew games .
It 's going to be interesting to see what kind of crazy stuff people dream up with these tools .
In addition to the nifty XNA bits , Frank and I also chitted and chatted about the good old days of gaming - he worked on Wing Commander III ( one of my favorites in the series ) , as well as other games that I loved in my childhood .
Never thought I 'd get to meet one of the people who worked on Wing Commander , so , for me , it was a thoroughly enjoyable geeky event
What are some of the characteristics of people who crank out blog titles that work really well most of the time ?
Is it something anyone can learn ?
Yes , and except in very rare cases , writing great post titles and other headlines can likely only be learned .
Rather than relying on natural talent , people who consistently produce winning headlines have learned to do three basic things :
1 . They understand that all compelling headlines make an intriguing promise that makes it almost irresistible to its target audience .
Understanding the intended audience is key — a really great headline generally wo n’t appeal to everyone , and watering it down for mass appeal will only hurt you .
2 . They study headlines that have been proven to work , and that usually means direct response advertising headlines .
In that context , “ proven to work ” means people responded to that particular headline by pulling out their wallets and making a purchase .
You can also learn by studying some of the top magazine headline writers , who work for Cosmopolitan and similar glossies , and even the tabloids you see at the supermarket checkout lane .
3 . Most importantly , rather than simply mimicking great headlines , they understand why the headline works , and therefore can make an educated decision as to which type of headline structure is most appropriate , and how to tweak it within a certain context .
So what about the title of the blog post you ’re reading right now ?
1. Starting off your post title with “ why ” at the beginning of a declarative statement ( instead of a question ) is one easy way to focus in on the benefit of reading your article .
That ’s one of the reasons why the title of this post works , but the words that follow the “ why ” are what ’s most important .
You can do the same by starting with “ here ’s why , ” “ what , ” “ when , ” or “ how , ” or you can simply make a strong statement that clearly demonstrates that the elaborated answer will be provided in the body content .
And of course a carefully worded question can magnetically draw in your intended readers as well .
2 . The title is modeled after this famous advertising headline :
Why Some People Almost Always Make Money in the Stock Market
Within the context of what I wanted to convey with this post , the basic structure of this classic headline works perfectly .
Why ?
3. Credibility .
The use of the word “ some , ” and having “ almost ” modify “ always , ” make the headline much more plausible .
Not even the highest paid copywriters in the world always nail a headline that works , and some people never write great post titles , because they do n’t take the time to learn how .
Many people feel that a great headline is bombastic and full of hyperbole , but that ’s usually not the case .
If people do n’t believe you can deliver on your promise , they wo n’t bother reading further , and your over - the - top headline fails .
As the people marketing their content via Twitter , Facebook , and other social networking sites up the ante with headlines that strain credibility , their results will diminish , while you ’ll gain an advantage by becoming a true student of great headline writing .
Understanding what type of headline is appropriate to a specific context is the real key to writing magnetic post titles that get your content embraced and shared .
This is the sixth installment in a series of posts called Magnetic Headlines .

Former congressman and star quarterback Jack Kemp once said that " … a distinction should be made that football is democratic , capitalist , whereas soccer is a European socialist sport , ” in a June 19 , 2006 column Kemp recanted ( well , sort of ) .
His new view is that " … I love soccer , but it 's still boring .
Oops , there I go again . "
In actuality , I rather liked Kemp 's column .
It 's witty in a tongue - in - cheek sort of way .
But is there a kernel of truth in his musings ( both old and new ) ?
Let 's consider the economic issues first .
Granted , Europe is generally more socialistic than America , but it is not the case in professional team sports .
Here are just a few distinctions :
Revenue sharing and salary caps .
Both are essentially wealth redistribution programs aimed at guaranteeing similar outcomes .
Imagine Toyota and GM sharing revenues with Ford and Nissan !
The latter example would be unthinkable in most industries yet it is the norm in football .
On the other hand , there is no revenue sharing in European soccer .
The most profitable soccer teams in the world , such as Manchester United , Real Madrid , and Milan , do not share revenues with soccer minnows .
Nor are there any salary or spending caps .
Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich purchased Chelsea , a middle of the road English soccer club , and proceeded to turn it into a European powerhouse by spending prodigious amounts of money on star players such as Frank Lampard , Didier Drogba of Ivory Coast , Michael Ballack of Germany , and Andei Shevchenko of Ukraine .
Many in England complained bitterly and still do , but as long as Mr. Abramovich has cash to spend no one can do anything to stop him .
Draft .
Another program aimed at equalizing outcomes .
In football , as well as in other American team sports , weaker teams are subsidized by allowing them to sign up the best young players at below market prices .
Think Vince Young , LeBron James , etc .
There is no draft in soccer .
Any club is welcome to join in the bidding for any player it wants and jack up the price — the sky is the limit .
Not so in American sports .
Consider the following example :
It is reported that Cleveland is prepared to offer LeBron 75 million dollars for five years , which is the maximum allowed amount .
Just imagine if there were no salary caps and any team could offer LeBron any amount it saw fit .
A hundred million , anyone ?
Two hundred perhaps ?
Instead , the current system subsidizes team owners at the players ' expense ( yes , I know that LeBron plays basketball , not football , but the system is similar ) .
Promotion / relegation .
Team owners in the NFL belong to a very exclusive , private club .
To gain entry , one must not only be very rich but get the members ' consent as well .
It is much easier to become a team owner in soccer .
First , since there is no revenue sharing , small market teams cost many times less than big market ones .
Second , there is the promotion / relegation mechanism .
This is how it works .
There is usually more than one soccer league in any country ( there are four in England ) .
Every year , a few top lower - league teams ( usually two ) are promoted to a higher - league , while the same number of bottom higher - league teams are relegated to the lower - league .
Lower - league teams are much , much cheaper than higher - league teams .
One can buy a lower - league team , hire a good coach , invest money and eventually see it promoted to the top league .
Since it is easier to become an owner of a soccer team , there is more competition than in football — does this sound socialist to you ?
Other issues :
Soccer is a European sport .
Soccer is not just European .
The top dog in soccer is Brazil .
Soccer has been the sport of Latin America for a long time .
It is also the top sport in Africa .
Ghana just beat the Czech Republic and the U.S. at the 2006 World Cup in Germany .
The African dream nowadays is to become a star soccer player , move to Europe and make a lot of money .
Many fine African players now star at top clubs in England , Spain , France , Italy , and virtually everywhere else in Europe .
Soccer is on the rise in Asia and even the U.S.
It is the only true world team sport .
Football is a democratic sport .
First , there is much coaching in football during games .
Since offence and defense are played by different players , coaches have many chances to direct the game .
Soccer is more fluid .
Coaches have fewer chances to influence the game .
There is only one break and the game has no long pauses .
Second , a quarterback calls every offensive play in football .
There is no such top - down management in soccer .
Soccer is boring .
I agree with Jack Kemp up to a point .
Yes , soccer is boring to a novice since it is indeed a slow and low - scoring game .
But , to an avid fan , there are many other things worth looking at .
On - the - ball skills , dribbling , deft passing , fearless tackling , movement of players without the ball — a thousand little things .
Soccer is boring to many Americans for the simple reason — lack of understanding of subtleties .
If you invest time and effort in figuring out these little things , soccer will amply reward you .

The curfew affects all vehicles and people on foot
The move affects both vehicles and pedestrians , a spokesman for the Iraqi prime minister said .
A senior Iraqi military spokesman said the curfew had been introduced due to specific intelligence about a series of planned car bomb attacks in Baghdad .
Sectarian violence and bombings have been increasing in the city , thought to coincide with the beginning of Ramadan .
Late on Thursday the brother - in - law of the new chief judge in Saddam Hussein 's trial was shot dead .
The curfew order was announced on state broadcaster Iraqiya .
" The government has decided to enforce a curfew on vehicles and individuals starting from Friday evening until 0600 on Sunday morning ( 0200 GMT ) , " the message said .
Vehicles have been barred from the Iraqi capital on a number of occasions in recent months .
A three - day curfew was put in place in Baghdad and three provinces in February after the bombing of an important Shia shrine sparked violent protests , but pedestrians were allowed to walk to mosques .
' Spike '
US and Iraqi troops have been reinforcing operations against insurgents and sectarian militias in Baghdad .
On Wednesday a US military spokesman said that there had been a spike in violence coinciding with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan , which began on Monday , and that suicide attacks were at record levels .
Judge Mohammad Oreibi al - Khalifa was appointed last week
He also said Iraqi security forces were " making a concerted effort " to end sectarian violence by targeting death squads .
Shortly after he spoke , 10 people were killed and 11 injured in a shoot - out at a Sunni mosque in the capital .
Shia and Sunni militia groups have increasingly been engaged in tit - for - tat attacks on each other since the al - Askari shrine was bombed in February .
A Sunni-led insurgency that erupted after the ousting of Saddam Hussein is also continuing .
On Thursday , gunman ambushed a car carrying Kadhem Abdul Hussein , the brother - in - law of Judge Mohammad Oreibi al - Khalifa , who is presiding over Saddam Hussein 's genocide trial .
Mr Abdul Hussein was killed outright and police said his son was injured .
We try not to get too political or alarmist here on Engadget -- especially when it comes to draft legislation that 's yet to make it far in congress -- but Gary Shapiro and the group he represents , the CEA ( you may have heard of them ? ) , are taking a stand against big content in America .
Sounds like someone 's hearing all the whining we ( all ) do about the overly restrictive DRM and fundamentally adversarial posturing the content industry has consistently taken against consumers and their devices .
A release issued by the CEA at Shapiro 's behest calls for the immediate passage of bill H.R. 1201 ( the Digital Media Consumers ' Rights Act of 2005 ) by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , on behalf of the HRRC ( Home Recording Rights Coalition ) .
Shapiro's on a crusade now , people , to tackle what he perceives as some very serious issues plaguing the industry today , like big content 's apparent enforcement of copyright as property law , and the " gross extension of copyright protection " keeping work from entering the public domain .
Whether H.R. 1201 is actually going turn up roses we do n't yet know , but it 's not like there 's anything to thing to stop the content companies -- and the CEA 's many members -- from lobbying against this bill , especially megacorps like Sony that play on both sides as content and device maker .

It ’s funny how times change .
When we started writing Subversion five years ago , CVS was the big evil beast that we were aiming to “ subvert ” .
These days , while Subversion still has a long way to go in performance and features , it has reached critical mass in the open source world .
The users@ list has thousands of subscribers and has become self - supporting .
Every major free operating system ships with a relatively recent version of subversion .
There are several books in the bookstore about Subversion .
Major projects like KDE , Apache , and GCC have switched to it , along with dozens of others .
When you run across an open source project using Subversion these days , it ’s no longer a novelty .
It ’s become the default safe choice for most new projects .
And now , lo and behold , a whole new generation of version control systems has appeared on the horizon : arch , codeville , monotone , bazaar - ng , svk , git , mercurial .
These are the new kids in town — the Distributed Version Control systems — and they aim to unseat the establishment .
Yes , you heard right : Subversion is now The Man .
I wonder when that happened ? 🙂
What makes this new generation of systems fundamentally different is that they take the idea of “ disconnected operations ” to the extreme .
Every user has an entire copy of the repository — 100 % of a project ’s history — stored on the local computer .
Each person is effectively an island onto themselves .
Users connect their private repostories together in any way they wish and trade changes like baseball cards ; the system automatically tracks which changes you have and which ones you do n’t .
There ’s something fresh and self - empowering about this model , because it ’s a superset of CVS and Subversion ’s traditional single - repository model .
An open source project can decide that exactly one repository is the Master , and expect all participants to push and pull changes from that master repository as needed .
Of course , a project can also organize itself into more interesting shapes : a tree - like hierarchy of repositories , a ring of repositories , or even just a randomly connected graph .
It ’s tremendously flexible .
Proponents of these systems tend to be a bit fanatical about their “ superiority ” over today ’s centralized systems .
Over and over , I hear testimonials like this :
“ It ’s great !
If I want to implement a new feature , I do n’t need to have commit access at all .
I have my own private copy of the repository , so I can write the whole thing by myself .
I commit changes to my private repository as often as I want until it ’s all finished .
Then I can present the whole thing to everyone else . ”
This user is describing a great convenience , but I view it in a slightly darker light .
Notice what this user is now able to do : he wants to to crawl off into a cave , work for weeks on a complex feature by himself , then present it as a polished result to the main codebase .
And this is exactly the sort of behavior that I think is bad for open source communities .
Open source communities need to work together .
They need to agree on common goals , discuss designs , and constantly review each other ’s work .
In the subversion community , we call the behavior above “ dropping a bomb ” .
It ’s considered anti-social and anti-cooperative .
Usually the new feature is so big and complex , it ’s nearly impossible to review .
If it ’s hard to review , then it ’s hard to accept into the main codebase , hard to maintain code quality , and hard for anyone but the original author to maintain the feature .
When this happens , we typically scold the person(s ) for not working out in the open .
Good Behavior , on the other hand , involves coming to the community with a design proposal .
After some discussion , we ask the developer (s ) to either ( 1 ) submit a series of patches as work progresses , or ( 2 ) give him ( or them ) a private branch to work on .
They need n’t have commit- access to the core code — a branch is all that ’s needed .
That way the larger community can review the smaller commits as they come in , discuss , give feedback , and keep the developers in the loop .
The main goal here is never to be surprised by some huge code change .
It keeps the community focused on common goals and aware of each other ’s progress .
So while most people say : “ is n’t it great that I can fork the whole project without anyone knowing ! ” My reaction is , “ yikes , why are n’t you working with everyone else ?
why are n’t you asking for commit access ? ”
This is a problem that is solved socially : projects should actively encourage side - work of small teams and grant access to private branches early and often .
I probably sound like Mr. Anti-Distributed - Version - Control , but I ’m really not .
It ’s definitely cool , and definitely convenient .
I just think it ’s something that needs to be used very carefully , because the very conveniences it provides also promote fragmentary social behaviors that are n’t healthy for open source communities .
For more on this subject , see this essay by Greg Hudson — it was the writing which originally had my head nodding on this topic .
Also relevant is Karl Fogel ’s excellent new book , Producing Open Source Software .
It ’s all about managing and promoting healthy open source developer communities .
How To Secure Windows , The Open Source Way
Many of us FOSS lovers get stuck behind a Windows box , some of us love the idea of FOSS but ca n’t seem to move off Windows .
We get stuck using proprietary anti-spyware tools , anti-viruses , browsers , and firewalls .
The open source community provides us with tools to get away from that finally .
But do n’t be mistaken , these tools are not perfect .
They are not competition for Ad - Aware , Spybot , AVG , Avast , Kaspersky , etc .. yet .
But if used properly along side of safe browsing habits you should n’t have much to worry about .
I ’ve gone for as much as 6 months using these tools and these tools alone , then went back and installed AVG and ran a scan and came up clean .
Spybot did pick up a few pieces of spyware though but only tracking cookies .
WinClam Anti-Virus
Based on Clam for Linux , this anti-virus will run on Windows 98-2003 .
The good side about clam is that it updates very regularly .
More so than any anti-virus I ’ve come across .
The bad side ?
No real time scanner ( but that can be fixed , see WinPooch below , and no heuristic - based detection . ) .
Another con , scheduled scans of large directories can take a very long time .
It does have right click scan integration with Windows Explorer though as well as integration into MS Outlook to detect viruses as they come in to your e-mail .
WinPooch
Winpooch is more focused on spyware and trojans .
It is a Windows watchdog , free and open source .
Anti spyware and anti trojan , it gives a full protection against local or external attacks by scanning the activity of programs in real time .
This application monitors your registry and main system folders for changes , and lets you approve or deny these changes .
If you go into winpooch settings , it has an option to hook an anti-virus , currently Clam is the only anti-virus I ’ve known for it to hook .
Once Clam is hooked into Winpooch , it turns clam into a real time scanner .
So say you ’re installing a program that drops some files in System32 , Winpooch will ask to you allow or deny this , and Clam will now scan those files for potential threats .
It ’s a rather seamless process .
Winpooch uses the API Hooking method .
It spies programs when they are running and gives to the user a powerful control of their activity .
For example , you can forbide a program to write in a system directory or in the registry , or else to connect to internet .
That makes the difference between others anti spywares using a database of known signatures .
Firefox
Now we all know that staying away from IE6 is a good thing , no matter if you ’re on IE7 , Opera , Firefox or something else for that matter , but Firefox ’s extensions afford us an opportunity the others do not .
ClamGlue :
is an extension that scans every downloaded file automatically with ClamWin and giving you the option to keep or delete the file .
Unfortunately they have not updated this to work with Firefox 2.0 , so it ’s still a 1.5. x thing folks .
NoScript
is an extension that allows JavaScript , Java and other executable content only for trusted domains of your choice , e.g. your home - banking web site .
This whitelist based preemptive blocking approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities ( known and even unknown ! ) with no loss of functionality .
CookieSafe :
This extension will allow you to easily control cookie permissions .
It will appear on your statusbar .
Just click on the icon to allow , block , or temporarily allow the site to set cookies .
You can also view or clear the cookies and exceptions by right clicking on the statusbar icon .
For safer browsing you may choose to deny cookies globally and then enable them on a per site basis .
SafeCache
This extension segments the cache on the basis of the originating document , defending against web privacy attacks that remote sites can use to determine your browser history at other sites .
For example , a b.com image appearing on an a.com page would have a separate cache entry from the same image appearing on a b.com page , so a.com cannot use timing techniques to determine if you have visited b.com before .
Checks cookie settings ( allow , originating site only , deny ) to determine your desired privacy level ( segmented cache , cache originating site only , or never cache ) .
SafeHistory
This extension restricts the marking of visited links on the basis of the originating document , defending against web privacy attacks that remote sites can use to determine your browser history at other sites .
A link on a.com pointing at b.com will only be marked visited if you previously visited the b.com page with a referrer in the domain of a.com .
On - site links work normally .
Checks cookie settings ( allow , originating site only , deny ) to determine your desired privacy level ( segmented by origin , do n’t mark links visited in offsite frames , or never mark links visited ) .
TdiFw Firewall
Now I personally just use the Firewall that ’s provided in SP2 .
I see no need for dual applications on my system , but many would like an open source alternative , and that ’s where TdiFw steps in ( horrid name ) .
It is a s a simple TDI - Based Open Source Personal Firewall for Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003 .
and I think that covers all of our bases .
Remember , no matter what tools you have installed the number 1 way to secure yourself is knowing what and what not to click on .
Point blank .
You can have the best tools out there , but nothing is going to replace safe browsing and downloading habits .
Also , if you ’d like to have an encrypted virtual disk to keep your data from prying eyes ( on a USB stick or on your hard - drive ) , be sure to check out my tutorial on installing TrueCrypt on Windows

Facing shocking allegations that he paid a gay prostitute for sex , prominent Colorado Springs pastor Ted Haggard placed himself on administrative leave Thursday from his church position and resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals , a platform that made him a rising star in conservative politics .
Haggard , 50 , said in a statement released by his 14,000 - member New Life Church that he could “ not continue to minister under the cloud created by the accusations made on Denver talk radio this morning . ”
In interviews over the past two days with KHOW talk radio , 9 News and The Denver Post , Michael Forest Jones , 49 , of Denver alleges he had sex on a monthly basis with Haggard over three years .
Jones claimed Haggard used the name “ Art , ” admitted he was married and used meth before the two had sex .
In an interview Wednesday with 9 News , Haggard denied he ’d used drugs or had gay sex , saying he ’s been faithful to his wife .
Haggard , who has five children , could not be reached for comment Thursday .
Late Thursday , The Associated Press reported that the acting senior pastor at New Life , Ross Parsley , told KKTV - TV of Colorado Springs that Haggard admitted some of the accusations were true , but Parsley did n’t elaborate .
The timing of the disclosure has stirred controversy , coming days before Colorado voters will decide on two measures related to gay rights and marriage .
Haggard is a chief supporter of Amendment 43 , which would define marriage as only between a man and a woman , and he has taken no position on Referendum I , which would grant domestic - partnership rights to same - sex couples .
Haggard is unquestionably a national figure .
Since founding New Life Church in his basement in the 1980s , the son of an Indiana veterinarian has ascended the ranks of evangelical leaders , taking part in White House conference calls , counseling foreign leaders and being named by Time magazine as one of the nation ’s 25 most influential evangelicals .
Martin Nussbaum , New Life Church ’s attorney , emphasized that Haggard ’s leave and an imminent inquiry into the matter by an outside church board should not be construed as an admission of guilt but rather in keeping with church policies .
Under church bylaws , an outside “ board of overseers ” investigates allegations of immorality , financial misdealings or teaching heresy , Nussbaum said .
The board has authority to discipline the senior pastor , remove him or restore him to ministry .
“ I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership so that the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity , ” Haggard said in his statement .
“ I hope to be able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date . ”
The overseers board is made up of the Rev. Larry Stockstill of Bethany World Prayer Center in Baker , La. , where Haggard worked as a youth pastor more than two decades ago ; the Rev. Mark Cowart of Church For All Nations in Colorado Springs ; the Rev. Tim Ralph of New Covenant Fellowship in Larkspur ; and the Rev. Michael Ware of Victory Church in Westminster .
“ We want to know the real truth , ” Ware said .
“ We obviously hope it ’s not true .
We want to be open , independent .
There ’s always two sides to a story . ”
Ware said the group has not met and has no timetable , and it ’s unclear what exactly the inquiry will involve .
Haggard was replaced on an interim basis by Parsley , who has worked in senior ministry in the church for 15 years .
“ People need to be patient and allow this process to unfold as it was designed to , ” Parsley said in a statement .
In a prepared statement Thursday , Focus on the Family founder James Dobson rapped the news media for reporting a rumor “ based on nothing but one man ’s allegation , ” referred to Haggard as a friend and suggested the timing of the story was meant to influence the outcome of the Amendment 43 vote .
“ ( Haggard ) has shown a great deal of grace under these unfortunate circumstances , quickly turning this matter over to his church for an independent investigation , ” Dobson said .
“ That is a testament to the character I have seen him exhibit over and over again . ”
Later Thursday , a news conference in downtown Colorado Springs that was to feature civic and religious leaders voicing support for Haggard was canceled for reasons that are unclear .
For 2 1/2 hours Thursday night , church elders met to discuss the situation .
One man , who did not identify himself , said the congregation expects Haggard will address them during weekend services .
At Haggard ’s home just a short drive from the church , a gate blocking the driveway was locked , and television crews set up across the road .
Jones told The Post that Haggard contacted him about three years ago through an ad Jones placed in a gay newspaper or on the website Rentboy.com .
Jones said Haggard introduced himself as being from Kansas City , but Jones said he later knew otherwise because his caller ID showed the calls as coming from Colorado Springs pay phones .
But he said he did n’t confront him because Haggard was a client .
They met at least once a month at Jones ’ Denver apartment , and Haggard paid cash , Jones said .
“ He was very nice and very soft - spoken , ” Jones said .
“ We never talked about anything heavy - duty . ”
Jones alleged Haggard snorted a small amount of methamphetamine that he brought with him at least a dozen times to enhance the sexual pleasure .
Haggard told 9
News he ’s never done drugs .
About six months ago , Jones said , he was watching TV when he saw a History Channel program on the Antichrist that included Haggard as an expert .
He researched Haggard on the Internet .
“ Once I pulled him up , I ’m going , ‘ He ’s big . ” ‘
Rob Brendle , an associate New Life pastor , said Haggard fought to make Amendment 43 only define marriage , breaking with other evangelical leaders who favored a broader measure barring domestic partnerships .
Haggard has said marriage deserves special status , while civil protections should be a separate issue .
“ He has been the person within the evangelical community in Colorado Springs , more than any other leader , been the defender of the rights of homosexuals with his work on the language of the amendment , ” Brendle said .
“ If there is a hammer who has been driving this nail , it ’s not Ted . ”
As for Jones ’ allegations , Brendle said , “ I have no question in my mind that everything this man says is false .
I know Ted to be a man of the utmost integrity and the highest moral character . ”

We have recently created example Angular.js web app with the minimal generic functionality .
Small enough to be called framework but with built - in test cases , controllers and several views with user forms .
The goal is to have a reusable foundation for Angular projects .
This blog post is about how we designed Angular Starter structure .
Part two of this posts is about consuming APIs with AngularJS .
Why Angular Starter
There are many tutorials on how to start application development with Angular.js .
As well as a good few projects on GitHub with the Angular app skeletons .
Like the angular - seed project created by Angular.js development team itself .
What we needed was a minimal project , with pre-built basic functionality and structure of communication with web services and APIs .
And of course automated test cases .
We wanted test cases to get some special attention as we are big fans of TDD ( test - driven development ) .
Having the majority of test cases created even before any app functionality is coded is a good help to keep those bugs away .
I have n’t found the open source project which completely match my requirements and Angular Starter was born .
It ’s an open source project , hosted on GitHub and I welcome all suggestions and comments .
What exactly is its structure and how it can help to start your Angular apps ?

The Islamists have made rapid advances this year
The Islamists have repeatedly declared Jihad , or Holy War on Ethiopia , accusing it of backing their rivals in Somalia 's interim government .
" This group represents a clear threat , " Mr Meles said in Ethiopia 's first prime minister 's question time .
Some fear a regional war , as Ethiopia 's rival Eritrea is seen as pro-Islamist .
The Union of Islamic Courts has denied claims by Ethiopia and the Somali government that it has links to al - Qaeda .
Some Islamist leaders want Somalia to take control of Somali - speaking areas of Ethiopia and Kenya .
Declaration of war
Mr Meles said he did not believe the peaceful path of negotiations with the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) was completely exhausted but he said they could not close their eyes or look the other way when the country was being attacked .
Opposition politicians said a resolution put forward by the ruling party calling on the house to back whatever moves the government thought necessary amounted to a declaration of war on Somalia .
A UN report this month accused Ethiopia and Eritrea , among other countries , of breaking an international arms embargo by supplying arms to Somalia .
The UIC further accuses Ethiopia of having thousands of troops backing government forces in Somalia .
Mr Meles has denied these claims but admits to having hundreds of military trainers in Somalia .
Eritrea equally denies claims that it has sent troops and weapons to the UIC .
Somalia 's interim government only controls a small patch of territory around the town of Baidoa .
NASA 's Voyager 1 has passed into the border region at the edge of the solar system and now is sending back information about this never - before - explored area , say scientists at the University of Maryland .
" We have confirmed , for the first time , that Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock on Dec. 16 , 2004 , " said Frank McDonald , a senior research scientist at the university 's Institute for Physical Science and Technology , and a coauthor on two of four Voyager 1 papers published in the Sept. 23 issue of Science .
The termination shock marks the beginning of a transition region at the edge of the solar system that is known as the heliosheath .
" Until now there has been debate among scientists on whether Voyager 1 had crossed the termination shock as early as 2002 or not until December 16 , 2004 , " said McDonald , who coauthored " Crossing the Termination Shock into the Heliosheath : Magnetic Fields , " and " Voyager 1 Explores the Termination Shock Region and the Heliosheath Beyond . "
Matthew Hill , George Gloeckler and Douglas C. Hamilton , scientists in the University of Maryland 's Space Physics Group were among the coauthors of a third article , " Voyager 1 in the Foreshock , Termination Shock and Heliosheath , " which presents other new observations on the spacecraft 's entrance into the heliosheath .
Gloeckler and his Space Physics group built the Low Energy Charged Particle ( LCEP ) instrument , one of the five main instruments on Voyager .
" The termination shock -- a shock wave in the solar wind , that marks the slowing of the supersonic solar wind to subsonic speed -- had been universally thought to be a prodigious accelerator of particles and our findings largely confirm that , " said Hill , a research scientist in the department of physics .
" This paper describes a remarkable increase in particle intensity with energetic characteristics unlike anything we have seen before .
In addition , the LECP instrument indirectly determines that the solar wind speed in the heliosheath is clearly sub-sonic . "
However , Hill explained that one very surprising finding was that certain particles called " anomalous cosmic rays " do not appear to be accelerated at the termination shock , or at least not in the area where Voyager 1 crossed .
This is despite the " near unanimity of opinion " among scientists that these rays would be accelerated .
" This finding has the potential to turn three decades of anomalous cosmic ray research on its head , " said Hill .
Solar Wind Blows Bubble around Solar System
Our sun is surrounded by a bubble known as the heliosphere ( " helio " means sun ) that extends well beyond the solar system 's outermost planets .
This bubble is formed by the solar wind ; electrically charged particles that blow out from the sun at a million miles per hour .
As the sun races around the center of our Milky Way galaxy at some 560,000 miles per hour , this bubble , or heliosphere , shoves through the clouds of dust , gas and charged particles that whirl between the stars .
At the outer edge of the heliosphere , is the heliosheath , a transition or border region where the solar wind is directly influenced by the pressure of the interstellar clouds through which our solar system travels .
Uncertainly about when Voyager 1 entered the heliosheath , stems from the fact that the exact location and size of this transition region are not static , but change based on the relative pressures of the solar wind and the opposing interstellar clouds .
The beginning of the heliosheath region is marked by the termination shock , the point at which the solar wind abruptly slows .
The termination shock gets its name from the shockwave produced by the slowing of the solar wind .
This shockwave is similar to the sonic boom that occurs on Earth when an airplane crosses the subsonic - supersonic barrier .
The outermost edge of the heliosheath is the heliopause , which marks the end of our solar system .
At the heliopause , the force or pressure of solar wind is stopped , balanced by that of the pressure from the interstellar clouds .
Beyond the Solar System
Voyager 1 and its twin spacecraft Voyager 2 are now part of a NASA Interstellar Mission to explore the outermost edge of the sun 's domain and beyond .
Both Voyagers are capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020 .
Maryland 's McDonald , who has worked on the voyager missions from the beginning , said Voyager 1 should reach the heliopause , or end of the solar system in the next eight to ten years .
" When we started none of us thought of this mission lasting this long .
Now it has gone 28 years , and there is no reason it can't go on for many more . "
When the Voyagers were launched in 1977 , their mission was to explore the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn .
However , after completing their initial assignments , the pair just kept going and going .
Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune , the only spacecraft to have visited these outer planets .
It now follows its twin and could cross the termination shock and enter the heliosheath by 2008 . "
The Voyagers each carry a message to any extraterrestrials they might encounter .
Each messages is carried by a phonograph record - a 12 - inch gold - plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth .
Experiments built by the University of Maryland space physics group are currently operating on 13 spacecraft , including the two Voyager spacecraft .
Other missions carrying the group 's sensors include Cassini , the Ulysses probe to the solar poles and near - Earth missions such as Geotail , the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer ( SAMPEX ) , WIND , the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) , and the Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) .

Brain scans have revealed how information we learn during the day is squirrelled away into long - term memory while we sleep .
During a good night 's rest , memories of recent events are shifted from one part of the brain to another , a process that is crucial for developing long - term memories , according to a report published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers , lead by Dr Philippe Peigneux at the University of Liege in Belgium , gave two teams the task of learning their way around a virtual 3D town by training them on a computer .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which can take repeated snapshots of activity in the brain , they witnessed people 's memories of how to navigate being transferred from a region of the brain that deals with remembering directions , the hippocampus , to a part that governs how we move , the striatum .
One of the teams was then told to stay awake all night , playing video games .
Two days later , both groups were again given brain scans , and the scans showed that the group which had rested well was using a different part of the brain to navigate around the virtual town , the striatum .
The sleep - deprived team was still using the hippocampus , suggesting that the information had not yet been committed to long - term memory .

My reasons for leaving Microsoft were the opposite of why I went to work there .
I arrived at Microsoft a scared kid just out of college .
I was desperate to start my life , and get out of debt .
During my senior year I interviewed with every software company I could find and was rejected by every one .
When graduation came I had no where to go so I moved into my girlfriend ’s apartment .
My friends left for new cities and the start of their adult lives , or swallowed more of their pride than I could , and moved in with the parents .
Soon my girlfriend left for the summer , studying half a planet away in Australia .
My only companion was my dog Butch .
We lived cheap together : ramen noodles and dog bones .
I paid the bills writing chapters for technical books , and essays for magazines .
At night I ’d escape by poking at a novel that would never see the light of day .
For years I ’d been following the plan given to me : go to high school , go to college , get a job .
From day one of kindergarten onward there was always a next step waiting .
The choices were easy and safe : which classes , which activities , which universities .
But an hour after my college graduation , sitting alone in an empty apartment on Beeler street in Pittsburgh , there were no more choices laid out for me .
There was nothing .
I confronted my future as a kind of void for the first time and was terrified .
I ’d never understood that emptiness , despite seeing its effect on older friends and my older brother .
Until I was sitting alone surrounded by it , without the defense of a plan or a friend , I had no idea how frightening it was .
So that July , when I was invited to Seattle for a second chance at Microsoft ( I ’d been rejected the first time ) , it was a godsend .
No one else was calling .
The night before my interview , too nervous to sleep , I drove my rented Geo Metro all over Seattle .
The long stretches of tall pine trees and the wide clean streets looked to me , a boy raised in Queens , like a foreign country .
Everything in Seattle was neat and safe , and so quiet .
I drove slowly through the night , afraid of getting in trouble just for being there .
Before heading to my hotel , I went to the Microsoft campus , a long stretch of 3 story buildings on shallow green hills , laid out between forests and sports fields .
I stopped by one of the basketball courts and stepped out of the car , taking it in .
I doubted I ’d ever see that place again .
After a year at Microsoft , around 1995 , I became a program manager on the Internet Explorer web browser project .
I was paid well to lead smart people in the making of software used by millions of people .
Some of the dreams I had as a computer science student , the idea of designing something many people would use , had come true .
Before I knew it I was in my mid-twenties , was promoted to a team leader , and was rewarded for being as smart and creative as I could be .
Soon I managed others , and years later would have the role of teaching other teams of engineers what I ’d learned .
But when my ten year mark at Microsoft was n’t far away , I felt the return of the emptiness I ’d felt on graduation day .
This time the void was n’t about what was outside me , it was about what was going on inside .
I questioned what I was doing with my time on the planet .
Dreams of my college years had been fulfilled , and if I did n’t make big changes soon , I knew I ’d be repeating myself .
There were other challenges I wanted , and I became terrified of spending my life like a sad , confused bird of prey , circling the same territory over and over again , never understanding why there was nothing new to find .
I needed a new situation to jump into and despite what my manager ’s and peers said , I knew I could n’t do that while working in the same place .
I had to move on .
I was surprised to find that even though I was ten years older , my fears about the big unknowns were just as scary as before .
But when I measured my fears about staying , I found they were stronger than those about leaving , so I left .
So I chose to leave Microsoft less for reasons of escaping a particular place or group of people , but more to seek out a new set of circumstances to live in .
Just like I sought out Microsoft to escape my fears of the post - college emptiness , I looked to leave Microsoft to create not a void , but a new space to grow in : one of my own choosing .
I ran to Microsoft to escape my fears of failure .
I left Microsoft to define my own idea of success .
I pulled out the beaten up novel , and the half written essays , and planned a life around the writing of things , the deepest , scariest , truest dream I had .
How long I ’ll last , I do n’t know .
Success with a writing life , even on my own terms , is harder to come by than with software .
But its been over a year now and I have n’t looked back .
You may be paid more ( or less ) than you think
Economists quantify the salary value of four key factors that determine job satisfaction .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) �
It 's so hard to put a price on happiness , is n't it ?
But if you 've ever had to choose between a job you like and a better - paying one that you like less , you probably wished some economist would get on the stick and tell you how much job satisfaction is worth .
Quiz
Take the quiz
Do you deserve a raise ?
Before asking , know your strengths and weaknesses .
1 . If you left the company , how easy or hard would it be for the company to replace you ?
Easy Hard
This quiz is adapted from Are You Paid What You 're Worth ? , by Michael O'Malley ( Broadway Books , $ 15 ) .
Well , you 're in luck .
Economists John Helliwell and Haifang Huang at the University of British Columbia have done just that .
Their estimates are based on an analysis of life satisfaction surveys that consider four key factors of job satisfaction .
Trust in management is by far the biggest component to consider .
Say you get a new boss and your trust in management goes up a bit at your job ( say , up one point on a 10 - point scale ) .
That 's like getting a 36 percent pay raise , Helliwell and Huang calculate .
In other words , that increased level of trust will boost your level of overall satisfaction in life by about the same amount as a 36 percent raise would .
Conversely , if you lose some trust in management , the decline in your job satisfaction is like taking a 36 percent pay cut .
Having a job that offers a lot of variety in projects , Helliwell and Huang found , is the equivalent of a 21 percent hike in pay .
Having a position that requires a high level of skill is the equivalent of a 19 percent raise .
And having enough time to finish your work is the equivalent of an 11 percent boost in pay .
The raise equivalents Helliwell and Huang found are certainly impressive .
After all , when was the last time you got a 36 percent raise ?
But , in fact , while a big raise can make you happier it only does so in small measure .
Helliwell notes that moving from the bottom to the top of the income scale is only likely to boost your overall satisfaction with life by less than a point on a 10 - point scale .
A 10 percent raise will only boost your inner Dr. Feel Good by a small fraction of one point .
And let 's not even discuss the infinitesimal effect of a 3.5 percent raise � which employers gave average performers last year .
So , apparently , if you have to work , you might as well do something you like because the money alone wo n't make you that happy .
But we already knew that , did n't we ?
On the other hand , there is evidence to suggest that if you keep a happy disposition you 're likely to do better at work financially , regardless of how satisfying your job is .
And if happiness is really your goal , there are cheap ways to get it .
Among them , love , sex , exercise and sleep .

Big Brother Comes to School :
Telling Teachers
What to Read and What to Believe by Jamie McKenzie ( about author ) © 2005 , Jamie McKenzie , all rights reserved .
In some school districts , sites are blocked and filtered if they address important political issues like the federal education law , NCLB .
These filters are not always even handed in their blocking of sites and end up steering both adults and children to read a particular political point of view .
It is fundamentally undemocratic and probably illegal for a school district to determine which political points of view are acceptable and which are not .

This photograph of General Grant is meant to portray a " high horse " as in " get off your high horse " as when someone is preaching , imposing their beliefs on others or taking away ( other people 's ) liberties .
When one group or person ( a technician , a technology director , a superintendent or a Board of Education ) decides what others should read and think , they are exceeding their proper role and probably violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
While quick to defend their actions in terms of values , they show a profound misunderstanding of the law , the Constitution and basic American beliefs about freedom of speech and freedom of access to information .
They assume their values are the " correct " values and should prevail .
Heavy handed control of information is associated with fascism and dictatorship .
At a time when the United States government is urging the spread of freedom to new geographical areas , it would be fitting to practice freedom here at home .
No Teacher Allowed to Read
The practice of unfairly blocking teachers ( and students ) from reading politically oriented materials came to this author 's attention when a teacher from a school district in California e-mailed complaining about her district 's filtering of an FNO Press journal and Web site criticizing NCLB ( http://nochildleft.com).
The district and its filtering company allowed teachers to access and read the highly partisan marketing efforts and advocacy on behalf of NCLB issued by the outgoing Secretary of Education but blocked the reading of materials critical of NCLB .
Even though the Department had been caught paying a journalist to promote its agendas and even though the Department has a very large PR budget advocating NCLB to parents , teachers and others through Web sites and press releases , the district and the filtering company , SonicWALL left the Department 's blatant advocacy unfettered while blocking criticism of " No Child Left . "
This unbalanced filtering is damaging .
It is wrong when school districts and their corporate allies take sides on political issues .
If the filtering company allows political advocacy from government Web sites selling the agendas on education , Social Security , war , Arctic drilling and budget deficits while filtering opponents of these policies , they are violating sacred American traditions of fair play and freedom .
They are taking sides .
They are subtly engaging in mind control .
They are indirectly endorsing certain policies while silencing opposing points of view .
When the superintendent of this district was contacted and asked to stop filtering the material , he never replied .
Instead , he delegated the problem to a middle school principal who first denied that it was happening .
The screen shot below proves that it was happening on the very day the principal denied it .
When asked to stop filtering information critical of NCLB , the district administrators lapsed into silence .
As this issue goes to print , they have not paid the editor the courtesy of a response other than the original ( false ) denial and a one line message from the principal ( see below ) .
Denying Responsibility
What makes this episode in censorship especially pernicious is the refusal of each party to take responsibility for the censorship .
When contacted and asked to stop filtering " No Child Left , " the top PR person for SonicWALL issued the following statement : Dear Mr McKenzie
I have been in contact with our content filtering area , and they have
given me the following response for you .
" In fact , your comments do not accurately reflect the services that we
provide .
Our content filtering service only categorizes web sites .
Individual users , such as school districts , then make independent
decisions concerning whether such content should be blocked or not .
In
your message , you indicate that teachers in some districts are not able
to read your articles .
We recommend that you contact those school
districts directly to have them reconsider their blocking policy to
enable your materials to be read . "
I hope you will find this helpful .
Best regards
Mary McEvoy
This response from SonicWALL is a dodge .
SonicWALL invents the list of blocked sites .
They decide who gets filtered .
They do not explain their criteria and do not reveal which sites are blocked .
Most clients could not thoughtfully select which sites to block if SonicWALL does not tell them .
The default setting for blocking sites is determined by the company and the school district electing this filter is complicit .
The company puts responsibility on the school district while the school district subscribes to a service that blocks sites the school district may not have thought about in any sense .
When this editor sent the above screen shot to the principal as evidence that his denial was wrong , instead of an apology , the principal fired back a one liner . . .

Filtered for political reasons ???
Where do you get off saying that !!
The screen shot says very clearly , " Reason for restriction . . .
Forbidden Category : Political / Advocacy Groups . "
Why Censorship ?
How does this filtering qualify as censorship ?
The filtering is unfair and unbalanced .
The filtering company and its client school district have blocked teachers from reading articles critical of the federal educational law called ( inaccurately ) " No Child Left Behind " by blocking access to a Web site critical of the law , http://nochildleft.com while allowing access to sites promoting the policy ( advocacy ) such as proponents in the Department of Ed .
If a reader does a Google search for " No Child Left Behind , " the list is dominated by proponents .
The filtered site http://nochildleft.com comes in third .
It is strongly and openly opposed to NCLB , critical of its impact on schools and proud of its opposition to an ill - considered faulty policy .
Teachers in some districts are not allowed to read the criticism until they are home .
When they are at work , they must read the party line .
Teachers need to read more than one side , but if they work in districts that have chosen the political advocacy filter from SonicWALL , they may only reach Web sites that are enthusiastic supporters of NCLB .
The filtering company and its client school district allow teachers to read every one of the first 30 sites except for the one site that is clearly opposed to NCLB and an article from Mother Jones , " No Child Left Unrecruited . "
All the " allowed " sites except for the NEA either endorse NCLB or are neutral .
This kind of filtering is censorship .
It is a subtle but dangerous attempt at mind control .
What Freedom ?
Should teachers and students be able to visit Web sites that argue for social and political policies of various kinds from several points of view ?
It would seem to be an unalienable right .
Citizenship involves weighing opposing viewpoints .
It is American to brook dissent .
Should a school district block teachers and students from reading certain political and social points of view while allowing access only to opposing points of view ?
It would seem to be a gross violation of fundamental rights .
If blocking political advocacy sites , at least the district should be fair and even - handed .
This photograph shows Constitution Hall where the Bill of Rights was forged and agreed upon long ago .
The photograph was shot on February 25 , 2005 from the room where the Liberty Bell is kept safe .
The curtains were drawn against a bright sun , creating a filter of sorts preventing us from seeing the Hall clearly , obscuring the place where Americans first agreed upon fundamental rights in the Declaration and then in the Constitution .
Infiltrating the Public Schools
While the filtering companies claim that they are even - handed in their filtering , most of them refuse to reveal either their lists of blocked sites or the criteria they use for filtering .
This makes it difficult to evaluate the truth of their claim .
It also makes it difficult for a school district to make an informed decision if they select one of the political filters .
What are they buying ?
It is impossible to tell .
Yet the company claims each district is making an informed choice of which sites to filter .
How can that be if they are not provided with a list of the sites blocked ?
When looking at sites considering government policies , if government sites promoting and advocating those policies are left unfettered while opposing sites are usually filtered under a political advocacy claim , a company is effectively endorsing one set of policies while rejecting another .
The definition of advocacy is then tilted to favor the government and party in power over those who have contrasting points of view .
What can you do ?
1 . Make sure such filters are not operating in your school district .
2 . Ask your administration and Board of Education to take a stand against such political filtering .
3 . Contact SonicWall and let them know how you feel about their filtering .
E-mail their PR person , Mary McEvoy at mmcevoy@SonicWALL.com .
4 . Remain vigilant as new technologies arrive and offer services that may undermine fundamental liberties .

If only I could 've been there to stand up and clap :
" Why are you such a bunch of big girls ? " asked Birch .
" Why do n't you tell the content owners to just get stuffed ? "
He continued unabated : " You 're too seduced by the content industry , Hollywood is not even a $ 10 billion industry .
Hollywood is small compared to the telecom industry .
Why do n't you take a stronger line ?
Consumers do n't want DRM at all .
You ca n't sell DRM . "
Thus the EET reports the outburst of audience member David Birch , who stood up during the Q&A part of a panel on DRM at the 3GSM conference in Barcelona and let rip at the telecom industry panelists .
David Benjamin , who filed the story for the EET , reports that Birch also told the panelists that telecommunications industry is 15 times the size of the content industry .
In a later column at the EET , Spencer Chin approvingly cites the story of Birch 's outburst , and manfully ( though not entirely successfully ) attempts to laud Birch for " stirring the pot " while simultaneously censuring name - calling at professional conferences .
I say bring on the name - calling .
In fact , if Mr. Birch happens to read this post , we 'd like to formally offer to let him have the mike for a moment so that he can preach , heckle , and harangue a bit more in a guest editorial on content vs. the carriers .
Just drop us an email .
For my part , the coverage of Birch 's rant definitely got me thinking .
The total cost of Peter Jackson 's King Kong was somewhere north of US $ 200 million .
That 's quite a bit , but such big - budget blockbusters are rare , and you can make and market a Hollywood movie for well under half that figure .
Indeed , Brokeback Mountain had a production budget of only US $ 14 million .
In the tech industry , the price of a new fab is currently around US $ 5 billion , a price that puts such facilities out of reach for all but the biggest players like Intel and IBM .
Still , that 's 25 King Kongs , or over 350 Brokeback Mountains , or 1,000 five million dollar episodes of a big - budget HBO series like Rome or The Sopranos .
My point is that , for even just half the price of a single 65nm fab , the tech industry could buy a few small studios and just start throwing tons of free content at the world .
Or , for the full price of a fab , they could fund almost a decade worth of low - and medium - budget content to give away as an inducement for people to buy hardware .
Intel , IBM , and other tech companies with large investments in Linux know full well that you can sell a lot of hardware by giving away the software .
Why not give away the content too ?
How many dollars worth of media center , home networking , and home network attached storage hardware could you sell if consumers knew that there were terabytes of free , unencumbered , high - definition , processor - intensive , storage - hungry , bandwidth burning , digital content awaiting them on the Internet — content that they could copy , share , and shuffle around among as many newly purchased media devices as they like ?
I 'll freely admit that 90 % of what I know about the cost of Hollywood movies and TV shows I learned from Google over the past two hours .
I 'll also admit that drawing big - picture conclusions about how the tech industry could crush the movie industry based on a comparison of the cost of a fab to the cost of some movies and TV shows has a certain " late night dorm room bull session " quality to it .
Nonetheless , I stand by my general claim that , for the price of what a single tech company invests in a single new fab , the hardware and telecommunications industries as a whole could dump enough free digital content on the world to fuel a very profitable explosion in consumer hardware purchasing .
So c'mon , tech industry .
Why let Hollywood push you around and , even worse , hold hostage tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in potential sales ?
If investments in open source can pay off in server hardware sales , why could n't investments in free movies and music pay off in home entertainment , networking , and storage hardware sales ?
Think I 'm smokin ' crack with this idea ?
Skeptical that low - to moderate - budget , freely available alternatives to Hollywood - produced content would magically translate into increased consumer and infrastructure hardware sales ?
Find it unlikely that tech companies , who can't even seem to produce advertising that 's entertaining and attractive , could ever fund a TV show or movie that you 'd actually want to watch ?
Drop into the discussion thread and tell me why .

ENOUGH with the organized snacks .
When did this start anyway ?
I ’m at my 7 - year - old ’s soccer game .
The game ends and this week ’s designated “ snack parent ” produces a ginormous variety pack of over - processed chips and an equally gargantuan crate - cum - cooler .
Our children swarm like something out of the climactic scene in “ The Day of the Locust . ”
Do our kids need yet another bag of Doritos and a juice box with enough sugar to coat a Honda Odyssey ?
Ca n’t they just finish playing and have some water ?
Call me a spoilsport , but I do n’t want to bring a team snack .
I hate that first day , when the coach ’s spouse passes around the sign - up sheet so we can schedule what parent brings the communal snack on what day .
It ’s too much pressure .
Suppose I ’m away ?
Suppose we want to visit relatives and miss that week ?
Now we have to find “ snack coverage . ”
And heaven forbid you forget altogether and then the little darlings look longingly for the expected goody and you ’re the social pariah who did n’t come through and that one mom , the one who always has the perfect after - school arts ’ n ’ crafts project , gives you the disapproving eye and head shake .
The scheduled snack is yet another way we cater to our child ’s every whim .
Guess what ?
Precious can go an hour — maybe more ! — without eating .
And if your child ca n’t make it that long , bring your own snack .
Feed your kid ’s need , not mine .

Chapter 4 . Part 2 : Selling Bazaar to Cathedral and Linux Gold Rush ( 1997 -2000 )
( 1997 )
Welcome to the hotel California
Such a lovely place ...
Eagles
In 1997 Linus moved from Finland to a California startup Transmeta in order to experience the " extreme other side " of computer programming -- that of a high - tech start - up and as a side effect to become rich ( his explicitly stated goal , and he definitely managed to achieve it in less than three years ) .
Later in his interview to NYT he tried to avoid answering the question how " make money fast " craze affected him in Silicon Valley :
Since you moved to Silicon Valley from Finland in 1997 , how has the region 's aggressive approach to money - making affected you ?
Oh , how I hate that question .
I 've actually found the image of Silicon Valley as a hotbed of money - grubbing tech people to be pretty false , but maybe that 's because the people I hang out with are all really engineers .
They came here because this is where the action is .
You go out for dinner , and all the tables are filled with engineers talking about things that wo n't be available to ' ' normal people ' ' for a few years .
If ever .
In reality Linus decided to struck while the iron was hot , getting into the US " Internet IPO " boom before the bubble burst .
Aided by mass " Internet boom " hysteria , Linus and many others – from books authors to snail oil salesmen – were happy to became rich from the greatest XX century 's stock bubble .
Bob Metcalf was the first who understood this transformation of the former revolutionary into a " make - money - fast " , personal enrichment comes first type ( pigs in Orwell terminology ;-) .
In his Feb 2000 column
If open - source software is so much cooler , why is n't Transmeta getting it :
.. .Am I the only one to see that Torvalds and other open - source software revolutionaries are acting out the finale of George Orwell 's Animal Farm ?
Orwell 's farmhouse is full of open - source pigs , which are now almost indistinguishable from the proprietary humans they recently overthrew .
It 's true that I have been unkind to the " open sores " movement .
But to be clear , anyone is welcome to beat Microsoft with better software , even a utopian community of volunteer programmers .
May the best software win .
And do n't get me wrong , even if he disappoints Richard Stallman by not always referring to GNU / Linux , Torvalds is a genuine hero of the open - source revolution .
But with Torvalds saying some animals are more equal than others , why is the sanctimonious open - source press still cheering him on ?
Are the likes of Slashdot.org , just gobbled by VA Linux , also porking out in Orwell 's farmhouse ?
Torvalds wrote and now controls Linux , the open - source operating system , due this summer in Version 2.4 .
By day , he is a programmer at Transmeta .
Transmeta just announced Crusoe , its low - power microprocessors for mobile computers .
The architecture of Crusoe chips is based on VLIW ( very long instruction words ) .
It has " code morphing " to convert and cache software in speedy VLIW codes .
And it comes with Mobile Linux , with Linux extensions for power management .
According to Transmeta , Crusoe is two - thirds software and one - third hardware .
So what I want to know is , if open - source software is so cool , and if Torvalds " gets it , " why is n't Crusoe open source ?
For a start , why are n't the Crusoe chip 's mask sources published for modification and manufacture by anyone ?
And yes , Mobile Linux is open source , but not the " code morphing " software Torvalds helped write .
Transmeta has taken the phrase Code Morphing as its proprietary trademark .
And what the code does , according to Transmeta , has been ... patented .
Worse , Crusoe is touted for running Intel X86 software , and in particular , Microsoft Windows .
Does n't the open - source community say Windows is beneath contempt ?
Torvalds showed up at LinuxWorld Expo touting open source , of course , but then went on to revise two of its bedrock principles .
Torvalds talked at LinuxWorld about fragmentation -- the emergence of too many Linux versions .
Being old enough to have watched Unix fragment during the 1980s , I worry .
But instead of holding to the party line that Linux will not fragment , Torvalds now says there is bad fragmentation and good .
One can assume , because he's in charge of both , Transmeta 's Mobile Linux will fragment Linux 2.4 , but in a good way .
Then Torvalds talked about commercial companies , which are n't so bad after all : Take for example Transmeta .
His audience , packed with employees , friends , and family of newly public Linux companies , did not boo him back out into the barnyard .
Where is the outrage ?
So just to keep Torvalds honest , I 'm thinking that Crusoe chips , which are mostly software , should be open source and basically free .
Chips have to be manufactured -- with white coats , ovens , and stuff -- so maybe it should be OK to sell open - source Crusoe for the cost of its silicon , trace metals , media , and manuals ...
Since early 1996 , shameless opportunists have sprung up across the country and across the Internet , ready to take advantage of the America newfound spirit of " webalization " .
While making money by fooling others is reprehensible , we can assume that many of these snake - oil salesmen like Bob Young and Larry Augustin were just gifted Ponzi scheme manipulators that just waited for the opportunity to strike gold from the fools and for whom this Internet boom was the last and only opportunity to become rich .
They were not real sharks .
The real sharks here were the investment banks and venture funds .
And this period was the first when regulations adopted during Great Deal were substantially weaken and agencies that were formally responsible for control on financial oligarchy behavior were weakened and emasculated .
Fed was in the hands of shameless opportunist Greenspan who under the pretext of free market and deregulation was selling the country to financial oligarchy .
For the latter dot - com boom was a perfect opportunity to redistribute country wealth in their own favor .
Greed is good was the slogan of the day .
This wealth redistribution mechanism worked via numerous venture and hedge funds that were created to attract money and extract rent for the casino owners which were investment banks .
With skillful propaganda , money were just flowing like water into all sorts of " Internet funds " as well as the small and mostly unprofitable Internet start - ups .
In 2011 in her article in NYT Evelyn Rusli and Verne Kopytoff gave the following assessment of this giant Ponzi scheme ( Is It a New Tech Bubble Let 's See if It Pops ) .
Note the Goldman Sacks , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were active players in creating and milking this Ponzi :
In 1998 , Goldman Sachs Capital Partners , the bank 's private equity arm , began a new , $ 2.8 billion fund largely geared toward Internet stocks .
Before that fund , the group had made fewer than three dozen investments in the technology and communications sectors from 1992 to mid-1998 , according to Goldman Sachs documents about the fund .
But between 1999 and 2000 , the new fund made 56 technology - related investments , of about $ 27 million on average .
In aggregate , the fund made $ 1.7 billion in technology investments -- and lost about 40 percent of that after the bubble burst .
( The group , which manages the money of pensions , sovereign wealth funds and other prominent clients , declined the opportunity to invest in Facebook early this year . )
Philip A. Cooper , who in 1999 was head of a separate Goldman Sachs group that managed fund of funds and other investments , recalled that investors were clamoring , " We want more tech , we want more . "
Bowing to pressure , he created a $ 900 million technology - centric fund in 1999 , and within eight weeks he had nearly $ 2 billion in orders .
Despite the frenzy , he kept the cap at $ 900 million .
" There was a lot of demand , but we could n't see any way we could prudently put that much capital to work , " said Mr. Cooper , who has since left Goldman .
Other Wall Street firms , including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley , also made a number of small to midsize investments during the period .
In 1999 , for instance , Morgan Stanley joined Goldman Sachs and others in a $ 280 million investment in CarsDirect.com , which scrapped its initial plans to go public when the market deteriorated .
" We thought we were going to double our money in just a couple of weeks , " said Howard Lindzon , a hedge fund manager of Lindzon Capital Partners and former CarsDirect.com investor .
" No one did any due diligence . "
Mr. Lindzon lost more than $ 200,000 on his investment .
Also in 1999 , Chase Capital Partners ( which would later become part of JPMorgan Chase ) invested in Kozmo.com -- an online delivery service that raised hundreds of millions in venture funding .
JPMorgan Chase , which just recently raised $ 1.2 billion for a new technology fund , at the time called Kozmo.com " an essential resource to consumers . "
At its height , the company 's sprawling network of orange bike messengers employed more than a thousand people .
Less than two years later , it ceased operations .
An online grocer , Webvan , was one of the most highly anticipated I.P.O.'s of the dot - com era .
The business had raised nearly $ 1 billion in start - up capital from institutions like Softbank of Japan , Sequoia Capital and Goldman Sachs .
Goldman , its lead underwriter , invested about $ 100 million .
On its first day , investors cheered as Webvan 's market value soared , rising 65 percent to about $ 8 billion at the close .
Less than two years later , Webvan was bankrupt .
About the same time , Internet - centric mutual funds burst onto the scene .
From just a handful in early 1999 , there were more than 40 by the following year .
One fund , the Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies fund , made its debut in late March 2000 -- near the market 's peak -- with $ 1.1 billion in assets .
About one year later , the fund , with returns down about 70 percent , was closed and folded into another fund .
" We all piled into things that were considered hot and sexy , " said Paul Meeks , who was the fund 's portfolio manager .
Mr. Meeks started six tech funds for Merrill Lynch from 1998 to 2000 .
The period of explosive commercialization of Linux startups and Torvalds can probably be considered as the towing figure , the banner of all Linux " get money fast " IPO schemes .
As we mentioned before Torvalds never passed his rights to FSF : the practice that Stallman usually rigorously enforced .
Therefore in some sense he from the beginning was a dissident in the camp of fanatic pro-GPL zealots , the leader of his own cult .
He definitely does not like to be a follower of Stallman or anybody else and wanted to play his own game in order to became rich and famous .
And he probably was right about the " extreme other side " that he wanted to experience , but in a quite different meaning of this word .
One thing that he experienced very soon is that he is no longer a free software developer .
Actually he became more of a pawn in the hands of executives of major investment banks and venture firms as well as suits from Intel , IBM , and Oracle .
And those people were able to explain to Linus what is good and what is bad for his beloved OS with a pretty convincing arguments like stock options ( BTW Intel & IBM were the major and early investors in Red Hat and VA Linux ) , speech arrangements and other valuable perks .
And there were , of course , pretty funny things that waited for him when Linux became kind of " theater of absurd " .
For example , when Oracles ' Ellison spent an hour in front of 1,000 programmers in San Francisco talking about the merits of free software .
That 's right .
A man who became as rich as Croesus by selling his database software for thousands of dollars per CPU told this standing - room - only audience that their practice of sharing code for Linux ( and charging nothing for it ) was a good thing .
Moreover , Linus Torvalds ' beloved Linux ( and he himself ) soon will be associated with the worst charlatans of the Internet bubble .
The sad fact is that Linus did a lot of PR work to help to ensure that the record for an IPO 's opening - day gain belongs to VA Linux .
The latter shot up 700 % , to $ 239.25 a share , when it hit the market on Dec. 9 , 1999 .
Three year later , renamed VA Software , traded for about $ 1 . Eliot Spitzer , the New York attorney general , later has exposed the way Wall Street analysts promoted lousy " Linux " companies to win additional investment banking business .
And Linus Torvalds participation in this game of deception is undeniable fact : he willingly adopting the role of cheerleader .
First of all " corporate sponsors " made it clear that they need Linux on servers ( IBM wanted to fight Sun and Microsoft , but probably more Sun than Microsoft ; the same was true for Intel ) .
Therefore , despite Linus previous convictions , Linux on desktop became No.2 task and from now on Linux will be developed mainly as a server OS .
Talks about Linux on desktop will continue for next several years and interesting applications for Linux will emerge , but there is not much money on the desktop and it's money that ( in a subtle way via Linux startups that are financed by Intel , IBM and other large companies ) determine the actual direction of Linux development .
To reuse old cliché of the Clinton campaign " it 's money , stupid " .
Volunteers are welcome , but they does not matter .
Second , they made him a poster boy for both Linux commercial promotion and for anti-Microsoft campaign .
Much later in his 1992 interview to BBC World Linus said that he is pretty happy to play this role :
" In a way it is fun .
I 'm pleased to be a poster boy .
It gives me some self - importance , " he said .
He would not , however , want to become personally involved in the dispute with Microsoft .
" I 've tried to stay out of the Microsoft debate .
If you start doing things because you hate others and want to screw them over the end result is bad , " he said .
If the period when Linus controlled the direction of Linux development ever existed , it definitely come to end .
Not only he became " a developer for hire " that barely understand the code of some subsystems that he incorporates into the kernel ( see more about it in discussion of v.2.4 problems ) , he become " a hired gun " in an ultra-secret and ultra-closed organization .
Yes , he still can make an important decisions and yes he still can optimize kernel the way he liked ( and sometimes cutting chunks of necessary code that he considered " raw " , but that was necessary for the future development of a particular subsystem ) .
But what and when should included in the kernel is now a different story .
In a sense he became a prisoner of his own project .
The selection of features from which he can chose is no longer controlled by him .
And the first such feature that he previously objected against that that now became almost No. 1 priority was SMP .
Another thing that he probably cannot predict at this time was that he and his beloved OS will become the core of several crazy Linux IPO that enriched few members of Linux community ( including Linus Torvalds himself ) , but was a huge rip - off for many naive open source supporters .
As we will see in 2001 he more and more looks like a guy on the former girlfriend wedding party .
As for Transmeta experience he probably can attest that the company was able to transform a former " free developer " into some mixture of a developer , a marketer and a ceremonial figure suitable for keynote addresses and product launches .
And Transmeta was interested in Linus as a PR figure probably much more than in his technical abilities as a kernel developer .
Formally Linus became just a staff engineer in Transmeta to lead the development of Linux for a supersecret ( at this time ) Transmeta 's Intel - compatible chip .
But a far more important role that he was assigned was the role to chief PR person for Transmeta and here his journalistic upbringing was a huge asset for this startup that has nothing to do with Linux per se and from technical standpoint was more in the camp of VM developers than monolithic kernel developers .
Transmeta probably gave him an offer that he cannot refuse as at this time he seems rejected several other excellent offers including one from Steve Jobs :
A lot of folks in Silicon Valley are so drunk on their own bath water that they simply do n't get Linus .
Take Steve Jobs .
After Linus moved to the States in 1997 , the acting Apple Computer CEO got in touch with him .
Jobs wanted to persuade Linus to get involved in making the MacOS an open source code project .
" He tried to get the Linux movement going more into the Apple area .
I think he was surprised that his arguments , which were the Apple market share arguments -- which would have made an impression on people who did this for commercial reasons -- had absolutely no impact on me , '' Linus says .
BTW in his autobiography he mentions this episode that cast some light of his super sized ego struggle -- he really can do whatever it takes to avoid being in the shadow of Steve Jobs or other prominent developer :
According to Torvalds , Jobs assumed that he would be interested in joining Apple 's mission to capture more of the personal computer market from Microsoft , rather than continue concentrating on Linux .
" I do n't think Jobs realized that Linux would potentially have more users than Apple , although it 's a very different user base . "
In Transmeta he was the one and only Linus Torvalds .
The start - up was headed by Dave Ditzel , former chief scientist of the chip development project at Sun that produced the SPARC processors , one of the most successful RISC CPUs .
But Ditzel was known only in very narrow circles of CPU developers .
Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen was the major investors in Transmeta -- so here Linux symbolically again returned to his MS DOS roots and made an important step of becoming Microsoft of Unix :-)
Starting salary of Linus in Transmeta as well as the number of share he would get in the eventual IPO were closely guarded secrets .
Linus claims that he negotiated that he will have enough time to continue to supervise the development of Linux kernel , but again reality was that he was really working like Transmeta PR person driving attention to the company .
Just think about the number of interview and speeches he gave during the 1998 and 1999 before the launch of the first Transmeta chips .
PR work requires a lot of time .
Moreover in any case the size of the project already has outgrown his capacity to manage it .
In 1998 when I wrote the first draft of this chapter the Transmeta move to hire Torvalds looked like a very clever ( I would like to call it innovative ) marketing plot , that can be called " cloak - and - dagger marketing " -- officially Torvalds work on a some " top secret " project there .
Transmeta 's windows were blacked out , its Web site contained one sentence ( " This Web page is not here yet " ) .
All they need was one celebrity to provoke heated speculations about just what Transmeta were doing and this particular celebrity was doing there .
In 2003 as SCO lawsuit heated and started threatening Transmeta , he was promptly shipped to the OSDL ( As Shakespeare aptly formulated this idea in Otello " Moor did his job , Moor can leave . " ) :
The non-profit Open Source Development Lab ( OSDL ) and chip - maker Transmeta Corp. jointly announced today that Linus Torvalds , the creator of Linux , will join OSDL as the first OSDL Fellow .
Torvalds will join OSDL on leave from Transmeta Corporation , where he is currently a Transmeta Fellow .
Most of the talk before Transmeta IPO was focused on the next - generation secret chip that Transmeta is developing .
The main ingredient of this hugely successful PR trick was of course Torvalds , who play the role of celebrity who fueled huge interest in Transmeta interest in " Linux media " and even managed to get substantial attention from mainstream media .
This PR trick would probably would not work for Transmeta without him , that 's why in 1998 I , like many other observers , ( incorrectly ) assumed that there were some gentleman agreement , that Torvalds will work just as PR person for company by promoting Linux and other than that he is free to do whatever he wish .
This proved to be partially wrong -- actually along with PR duties Linus did Linux port to the Transmeta chip .
In any case , for Linus this was not only the official end of volunteer period but also definitely " end of fun " .
Welcome to the hotel California .
Now it 's all about money .
While he got an unusually high salary in Transmeta , strategically this move was a very risky step from several points of view .
First of all , leaving university grounds cuts implicit , but extremely important support from friends and academic stuff that he enjoyed at the University of Helsinki , making his job of the " Chief configuration management specialist " of the kernel code much more difficult and forcing him to make more bad , " intuitive " decisions that badly affected Linux development .
Also that made him more conservative : without a university he was essentially on his own and please remember that from the point of view of academic training he never managed to accomplished much .
Just a MS degree .
No other research projects , no articles , no participation in other important project like Multics was for Unix creators , nothing that might help him in the future to navigate the development of the kernel .
Note that Ken Thompson and other core members of the Unix team has had an excellent school in Multics project before launching Unix .
So deciding what technical path to chose became more difficult and that dramatically increased the conservatism , the concentration on the polishing of existing codebase and including only features that he cannot reject .
That also made him very vulnerable to the corporate pressure .
Generally speaking , leaving university grounds is a very dangerous step for any freeware / open source project leader and I attribute much of Stallman 's success to the fact that he managed to stay in MIT , even when MIT got tied of him and wanted him out ;-) .
Gradually the question of the level of " Linux_ kernel_development / Linus_leadership " synergy became open .
In this sense SCO lawsuit really helped Linux as it was a good time for Linus to divorce Transmeta and to join an independent body for the development of Linux kernel , which can survive even if Linus himself was overrun by a track .
Probably the fact the Linus was quickly shipped to Open Source Labs to protect Transmeta from excessive liability was the most positive development that came out of this lawsuit .
I could only say that I have the benefit of having been exposed to the Raymondism and other silly ideas ten years ago , and having the benefit of thinking them through before thinking got clouded by pundits and free IPO money .
For most people who have discarded orthodox Raymondism , the idea seems so childish and shallow that there is n't much perceived value in convincing the people who are sold on it .

In late 1997 Linux gold rush started and in early 1998 Linus found himself at the front - pages of such magazines as Forbes .
In one year he probably gave more interviews and speeches that in all his previous life .
It 's difficult to say how he reacted to all this stream of media hype and exaggerations , but it definitely increased the troubling " cult of personality " problems in the movement that I mentioned before .
It 's not an easy job to be a media darling .
Despite his usual " political correctness " the burden of fame was probably too much for him and Linus managed to make some revealing his personality statements ( see Linus 1998 for more complete context of the statements ; full interviews are also available online ) .
One of the main negative factors that usually cautious and realistic he gradually was also affected by " Linux uber alles " movement headed by Eric Raymond .
I discussed this movement ( Raymondism ) in more details in my Bad Linux advocacy FAQ ) :
... first he proclaimed that he has no competitors in the Unix market anymore ( assuming that Linux works better that Solaris 7 on 64 CPU systems -- BTW in late 1998 Linus abruptly changed his technical priorities and despite proclaimed desktop orientation started working hard on adding SMP support to the Linux kernel .
In other words Linus adopted " One Microsoft way " technical policy -- much like Microsoft with NT , he is trying to make Linux a universal OS that dominates both desktop and server .
It 's really funny that despite the fact that both Solaris and Free / OpenBSD were still superior in certain aspects of kernel design he claimed just opposite : " I 'm no longer looking at the Unix market when I 'm looking for competitors , " he said , adding that when looking for new features to add to the free OS , he is looking more to Microsoft than to high - end Unixes like Solaris or Digital Unix .
" I 've been much more focused on the Windows NT and 98 target group as a market "
( assuming that Linux works better that Solaris 7 on 64 CPU systems -- BTW in late 1998 Linus abruptly changed his technical priorities and despite proclaimed desktop orientation started working hard on adding SMP support to the Linux kernel .

It 's really funny that despite the fact that both Solaris and Free / OpenBSD were still superior in certain aspects of kernel design he claimed just opposite : ... in another interview he predicted disappearance of Apple from the face of Earth in a couple of years ( and also misunderstanding the power of Microsoft legal machine -- the danger of infringement of copyright lawsuits -- whatever you think about it , realistically this is a very powerful threat to free software movement , as SCO lawsuit later have shown ) .
In fact , Apple essentially killed Linux on desktop with the advent of OS X ( see below ) :
I actually think that within a few years , Apple will cease to exist simply because , my personal opinion is , it 's too hard to compete against Microsoft in the commercial marketplace .
And yet I feel that Linux can actually succeed because we are n't really competing against Microsoft .
Linux does n't have the same commercial pressures that Apple does have .
... in yet another interview he gives his final and categorical judgment about Java ( " I think everybody hates Java as a desktop thing " ) forgetting the fact that he never programmed in the language and after programming kernel in C it 's very difficult to switch to something else , anyway ;-) :
SW : What are your thoughts on Java ?
LT : I think everybody hates Java as a desktop thing .
I see Java mentioned a lot lately , but all of the mentions within the last year have been of Java as a server language , not as a desktop language .
If you go back a year and a half , everybody was talking about Java on the desktop .
They are n't anymore .
It 's dead .
And once you 're dead on the desktop , my personal opinion is you 're dead .
If servers are everything you have , just forget it .
Why do you think Sun , HP -- everybody -- is nervous about Microsoft ?
It 's not because they make great servers .
It 's because they control the desktop .
Once you control the desktop , you control the servers .
It 's no longer something that will revolutionize the industry .
It could have revolutionized the industry if it was on the desktop , but I do n't see that happening anymore .
I hope I 'm wrong .
Really .
I just do n't think I am .
SW : How did Sun blow it ?
LT : Too much noise , too much talk , too much discussion , not enough " show me . "
... and in yet another he admits that " he really like the Unix as a philosophy " ( not the fact that he just implemented a clone of the Unix kernel that already has standards , books and even complete source code available ) and ironically ( referring to Windows ) gave a very good characterization of Linux development " nobody tried to design windows -- it just grew in random directions without any kind of thought behind it . "
boot : Linux is based on UNIX , right ?
Torvalds :
Well it 's based on UNIX in the sense that I was used to UNIX and I really liked it .
UNIX has a philosophy , it has 25 years of history behind it , and most importantly , it has a clean core .
It strives for something — some kind of beauty .
And that 's really what struck me as a programmer .
Operating systems that normal home users are used to , such as DOS and Windows , did n't have any way of life .
Nobody tried to design Windows — it just grew in random directions without any kind of thought behind it .
... in early 1999 interview Linus first time used the word " invented " to Linux -- the word completely inapplicable to the clone OS and very close to the Microsoft marketing style ( as everybody knows Microsoft " invented Windows " by a blatant rip - off but then intelligent enhancement and independent development of the Mac GUI ;-) .
As always he failed to mention GNU project ( moreover , this time he even forgot to mention that the adoption of GPL license was the smartest thing he ever did and probably at this time he really has some reservations -- see KDE jihad ) :
PC Week : Give us the short history of Linux 's development .
Torvalds :
Basically , I invented it eight years ago , almost exactly eight years ago .
It started small , not even an operating system .
It was just a personal project .
I just was doing something fun with my new machine .
It kind of evolved through luck and happenstance into an OS , simply because there was very much a void where there was n't much choice for someone like me .
I could n't afford some of the commercial OSes and I did n't want to run DOS or Windows -- I do n't even know , did Windows really exist then ?
PC
Week :
You could have copyrighted Linux and made a fortune .
Why did you make it an open source code operating system , and will that model work in the future as Linux acceptance grows ?
Torvalds :
It started out as a personal belief that , yes , open source was needed .
Then , when it got large enough , I encouraged people to license their own development , their own parts .
Now there are multiple owners sharing all these licenses ...
In his autobiography he managed to describe Mach kernel and Apple OS X in less than flattering terms :
" Frankly , I think it 's a piece of crap , " Torvalds says of Mach , the microkernel on which Apple 's new operating system is based .
" It contains all the design mistakes you can make , and manages to even make up a few of its own . "
Torvald 's comments promise to upset not just Apple fanatics , but also some quarters of the free software movement .
The Mach microkernel is also being used as the core of Hurd , a kernel project from the Free Software Foundation that will be an alternative to Linux as the heart of the GNU ( Gnu 's Not Unix ) operating system , originally devised by free software advocate Richard Stallman .
The criticism comes in a chapter where Torvalds tells that , on arrival in Silicon Valley in early 1997 , Apple 's charismatic chief executive Steve Jobs invited him to join Apple and help develop OS X .
He says that Jobs was also keen for him to help attract open source developers to the project .
The remarks will particularly sting Apple , because the company has made great play of the fact that the core of its new operating system is , like Linux , based on the Unix operating system and was developed on open source software .
Qualified criticism is a gift .
If Linus says that a particular approach has its problems , great .
Mach 3 Microkernel has a lot of problems , but there is no perfect approach to the kernel design .
For each and every Mach 3 problem one can find one in monolithic kernel design advocated by Linus .
And if you are a specialist that defends monolithic kernel as a better alternative , you better provide solid arguments , not the all encompassing word " crap " in the best " Father Linus , the greatest kernel designer of all times and nations " style .
Actually even among monolithic kernels Linux kernel is not the best in many respects .
BSD was and still is a better system in the networking department .
If you need a firewall , router , maybe even a web server it will probably run better on BSD .
That makes me wonder at his motivations and it lowers my respect for Linus .
And definitely reminds me of the old Tanenbaum vs.
Torvalds debate right back in the beginning of ' 92 :
While I could go into a long story here about the relative merits of the two designs , suffice it to say that among the people who actually design operating systems , the debate is essentially over .
Microkernels have won .
The only real argument for monolithic systems was performance , and there is now enough evidence showing that microkernel systems can be just as fast as monolithic systems ... that it is now all over but the shoutin` .
Although microkernels did not won , they did not disappeared either and the design has its merits and to a certain extent found its way into best commercial Unixes like AIX and embedded kernels like QNX .
May be some sort of compromise is an optimal solution .
The problem here is that he extended his ( primitive ) knowledge of the field circa 1992 to the situation in 2001 .
Linus has made his opinion of microkernels clearly in the past , when he was just a beginner kernel developer , a guy who can barely can program in C .
But both monolithic kernels of early XXI century and Mach kernels are quite different from what was the state of the art of 1992 .
And he should know that in the current Linux kernel " Bad driver equals kernel panic " , not to mention the hassle for driver developers , who are forced to port their code against all kernel ( endless ) changes .
My ( limited ) understanding is that QNX has been a quite successful microkernel architecture for years .
Considering the critical real - time applications that QNX has to run , I am glad they got their micro-kernel right .
Lets see ...
Nuclear reactors , nuclear subs , NASA uses it for some things , traffic control systems , etc .
Very impressive list for such a crappy design .
And as the last peace of my collection I will reproduce his famous letter " Because I 'm a bastard , and proud of it ! " from Kernel Traffic # 87 .
were he stated his position about kernel debuggers in the following way :
I do n't like debuggers .
Never have , probably never will .
I use gdb all the time , but I tend to use it not as a debugger , but as a disassembler on steroids that you can program .
None of the arguments for a kernel debugger has touched me in the least .
And trust me , over the years I 've heard quite a lot of them .
In the end , they tend to boil down to basically : it would be so much easier to do development , and we'd be able to add new things faster .
And quite frankly , I do n't care .
I do n't think kernel development should be " easy " .
I do not condone single - stepping through code to find the bug .
I do not think that extra visibility into the system is necessarily a good thing .
Apparently , if you follow the arguments , not having a kernel debugger leads to various maladies : you crash when something goes wrong , and you fsck and it takes forever and you get frustrated .
people have given up on Linux kernel programming because it's too hard and too time - consuming
it takes longer to create new features .
And nobody has explained to me why these are _bad_ things .
To me , it 's not a bug , it 's a feature .
Not only is it documented , but it 's _good_ , so it obviously can not be a bug .
" Takes longer to create new features " - this one in particular is not a very strong argument for having a debugger .
It 's not as if lack of features or new code would be a problem for Linux , or , in fact , for the software industry as a whole .
Quite the reverse .
My biggest job is to say " no " to new features , not trying to find them .
Oh .
And sure , when things crash and you fsck and you did n't even get a clue about what went wrong , you get frustrated .
Tough .
There are two kinds of reactions to that : you start being careful , or you start whining about a kernel debugger .
Quite frankly , I 'd rather weed out the people who do n't start being careful early rather than late .
That sounds callous , and by God , it _is_ callous .
But it 's not the kind of " if you ca n't stand the heat , get out the the kitchen " kind of remark that some people take it for .
No , it 's something much more deeper : I 'd rather not work with people who are n't careful .
It 's darwinism in software development .
It 's a cold , callous argument that says that there are two kinds of people , and I 'd rather not work with the second kind .
Live with it .
I 'm a bastard .
I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think otherwise .
Yet they do .
People think I 'm a nice guy , and the fact is that I 'm a scheming , conniving bastard who does n't care for any hurt feelings or lost hours of work if it just results in what I consider to be a better system .
And I 'm not just saying that .
I 'm really not a very nice person .
I can say " I do n't care " with a straight face , and really mean it .
I happen to believe that not having a kernel debugger forces people to think about their problem on a different level than with a debugger .
I think that without a debugger , you do n't get into that mindset where you know how it behaves , and then you fix it from there .
Without a debugger , you tend to think about problems another way .
You want to understand things on a different _level_ .
It 's partly " source vs binary " , but it 's more than that .
It 's not that you have to look at the sources ( of course you have to - and any good debugger will make that _easy_ ) .
It 's that you have to look at the level _above_ sources .
At the meaning of things .
Without a debugger , you basically have to go the next step : understand what the program does .
Not just that particular line .
And quite frankly , for most of the real problems ( as opposed to the stupid bugs - of which there are many , as the latest crap with " truncate ( ) " has shown us ) a debugger does n't much help .
And the real problems are what I worry about .
The rest is just details .
It will get fixed eventually .
I do realize that others disagree .
And I 'm not your Mom .
You can use a kernel debugger if you want to , and I wo n't give you the cold shoulder because you have " sullied " yourself .
But I 'm not going to help you use one , and I would frankly prefer people not to use kernel debuggers that much .
So I do n't make it part of the standard distribution , and if the existing debuggers are n't very well known I wo n't shed a tear over it .
Because I 'm a bastard , and proud of it !
Linux and Innovation : Linus Torvalds and Newt Gingrich
See , you not only have to be a good coder
to create a system like Linux ,
you have to be a sneaky bastard too ;-)
[ Linus Torvalds in < 4rikft$7g5@linux.cs .Helsinki.FI >]
The other interesting thing is that Raymondism equals Linux and open source with innovation and Linus often tries to play this card too .
In fact Linux can be considered as a neo - conservative revolution ( counterrevolution ) against Microsoft .
There is nothing very special about Linux kernel .
It is absolutely , 100 % true that Linus has complete control over the present development .
He has in the past and will in the future nix excellent ideas that do not conform to his rather limited views .
It has taken 10 years for Linux to get a semi decent VM which is still weak compared to the FreeBSD's VM .
Linux kernel version 2.2 was worse than 2.0 at handling high demand .
Until 2.2.18 or so , if a process used all the virtual memory , the kernel would randomly pick a process and kill it to free some memory .
I think it checked the PID !
=1 , thank goodness .
But this still means that Netscape or Midnight commander going nuts and eating all the memory could leave your box in a " fuzzy " state when the number and names of surviving applications and daemons cannot be predicted with any certainty .
In no way Linux kernel can be considered as an advancement of the state of the art in operating systems design , it 's a reimplementation of preexisting ( and really innovative ) ideas of Unix .
Yes good reimplementation has its own value and nobody can deny that Linux was an important part of Unix Renaissance .
But is it an innovative OS ?
Or in a more narrow sense is it an innovative kernel ?
That 's a joke .
Unix introduced at least seven major innovations in OS design : C language as system programming language , hierarchical filesystem , pipes and a set of pipes friendly utilities / filters , regular expressions , devices as files , shell as the mother of all modern scripting languages , first built - in TCP / IP stack .
Linux introduced none , zero to be exact ( if we do not count the method of development praised so highly in CatB ;-) .
The most important part of open source development : the development of scripting languages such as Perl.
PHP Python and Ruby as well as LAMP stack , two things that were really innovative about open source just happened to be in Linux ( and not only in Linux ; for example Perl predates Linux as the initial version was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 and Perl 3 was released in 1989 and Perl 4 in 1991 )
If one compares Linux with BE OS , Inferno or even with OS / 2 and Amiga one can see that in major design decisions Linux is a very conservative , backward OS .
As Rob Pike noted in his " Systems Software Research is Irrelevant " ( http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/rob/utah2000.pdf)
Linux can be considered as a sign that computer science research became irrelevant and he claimed that the whole situation in OS design is generally bad and requires action .
In a sense it 's more like a powerful social movement with political overtones , very similar to Newt Gingrich " Contract with America " thing ( fight corruption , waste in government spending , tax reform and a balanced budget , etc. ) than a technological advance .
There are other things that make analogy between Newt Gingrich and Linus Torvalds much less superficial than it looks from the first sight .
For example , both understand that the principal task of the leader is to define a positive " vision " around which followers can cohere , define strategies to achieve this vision , then delegate authority to others to carry out operations and tactics preserving key functions as the center of communication and final decision maker .
That 's why Torvalds so easily delegates programming of various parts of the kernel to other people .
As long as he is in a controlling position of leader and configuration manager of the whole kernel who has the final word on what will be included in a particular version , it does not matter much who will produce a particular module or driver .
Enjoy your ride as long as you agree that I am the driver .
Prior to becoming the House speaker , Newt Gingrich had spent over a decade writing and speaking about , and organizing around , an eclectic neo-conservative model , which he argued should take the place of Great Society liberalism .
In Gingrich 's view , his conservative predecessor , Ronald Reagan , had ultimately come up short as a transformative leader because his horizon as a leader had been defined by opposition to liberalism rather than a positive vision of a new order in American politics .
" The great failure of the modern Republican party , including much of the Reagan administration , " Gingrich wrote in 1984 , " has been in its effort to solve problems operationally or tactically within the framework of the welfare state . . . .
Real change occurs at the levels of vision and strategy . "
That 's somewhat similar of Torvalds attitude to Stallman .
Gingrich reiterated this theme in a 1995 interview :
" You have to blow down the old order in order to create the new order .
Reagan understood how to blow down the old order , but was n't exactly sure what the new order would be . "
When Gingrich became speaker in 1995 , his overriding goal was to succeed where President Ronald Reagan had failed , by creating a " new political order " in the United States .
Sounds pretty similar with the " world domination " rhetoric of Linus Torvalds .
Both share extraordinarily ambitions , executive - style understanding of political leadership , and an acute ability to work well with press .
Both repeatedly demonstrated willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and take political risks to advance their goals ( Linus decision to bless commercial distributors was very unconventional , to say the least , for a " member of a GNU generation " ) .
Being a chief configuration manager for a large and complex project is a very challenging , exhausting and thankless job .
I suspect that now Linus really hates his job .
But the survival under relentless pressure for a decade attests that Linus Torvalds has a really rare combination of top programming talent along with traits typical for gifted managers and skilled politicians .
That 's a very rare combination .
In this respect he is a really outstanding person , outstanding without any reservations , because most people will quit such a job after the first several years .
His job requires not only talent and understanding of internals ( that 's easier for Linus Torvalds , than for anybody else because he saw the whole development for the very beginning and complexity for him increases gradually from a pretty low level ) , but the ability to work long - long hours almost without any vacations .
And if you add Hollywood level popularity and corresponding time spend in the PR events this is not very enviable position .
And unlike Hollywood stars he cannot resort to the alcohol , drags or to womanizing , or and combination of those three to reduce this pressure ;-) .
The work under constant stress , under constant overload does not make life easy for anybody .
First problem is that due to overload some decisions now should be taken based on intuition as there is no time ( and sometime technical background ) to understand the consequences of solutions proposed .
The second and major problem is that managing of the project of the current size of the Linux kernel is probably just too much for any single person , no matter how talented he or she is .
The first signs of this overload were evident already in 1998 a year after he was welcomed to the " Hotel California " .
In April , 1998 the birth of Linus 's second daughter caused great joy , and substantial disruption in kernel development as all work stopped and many patches got lost .
Some grumbling results as it becomes clear just how dependent the entire process is on Linus .
In October 1998 tensions again exploded on Linux kernel after Linus dropped too many patches .
Linus walked out in a huff and took a vacation .
Things returned to normal , of course , but some people got talking .
It becomes clear once again that the Linux kernel became to be too big for one person even to serve just as a configuration management specialist .
Some ways of reducing the load on Linus were discussed , but nothing was really resolved .
Understandably the kernel development considerably slowed down also due to complexity of the current version of the kernel and SMP stuff ( and here is it really difficult for a student with just MS to complete with IBM , HP or SUN laboratories staffed with a lot of PhD holders ;-) .
That inevitable slowdown was first predicted in now famous Halloween I memo that provided one of the first objective ( objective attitude is our attitude to people we do not like ;-) evaluations of Linux .
For example there was no other major open source implementation of SMP .
And commercial implementations were complex and at this time closed .
So while there was some space for Linux to catch Solaris and NT in SMP area , very little can be achieved by playing a plain - vanilla following somebody 's tail lights .
Here I would like to stress the importance of the academic environment for the OSS projects that was lost .
Not that I respect PhD holders for the diploma they have ( a lot of PhD dissertation are just weak to the point of being a scam and IMHO worth much less than a single decent OSS program ) , but still I think that it 's extremely beneficial for an OSS software developer to work for an academic institution , or at least be close to the university atmosphere .
That was true for Denies Ritchie and Ken Thompson , who did their groundbreaking work on Unix at Bell Lab ( the latter is as close to academic institution as one can get ) and later at Berkeley ( and please remember that in some areas Berkeley is more important contributor to Unix than Bell Lab ) .
Same is true for Richard Stallman .
Only Larry
Wall looks like a good counterexample here ( although later he joined a publisher O'Reilly as a free researcher , getting into essentially semi-academic atmosphere ) , but one can always switch from Perl to TCL or Python :-) .
And it 's a common knowledge that large bureaucracies can have some niches that provide an almost academic freedom for several years .
Anyway kernel development in 1998 slowed down quite visibly .
There was no new kernel version in the 1998 -- situation that would be unimaginable to the Linux crowd in 1992 or 1994 or even in 1996 .
Version 2.2 slipped to January 1999 .
In late January , 1999 kernel version 2.2 was at last shipped -- somewhat buggy because of pressure to release the version .
All of a sudden Torvalds declared the source code final , noting that , " enough is enough " and that " Every program has bugs , and I 'm sure there are still bugs in this .
Get over it -- we 've done our best . "
To call it a stable kernel is like drawing an arbitrary line , but market pressure is market pressure and Torvalds ' ability to withstand it under the current level of market hype is extremely limited .
Essentially , like in the past , Linus Torvalds has no other choice , but to give what people want ...
The version 2.2 was in some important areas a significant improvement over 2.0.x kernel but it was larger and need time to stabilize .
In retrospect improvements also help to understand what was wrong with prev. version .
For example , among other advantages FreeBSD had a big speed advantage over Linux 2.0.x when it came to NFS throughput , because kernel 2.0.x did not yet have kernel - space support for it ( it was all user space , redundant copying -- a lot of overhead that was removed for Beowulf clustering ) .
With Linux 2.2 and KNFS , I wonder if FreeBSD is still faster in this area .
Still the kernel itself was far from meeting enterprise standards .
As Mark Russinovich wrote in his article Linux and the Enterprise ( April , 1999 ) :
Let me state clearly at the outset that I do n't intend to bash Linux in this article , nor do I intend to proclaim NT 's superiority to Linux .
I base the information I present on a thorough study of Linux 2.2 , including its source code .
I hope that by revealing these problems , I will encourage Linux developers to focus on making Linux ready for the enterprise .
I also want to dispel some of the hype that many Linux users have uncritically accepted , which has given them the false impression that Linux is ready for enterprise prime time .
What Does " Enterprise - Ready " Mean ?
Before an OS can compete in the enterprise , it must deliver performance levels on network server applications that rival or exceed the levels that other OSs achieve .
Examples of network server applications include Web servers , database servers , and mail servers .
OS and hardware vendors typically use results from industry - standard benchmarks such as Transaction Processing Council ( TPC ) -C , TPC-D , and Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation ( SPEC ) SpecWeb to measure proprietary OSs or hardware against other vendors ' products .
Vendors spend millions of dollars on benchmark laboratories in which they tune , tweak , and otherwise push state - of - the - art hardware and software technology to the limit .
Enterprise customers , in search of a computing infrastructure that provides maximum capacity , often turn to benchmark results for guidance , and OS and hardware vendors holding benchmark leads take great pride in being king of the hill at any given time .
Thus , competing in the enterprise means removing every performance impediment possible .
Overlooking even the smallest drag will create an opening that a competitor can drive through to obtain a valuable lead on a benchmark .
What complicates the science of engineering an OS for the enterprise is that an OS might have subtle design or implementation problems that do n't adversely affect performance in casual desktop or workgroup environments .
Yet these problems can keep the OS from achieving competitive results in an enterprise - class benchmarking environment .
A typical enterprise - application benchmarking environment includes dozens of powerful multiprocessor computers sending requests as fast as they can over gigabit Ethernet to an 8 - way server with 4GB of memory and hundreds of gigabytes of disk space .
Efficient Request Processing
Network server applications typically communicate with clients via TCP or UDP .
The server application has either a published or well - known port address on which it waits for incoming client requests .
When the server establishes a connection with a client or receives a client request , the server must then process the request .
When the server application is a Web server , the Web server has to parse the HTTP information in the request and send requested file data back to the client .
A database server application must parse the client 's database query and obtain the desired information from the database .
For a network server application to scale , the application must use multiple kernel - mode threads to process client requests simultaneously on a multiprocessor 's CPUs .
The obvious way to make a server application take advantage of multiple threads is to program the application to create a large pool of threads when it initializes .
A thread from the pool will process each incoming request or series of requests issued over the same client connection , so that each client request has a dedicated thread .
This approach is easy to implement but suffers from several drawbacks .
First , the server must know at the time it initializes what kind of client load it will be subject to , so that it can create the appropriate number of threads .
Another drawback is that large numbers of threads ( an enterprise environment can produce thousands of simultaneous client requests ) can drain server resources significantly .
Sometimes , resources might not be adequate to create all the threads the application wants to create .
Furthermore , many threads actively processing requests force the server to divide CPU time among the threads .
Managing the threads will consume precious processor time , and switching between competing threads introduces significant overhead .
Because a one - thread - to - one - client - request model is inefficient in enterprise environments , server applications must be able to specify a small number of threads in order to divide among themselves the processing for a large number of client requests .
Where this client - multiplexing capability is present , no one - to - one correspondence between a thread and a client request occurs .
Neither does a one - to - one correspondence between a client request and a thread occur — one thread might share a client request 's processing with several other threads .
Several OS requirements are necessary for a client - multiplexing server design to be feasible .
The first requirement is that a thread must be able to simultaneously wait for multiple events : the arrival of a new client request on a new client connection , and a new client request occurring on an existing client connection .
For example , a Web server will keep multiple browser connections open and active while accepting new browser connections as multiple users access a Web site the server manages .
Connections between a browser and the server can stay open for several seconds while large files transmit over a connection , or while the browser requests multiple files over the connection .
The second requirement is that the threads must be able to issue asynchronous I /O requests .
Asynchronous I/O is an OS - provided feature whereby a thread can initiate I/O and perform other work while the I/O is in progress — the thread can check the I/O result at a later time .
For example , if a server thread wants to asynchronously read a file for a client request , the thread can start the read operation and wait for other client requests while the read is in progress .
When the read completes , the system notifies a thread ( not necessarily the thread that began the read operation ) so that the thread can check the I / O's status ( i.e. , success or failure ) and whether the I/O is complete .
Without asynchronous I/O , a thread initiating an I/O operation must wait while the operation takes place .
This synchronous I/O causes multiple - client - per - thread server designs to perform poorly .
Because such server designs designate limited thread pools , taking threads out of commission to perform I/O can lead to a situation in which no threads are available to accept new client requests or connections .
In such a case , a multiprocessor 's CPUs might remain idle while client requests sit backlogged .
Worse , the server might never have a chance to service client requests , because the client might stop waiting for the server .
Figure 1 contrasts asynchronous and synchronous I/O. Linux and Request Processing
Unfortunately , Linux 2.2 does n't satisfy either client - multiplexing server - design requirement : Linux 2.2 cannot efficiently wait for multiple events , and it does n't support asynchronous I/O .
Let 's look more closely at each of these concerns .
Linux provides only one general API to server applications that want to wait on multiple requests — the select API .
Select is a UNIX system call that has been present in every UNIX release since the OS 's initial development .
Select is one of the OS interface functions that has become part of the POSIX standard for UNIX API compatibility .
One reason that the Linux select implementation is not an acceptable function for waiting on multiple events is that the system uses select to notify all threads that are waiting on the same event whenever the event occurs ( e.g. , the arrival of a request from a new client ) .
Notifying multiple threads in this way degrades server performance :
Only one thread can handle the new request or connection , and the other notified threads must return to a state of waiting .
In addition , synchronization causes overhead as the threads agree among themselves which one will service the request .
Other secondary overhead results when the OS divides CPU time among the threads it has needlessly notified .
This kind of limitation forces a network server application to designate only one thread to wait for new incoming client requests .
This thread can either process the new request itself , waking up another thread to take over the role of waiting for new requests , or the original thread can hand the request off to a waiting thread .
Both alternatives add overhead , because every time a new client request arrives , the waiting thread receives notification and must then notify another thread .
If Linux provided some additional application support , the OS could wake up only one thread .
For example , an application could specify that even though multiple threads are waiting for a particular event to occur , the application wants only one of the threads to receive notification for each occurrence of the event .
NT provides such support for its waiting functions ( NT server applications do not typically use select , although NT implements the select call for compatibility with the POSIX standard ) to allow multiple threads to efficiently wait for incoming client requests .
Select suffers another serious problem :
It does n't scale .
A Linux application can use select to wait for up to 1024 client connections or request endpoints .
However , when an application receives notification of an event , the select call must determine which event occurred , before reporting the event to the application .
Select uses a linear search to determine the first triggered event in the set the application is waiting for .
In a linear search , select checks events sequentially until it arrives at the event responsible for the notification .
Furthermore , the network server application must go through a similar search to determine which event select reports .
As the number of events a thread waits for grows , so does the overhead of these two searches .
The resulting CPU cost can significantly degrade a server 's performance in an enterprise environment .
NT incorporates a unique feature known as completion ports to avoid the overhead of searching .
A completion port represents a group of events .
To wait on multiple events , a server associates the events with a completion port and waits for the completion port event .
No hard upper limit exists on the number of events a server can associate with a completion port , and the server application need not search for which event occurred — when the server receives notification of a completion port event , the server also receives information about which event occurred .
Similarly , the kernel does n't perform searches , because the kernel knows which events the system associates with specific completion ports .
Completion ports simplify the design and implementation of highly scalable server applications , and most enterprise - class NT network server applications use completion ports .
Even on desktop 2.2 still has a long way to go and still demonstrated sound stutters , jerkiness when moving windows and slow window manager performance ( which is connected with weak support of interactive applications in the kernel ) .
Another consequence of this overload is that polishing of existing codebase became a top priority .
Linux needed to compete with commercial systems in benchmarks and that requires polishing and tuning , polishing and tuning ...
That became pretty clear during so called Mindcraft fiasco that took place in the early 1999 .
This was Microsoft sponsored ( and Mindcraft executed ) test that showed that despite Raymondism claims , Linux 2.2 still has problems in the application area were it is most widely used -- as a web server .
Here are some important results from the test :
With 4 CPUs and 1 Gig of RAM , NT & IIS achieved 4,166 http requests per second .
With 4 CPUs and 1 Gig of RAM , Linux & Apache achieved 1,842 http requests per second .
With 1 CPU and 256 MB RAM , NT & IIS achieved 1,863 http requests per second .
With 1 CPU and 256 MB RAM , Linux & Apache achieved 1,314 http requests per second .
It was natural to expect that Eric Raymond will fiercely defend his beloved operating system and his CatB fairy tail against any enemies , including truth .
And the desire to see a rebuttal was instantly gratified ( see Linux Today Eric S. Raymond -- Latest FUD tactic may be backfiring .
readers posting are also very telling and can tell about Raymondism as phenomenon much more that my writings ) :
Microsoft 's latest FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt ) tactic may be backfiring .
A 21 April ITWeb story [ 1 ] reported results by a benchmarking shop called Mindcraft that supposedly showed NT to be faster than Linux at SMB and Web service .
The story also claimed that technical support for tuning the Linux system had been impossible to find .
Previous independent benchmarks ( such as [ 2 ] ) have found Linux and other Unixes to be dramatically faster and more efficient than NT , and independent observers ( beginning with a celebrated InfoWorld article in 1998 [ 3 ] ) have lauded the Linux community 's responsiveness to support problems .
Linux fans smelled a rat somewhere ( uttering responses typified by [ 4 ] ) , and amidst the ensuing storm of protest some interesting facts came to light , .
1 . The benchmark had been paid for by Microsoft .
The Mindcraft press release failed to mention this fact .
2 . Mindcraft did in fact get a useful answer [ 5 ] to its request for help tuning the Linux system .
But they did not answer the request for more information , neither did they follow the tuning suggestions given .
Also , they forged the reply email address to conceal themselves -- the connection was made after the fact by a Usenetter who noticed that the unusual machine configuration described in the request exactly matched that of the test system in the Mindcraft results .
3 . Red Hat , the Linux distributor Mindcraft says it asked for help , reports that it got one phone call from them on the installation - help line , which is n't supposed to answer post - installation questions about things like advanced server tuning .
Evidently Mindcraft 's efforts to get help tuning the system were feeble -- at best incompetent , at worst cynical gestures .
4 . An entertainingly - written article [ 6 ] by the head of the development team for Samba ( one of the key pieces of Linux software involved in the benchmark ) described how Mindcraft could have done a better job of tuning .
The article revealed that one of Mindcraft 's Samba tweaks had the effect of slowing their Linux down quite drastically .
5 . Another Usenet article [ 7 ] independently pointed out that Mindcraft had deliberately chosen a logging format that imposed a lot of overhead on Apache ( the web sever used for the Linux tests ) .
So far , so sordid -- a fairly standard tale of Microsoft paying to get exactly the FUD it wants from a nominally independent third party .
But the story took a strange turn today ( 22 Apr ) when Microsoft spokesperson Ian Hatton effectively admitted [ 8 ] that the test had been rigged !
" A very highly - tuned NT server " Mr. Hatton said " was pitted against a very poorly tuned Linux server " .
He then attempted to spin the whole episode around by complaining that Microsoft and its PR company had received " malicious and obscene " email from Linux fans and slamming this supposed " unprofessionalism " .
One wonders if Hatton believes it would be " unprofessional " to address strong language to a burglar caught in the act of nipping the family silver .
In any case , Microsoft 's underhanded tactics seem ( as with its clumsy " astroturf " campaign against the DOJ lawsuit ) likely to come back to haunt it .
The trade press had largely greeted the Mindcraft results with yawns and skepticism even before Hatton 's admission .
And it's hard to see how Microsoft will be able to credibly quote anti-Linux benchmarks in the future after this fiasco .
Despite numerous similar attempts by Raymondists ( and some Linux developers including Alan Cox ) to present this finding as a one - sided report and destroy Mindcraft 's credibility by painting the test as a PR exercise performed by paid Microsoft puppets ( attempts that most Linux developers regret later )
Linus was faced with an urgent necessity to find its own game in TCP / IP stack improvement and SMP improvement .
He understood more than anybody else that even if Linux was properly tuned , it still may not have matched NT on that hardware .
The part of the test was run on a high - end SMP box , and at this time NT may well outperform Linux 2.2 on that sort of platform .
SMP in the kernel 2.2 was not as good as Windows NT , to say nothing about Aix or Solaris .
And this put him in an extremely difficult position of making some decisions of how to proceed without a real kernel development lab and without any development plan .
That probably contributed to already substantial overload and played a role in a one year delay of 2.4 kernel .
Here is how he recollected the events later in his December 2000 Linux Magazine interview :
MindCraft thing [ MindCraft is an independent research laboratory that last year reported test results -- paid for by Microsoft -- indicating that Windows NT outperformed Linux in certain basic server tasks .
­ Ed ] .
LM : How hard was that to deal with ?
LT : It was really personal for a few months .
I took it fairly personal , especially the way they did it .
LM : What happened ?
LT : Well , it was a panel discussion in Chicago and it was the first time I 'd been on the floor at the same time as people from Microsoft .
Five minutes before the panel started , the Microsoft guy handed out this paper that contained the results from the MindCraft study , and I did n't even have time to really see what it meant .
So , when he actually took this up in the panel , it was hard for me to say anything .
LM : But in the end , Microsoft was right , do n't you think ?
LT : Microsoft was right .
The point was that it actually gave us a much better baseline to compare what we were bad at .
We 'd probably been naive and thought that we were doing some things really well .
Then having somebody do that comparison was very motivational .
That was quite important .
Everybody expected some kind of attack from Microsoft , so I think we'd been a bit arrogant in believing that there were so many benchmarks that we were so much better at than NT .
It took a lot of people by surprise , including me .
We really lost badly in that one .
There was certainly that kind of naivete .
" My name is Linus , and I am your God "
- Linus Torvalds , Linux Expo , Durham NC , 1998
The keynote by the world 's most idolized geek ,
Linus Torvalds , was already
underway by the time
we rushed into the massive auditorium .
Paul Ferris -- A Date With Fearless Leader
Well oiled machine of Linux startup PR professionals , distributors and may be in pre-IPO period even high caliber PR people from largest investment banks created a very interesting public image of Linux Torvalds .
The zeal to create a " positive sellable image " of the Father of Linux might be studied as an example of a very successful PR campaign in communication departments of Ivy League Universities .
Even Linus Torvalds appearance on the fist page of Forbes probably was probably not that accidental .
All - in - all it created a cult of personally effect similar to a typical leader of a totalitarian party .
Several journalists who tried to explore this " make money fast " possibility contributed to this trend too .
And the results were pretty impressive even for Eastern Europeans who suffered from this melodramas for most of their life .
Like in case of many religious cults and radical movements Linus became especially attractive as a role model for teenagers .
Here are typical examples :
Name : Kenneth Kowalsky Location : Victoria BC - CANADA Occupation : Student
Linus is my idol .
I am a 15 year old student .
Programming and computer science is my life .
I have used Linux for the past 3 years and found the subject of Linux to be highly interesting - not because it is Unix or the fact that it is highly stable - because it has started a revolution .
If you compare Linux to MS Windows NT , Linux comes out on top .
The reason is the open source factor , while windows is only worked on by a 1000 programmers ( at most ) Linux is worked on my millions .
This is because Linux is open source , which allows anyone to patch up or add to the current design .
I mean anyone , including you who are reading this note could go to kernel.org and get the tarball and within the hour be knee deep in source code .
This gives Linux an advantage , the kind of advantage that only can be achieved with open source .
I do n’t mean to say that every instance of Linux on the planet will kick butt with windows .
When Linux is poorly configured it can crash more than windows , but when properly configured it has ten times the power that any windows copy could every dream of .
Linus is the person that I hope to be one day , do n’t get me wrong .
I do n’t want to be the guy in charge of Linux , I do n’t even really want to start a movement – but I do want one thing in common with Linus – I want to be able to give away something that will better the computing world .
If you think about it , Linus gave away something that could have brought him millions – or even billions .
Linux could have been the next Microsoft Windows .
It takes an incredible person to do something like that – that is why I look up to Him .
Name : CVRadhakrishna Location : Trivandrum - India Occupation : Scientist
Linus is to Computer Field as MK Gandhi was to public life .
Mahatma Gandhi gave exemplary concepts like Satyagraha ( passive resistance ? ) against oppression and Linus has given the Computer world Linux aginst monopolies , trademarks and patent dominance .
Both gave freedom to the people , one at political and social level and another in the realm of Computers .
Name : Faisal Halim Location : Abu Dhabi , U.A.E. Occupation : Student
A MODEL worth EMULATING !
Mr. Linus Torvalds has proved to students a model worth emulating .
Not only does he develop software based on the principles of software engineering , he actually does not bear a fanatic attitude towards software licences .
Here , at Islamia English School , we , the boys of A Level I , are asked to be models for the younger boys to emulate .
I think Mr. Linus is a man we can look up to emulate , besides our teachers .
He has upheld the principles of the hacker culture , been well mannered in the face of companies violating the norms of the computer industry , a premise where many people would just start to flame , he gives importance to his appearance , he is capable of making presentations , and he has broken the dark mist that has gathered on hackerdom by bringing up a family .
What is really sad , the initial Linus ( and Alan Cox ) reaction to the Mindcraft fiasco might be an early warning of the tendency that is common to many other open source projects : initial developer instead being part of the solution eventually becomes a part of the problem .
An identification with the project and the desire to keep the control of the project at some point starts to hurt the project future .
Please remember that revolutions usually eat its own children and big software projects are not so different from revolutions .
But as for Linus " world dominance " goal : an attempt to play ( and win ) both desktop and server game were far from encouraging signs .
This is continuation of tremendous overload , pure and simple .
That 's why version 2.2 lacked a journaling file system , which means that if fsck can't fix a disk after a power failure or system crash , and you were pretty much hosed and the most recent backups is your only chance , if any .
That 's not good for availability , but project leader is just a mortal human ...
But question of succession and the organization of Linux Kernel lab has another dimension .
If you are the leader of a big project you need to be open about succession because the project will definitely outlive the initial leader .
Here Torvald 's behavior looks really ambivalent and demonstrates his supersized ego .
And that speaks trouble for Linux as a project and especially for the Linux companies like Red Hat or Caldera .
As Russ Mitchell in his Business2 paper pointed out :
It would be natural to expect Torvalds to respond to questions about succession issues .
But he 's not talking .
Busy developing software at computer chip maker Transmeta in Santa Clara , Calif. , even as he continues to manage the Linux project , Torvalds has been keeping a low profile of late .
His handlers rebuffed several invitations from Business 2.0 to talk about the Linux organization , the question of succession , and his own plans for the future .
Although the media tend to trumpet Linux as a global collective of hundreds or thousands of programmers headed by Torvalds , the truth is a bit more complicated .
In fact , Torvalds and a tight cabal of top - notch programmers that numbers fewer than a dozen do most of the heavy lifting .
Torvalds and his small team are responsible for developing new iterations of Linux operating system software and for fixing bugs and otherwise maintaining the current iteration .
While the group is barely known within the software industry , Torvalds ' successor would emerge from this group .
More than two dozen Linux insiders were polled to name the one individual most likely to take the baton from Torvalds , and one name consistently turned up : Alan Cox .
Cox is a bush - bearded , long - haired Brit who lives in England and works for Red Hat .
Cox is one of the " few people [ Torvalds ] trusts to make important decisions about future directions , " says Peter Wayner , author of Free For All , a recent book on the history of Linux .
Cox , he says , is " responsible for making sure that most of the new ideas that people suggest for Linux are considered carefully and integrated correctly . "
When Torvalds took his first vacation in eight years last summer ( a mere two weeks ) ,
Cox ran the operation √and he did more than keep the wheels on the tracks : " While Linus was gone , Linux development became unblocked in certain ways , " says Michael Tiemann , an open source pioneer who founded Cygnus Systems and now is chief technology officer at Red Hat .
Tiemann says
Cox made a number of decisions about Linux code that " broke some logjams " that had been hampering Linux development .
Cox and Torvalds could hardly look less alike .
Torvalds is a cherub - cheeked boy next door .
Cox is the wild and wooly hippie freak .
Do n't fall for stereotypes , though √it turns out that Torvalds is the more loosely - goosey manager , according to Tiemann .
" Linus is adamant that people do their own thing , " he says .
" His message [ to the programmer ] is that you should do what works for you .
Cox says to them : " This is how it works best together , this is how your contribution can become more of a building block . "
Linus seems more of an anarchist .
Alan seems more constructionist . " .... .... .....
When a corporation is headed by a charismatic leader who wo n't spell out a clear path of succession , investors usually get spooked .
Are Linux customers worried ?
There is little evidence at the moment .
But they may be unaware of how loose and uncertain is the structure that Torvalds sits upon .
They may be unaware that Linux 's benevolent dictator has chosen not to reveal his succession plans√or even to say whether he has crafted any succession plan at all .
As I already mentioned in the " Raymondism " section there were some warning signs of common " cult of personality " disease in Linux development starting from early 1998 .
Work on Linux standards was ( and is ) marginal and is not supported by Linus as this undermines his power as the supreme technical guru .
Documentation of internals was in really bad shape and Linus politely explained " he is bad at documentation " :-) .
Starting from the kernel 2.2 based distributions some interoperability problems started to cause some concerns and papers start to appear about problems in this area .
And the speed of development and overload make any fixes of this situation problematic , but in late 2000 the market conditions seems took care about minor Linux distribution players without any lab .
Still there are questions to answered about maturity and rationality of the decision of going both for desktop and low - level servers and high - end computing using a single person an the supreme coordinator of all development efforts .
And this particular question is very difficult to answer because of the personality issues involved .
For example , it 's not clear how long Linus will be able positively contribute to the kernel development or , more importantly , be able productively coordinate increasingly complex and demanding configuration management job on both ends -- desktop and high - end server .
That to a certain extent deprive opportunities for Alan Cox and several other major developers to influence strategic decisions in the development .
Currently Linus is still the focus point of all kernel development efforts , but with three daughters he is definitely not able to work 10 hours or more a day on this problem ( 10 hours a day six days a week looks like a bare minimum for a leader of such a project ) .
Yes I understand that he wants to achieve his financial goals but in such situation the extent to which he is still a positive force is unclear .
May be its time for him to move his responsibilities as a kernel developer coordinator to some independent body like proposed Linux Kernel Development Lab financed by all commercial Linux distributors .
For example now Linus is trying to coordinate symmetric multiprocessing support in the kernel without proper laboratory to test proposed solutions .
And actually without any supporting stuff ( unless there are some shadow support staff in Transmeta ) .
He essentially controls very few areas of the kernel ( probably less than 10 % including memory management stuff and scheduler , both at the level far beyond competition and both are constant source of problems ) so his main contribution now is a management of the development .
It remains to be seen if he will be up to the task and will continue to play constructive role in the movement that largely outgrow the model of loosely coupled mob of Internet connected developers .
Here his Transmeta affiliation looks far from being a best solution .
And I am not only talking about possible conflict of interest in a style " What is good for Transmeta is good for Linux " .
I believe that Larry Wall made a better decision when he went to work for O'Reilly .
First , publishers are closer to academic institutions than most commercial organizations .
Second , at certain point you need a real organization to help you in your efforts .
From that point of view organizations like FreeBSD or even GNU with several core developers that are able physically contact each other have an advantage over current Linux infrastructure .
In any case in some 1999 interviews Linus looks exhausted to level of burnout and it is evident that he hate to produce another version of the kernel in 1999 .
In one interview he even suggested that it probably would be better if Linux returned to the status of his home hobby .
This , of course , is now completely impossible , no matter how he want that or how exhausted he feels .
And was forced his into another rat race to get kernel 2.4 out in 1999 -- the race that was lost .
Question of burnout is also important for other volunteer kernel developers as excessive load is the best way of killing any interest in participating in any volunteer project .
I think that this is one of the main dangers as talented volunteer developers are the most valuable capital Linux has .
With hired developers only ( say Red Hat peoples exclusively )
Linux is not much different from closed commercial OSes like Solaris .
It 's just more difficult to sell it profitably because " once GNU , forever GNU " factor .
From the other point of view if a program has a couple hundred thousand lines does it matter much if it is open sources or not -- open source at this level is just intermediate representation and other intellectual assets like internals documents , special tools for dealing with this level of complexity , etc. are significant barriers of entry .
That 's actually explain Linus unwillingness to spend any time documenting development .
Netscape failure with opening of Communicator showed that large scale projects are a special beasts and the complexity of the project at mature stage is a powerful barrier of entry even to the most motivated and skilled developers .
And please remember that before mid-seventies almost all IBM mainframe software products were open sourced ...
Since approximately 1997 Linus probably became the most well known Finn on the planet .
Now he became a media darling -- a very dangerous and rather time consuming occupation with not that much time to devote to kernel :-) .
And media is pretty cruel as it serves as a powerful amplifier of " cult f personality " disease .
He now has dozens of pages and hundreds of papers devoted to him , including this chapter ;-) .
Among the most active builders of Linus cult I would like to mention Eric Raymond who lionize Linus in his famous " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " paper ( here Eric Raymond motives are pretty clear -- he wanted to benefit from the cult ; see my OSS page for details ) .
Linux movement instantly became Open Source movement and where Linux and Open Source is concerned , hyperbole from the digerteratti hype meisters proliferates nearly as quickly as the hyperlinks .
Here is one quote from LinuxWorld Today that is as close to the style of Soviet media depicting party functionaries as one can ever get :
Throughout the entire keynote the audience listened almost in awe to this man with the good humor , the technical genius , and the incredible people skills that have been able to harness the brilliance of the bazaar , those hundreds , thousands of developers on the Internet , so that they all pull together to move Linux forward , release by release , to the point where it is today .
An entirely unlikely object of affection of nearly the entire computing industry .
And he himself proved to be as susceptible to this disease as communist bureaucrats .
In early 1999 interview Linus first time used the word " invented " to Linux -- the word completely inapplicable to the clone OS and very close to the Microsoft marketing style ( as everybody knows Microsoft " invented Windows " by a blatant rip - off of the Mac GUI ;-) .
As always he failed to mention GNU ( moreover , this time he even forgot to mention that the adoption of GPL license was the smartest thing he ever did ; probably at this time he already has some reservations -- see KDE jihad ) :
PC Week : Give us the short history of Linux 's development .
Torvalds :
Basically , I invented it eight years ago , almost exactly eight years ago .
It started small , not even an operating system .
It was just a personal project .
I just was doing something fun with my new machine .
It kind of evolved through luck and happenstance into an OS , simply because there was very much a void where there was n't much choice for someone like me .
I could n't afford some of the commercial OSes and I did n't want to run DOS or Windows -- I do n't even know , did Windows really exist then ?
PC
Week :
You could have copyrighted Linux and made a fortune .
Why did you make it an open source code operating system , and will that model work in the future as Linux acceptance grows ?
Torvalds :
It started out as a personal belief that , yes , open source was needed .
Then , when it got large enough , I encouraged people to license their own development , their own parts .
Now there are multiple owners sharing all these licenses ...
" Father " Linus Torvalds is now the holy cardinal of the church of Linux .
You can find more relevant quotes in the in the Webliography to the chapter .
Anyway , this " superhero " status of Linus Torvalds remind me of communist empires with their First Secretaries determined to die " serving the country " :-) .
And , yes , the kernel can be a kind of mausoleum ...
What I would like to stress is that Open Source is a very important avenue of software development that need to be supported , but it is unrealistic to consider it a panacea -- software development is really hard no matter open sourced or not .
So if one wants to participate he / she should have no illusions about open source / free software .
There is no royal way for accomplishing big software projects and even with luck one need to struggle / suffer a lot .
That also means that the heroes of OSS development deserve their fame , despite all in - fighting and problems that OSS face .
At the same time it 's important to understand that none of them is or ever been an angel , that they were driven by ( always ) complex and ( often ) contradictory motives .
We also need to understand that usually one of two central figures catch all the fame that should belong to many more people , with some never mentioned in the mainstream press .
And that we do not need the communist - style cult of personality for OSS leaders , who IMHO are to certain extent " accidental leaders " of Linux cult .
The pressure was mounting against Linus excusive control of the kernel .
For example in a story Is Linus Killing Linux published on Jan 26 , 2001 at Techweb Paula Rooney questioned the status quo :
... some solution providers , vendors , and industry observers are beginning to question how long one man can steer the evolution of Linux , and whether Torvalds ' sole oversight of the kernel , now at version 2.4 , is slowing its corporate adoption .
While he's not driven by profit motive , the engineer has significant power over the kernel : Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds himself .
Windows , in contrast , is the trademark of Microsoft .
They note Torvalds lacks formal accountability for Linux and , as a full - time engineer at chip maker Transmeta Corp . ( stock : TMTA ) , has considerable professional obligations outside his open - source activities .
What 's more , industry titans such as IBM Corp. ( stock : IBM ) ; Compaq Computer Corp. ( stock : CPQ ) ; Intel Corp. ( stock : INTC ) ; Hewlett - Packard Corp. ( stock : HWP ) ; and Oracle Corp. ( stock : ORCL ) are pouring billions of dollars into developing Linux products and want to exert more influence on the direction of the kernel , based on customer feedback .
" We need a full - time leader and a nonprofit organization that can be funded by IBM , Compaq , and Dell and the [ Linux ] distributors , " said Hal Davison , owner and president of Davison Consulting , Sarasota , Fla .
Some Linux solution providers view the constantly evolving process of the posting of Linux libraries , patches , and updates to the Internet as inefficient and cumbersome , Davison said .
" VARs are reluctant because they do n't see a clear channel .
They do n't see a Microsoft or strong corporate company saying , ' We 're going to be here forever , ' " he said .
Torvalds opposes the notion of corporate interests controlling the destiny of the Linux kernel .
However , experts say he 'll face pressure from big OEMs and ISVs that are bankrolling the transformation of the technology into a lucrative industry .
The Linux market stands to double this year to $ 4 billion , according to Deutsche Banc Alex .
Brown , a Wall Street investment firm .
OEMs are hopeful but leery about Torvalds ' casual indifference to market needs and capitalist concerns .
IBM 's recent pledge to spend $ 1 billion to advance Linux commercially in 2001 comes with a no-strings - attached promise today , but observers say that wo n't last if Linux does n't pick up steam in the form of revenue and profits .
For example , at the LinuxWorld conference in New York , IBM plans to unveil new Linux initiatives and clients , including Shell Oil .
" In the early stages of open source , it was more of a charitable affair and developers did n't attach a fee , " said George Weiss , an analyst at Gartner .
" But the vendors are in it for financial success , and they 'll think twice about being charitable while answering to their stockholders . "
Publicly , blue - chip vendors recognize Torvalds as the lead Linux developer , but note that they are n't beholden to his final nod to carry out their product plans , as they are with Microsoft 's Bill Gates .
Still , insiders say Torvalds ' casual e-mail sign - offs on the kernel carry tremendous weight in the commercial market and down the food chain from OEMs to ISVs , solution providers , and customers .
For instance , when Torvalds declared Linux 2.4 finished several weeks ago , only Red Hat opted to ship an upgrade based on the " preproduction " Linux 2.4 kernel .
Since then , Linux distributors have begun detailing their product deliverables based on the new kernel .
" [ Torvalds ' ] decisions are not ones you 'd quickly throw out the window , " said Bob Shimp , senior director of database marketing at Oracle , Redwood Shores , Calif. , which contributed to Linux 2.4 development .
" When he 's ready to release the final version , that 's when distributors package it up , " Shimp said .
" Having a little bit of control like that is a good thing .
It all boils down to market forces . "
Despite Torvalds ' technical reign over Linux , IBM and Compaq have quickly become the industry 's de facto Linux leaders , and tensions over the kernel 's direction will heighten as market forces intensify , experts say .
" I do n't believe open source works well for commercial companies because they can't control schedules , " said Michael Cusumano , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management who sits on the board of solution provider NetNumina Solutions .
" Software companies try to have regular development cycles .
That 's how you build a rhythm for a company
" Stop winning about values and grab some cash "
I think a large part of the business models that Linux companies tries to adopt and for which they eventually paid a huge price are attributable to venture capitalists greed .
With an explosive combinations of venture capital and investments banks , you simply throw some money at something fashionable in order to build something akin to a pyramid scheme in which you hope to sell off shares to gullible investors during IPO and get out before the pyramid collapses .
And collapse partially is caused by excessive valuations and excessive zeal with which new public companies tried to expand their market to justify unrealistic evaluations they got during the IPO due to subtle manipulations of the underwriter banks .
This can be considered as a new genre kind of Greek tragedies played on the sunny California soil :-) .
Ancient Gods were blood - thrusty ...
Venture capitalists expect you to do you best to inflate the stock value at the after IPO period as this is a period where they plan to get ( huge ) return on their investment .
And to please them you need to hire 250 or even 500 people even if you understand perfectly well that it might be a sustainable business for only less than 50 .
This is the reason why so many Linux companies are making a huge loss during their first year .
Imagine a company with limited market and a small revenue which like sportsmen on steroids has millions of dollars injected into it to produce quick results no matter what .
How do you spend the money without making a loss ?
Your revenue will not increase overnight and it might be impossible to grow in beyond a very modest sum .
But you spend and spend the money on hiring extra ( and unnecessary ) people , advertising , marketing , partnerships , acquisitions ....
Venture capitalists want you to make a quick buck so that they can get out with profit .
Any how stock will behave after this point is not very interesting to them .
As Linux became fashionable there was a big temptation to make quick buck on Linux and that temptation started a wave of very questionable IPOs .
A business is only able to survive if it makes a profit .
But IPO itself can be a ( questionable ) business model , although not a sustainable one .
And the motto of the movement for some time was changed to " Stop winning about values and grab some cash " .
Boosting ore IPO share price took precedence over creating real value and real software .
Analysts shamelessly hyped the stock of companies with which their investment banks did business .
It would be simply myopic not to see the Linux IPO story as a part of the techobable of the late 1990s with all accompanying it hype , greed and immorality .
As we will see the post IPO scandals and suits scandal marks the end of an era and later with Enron fiasco raised the question of the strength of the fundamentals of the US markets : transparency , accountability and trust .
Actually a company is only able to direct its own course if it remains free from the the excessive influence of the capital markets .
And that excessive influence is essentially on of the most important factors that dooms many developing country economies , to say nothing about small startups .
That means that in a healthy financial climate financing of the business is provided via growth of revenue from sales , not from selling shares ( we will for simplicity avoid tax - avoiding schemes when shares sold at discount constitute a major part of employee salaries ) .
How much good can a company do to the open source software movement , and its owners and employees , within those constraints ?
Linux startups history in general and RH in particular suggests some answers to this question .
First on all let 's state it frankly that from business perspective each additional Linux distributors dilutes the value of the other distributors franchises by diverting some potential customers .
So there is no much love left among creators of different commercial Linux distributions .
The first largely unknown event in the commercialization of Linux was the selling of www.linux.com domain by its owner Fred van Kempen for undisclosed sum ( rumored to be up to five millions ) to VA Research ( of future VA Linux IPO fame ) .
That was a nice return on investment that proved that Linux is able quickly produce millionaires .
And Fred van Kempen soon became just an interesting footnote in the history of crazy Linux IPOs .
In 1998 Red Hat became an undisputed leader among Linux distributors .
It got several important investments including one from IBM ( who also invested in other Linux distributors ) and one from Intel as well as one from Novell ( that was essentially a blow to Caldera ) .
The community developers are supposed to build Red Hat 's product , while the certifications and vendor endorsements are held back for the high - priced " Red Hat Enterprise Linux " brand .
With almost a hundred developers ( including Alan Cox ) it looked like Red Had might implicitly controls the direction of Linux kernel development by a mere share of brainpower it employs .
In this sense by mere fact of existence of this Red Hat developers involved with solving of complex problem of running enterprise style applications like Oracle on the Linux kernel the role of Linus Torvalds was shrinking .
Linux Torvalds cannot pay too much attention to the Oracle problems .
One sign of this is that he no longer controls production versions of the kernel and in some cases it 's possible to outsmart Linus putting into production version features that he might object .
But Linus Torvalds is much less democratic than he appears and still drive the configuration management of the kernel with an iron fist and that pretty much limits Red Hat possibilities , although no question Red Hat has its own proprietary kernel in his distributions .
In late 2000 after Linus sold all Red Hat shares , he actually slammed RH about version of GNU compiler included into v. 7.0 , but this was just an accident or as somebody cynically suggested in Linux Today " an implicit assumption of guilt for his Midas touch ;-) "
Red Hat 's business model is by - and - large an outsourcing model ( with " shared " free developers or " not so shared " part time developers producing the code that Red Hat sells ) .
As there are less expensive distribution , revenue stream form selling the software is not a reliable revenue mode , Red Hat almost completely depends on its subscription - based revenue stream , so he need to close distributions as much as possible .
Clones like Mandrake ( that outsell Red Hat on the desktop ) are ( from the pure business perspective ) annoying enough to justify some counteractions .
It 's interesting to note that with the complexity of the latest versions of Linux , Red Hat managed to lock people into their distribution without breaking GPL license ; the key is in how they put it all together .
If you try to compile pine on a Red Hat 5.2 machine it wo n't run on Debian 2.1 , although both distributions use glibc6 .
But if you compile it the Debian machine , it would ran on both platforms .
Something about Red Hat 's development environment prevented the Red Hat compiled binary from running on Debian .
This power over little things , like where files should be placed , and which libc to use is a considerable power independently whether the product is GPLed or not ;-) .
This demonstrates that if a company develops a product on Red Hat , users may have trouble running that product on other platforms .
At the same time , many companies feel that they must develop on Red Hat -- most of their customers will be using Red Hat .
Anyway , in late 1998 it looks like Red Hat was close to be perceived as the de facto owner of Linux .
This is a perception created a solid preconditions for the successful IPO pyramid scheme .
After Red
Hat files for IPO many expected that it will
