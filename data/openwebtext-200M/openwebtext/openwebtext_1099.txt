Peer to peer lending has been a hot topic on personal finance blogs for the last year or so .
Lots of people are promoting it as a good way to make decent returns on your money – even in a tough economy like we ’re in ( Some might argue that it ’s because of the hard times we ’re in that it ’s becoming a better way to make good interest on your money ) .
I have stayed out of the social lending market because up until recently my wife and I were still building up 3 - 6 months of expenses in our emergency fund ( actually we ’re closer to 8 months , we ’re a bit more conservative than some ) , and we did n’t really have a lot of extra money to put into things Lending Club or Prosper .
We ’ve finally completed our 8 months of expenses , and since we now have a little bit extra discretionary income , I thought I would sign up to use one of the more popular person to person lending services , Lending Club .
The Idea Behind Peer - To - Peer Lending
For those of you who are n’t familiar with P - 2 - P lending , here is a quick primer of how it works .
Sites like Lending Club bring together a large network of borrowers and investors .
As an investor / lender you can choose to invest as little as $ 25 with one borrower , or if you want to invest a larger sum you can spread out your money between a larger number of loans .
( You can lend a large amount to one borrower , but it is n’t suggested .
Better to diversify your holdings . )
As a borrower you can get a loan for up to $ 25,000 and have that amount lent to you from many different sources .
P - 2 - P lending may allow people who might otherwise not be able to get a traditional bank loan to still fund their business , consolidate debt , or fund a wedding – all while getting a lower interest rate than they might have at a bank or on their credit card .
Peer - to - peer lending is n’t without it ’s downside – and as with many traditional loans there are going to be plenty of people that default on their loans , and do n’t repay .
So you need to take that into account when choosing the loans you want to fund , and looking at the higher interest rates on riskier loans .
The higher the interest rate that you ’ll receive , the more risk you ’ll take on .
Also , Lending Club and other P - 2 - P sites are not available in all states .
Signing Up For Lending Club
I chose to sign up for Lending Club as my first foray into P - 2 - P lending because it has a pretty good reputation in the blogosphere , and elsewhere .
They also successfully registered with the SEC in 2008 , which has given them even more credibility .
Signing up for the Lending Club was a simple process , although it will take you a few days from signing up until you can actually begin lending .
Here are the steps to sign up .
Go to Lending Club web site Click on Join Now link at the top right of the screen and complete the application to be a borrower or investor on the screen that comes up .
If signing up as an investor do n’t forget to use the referral code below for $ 50 free !
You should receive a confirmation email , in which you ’ll need to click on a link to confirm your registration .
Go back to the Lending Club website and login with your new login info .
Click on the Invest button .
Fill in your profile information in order to verify who you are , and to link your bank account to Lending Club .
( Lending Club will make two small deposits into your account to verify that you have access to the account ) .
Once your bank account is verified , go to the My Account tab , and then choose Add Funds .
You ’ll need to transfer at least $ 25 to your Lending Club account in order to get started .
This may take a few days .
From My Account tab , click on Invest to start lending money
Once you ’ve finished to process above , you ’ll be ready to start lending money .
This is the fun part – lending money , and making a bit of money in return .
Lending Money With Lending Club
Lending money using Lending Club is actually kind of fun .
You get to read about people ’s situation , find out why they ’re taking out a loan , and then see if they are in fact a good credit risk .
I decided to look mainly at loans that were from borrowers with good credit scores , verified income , and what I considered good reasons for taking out a loan ( I ’m usually against taking on new debt of most kinds , so I did n’t want to fund loans unless they were for people bettering their debt situation , and trying to get out of debt ) .
Since I ’m just testing the waters , I decided to invest $ 100 for now .
If I ’m happy with the returns and borrower repayment I ’ll consider investing more in the future .
Originally I was planning on investing my money with my friend Matt over at DebtFreeAdventure.com who is currently repaying a Lending Club loan to consolidate a couple of higher interest credit cards and an auto loan .
Unfortunately ( for me ) his loan was completely funded before my deposit was credited to my LC account .
So I had to find other loans to fund .
To find borrowers to fund just do the following :
Click on the Invest tab at the top of the page .
Enter how much you would like to invest with each loan .
Hit the Run LendingMatch button to match your lending amount to borrowers .
If you would like you can increase the amount of risky loans you are willing to take on ( and the interest you can make ) using the slider on the page .
When you are done hit the Next button and it will bring back a list of matching loans for you to invest in , based upon your risk tolerance that you ’ve selected .
If you prefer to select loans manually , you can also do that by selecting the Browse Notes link at the top of the page ( this is what I chose to do ) .
Since I was investing with Lending Club for the first time I decided to manually select the notes that I would be investing in .
I did n’t want to invest in anything that sounded overly risky , or to invest with anyone that sounded like they were n’t very responsible .
Since I am only investing $ 100 to start , it did n’t take me very long to find 4 notes to invest $ 25 in , with people who had good credit scores , and who were either in the A or B credit rating .
Once you have your notes selected you just click on the Invest button , and then confirm your purchase order for those loans , and those amounts .
Piece of cake .
Now , I just have to sit back and watch the interest pile up !

I ’ve been assuming that the forthcoming ban on using a cellphone while driving is just an unenforceable piece of symbolic politics unlikely to do any harm .
I still think that ’s right , but this story from the States of a woman being pulled over for allegedly talking on a cellphone , tased , arrested , and having her kids left in a freezing car for 40 minutes made me think twice :
In January , an Onondaga County sheriff ’s deputy pulled over Audra Harmon , who had two of her kids with her in her minivan .
A routine traffic stop escalated quickly .
The deputy , Sean Andrews , accused her of talking on her cell phone .
She said she could prove him wrong .
He said she was speeding .
She denied it and got out of the van .
He told her to get back in .
She did , then he ordered her back out .
He yanked her out by the arm , knocked her down with two Taser shots and charged her with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest .
His rationale on the disorderly conduct charge :
She obstructed traffic when she got out of the van .
The speeding accusation : going 50 mph in a 45 - mph zone . (…)
Andrews told Harmon he ’d seen her using her cell phone while she was driving .
In the video , he makes a phone gesture with his hand .
She told him she ’d been driving with her right hand on her cheek , but that she had n’t talked on the phone for at least two hours .
She says she offered to let him look at the phone to see for himself .
He declined . (…)
“ Are you OK ?
Do you need help ? ” [ witnesses ]
Santorelli and her father yelled , according to Santorelli ’s statement to deputies .
“ I ’m not OK , and I do need help , ” Harmon responded .
As Andrews picked her up and escorted her to his car , Harmon pleaded with the witnesses .
“ Please come get my kids ! ” Harmon remembers yelling .
The witnesses said they could n’t do that , but they asked Harmon for her home number so they could call her husband .
She gave it to them .
“ I wanted these strangers to get my kids , because at that point I thought they ’d be safer with strangers , ” Harmon says .
The kids sat in the car for about 40 minutes until their father arrived and took them home , which was about 500 yards away , she says .
Harmon said she wants to teach police a lesson :
It ’s OK to admit you ’re wrong .
She said Andrews manufactured the speeding charge once he realized she did n’t deserve a cell phone ticket .
Andrews had not clocked her with a radar gun .
Instead , he said in a report , he calculated her speed by following her for “ several seconds . ”
“ I want the public to know these police officers apparently are n’t being trained well enough to know when it is justified to use a Taser , ” she said .
Remember that wonderful evening on November 4 , 2008 , when Barack Obama appeared on stage in Chicago 's Grant Park and gave a stirring election victory speech in front of 250,000 cheering , weeping , ecstatic supporters ( including Oprah ) and millions more around the globe watching on TV ?

It was such an exciting time .
What I would like to know is what the hell happened in the past week ?
We all encounter more than our share of foolish blog posts .
Most of the time you simply have to let them be .
You could spend the rest of your life correcting drones and automatons who will never have an original or unconventional thought no matter how much you prod them .
Their seventh - grade teacher , who was also the track coach , taught them what they know , and they ’re sticking to it .
Once in a while , though , for your own sake and for the sake of readers who suspect the post is all wrong but are n’t quite sure why , you let loose with a full - blown response .
And that ’s what I ’m doing here in reaction to a blog entry called " Peter Schiff : Medicare Recipients Are Lazy People Who Refuse to Pay for Their Own Health Care . "
This is longer than my usual pieces , but I hope I am not trying the reader ’s patience too much .
In block quotes are the words of a blog author who identifies himself , interestingly enough , simply as " Che . "
Here we go .
I love it when right wing economists talk about " market forces " and " letting the free market run our economy . "
They make it sound like the free market is some altruistic being that always knows exactly what to do and when to do it .
I do not know of anyone who subscribes to this junior - camper caricature .
For one thing , no free - market economist is dumb enough to use a phrase like " letting the free market run our economy . "
The free market is merely the matrix of free exchanges entered into by individuals .
How can a matrix of free exchanges " run " anything ?
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Secondly , no free - market economist thinks the market " always knows exactly what to do and when to do it . "
If that were the case , how could free - market economists account for firms that go out of business ?
The argument that free - market economists actually make is that on the free market , decisions regarding what to produce , in what quantities , using what methods , and in what locations , are made in light of satisfying the most urgent demands of consumers .
Business firms find out very quickly what consumers want and what they do not want , and they adjust their production decisions accordingly .
Profits indicate that a particular industry is combining factors of production in a way that pleases consumers .
As a result , production in that industry tends to expand .
Likewise , losses indicate that value is being reduced or destroyed , and that factors of production are being employed in lines of production that please consumers less , at the expense of other lines of production where they might have produced something consumers wanted more .
There are limitless ways business firms can combine factors of production to produce an equally limitless potential array of goods .
Thankfully , firms do not have to grope around in the dark amid these trillions of choices .
If their production process uses an input more urgently needed elsewhere , that input gets bid away from them and they find a substitute .
If they produce too much of something , their resulting losses prompt them to produce less , thereby releasing resources for the production of another good that consumers value more highly .
At all times , resources are directed , in light of consumer wants , to those production processes in which they are most urgently demanded .
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
So no , markets do not know " exactly what to do and when to do it " — a juvenile caricature — but feedback from consumers ’ decisions does constantly push markets toward a more efficient use of limited resources .
Government , on the other hand , has no rational basis for determining what to produce , in what quantities , and so on .
It gets its money not by providing a good that people voluntarily choose to purchase , but by seizing the funds from its subject population .
Since it therefore lacks a profit - and - loss feedback mechanism , every single production decision it makes is absolutely arbitrary , and necessarily wastes resources .
It operates completely in the dark .
It can not adjust to consumer demand , since it has no way of calculating the best , least wasteful way to produce .
More than that , it can not even know what to produce .
The free market is not some emotionless , all knowing entity .
It is controlled by humans who are susceptible to greed , corruption , and exploitation .
The free market is only as pure as the fallible human beings that control it .
As we ’ve seen , the free market is just a matrix of exchanges , so no one in his right mind would describe it as any kind of " entity , " whether " emotionless , " " all knowing , " or " yellow with purple polka dots . "
We ’ll deal with " corruption " and " exploitation " below .
But in keeping with Che ’s charming devotion to government , he does n’t consider that its own officials might be susceptible to greed , corruption , and exploitation .
Later , he suggests that corrupt politicians can simply be voted out of office ( how ’s that one working out for you so far , Che ? ) .
He does not consider the possibility that corporations that do not produce what consumers want can likewise be voted out of the economy by merely abstaining from buying their products .
If free market principles were allowed to rule , like Schiff wants , what that means is everything is based on maximizing profit .
At this point we are all supposed to gasp at what a terrible prospect this would be .
After all , the track coach and Michael Moore have told us about the wickedness of " profits , " so what more is there to say , really ?
What Has Government Do ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 1.83 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 08:05 EST - Details )
But as we ’ve seen above , profit is simply society ’s way of ratifying a firm ’s past production decisions .
It indicates what consumers want , and ( by the process of imputation ) the best process for producing it .
Profits attract further investment in a given line of production , until the increased supply of goods in that industry brings the rate of return there back down to the level that exists elsewhere in the economy .
This is how we ensure that our limited resources are not wasted , and that the most urgently desired goods are produced .
In the absence of profit as a driving force , how exactly would Che like to see resources allocated ?
We can either allow consumer preferences to guide production , or let the personal preferences of a monopolist ( i.e. , government ) dictate what should be produced and how .
When the question is posed this way , the choice is pretty clear , which is why the question is never posed this way .
Incidentally , would Che prefer to base economic decision making on maximizing losses instead ?
Would that be better ?
Two major byproducts occur when the only concern of an economy is profit .
1. Quality goes down because corners must be cut to save money and compete ( See China ) .
Now Che , think about this for a minute .
Suppose you had an economy in which profit was of no concern whatever .
Would quality go up , then ?
Would we enjoy products of ever - increasing quality if businesses were not required to satisfy the consuming public ( which is what earning profits means ) in order to stay in business ?
You do n’t think their freedom from the need to make profits might make them lazy , or unresponsive to consumer demand ?
You think they ’d work overtime on high - quality products for the sake of the brotherhood of man , or the great fatherland , or whatever abstraction the regime proposes ?
If the consumer wants high - quality merchandise , producers will compete to provide him with it .
If everyone is producing low - quality garbage , there is a gigantic profit opportunity awaiting a newcomer who simply improves product quality .
Do n’t you believe those evil corporations would jump at the chance to profit ?
Why in your scenario do those wicked , wily , greedy characters suddenly lose their drive to earn a return ?
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
You will say that consumers wo n’t pay higher prices for quality merchandise .
But where does that arbitrary assertion come from ?
If they wo n’t pay the higher prices , then that means they are satisfied with the existing level of quality , and that the money they might have spent on nicer things is in their view more urgently spent on something else — basic , no - frills products , say .
You , Che , are not in a position to judge their decision .
If they will pay higher prices , then more upscale firms will cater to them — which , if you ’d turn your head slightly and glance around a bit , you ’ll notice is how the economy already works .
There is , after all , no logical limit to the potential quality of merchandise .
Following Chester Lampwick on The Simpsons , someone may purchase a solid - gold house .
Now most people , in their search for higher - quality dwellings , may not want to live in a straw hut , but they are likewise prepared to stop well short of a solid - gold house .
There is no nonarbitrary way to decide , apart from the voluntary spending streams emanating from consumers and the production decisions made on that basis , what ratio of quality to affordability people should choose .
Again , though , all we need to do is look around to find the refutation of Che ’s strange claim .
Are automobiles today of lower quality than they were in , say , 1977 ?
Would anyone care to trade in his Blu-ray player for a 1981 VCR ?
The Blu-ray also costs a teensy - weensy bit less , in real terms , than the 1981 VCR , I might add .
I trust you that there is something wicked in all this , Che , but I ’m just not seeing it .
2 . Wages go down , because it [ employers ’ drive for profits ] pits workers against one another .
For example , if there are no labor regulations , I can pay a woman significantly less than a man to do the same job .
This forces wages down , because now a man must settle for a depressed wage if he wants a job .
This is why nonchemists do not write about chemistry , and nonbotanists stay out of botany .

The Best of Tom Woods
Speaking during a conference call following its Q1 financial report , Sony Corp CEO and Executive Vice President Nobuyuki Oneda revealed that the cost of manufacturing its PS3 console have dropped by 70 per cent .
" The cost reduction since we introduced the PS3 is very substantial and this is on schedule , " said Oneda .
" We do n't disclose how much of the PS3 , specifically the cost deduction was achieved during the past two years .
But that is on schedule . "
He added that the figure is " about 70 % , roughly speaking " .
Precise manufacturing costs are n't known , although a figure of $ 800 / £ 485 has been commonly accepted for the cost at launch .
With a 70 per cent reduction applied that figure shrinks down to £ 146 , around half that of the current retail price of the 80 GB PS3 .
It 's widely expected that Sony will announce a PS3 price cut and the PS3 Slim at its Gamescom press conference next month .

Longtime Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso will be inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame .
John LeClair gets a nod as well , but his tenure in Pittsburgh is highlighted by the time he crashed into Geno and injured Malkin ’s shoulder during the preseason , causing the future Conn Smythe winner to miss the first month or so of his Calder - winning rookie campaign .
So we ’ll mostly applaud Tommy here .
Barrasso famously helped the Pens win their first two Cups in ’91 and ’ 92 .
And he was with the team up until the onset of this decade , which is nuts , considering he won the Calder himself back in ’ 84 .
He also picked up the Vezina as the top goaltender that year .
He still holds the record for most points by a goaltender with 48 .
They were all assists .
Lemieux would ’ve “ buried it . ”
All I can say is congrats , and thanks for all the success you helped bring to the Pens , Tom .
Whenever your name was brought up during your time in the ‘ Burgh , the response I ’d mostly get was “ that guy is an asshole . ”
I ’m not entirely sure why , so I ’ll clarify for them , and from here on out , will refer to you as “ Stanley Cup Winner and Hall of Fame Asshole , Tom Barrasso . ”
Congrats .
[ from The Technium ]
Cities are technological artifacts , the largest technology we make .
Their impact is out of proportion to the number of humans living in them .
As the chart above shows , the percentage of humans living in cities averaged about one or two percent for most of recorded history .
( The chart ’s Y axis is a logarithmic scale of percentage . )
Yet almost everything that we think of when we say “ culture ” arose within cities .
After all , the terms “ city ” and “ civilization ” share the same root .
But the massive citification , or urbanization , that characterizes the technium today is a very recent development .
Like most other charts depicting the technium , not much happens until the last two centuries .
Then populations booms , innovation rockets , information explodes , freedoms increase , and cities rule .
Cities may be engines of innovation , but not everyone thinks they are beautiful , particularly the megalopolises of today , with their sprawling rapacious appetites .
They seem like machines eating the wilderness , and many wonder if they are eating us as well .
Is the recent large - scale relocation to cities a choice or a necessity ?
Are people pulled by the lure of opportunities , or are they pushed against their will by desperation ?
Why would anyone willingly choose to leave the balm of a village and squat in a smelly , leaky hut in a city slum unless they were forced to ?
Well , every city begins as a slum .
First it ’s a seasonal camp , with the usual free - wheeling make - shift expediency .
Creature comforts are scarce , squalor the norm .
Hunters , scouts , traders , pioneers find a good place to stay for the night , or two , and then if their camp is a desirable spot it grows into an untidy village , or uncomfortable fort , or dismal official outpost , with permanent buildings surrounded by temporary huts .
If the location of the village favors growth , concentric rings of squatters aggregate around the core until the village swells to a town .
When a town prospers it acquires a center — civic or religious — and the edges of the city continue to expand in unplanned , ungovernable messiness .
It does n’t matter in what century or in which country , the teaming guts of a city will shock and disturb the established residents .
The eternal disdain for newcomers is as old as the first city .
Romans complained of the tenements , shacks and huts at the edges of their town that “ were putrid , sodden and sagging . ”
Every so often Roman soldiers would raze a settlement of squatters , only to find it rebuilt or moved within weeks .
Babylon , London , and New York all had seamy ghettos of unwanted settlers erecting shoddy shelters with inadequate hygiene and engaging in dodgy dealings .
Historian Bronislaw Geremek states that “ slums constituted a large part of the urban landscape ” of Paris in the Middle Ages .
Even by the 1780s , when Paris was at is peak , nearly 20 % of its residents did not have a “ fixed abode ” — that is they lived in shacks .
In a familiar complaint about medieval French cities , a gentleman from that time noted : “ Several families inhabit one house .
A weaver ’s family may be crowded into a single room , where they huddle around a fireplace . ”
That refrain is repeated throughout history .
Manhattan was home to 20,000 squatters in self - made housing .
Slab City alone , in Brooklyn ( named after the use of planks stolen from lumber mills ) , contained 10,000 residents in its slum at its peak .
In the New York slums “ nine out of ten of the shanties have only one room , which does not average over twelve feet square , and this serves all the purposes of the family . ”
San Francisco was built by squatters .
As Rob Neuwirth recounts in his wonderful book Shadow Cities , one survey in 1855 estimated that “ 95 percent of the property holders in [ San Francisco ] city would not be able to produce a bona fide legal title to their land . ”
Squatters were everywhere , in the marshes , sand dunes , military bases .
One eyewitness said , “ Where there was a vacant piece of ground one day , the next saw it covered with half a dozen tents or shanties . ”
Philadelphia was largely settled by what local papers called “ squatlers . ”
As late as 1940 , one in five citizens in Shanghai was a squatter .
Those one million squatters stayed and kept upgrading their slum so that within one generation their shantytown became one of the first 21st century cities .
That ’s how it works .
Over time slums gain permanency .
Ad hoc shelters are upgraded , infrastructure extended , and makeshift services become official .
What was once the home of poor hustlers becomes , over the span of generations , the home of rich hustlers .
Propagating slums is what cities do , and living in slums is how cities grow .
The majority of neighborhoods in almost every modern city are merely successful former slums .
The squatter cities of today will become the blue - blood neighborhoods of tomorrow .
Slums of the past and slums today follow the same description .
The first impression is and was one of filth and overcrowding .
In a ghetto a thousand years ago and in a slum today shelters are haphazard and dilapidated .
The smells overwhelming .
But there is vibrant economic activity .
Every slum boasts eateries , and bars .
And most have rooming houses , or places you can rent a bed .
They have animals , fresh milk , grocery stores , barber shops , healers , herb stores , repair stands , and strong armed men offering “ protection . ”
A squatter city is , and has always been , a shadow city , a parallel world without official permission , but a city nonetheless .
The improvisation and creative energies unleashed by a squatter city are so attractive that we build them just for the pleasure of their raucousness .
Take Burning Man , the arts festival arising every year in the Nevada desert .
It is a bona fide squatter city built and run semi-legally by its inhabitants .
It is , in essence , a slum with porta potties .
It draws 40,000 residents who bang together huts , shanties , tents , and make - shift shelters , and then , like any other slum , trade , barter , and share their few skills and belongings .
The owner - built architecture of Burning Man is thrilling , and the gift economy bracing .
Because this futuristic slum is so dense and temporary , it has one of the highest concentrations of creativity I ’ve seen anywhere .
Like any city , a slum is highly efficient .
Maybe even more than the official sections because nothing goes to waste .
The rag pickers and resellers and scavengers all live in the slums and scour the rest of the city for scraps to assemble into shelter , and to feed their economy .
Slums are the skin of the city , its permeable edge that can balloon as it grows .
The city as a whole is a wonderful technological invention which concentrates the flow of energy and minds into computer chip - like density .
In a relatively small footprint , a city not only provides living quarters and occupations in a minimum of space , but a city also generates a maximum of ideas and inventions .
The squatter city at Black Rock , Nevada
As Stewart Brand notes in the City Planet chapter of his upcoming book Whole Earth Discipline , “ Cities are wealth creators ; they have always been . ”
He quotes urban theorist Richard Florida who claims that 40 of the largest megacities in the world , home to 18 % of the world ’s population , “ produce two - thirds of global economic output and nearly 9 in 10 new patented innovations . ”
A Canadian demographer figured that “ 80 to 90 percent of GNP growth occurs in cities . ”
The raggedy new part of each city , its squats and encampments , often house the most productive citizens .
As Mike Davis points out in Planet of Slums , “ The traditional stereotype of the Indian pavement - dweller is a destitute peasant , newly arrived from the countryside , who survives by parasitic begging , but as research in Mumbai has revealed , almost all ( 97 percent ) have at least one breadwinner , and 70 percent have been in the city at least six years … ”
Slum dwellers are often busy with low paying service jobs in nearby high rent districts ; they have money but live in a squatter city because it ’s close to their work .
Because they are industrious , they progress fast .
One UN report found that households in the older slums of Bangkok have on average 1.6 televisions , 1.5 cell phones , a refrigerator ; two - thirds have a washing machine and CD player , and half have a fixed line phone , video player and a motor scooter .
In the favelas of Rio , the first generation of squatters had a literacy rate of only 5 % , but their kids were 97 % literate .
There is a price to pay for that growth .
As vibrant and dynamic as cities are , their edges can be unpleasant .
To enter a slum you need to walk down shit lane .
There is human excrement rotting on the sidewalk , urine flowing in the gutter and garbage piled up in heaps .
I ’ve done it many times in the sprawling shantytowns of the developing world and it is no fun — especially for the residents .
To compensate for this outer contamination and ugliness , the insides of squatter housing is often surprisingly soothing .
Recycled material covers the walls , color abounds , knick - knacks accumulate to create a comfy zone .
Sure , one room will house far more people than seems possible , but for many , a slum dwelling offers more comfort than a village hut .
While the pirated electricity may be unreliable , at least there is electricity .
The single water spigot may have a long line , but it might be closer than the well at home .
Medicines are expensive , but available .
And there are schools with teachers that show up .
It is not utopia .
When it rains , slums turn to mud cities .
The ceaseless call for bribes for everything is dispiriting .
And there is the embarrassment that squatters feel about the obvious low - status of their homes .
As Suketa Mehta , author of Maximum City ( about Mumbai , and quoted by Brand ) says , “ Why would anyone leave a brick house in the village with its two mango trees and its view of small hills in the East to come here ? ”
Then he answers : “ So that someday the eldest son can buy two rooms in Mira Road , at the northern edges of the city .
And the younger one can move beyond that , to New Jersey .
Discomfort is an investment … ”
Then Mehta continues : “ For the young person in an Indian village , the call of Mumbai is n’t just about money .
It ’s also about freedom . ”
Stewart Brand recounts this summation of the magnetic pull of cities by activist Kavita Ramdas : “ In the village , all there is for a woman is to obey her husband and relatives , pound millet , and sing .
If she moves to town , she can get a job , start a business , and get education for her children . ”
The Bedouin of Arabia were once seemingly the freest people on earth , roaming the Great Empty Quarter at will , under a tent of stars and no one ’s boss .
But they are rapidly quitting their nomadic life and hustling into drab concrete block apartments in exploding Gulf - state ghettos .
As reported by Donovan Webster for National Geographic , they stable their camels and goats in their ancestral village , since the bounty and attraction of the herder ’s life still remain for them .
The Bedouin are lured , not pushed , to the city because , in their own words : “ We can always go into the desert to taste the old life .
But this [ new ] life is better than the old way .
Before there was no medical care , no schools for our children . ”
An 80 - year old Bedouin chief sums it up better than I could : “ The children will have more options for their future . ”
The migrants do n’t have to come .
Yet , they come by the millions from the villages , or the deserts and scrublands .
If you ask them why they come , it ’s almost always the same answer , the same answer given by the Bedouin and slum dwellers of Mumbai .
They come for opportunities .
They could stay where they are .
The seasonal droughts and floods are eternal .
The hardship in planting and harvesting in the hills are ancient .
And so is the incredible beauty of the land and the intensity of family and community support .
If everything were equal who would want to leave a Greek island , or a Himalayan village , or the lush gardens of southern China ?
The young men and women could stay in the villages and adopt the satisfying rhythms of agriculture and small town craft that their parents followed .
The same tools work .
The same traditions would deliver the same good things .
Very little in the country side has changed .
It is all as it has always been — except the outside around it is new .
Now the young have TV and radio and trips into town to see movies and they know what is possible .
They could stay .
But while their options in the village have not decreased , the options outside the village in the city have enlarged to such a degree that it makes the village seem a prison .
They could stay , like the Amish choose to do .
Or Wendell Berry .
They could keep the minimalist ways going as their ancestors have for millennia .
They could stay and not increase their technology .
But they choose — very willingly , very eagerly — to run to the city .
Some argue that they had no choice .
That those who arrive in the slums are forced against their desires to migrate to the city because their villages lacked the options of education , jobs and opportunity .
It is true there ’s an imbalance of options — that ’s the point .
But there is work in the villages ; it is just that this work does not pay cash ( by which to buy cell phones and movie tickets ) , and it is boring for many , although it can be very satisfying if one is patient .
That livelihood of seasonal toil , abundant leisure , strong family ties , strong conformity , rewarding physical labor — all this treasure is unquestionably available to them .
They could stay .
But they do not choose it .
They choose possibilities and opportunities .
They stream into the open - ended city aware of what they left behind .
I once spotted the classic Manhattan subway map on the mud walls of a Sherpa hut in the Himalaya .
It was some trekker ’s small joke , a nod to technological incongruity .
But in many parts of Africa and Asia it is not incongruous to hear country - western music wailing from a radio in a quiet alley .
Country music has an unexpected international appeal .
Country star Kenny Rogers is the number one musician in Kenya , where there are more than one all - country - music radio stations .
Dolly Parton sells out in South Africa .
Modified versions of Johnny Cash cover songs can he heard in Afghanistan .
Country music has fans wherever people are departing rural areas .
In other words , worldwide .
Turns out that the weeping tunes about better days can be understood even without understanding the lyrics .
That crying slide guitar is the perfect accompaniment for the universal nostalgia that millions of migrants experience in their new urban homes .
They miss the countryside they recently left , and they can hear their own yearning for it in Kenny Rogers ’s deep longing .
Country music began in America during the very period when vigorous farm towns dissolved into suburbia .
It is played along highways , among factory workers , and in the low - rent fringes of urbanity as a comforting reminder of what has been lost .
Perhaps the songs serve as a charm to ward off further demise .
The benefits of the city and technology are not free ; they are paid with a sigh .
There are times and places when that pull of options is replaced by a involuntary push .
I think there is nothing as disturbing as the sight of indigenous tribesmen , say in the Amazon basin or in the jungles of Borneo or Papua New Guinea , wielding chain saws felling their own forests .
When your forest home is toppled , you are pushed into camps , then towns , and then to cities .
That migration is not voluntary .
Once in a camp , cut off from your hunter - gatherer skills , it makes a weird sense to take the only paid job around , which is cutting down your neighbors forest .
Even though this job is a choice of sorts , the narrow options that constrain it are very clear .
The despicable treatment of indigenous tribes by American white settlers really did force them into settlements and the adoption of new technologies they were in no hurry to use .
But since not every colonial nation forced their indigenous subjects into urbanity , this forced migration is not inherent in urbanity .
It is a policy that is freely chosen by a people , and not mandated by technology itself .
Gratefully , forced migration happens less and less .
Habitat for aboriginal tribes , however , is still being cut down , putting intense pressure on them to abandon their ancient lifestyles .
A certain small percentage of the river of people streaming into the cities today are being pushed by the expansion of the technium .
It is a horribly stupid policy to destroy natural habitat this way , and a horribly stupid policy to displace tribes .
It does not have to be that way .
Wiser people would not allow it .
But today , as in the past , most of the mass movement toward cities — the hundreds of millions per decade — is led by settled people willing to pay the price of inconvenience and grime , living in a slum in order to gain opportunities and freedom .
The poor move into the city for the same reason the rich move into the technological future — to head towards possibilities and increased freedoms .
Además , en el paquete económico para el próximo año propone la creación de un impuesto de 2 % al consumo incluye alimentos y medicinas para combatir la pobreza y otro de 4 % a telecomunicaciones
[ email protected ]
El presidente Felipe Calderón anunció una reforma estructural en el gobierno federal que incluye la desaparición de secretarías y la reducción del gasto oficial .
Además , en el paquete económico para el próximo año propone la creación de un impuesto de 2 % al consumo — incluye alimentos y medicinas — para combatir la pobreza y otro de 4 % a telecomunicaciones , así como el incremento del Impuesto Sobre la Renta , de 28 % a 30 % , y un aumento en el gravamen a tabaco , cerveza y sorteos .
Para transformar a México y enfrentar la “ gravedad de las circunstancias ” , Calderón presentó cuatro acciones .
La primera implica la desaparición de tres secretarías : Turismo , que será absorbida por Economía ; la de Reforma Agraria , cuyas funciones se dividirán entre Desarrollo Social y Agricultura .
Y la desaparición de la Función Pública , la cual se transformará en una contraloría dependiente de la Presidencia de la República .
La segunda medida incluye la reducción de altos mandos y el congelamiento de sueldos .
Como tercer punto , se recortarán recursos a embajadas y delegaciones federales en los estados .
Por último , disminuirán los viáticos , los gastos de representación , consultorías y asesorías .
Al presentar el Presupuesto de Egresos para el año próximo , el secretario de Hacienda , Agustín Carstens , explicó que el gasto público programable se reducirá 218 mil millones de pesos respecto a lo aprobado para 2009 .
En el documento entregado ayer al Congreso se plantea otorgar nuevas concesiones de radio y televisión , así como abrir el sector a la inversión extranjera directa .
En el proyecto , se propone una reducción de 2.7 % a los recursos de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública , así como a Educación .
En los Criterios Generales de Política Económica , la Secretaría de Hacienda estimó en 3 % el crecimiento del Producto Interno Bruto ; en 53.9 dólares el precio del petróleo ; en 2.5 millones de barriles diarios la plataforma de producción ; fijó el déficit fiscal en 0.5 % del PIB , es decir 4 mil 500 millones de dólares , y pronosticó una inflación de 3.3 % .
The Transportation Security Administration began collecting additional data on airline passengers taking domestic flights this week to aid in catching terrorists .
If a terrorist is clever enough to enter the United States , the terrorist is also clever enough not to get caught on a domestic flight .
Storing more data on innocent U.S. citizens may not reduce false positives as intended .
It may actually increase the number of false positives caused by clerical errors and chance similarities .
This brings me to a point I touched upon yesterday when discussing a hypothetical libertarian airline .
Passengers do not need to show ID before boarding an airplane .
After all , there are countless stories of passengers who lost or had their ID stolen while on vacation .
The government should not force airlines to turn these passengers away .
If airlines turn passengers away of their own regard ... hello , Libertarian Airways .
John Gilmore fought the government on the ID issue and lost to a secret government mandate .
The text of the mandate is still not available to the public .
According to security expert Bruce Schneier :
The TSA focuses too much on specific tactics and targets .
This makes sense politically , but is a bad use of security resources .
Think about the last eight years .
We take away guns and knives , and the terrorists use box cutters .
We confiscate box cutters and knitting needles , and they put explosives in their shoes .
We screen shoes , and they use liquids .
We take away liquids , and they 'll do something else .
This is a dumb game ; the TSA should stop playing .... Oh , and stop the ID checking — the notion that there is this master list of terrorists that we can check people off against is just plain silly .
A Personal History of Compilation Speed , Part 2
( Read Part 1 if you missed it . )
My experience with IBM Pascal , on an original model dual - floppy IBM PC , went like this :
I wrote a small " Hello World ! " type of program , saved it , and fired up the compiler .
It churned away for a bit , writing out some intermediate files , then paused and asked for the disc containing Pass 2 .
More huffing and puffing , and I swapped back the previous disc and ran the linker .
Quite often the compiler halted with " Out of Memory ! " at some point during this endeavor .
Now this would have been a smoother process with more memory and a hard drive , but I came to recognize that a compiler was a Very Important Program , and the authors clearly knew it .
Did it matter if it took minutes to convert a simple program to a machine language executable ?
Just that it could be done at all was impressive indeed .
I did n't know it at the time , but there was a standard structure for compilers that had built - up over the years , one that was n't designed with compilation speed as a priority .
Often each pass was a separate program , so they did n't all have to be loaded into memory at the same time .
And those seemingly artificial divisions discussed in compiler textbooks really were separate passes : lexical analysis , parsing , manipulation of an abstract intermediate language , conversion to a lower - level level intermediate language , peephole optimization , generation of assembly code .
Even that last step could be literal , writing out assembly language source code to be converted to machine language by a separate tool .
And linking , there 's always linking .
This was all before I discovered Turbo Pascal .
On one of those cheap , floppy - only , 8088 PC clones from the late 1980s , the compilation speed of Turbo Pascal was already below the " it hardly matters " threshold .
Incremental builds were in the second or two range .
Full rebuilds were about as fast as saying the name of each file in the project aloud .
And zero link time .
Again , this was on an 8MHz 8088 .
By the mid-1990s , Borland was citing build times of hundreds of thousands of lines of source per minute .
The last time I remember seeing this in an ad , after Turbo Pascal had become part of Delphi , the number was homing in on a million lines per minute .
Projects were compiled before your finger was off of the build key .
It was often impossible to tell the difference between a full rebuild of the entire project and compiling a single file .
Compilation speed was effectively zero .
Borland 's other languages with " Turbo " in the name -- like Turbo C - - were n't even remotely close to the compilation speeds of Turbo Pascal .
Even Turbo Assembler was slower , thanks in part to the usual step of having to run a linker .
So what made Turbo Pascal so fast ?
Real modules .
A large percentage of time in C compilers is spent reading and parsing header files .
Even a short school assignment may pull in tens of thousands of lines of headers .
That 's why most C compilers support precompiled headers , though they 're often touchy and take effort to set - up .
Turbo Pascal put all the information about exported functions and variables and constants into a compiled module , so it could be quickly loaded , with no character - by - character parsing needed .
Integrated build system .
The standard makefile system goes like this : first the " make " executable loads , then it reads and parses a file of rules , then for each source file that is out of date , the compiler is started up .
That 's not a trivial effort , firing up a huge multi-megabyte executable just to compile one file .
The Turbo Pascal system was much simpler : look at the list of module dependencies for the current module ; if they 're all up date , compile and exit ; if not , then recursively apply this process to each dependent module .
An entire project could be built from scratch without running any external programs .
Minimal linker .
Have you ever looked at the specs for an object file format ?
" Complicated " and " bulky " are two terms that come to mind .
Turbo Pascal used a custom object file with a minimal design .
The " linker " was n't doing anywhere near the work of standard linkers .
The result was that the link step was invisible ; you did n't even notice it .
Single pass compiler with combined parsing and code generation .
No separate lexer , no separate parser , no abstract syntax tree .
All of these were integrated into a single step , made possible by the straightforward syntax of Pascal ( and by not having a preprocessor with macros ) .
If you 're curious , you can read more about the technique .
Yes , there was a drawback to instantaneous compile times .
Fewer optimizations were done , and almost always the resultant code was slower than the C equivalent .
But it did n't matter .
Removing the gap between the steps of writing and running code was worth more than some amount of additional runtime performance .
I used to hit the build key every so often , even while typing , just to check for syntax errors .
And zero compilation speed eventually became standard , with the rise of interpreted languages like Perl , Ruby , and Python .

タイトルは気にしないでください。
Rubyistならたぶんみんな知ってる、一風変わったものを作らせたら超一流のwhy the lucky stiff がWeb上から消えてしまったらしい。今日は朝か らRuby界隈がいろいろと騒がしかった。で、そんな_why絡みの文章の中にちょっといい感じの追悼文があったので訳してみる。
http://ejohn.org/blog/eulogy-to-_why/
_why追悼
残念ながらいまはあまり時間がない（今週あるプロジェクトをリリースしようとしてるんだ）。だけどハッカーでありアーティストでもあった_whyについて少なくとも2-3言述べておくべきだろう。
_whyがオンラインに存在したと言う証はもはや存在しない。彼のサイトも、コードも、全て消えてしまった。その中には次のものが含まれるが、これら以外にもまだあるかもしれない:
これがどういうことか、考えられるのは次の二つだろう : 彼のアカウントがハックされサイトを落とされた、もしくは、ただ自分で自分のオンライン上での存在を消すことにした。個人的には、彼はいろいろと考えた上で意図的にこれをやったんだろうと思っている。
_whyをプログラマの中で際立った存在にしていた理由の一つは、彼が仮想世界の中で匿名を保って活動していたということだ。彼の名前を知る人も何人かはいたが、彼のオンラインでのペルソナに焦点が当たることはなかった(少なくとも積極的に彼が特定個人に結びつけられたことはなかった。彼を特定したと主張するサイトも見たことはあるが、だいたいは間違っていたし、その周辺に近づくことができたのがいいところだった)。ライブや、トーク、音楽を奏でるときでさえ、彼はずっと匿名を通していた。
騒ぎの元になったスレッドを読んでみれば、彼が消えたことに対して、怒り、混乱、悲しみなど、あらゆる種類の感情が渦巻いていることがわかるだろう。
一方私はと言えば、驚きつつも喜ばしいような、そんな気持ちでいる。
_why、彼の書いたコード、彼が装ったペルソナ、彼のプロデュースしたアート、はずっと私の賞賛の的だった。_whyのコードや文章(例えば、whyの感動的Rubyガイド - これはまだLuluで購入できる)しか見たことがない人もいるだろう。
しかし私は_whyをむしろアーティストと見なしていた。彼は彼の探求のために様々なメディアを利用した。文章、イラスト、コード、音楽まで。
彼が「whyの感動 的Rubyガイド」と同時にアルバムをリリースしていたことを、知らない人は多いかもしれない。このアルバムの中で私が一番気に入っているのは第2章にあたるものだ :
This Book is Made ( of Rabbits and Lemonade ) 。
_whyのアーティストとしてのエトスをこの曲以上に表すものは存在しないだろう。
_why は -そのコードにおいてさえも- 奇妙で、ユーモアがあり、すこし気取っていて、気まぐれだった。彼は彼のアートを表現する能力を楽しんでいて、同時に非常にうまくそれをこなした。
彼の作品は奇抜な雰囲気に覆われてはいたが、その中には、何かを表現すること、単純さを保つこと、伝え育てること、に対する真剣な思いが込められていたように思う。彼のコードと文章の全てにおいて、彼はハッキングの技芸(art)をより多くの人たち、より若い人たち、に伝える方法や、標準的な開発に敷衍している複雑さを単純にする方法を、いつも探っていた。
彼の文章からは明らかではないが、私はよく_whyが子供たちと一緒にいるところを想像した。小学校の先生としてか、もしくは彼自身の子供たちと。彼らとコミュニケートする方法や、彼らに何かを伝える方法や、彼らの想像力と表現力の自由さを解放する方法を探しているのだ。
彼の表現力豊かな気質のおかげで、一度IRCで数分チャットしたことがあるだけなのに、私は_whyを理解できたように思う。私は特に彼の匿名性をすばらしいものだと考えている。
私はこれまでの人生でいつも仕事とプライベートを切り離しておこうと努力していた。_whyがオンラインでのペルソナを使っていることは、私に大きな啓示を与えた。彼はプライベート(家族や友人との時間)にオンラインでのペルソナが入り込むこと、そしてその逆、を防ぐことに事実上成功していたといっていい。
人々は自分の仕事に夢中になりすぎる。私が思うに、彼は自分のオンラインでのペルソナとそのプロダクトを完全に区別された存在とすることで、彼の生活の残りの部分から切り離していた。パーソナルライフと仕事と遊びの完璧で明確な分離だ。
彼のオンライン上でのペルソナがきれいさっぱり消えてしまったことは私にとってそれほど驚きではない。2007年に、_whyは彼のメインのブログ( RedHanded)を終了した。このことは私にとって衝撃だったが、彼の人となりを理解する助けになった。何年も取り組んできたブログであって、みんながそれを彼のアイデンティティの一部と見なしていても大したことではないのだ。これ以上何かを語るのにふさわしい場所でないと感じたら、彼は古いサイトを捨てて別の場所へ移るだけだ。
_whyのオンラインでのペルソナ、彼が何年もかけて作ってきた全てのプロダクト、に例えることができるものがあるとすれば、それはチベット仏教の伝統的な砂曼荼羅だろう。
砂曼荼羅は多くの人が何日もかけて作成する非常に複雑な芸術作品だ。とても美しい芸術だが、とても脆い。
完成し公開された曼荼羅は、儀礼的なやり方で破壊される。これは「物質世界がはかないものである、という仏教の教えを象徴している」そうだ。
_whyのオンライン上での全存在とコードは'_why'という砂曼荼羅の中に存在していたのだ。そして'_why'を司っていた人物が、彼の人生の中でそれに割り当てていた部分を他のことにまわし、終わりにすると決めただけのことだ。
どうして彼は自分のコードをすぐ削除してしまうんだろう、どうして自分の作品に真剣に取り組まないんだろう、と何人かの人が尋ねるのを見たことがある。(特にそれに依存する人が多くなってから)
_whyの作品やアートの積み重ねを見ると、その訳が痛い程よく分かる。_whyのオンライン上での存在、コード、文章、音楽、イラストは、全てある人物の人生の中で単にある時ある場所を占めていただけなのだ。彼は常にあるプロジェクトから他のプロジェクト、あるブログから他のブログへ移り続けていた。そして今、彼は本当にどこかへ行ってしまった。私たちはこの数年間、彼と彼の作品を知れたことを喜ぶべきなのだろう。
この文章は実際に生きていた人物に対する追悼文ではなく（私は今も彼が幸せで、彼の友人や家族と共に人生の探求を続けてくれることを本当に願っている）、ある男の人生の一部分に対する追悼文だ。
私 の_whyへの想いがうまく伝わって欲しいと思う。彼のことを思うとき、いつも芸術的な表現や、幸福や、探求の喜びが心に浮かぶ。
_whyへ : これまで、私たちにコードやアートをもたらしてくれてありがとう。君が思うよりもずっと深く感謝していたよ。これからも人生を楽しみ続けて、君が感じた喜びや驚きを世界中の人たちに伝えてほしい。

I do not now which I want to See the worst Miss Rahol or mother I have thaugh that I wanted to See mother but never befour did I no what it was to want to See a parent and could not .
I wish you to gave my love to old Boss Miss Rahol and bailum and gave my manafold love to mother brothers and sister and pleas to tell them to Right to me So I may here … ( Page 2 cont . ) … from them if I can not See them and also I wish you to right to me and Right me all the nuse .
I do want to now whether old Boss is Still Living or now and all the rest of them and I want to now whether balium is maried or no .
I wish to now what has Ever become of my Presus little girl .
I left her in goldsborough with Mr. Walker and I have not herd from her Since and Walker Said that he was going to Carry her to Rockingham and gave her to his Sister and I want to no whether he did or no as I do wish to See her very mutch and Boss Says he wishes to now whether he will Sell her or now and the least that can buy her and that he wishes a answer as Soon as he can get one as I wis himto buy her an my Boss being a man of Reason and fealing wishes to grant my trubled breast that mutch gratification and wishes to now whether he will Sell her now .

So fare you well in love .
The American response to the decree on Monday was somewhat equivocal .
The State Department condemned the government ’s actions .
“ I think it ’s time for the de facto regime to put down the shovel , ” said a spokesman , Philip J. Crowley .
“ With every action , they keep on making the hole deeper . ”
But at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington , where diplomats met in an emergency session to discuss the Micheletti government ’s expulsion of four of its diplomats on Sunday , the American envoy reserved his strongest condemnation for Mr. Zelaya .
Image Roberto Micheletti , the de facto president of Honduras , asked for forgiveness on Monday for the crackdown he imposed .

W. Lewis Amselem , the acting American representative , called Mr. Zelaya “ irresponsible and foolish ” for returning to Honduras before a negotiated settlement was reached .
“ The president should stop acting as though he were starring in an old movie , ” Mr. Amselem said .
Chris Sabatini , an analyst at the Council of the Americas , said that the United States was embarrassed at being linked to Mr. Zelaya , “ a dangerously capricious leader . ”
But he said the mixed messages , which he said have characterized the American response since the coup , could also be an attempt “ to soften Micheletti ’s position by showing that they are even - handed . ”
“ The effect is , however , that the United States looks a little weak - kneed before the de facto government , ” he said .
José Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights
Watch said that if the United States was trying to spread the blame , the strategy was not working .
“ It has the effect of defusing the pressure , ” he said .
“ Micheletti is the one who is taking away freedoms to an outrageous degree and the United States needs to be focusing all its attention on him . ”

A GPU Computing Push
Nvidia ’s corporate strategy firmly rests on expanding the market for GPUs beyond graphics to include certain types of computation .
Specifically , Nvidia ’s efforts with CUDA are aimed at moving GPUs into the high performance computing ( HPC ) market – where the substantial compute capabilities and memory bandwidth directly translate into performance .
Nvidia ’s Tesla products ( GPUs designed for computation instead of graphics ) have made a bit of a splash , but at the moment the adoption is extremely limited .
GPU clusters are basically non-existent , at least in part due to the lack of error detection and correction , which we believe will be corrected in the next product release from Nvidia .
HPC : CorrECCtness Required
ECC is an essential requirement for servers , and especially clusters of servers , which are the predominant compute workhorses in the HPC world .
All servers come standard with ECC memory and other reliability , availability and serviceability ( RAS ) features ( e.g. ECC on caches ) .
Generally , these RAS features are driven from above by the proprietary microprocessor families such as Itanium , PowerPC , SPARC and zArch , with industry standard x86 servers typically lagging behind a bit .
Without ECC , it ’s simply not possible to build reliable clusters , since the soft error rates in DRAM are too high – and buyers are sophisticated enough to understand this .
Moreover , the long term trends in process technology and semiconductor device scaling make errors more prevalent in both SRAM and DRAM .
Increasing density , increasing signaling rates , decreasing voltage and decreasing the amount of charge representing a single bit exponentially raise the risk of soft errors ( SERs ) , which cause data corruption .
Unfortunately , these are all the same changes that make semiconductors cheaper and faster over time , so they need to be adequately addressed as Nvidia moves to 40nm and eventually 28nm and beyond .
Historically , the graphics world has not been concerned with SERs – if a pixel ’s color is off by a single bit ( or even multiple bits ) , it does n’t really matter .
Graphics applications just do n’t need the same level of correctness as the rest of the system , since human eyes will compensate for many errors .
As GPUs evolve to be more general purpose and this is one of the areas where they are following in the footsteps of CPUs and providing greater functionality .
For example , GDDR5 was the first generation of graphics memory interface to include any error detection at all , but it only covers data ( note that we are discussing errors on the GDDR5 bus itself , and not in the DRAM ) [ 1 ] .
Almost every other high speed signaling interface ( > 2GT/s ) in the PC had comprehensive error detection and retry – PCI - Express , QuickPath nee CSI , HyperTransport , Fully Buffered DIMMs , etc. GDDR4 , despite running upto 3.2GT /s had no error detection at all .
Without ECC and other forms of error protection , the only alternatives are to calculate any important values twice and compare the results to detect an error – which can halve your performance ( although some algorithms tend to be robust against errors ) .
Since the main selling point for a GPU is the high performance , that is quite problematic .
For double precision , a GT200 or GT200b is only 65 % or 88 % faster than Nehalem – computing the results twice would make the GPU slower than a standard CPU .
Costs and Benefits of ECC
Adding ECC support is pretty straight forward from an engineering perspective .
ECC requires arrays of 9 DRAMs ( instead of 8 ) , extra pins to connect to the extra DRAMs and more logic in the memory controllers .
This will noticeably increase the bill of materials for a GPU ; not a problem for the expensive and margin - rich professional grade products such as Tesla and Quadro .
However , it does mean that adding ECC support to Nvidia ’s GPUs cannot substantially increase costs for consumer products , since ASPs and margins are decreasing by virtue of ATI ’s singular focus on graphics and incipient products from Intel .
Ultimately adding ECC to Tesla products ( and probably Quadro too ) could be quite advantageous .
As noted above , it will enable Nvidia to make more progress selling GPUs into the HPC market and reduce the hesitation of some buyers .
However , it could benefit Nvidia by differentiating between consumer and professional GPUs , which both can run CUDA – after all the , price delta is enough to make buyers contemplate skipping a Tesla in favor of a GeForce .
Moreover , it would differentiate Tesla and Quadro from competing products from ATI and Intel ( which may not have ECC ) and provide a marketing advantage .
The folks at Nvidia are n’t stupid ; they have considerable expertise in HPC and understand the market requirements ( in fact they have even published papers discussing reliability issues for GPUs ) .
But entering a new market is not done all in one step – it ’s a gradual process ; each product iteration feeding on prior successes and feedback .
Now that Nvidia has gotten their toes into the HPC waters , it ’s only logical that the next step will be to add ECC memory , enabling more users to consider GPUs for their computing needs .
Perhaps at the same time , they will address the previously noted unreliability of the GDDR5 interface for data writes .
Above and beyond ECC memory , there are further steps that can be taken .
The simplest form of ECC is Single bit Error Correct and Double bit Error Detect ( SECDED ) , which is likely what Nvidia will implement in their next generation GPU .
There are further techniques to detect and correct multi- bit errors , and even the failure of an entire DRAM .
The latter is likely to be particularly important for Nvidia , given that a DRAM failure requires replacing the entire product ( unlike in servers , where faulty memory is easily removed ) .
Outside the memory system , Nvidia might consider parity or ECC for the on-chip register files and SRAM , which total around 3MB in the current generation ( and will grow substantially if Nvidia ends up using real caches ) .
But on - chip storage ( or compute logic ) issues are even further down the road than addressing the rather obvious reliability concerns in the memory system .
GPUs and ECC : A Question of When
We have laid out the case for Nvidia adding ECC memory support to their GPUs , discussing the needs , costs and benefits .
This is an obvious and inevitable development , as Nvidia evolves their GPUs to more closely resemble CPUs and go after the HPC market .
The only real question is when Nvidia will add ECC support – and the next GPU generation is where we ’d put our bets down .

Civilian death toll soaring in Afghanistan
By James Cogan
3 August 2009
A report issued late last month by the Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) sheds light on the rising number of innocent Afghan men , women and children who are being killed in order for the US and its allies to consolidate their neo-colonial occupation of the country .
The UNAMA report contrasted the number of officially recorded civilian deaths for the first six months of 2009 with the number in previous years .
From January 1 to June 30 , it registered 1,013 civilian fatalities , “ compared with 818 for the same period in 2008 , and 684 in 2007 ” .
In other words , as the Obama administration has escalated the war and sent thousands of additional troops and aircraft to Afghanistan , the number of civilian deaths has soared by 24 percent .
The military activities of both the Taliban - led insurgency , dubbed in the report “ Anti Government Elements ( AGEs ) , and the operations of the so - called Pro Government Forces ( PGFs ) — foreign troops and Afghan government security forces — contributed to the body count .
Insurgent roadside bombings and suicide bombings were blamed for 595 deaths or 59 percent of the casualties .
In many cases , civilians were killed during attacks on occupation military targets .
American and NATO forces drive convoys through residential areas and have established bases inside Afghan towns and villages in order to prevent them coming under the direct control of the Taliban .
Included in the number of civilian deaths caused by the insurgency are also a number of pro-occupation government officials and employees who were assassinated .
The occupation forces killed 310 of the civilian deaths recorded by UNAMA , or 30.5 percent .
“ Unknown ” or unconfirmed parties were held responsible for the remaining 108 fatalities , or 10.5 percent .
Air strikes were the main cause of fatalities inflicted by the US and allied forces .
UNAMA recorded 40 air attacks that , combined , caused 200 deaths .
In June alone , six air strikes killed 51 people , suggesting that the rate is climbing despite proclamations by American generals that greater care is being taken to avoid what the military still calls “ collateral damage ” .
UNAMA ’s assessment of the impact of air strikes would be challenged by many in Afghanistan .
The report accepted , for example , the official figure that 63 civilians died in the hours - long May 4 aerial assault on the village of Bala Baluk , in the western province of Farah .
Locals continue to insist that the number who died was at least 144 .
It also accepted that the hundreds of alleged Taliban killed in remote areas of the country by air strikes were in fact combatants .
According to a tally compiled by Associated Press , American and NATO forces claimed to have killed more than 2,310 Taliban this year .
In 2008 , the tally was over 3,800 .
With the scale of fighting escalating , the new commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , ordered occupation forces in mid-June to stop giving any estimates on alleged Taliban casualties .
The air strike figure also does not count the hundreds of men , women and children who have been killed this year by missile strikes launched from unmanned US Predator drones over the border in the tribal agencies of Pakistan .
The anti-occupation insurgency is supported by the ethnic Pashtun population of the region .
In retaliation , the US military is waging a systematic campaign of killings and terror against them .
On June 23 , a single US attack on a funeral procession in South Waziristan killed over 80 people .
In just two days in July , Predator strikes killed another 80 .
Other civilian deaths that may not have been counted , or been falsely reported as Taliban fatalities , are those inflicted during the regular raids conducted by special forces ’ units on the homes of suspected insurgent leaders , fighters or financiers .
The report noted : “ Implementation of search and seizure operations ( including night time raids ) are also of concern , and there have been reports of a number of joint Afghan and international military forces operations in which excessive use of force has allegedly resulted in civilian deaths . ”
Agencies such as UNAMA rarely have the ability to independently verify who , and how many , are killed in such actions .
Overall , the UNAMA report makes a pessimistic estimate of the situation facing the US - led occupation in Afghanistan .
Far from Obama ’s surge curbing Afghan resistance to the presence of foreign troops , the Taliban and other insurgents are gaining support and expanding the territory in which they operate .
UNAMA noted : “ As the conflict has widened and deepened throughout 2007 , 2008 and into 2009 , almost a third of the country is now directly affected by insurgent activities with differing intensity .
Armed conflict is particularly prevalent in the South , South - East , East , Central , and Western regions of the country .
It is also spreading into areas formerly relatively tranquil , such as the North and North - East . ”
The occupation forces , in response , are “ attempting to quell the insurgency and responding to insurgent activity within civilian areas , [ and ] are also conducting more operations in areas where civilians reside .
These factors have resulted in a rising toll in terms of civilian deaths and injuries and destruction of infrastructure , including homes and assets , which are essential for survival and the maintenance of livelihoods . ”
The result will be greater numbers of Afghan civilians losing their lives , particularly in the continuing air strikes against alleged Taliban targets .
On July 30 , the Los Angeles Times reported that McChrystal had instructed that the Predator drones previously used for hunting for Al Qaeda leaders in remote mountainous areas of the country be focused instead on operations in “ major insurgent strongholds ” — i.e. , areas with large civilian populations .
McChrystal has also requested that at least another dozen of the unmanned aircraft be dispatched from the US to Afghanistan .
Central Command has further ordered the redeployment of U2 spy aircraft , combat engineer units , road - clearance teams and helicopters from Iraq to the burgeoning war in Afghanistan .
Underscoring again the fraudulent character of the “ war against terrorism ” , an unnamed official told the Los Angeles Times : “ We might still be too focused on Bin Laden .
We should probably reassess our priorities . ”
McChrystal himself declared in a recent interview : “ I do n’t think there is enough focus on counter - insurgency .
I am not in a position to criticise counter - terrorism , but at this point in the war , in Afghanistan , it is most important to focus on almost classic counter - insurgency . ”
Far from being against terrorism , the war is against the Afghan people .
The consequence of the rising death toll among both civilians and insurgents will be wider hostility toward the occupation forces and greater sympathy for the armed resistance to their presence .
At the same time , the surge is leading to a rise in US and NATO casualties .
In July , foreign occupation forces in Afghanistan suffered their worst casualties of nearly eight years of war , with 75 losing their lives .
In just the first two days of August , nine US and NATO troops have been killed — a rate as high as the worst days of fighting in Iraq .
The UNAMA report predicted that a sharp upsurge in violence would take place over the next several weeks , as the Obama administration and its allies attempted to hold a stage - managed presidential election in the country — including in areas controlled by the Taliban , where Afghan President Hamid Karzai is viewed with contempt .
One in 35 Americans are caught up in the corrections system and incarceration is on the rise .
Why is this when the US crime rate has dropped so remarkably ?
The United States incarcerates more of its own citizens than any other nation .
It has only 5 % of the world ’s population but 25 % of the world ’s prisoners .
If you count everyone ensnared in the corrections system – on probation or parole – millions of Americans ( one of every 31 ) are anything but free in the land of liberty ( 1 ) .
“ Incarceration is a rich country ’s hobby , ” says Scott Henson , a Texan journalist and political consultant who has monitored America ’s addiction to imprisonment for years and thinks it a pastime of impractical and frivolous consequences .
Crime and punishment are disconnected .
As funding has increased , more prisons have been built , more of the usual suspects – drug users , dealers , and petty gangsters – have been wrangled into newly constructed penitentiaries , and more warders hired to man the guard towers .
Crime seems to have fluctuated of its own free will , unaffected by the billions of dollars thrown at it and the policies written to combat it .
Although crime declined throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium , incarceration rates climbed dramatically , even among the young .
Meanwhile , the state of New York saw a dramatic decrease in violent crime as its prison population dropped ( 2 ) .
State budgets are being leached by rising bills for ever - expanding penal systems – nearing a cumulative $ 50bn this year – and politicians are exacting cuts on education , healthcare and other social services to make up the difference .
Between 1988 and 2008 , spending on the prison system grew from four to 30 times the budget for public housing ( 3 ) .
There is a current of racial inequality and strife that runs through America ’s history .
From slavery to reconstruction , urban migration to ghettos , one of the starkest examples of the lingering racial divide is the over - representation of people of colour in the prison system .
While distinct in some ways and eerily parallel in others , the racial and criminal narratives of America became particularly intertwined at a time of cultural conflagration .
In the 1960s America mutinied .
Long - oppressed racial groups – blacks , Latinos and the indigenous people – demanded civil rights , students called for an end to the war in Vietnam , women challenged the assumptions of patriarchy , and environmentalists mobilised against ecological destruction .
America was in open revolt against its own culture and Washington responded one of the few ways it knew : it declared a war .
‘ Tough on crime ’
With many citizens fearful of the uncertain future , politicians devised policies to win the war on crime and the war on drugs .
Writing to Dwight Eisenhower in 1968 , Richard Nixon expressed confidence in his “ tough on crime ” platform : “ I have found great audience response to this law and order theme in all parts of the country , including areas like New Hampshire where there is virtually no race problem and relatively little crime . ” ( 4 )
The war on crime has nothing to do with crime .
As Dr Bruce Western , professor of sociology at Harvard University , points out : “ Crime rates themselves may not have driven the prison boom but long - standing fears about crime and other social anxieties may form the backdrop for the growth in imprisonment . ”
( 5 ) While violent crime did drop remarkably in the 1990s , the role “ tough on crime ” policies played is debatable .
Instead , changes in local policing tactics and economic growth should be credited .
Incarceration rates rose steadily throughout this period thanks to the war on drugs , which received more and more funds from federal authorities .
In the 1960s drugs were beginning to emerge in the counter culture and working - class neighbourhoods , and their burgeoning popularity and expanding market were seen as a sign of lawlessness .
Lawmakers decided to take the war to the streets and create heavy - handed penalties for even petty possession .
These laws remain on the books and are enforced by a wide range of agencies , bureaus and police departments , all receiving increasing sums from the federal government .
“ Drugs draw many into the system who do not actively contribute to crime ” explains Western .
He says the effect incarceration had on crime rates was small .
The government has wasted billions on treating as a crime wave what is really a pressing public health issue .
Yet despite the lacklustre results of the zero - tolerance “ lock ’em up and throw away the key ” approach to drugs and petty crimes , America continues to break records in terms of incarceration rates .
Why ?
“ That ’s the $ 100,000 question , ” says Tracy Velasquez , executive director of the Washington - based Justice Policy Institute .
“ Our political system tends to reinforce an increase in incarceration ; [ for politicians ] there ’s a need to be tough on crime . ”
Ever since the racial and social strife of the 1960s , rehashed for a new generation by the campaign ads Ronald Reagan ran against Michael Dukakis featuring rapist and murderer Willie Horton , leaders everywhere have been working to appear tougher than their opponents .
Henson claims “ if you had to put your finger on it , Reagan set the tone of the debate ” .
But he is quick to emphasise – as observers and activists usually are – that it ’s wrong to examine criminal justice policy as a left - right issue , since the left and right have both failed miserably .
“ Joe Biden and John Kerry and Tom Harkin are the biggest drug warriors in the Senate , ” he claims .
“ Obama , in his stimulus package , even wanted to triple funding [ for drug enforcement agencies ] and ended up doubling it . ”
Velasquez explained that “ there has n’t been a downside to being tough on crime ” – a downside when courting votes .
But for the millions of Americans locked up for minor crimes and pushed around by well - funded police , the downside has been apparent for some time .
There are social issues in the prison system that warrant not just concern but urgent action .
Gangs have been using the penal system as a recruiting mechanism and their influence has grown .
Inmate populations have segregated themselves along racial lines to further conform to gang culture .
Sexual abuse is also prevalent : a recent study found that 60,000 inmates are abused each year with prison staff cited as frequent culprits ( 6 ) .
Beyond the fences there are other problems : more than half of America ’s incarcerated citizens are parents .
Occasionally , politicians point to the amenities afforded to some inmates and lament that murderers and rapists are living more comfortably than they should .
A sheriff in Arizona garnered press attention for having his prisoners live in tents beneath the desert sun ( a move that prompted an investigation by Amnesty International ) .
Such attitudes have created a system that merits shame and disappointment .
Cradle to prison
In 40 years Americans have asked their leaders only to take those unseemly , typically non-white people on the sidewalks peddling crack , lock them up , and throw away the key .
While conservatives like Reagan lamented “ cradle - to - grave ” welfare , his and other presidential policies have created a cradle - to - prison system where impoverished communities produce youth who choose to take their chances within the profitable drug or criminal world rather than do a minimum - wage job in the service sector .
Police , flush with money from the federal government , round up some of the “ usual suspects ” who will face stiff penalties in a legal system they will have little help in navigating .
Locked away , they may leave behind families who could use their help , in fact need it .
Each inmate is different and each story is complicated but politicians at every level of government seem to have found a solution that is absurdly simple .
And yet none of it works .
Crime is not falling as a result of tougher laws ; the criminal justice system is anything but economical ; mass incarceration is creating a wide range of social problems in the communities it has affected ; and even after the one million plus people who work in the prisons are paid their wages and more laws are authored , America has little to show for its crusade against crime and drugs .
“ It ’s not the kingpin but the low - level dealer [ who is put ] in jail , ” Velasquez points out .
It ’s a lack of alternative work that has drawn millions of Americans into drugs and then jail .
While narcotics have also spread to wealthier neighbourhoods , Henson reminds us that “ one side of the [ railroad ] tracks has taken the brunt .
Drugs have spread but not prosecution ” .
If the problem rests in bipartisan racism , in bipartisan neoliberalism and in bipartisan indifference , a solution seems to be emerging from bipartisan concern .
While there are several lawmakers on the left who have worked on this issue for decades , the political climate has marginalised their power .
Yet as Republicans scramble to secure their conservative credentials by exercising “ fiscal conservatism ” , many have considered ways of diminishing the costs of the corrections system and finding alternatives to incarceration .
And as states struggle to balance their budgets , polls reflect more positive attitudes towards the legalisation of marijuana and wardens run out of cells , this could be the perfect moment for debate .
The Forest
Antonia is a 12 year old girl .
She often has daydreams , in which she wonders of in to a magical far away forest , were she hides from the problems of the real world .
One day , however , her father takes drastic measures and she has to face a decision .
Is your inner peace an utopian state until you have finally escaped the grip of the society and its rules ?
Or is affirmation a faster way to your personal luck ?
And what are you supposed to do , if you have to answer this question at the age of 12 ?
In the Animated Short " The Forest " , the protagonist has to cope with this question and her hostile environment and finds a simple but radical solution .

Fox News moves Egypt to where Iraq was .
By Daniel Emery
BBC technology reporter , Edinburgh
EA is experimenting with novel ways for players to pay for games A stark warning about the finances of the games industry has been aired at the Edinburgh Interactive conference .
The sector had suffered " significant disruption " to its business model , Edward Williams , from BMO Capital Markets told the industry gathering .
" For Western publishers , profitability has n't grown at all in the past few years and that 's before we take 2009 into account , " he said .
By contrast , he said , Chinese firms were still seeing improved profits .
What makes the difference between Western firms and Chinese developers was the way they went about getting products to players .
Western publishers , said Mr Williams , still relied on the traditional develop methods of putting a game on a DVD and then selling that through retail channels .
Chinese developers focussed primarily on the PC market and used direct download , rather than retail stores , to get games to consumers .
Those Chinese developers were also helped by the low number of console users in South East Asia which meant developers there did not have to pay royalties to console makers .
Future models
Three factors , said Mr. Williams , were forcing the operating costs of Western firms to spiral upwards : • Games are getting larger , which meant longer development time and larger staff costs .
•
After its release in the 1990s the PlayStation accounted for 80 % of the market .
Today the console space is very fragmented , so developers have to work on many platforms at any one time .
•
The cost of licensing intellectual property or gaining official sports body endorsement ( such as FIFA or FIA ) has gone up .
These factors , said Mr. Williams , explained the stagnation in overall profitability despite sales in the games sector increasing by $ 30 bn ( £ 24.17 bn ) over the past four years .
Recent figures suggest sales are also coming under pressure .
US game sales fell by 29 % in the last 12 months suggest statistics from research group NPD .
The PlayStation no longer dominates pushing up costs for game makers Speaking to the BBC , Peter Moore - president of EA Sports - said that while the Chinese and Western markets were still very different , he expected to see some significant changes in the way Westerners buy games in the future .
" In China , PC and mobile platforms will continue to dominate , " he said .
" There is n't the necessity to buy other pieces of hardware and it is our job to service that . "
" In Europe we are going to see more content that 's delivered electronically , be that through Steam , Xbox Live or whatever . "
Mr Moore added that while this may have some impact on retailers , the future of the high street shop was still bright , especially if you factor in sales of hardware , peripherals and game - time cards .
" The release of Tiger Woods online as a free to play experience will be the real test of the Western consumer 's appetite for digital downloading , " he said .
The game , scheduled for release in late 2009 , has a segment which gamers can play for free online but can also pay for additional content as required .
Now in its sixth year , the Edinburgh Interactive Conference brings together industry figures , developers , publishers and the media to discuss issues facing the interactive game sector and to try to promote creativity .

When Richard Heinberg 's new book was about to be published , the editors at The Oil Drum were offered a review copy , and I was offered the chance to provide that review .
Yet in a way providing that review gives me a bit of a puzzle , because the underlying premise on which the book is based is that , as David Rutledge has propounded , the world will run out of realistic coal reserves much faster than most folk anticipate .
It is a point of view that I do n’t completely accept , and I have posted on my disagreements with Dr. Rutledge over some of his assumptions and conclusions in the past .
So I could fill this review with another regurgitation of my points of disagreement , but were I to do so I do n’t think it would be a fair review .
The book sets out to collect together in sequential order a compilation of those views that state that the world will run out of coal faster than expected ( including one source that disagrees ) ; then looks at the coal remaining in the major consumers the United States ; China ; Russia and India ; and then looks at potential exporters Australia , South Africa , Europe , South America , Indonesia and Canada , as it rounds out the major global patterns of coal trade of the world .
The interplay with coal and climate is then reviewed and three different paths forward are then offered , with some closing remarks .
It thus provides a relatively concise , yet comprehensive review of the coal supply future from one perspective .
That is a very useful thing to have , and ( perhaps I should n't admit this ) had I not been given a copy for review I would have bought one .
Would I have got my money 's worth ?
Well it depends on what you are looking for .
And to explain that remark let me discuss , very briefly what is in the Chapters and what I would argue about .
The fundamental questions come down to the difference between reserves and resources , and the rate at which reserves are used up .
However because use changes as production declines and product cost rises , there needs to be some model of declining production .
The references that the book cites rely on Hubbert Linearization , and this forms the basis then for the estimates .
The text explains how it works and notes that it has often , historically , been applied to estimating how long oilfields will last .
This model is then used to predict how long the current reserves of the different countries will last , based on current reserves .
The resulting numbers are quite dramatic .
China is shown , for example , to see a peak in production around 2020 .
Given that China produces , and consumes , around 40 % of world production - twice that of the United States - the impact on overall world use is likely to be significant .
For while , for example , Russia is quoted as having the second largest reserves , the book estimates that " Russia could well cease being an exporter within only a few years . "
( Part of the problem rises because some of the eastern resources have yet to be tapped , and even when they are the coal has to be moved to the west where the demand is .
Russian transportation services are considered currently inadequate to the task . )
In looking at India the author did give me my one mention , when looking at the potential increases in production that might be achieved by Coal India .
But he points out ( as I have ) that India has a serious current fuels crisis and that increasing coal use is one way to solve it , at least transiently .
I did think it a little odd that Pakistan , which also has serious supply problems , and is right next door , only got the courtesy of a passing reference " While the situation in India is not yet as bad as that in neighboring Pakistan , . . "
The situation in India is not getting better - as an aside - and remembering that Bangalore is where a lot of India ’s IT is located :
The situation is going to be grim across rural Karnataka .
People in the rural areas will get electricity just for 10 hours , of which the three phase supply will be available for only five hours .
It will be 14 hours of darkness in rural parts over the next 12 months .
That is only if the authorities do not take recourse to unscheduled load - shedding as they have often has done in the past .
Energy Minister K S Eshwarappa on Thursday announced that Bangalore would have to bear with two hours of regulated load - shedding -- an hour in the morning ( anytime between 6 am and 10 am ) and another hour in the evening ( anytime between 6 and 10 pm ) .
The situation for both India and Pakistan is that they are therefore going to be increasingly reliant on coal , and as the author points out , India is not yet set up to produce enough for its own needs , which as the above quote from this week shows , are becoming more critical .
And so these nations must turn to imports , and thus Chapter 5 deals with those countries that are most likely to provide that coal ( Australia , South Africa , Europe , South America , Indonesia and Canada ) .
Sadly it is this chapter that is the most disappointing , since the question as to whether the world will continue to have enough coal , is going to depend on the ability of the global production units to supply it .
The book only recognizes South Africa ( the country ) as being capable of coal production in Southern Africa ( the region ) and being the only country there with significant reserves .
However when South Africa started defaulting on power to neighboring countries at the beginning of 2008 , those countries had to look to what they can do with their own resources , and in Botswana , and Zimbabwe , among others , this will mean coal .
Chinese engineers have already been engaged to increase production , and there is talk of the country matching or exceeding its diamond income with the income from coal , based on a 200 billion ton reserve .
( In the book South Africa is quoted as having 48 billion tons of reserves .
The Botswana reserve was only a resource until S. Africa cut off supplies ) .
Admittedly there are currently some problems getting that program going , since initial plans for electricity production exceed local needs for power .
Europe gets similar short shrift , with UK reserves and production being written off in just less than a page .
And so we come to the chapter on climate impacts , that begins :
Recent reports on global coal reserves , surveyed in the previous chapter , generally point to the likelihood of supply limits appearing relatively soon - within the next two decades ( a contrary view is represented solely by the BGR report ) .
According to this near - consensus , coal output in China , the world 's foremost producer , could begin to decline within just a few years .
I am tempted to quote the shortest sentence in the Bible .
Of course , if you pick your sources , you can get a consensus on anything .
For the record I objected to David Rutledge 's point of view , not only at ASPO , but later in The Oil Drum .
( I wrote both about the National Academy report on coal , and the known coal reserves in the UK ( determined by measurement and observation ) not theoretically , and as defined in Trueman ’s Coalfields of Great Britain .
I listed the tonnages available from that text ( though putting Scotland inexplicably in England for the table ) .
That coal has not gone away , and some of it was being mined up to the time that North Sea Oil and Gas came ashore and turned it all ( and this is key ) temporarily from a reserve into only a resource .
This is not the place to get into more debate on the causes and status of climate change - or of the arguments that Richard Heinberg makes - if you believe they will reinforce that belief , if you do n’t you can nit - pick over those he got wrong .
But that is n't the purpose of the chapter , rather it is to look at how the impact of an early peak in coal production will affect carbon dioxide levels .
Recognizing that there is going to be a peak in the production ( and use ) of all three of the major fossil fuels ( oil , natural gas and coal ) that may be very imminent means , as the author points out , that most of the IPCC models overstate the levels of carbon dioxide that we face in the next century .
And thus , initially , the news is good in that the limits of concern will not be reached .
However the author questions the consequences of further warming , being concerned over , for example , the thawing of the permafrost and the release of methane as an additional forcing to the climate , and foreseeing additional problems beyond those currently anticipated .
Thus he concludes that the peaking of the fuels wo n’t solve the problem .
On the other hand he notes that climate change concerns are reducing the number of coal - fired power plants being considered in Europe and the United States .
Thus perhaps climate change will influence Peak Coal ?
One way of solving both problems relies on the introduction of new technology .
So in the penultimate chapter there are short reviews of IGCC ; CTL ; UCG ; and CCS though without any projection of hope that they will do much good in resolving the problem of carbon dioxide emissions .
And so , in the final chapter three scenarios for the future - one which sees no coordinated plan for the future sees the global economy in ruins by 2040 ; one that sees a massive investment in CCS and IGCC but yet again , despite that effort the world energy demands are not met and global ruin again arrives ; and then there is a third scenario where , through strong central government action ( and a declining world population ) the world is saved .
( I will let you buy the book to see how that happens ) .
Yes , I am going to keep the book around , not on my desk , but somewhere so that , in five years or so I can pull it back out and see how the world did move on .
I have a number of books from the 70's ( including a couple by Daniel Yergin ) that predicted the then future 20 - years of growth , and how without following certain paths we would be doomed .
They proved to be quite wrong , each in their own separate way , as this might prove to be .
Natural gas , for example , at the moment may play a stronger role in the future than is currently projected .
But that is the fun of future projection - this book gives you some insight into the debate about the future of coal - I disagree with many of the assumptions and projections , but it does define the arguments of a given viewpoint that is receiving increasing levels of attention .
So , yeah , I ’m glad I read it .
djconrad was one of several readers to point out the latest major scandal in EVE Online , the space MMO notable for its large , player - driven economy and the entertaining stories it often generates .
A player named Ricdic , chairman of a large in - game bank , decided to embezzle roughly 200 billion ISK ( the game 's currency ) .
Ricdic exchanged the ISK for about $ 5,000 to pay off real - life debts .
Massively has an in - depth write - up about how the theft affects the game and its players .
Since the scandal became public , there 's been a run on the virtual bank , and its executives are doing what they can to reassure people that it will continue to exist .
Ricdic was banned , not for the embezzlement , but for trading 200 billion ISK for real currency , which is forbidden by EVE's EULA .
Some of you may be aware of George Monbiot ’s so - far - unsuccessful attempt to pin down Ian Plimer on his ridiculous compendium of non-science .
In response to Monbiot ’s request for explanation and sources for some of Plimer ’s more bizarre claims , Plimer has responded with a homework assignment that is clearly beyond even his ( claimed ) prowess .
This is quite transparently a device to avoid dealing with Monbiot ’s questions and is designed to lead to an argument along the lines of “ Monbiot ca n’t answer these questions and so knows nothing about the science ( and by the way , please do n’t notice that I ca n’t cite any sources for my nonsense or even acknowledge that I ca n’t answer these questions either ) ” .
( Chris Colose and Greenfyre have made similar points ) .
It ’s also worth pointing out as Andrew Dodds has done that each question is actually referencing a very well known contrarian and oft - debunked argument , but dressed up in pseudo - scientific complexity .
However , as a service both to Plimer and Monbiot ( as well as anyone else interested ) , we give a quick scorecard on the relevance , actual scientific content ( whether the questions can actually be answered ) and sources for discussion for each of the , to be charitable , ‘ odd ’ questions .
For relevance , we grade each question on a scale from 0 to 5 , 0 being irrelevant to the issue of detection and attribution of 20th Century climate change , 5 being extremely relevant .
For scientific content , we rate the reasonableness of the question posed ( i.e. does it make any sense at all ) , from A to F ( A being a very well posed question , F making no sense ) .
For sources , we generally point to a paper or discussion that addresses the real issue .
From the distribution of the vines , olives , citrus and grain crops in Europe , UK and Greenland , calculate the temperature in the Roman and Medieval Warmings and the required atmospheric CO2 content at sea level to drive such warmings .
What are the errors in your calculation ?
Reconcile your calculations with at least five atmospheric CO2 proxies .
Show all calculations and justify all assumptions .
Relevance : 0 – poor .
Basic logical fallacy .
The existence of prior warm periods that may have been caused by different effects ( such as solar changes , orbital variation , continental configuration etc. ) does not imply that the human - caused increase in CO2 is not causing warming now .

Scientific Content : D – phenology ( the distribution and timing of species ) can potentially be useful for tracking climate changes , but it is just one of many different types of proxy information available , and has its own regional , temporal , and seasonal limitations .
Even more problematic , it is well known that the patterns of surface temperature variability during the “ MWP ” – more accurately , the Medieval Climate Anomaly ( MCA ) – and LIA periods were spatially quite heterogeneous , and a record at one or two locations generally tells us very little if anything about global patterns .
Even a cursory examination of the relevant recent literature ( for instance , Osborn and Briffa , 2006 ) reveals that the pattern of warmth during the Medieval era was far regional in nature , and does not approach the truly global scale of warmth evident in recent decades .

We know what CO2 and CH4 levels have been over the last 15,000 years and they oscillated within about 10 ppmv ( CO2 ) and 100 ppbv ( CH4 ) of their Holocene values since the start of the current era – until the industrial period ( around 1750 ) since when CO2 has increased by 35 % , and methane concentrations have more than doubled .
In each case the values being measured today are way higher than anything measured in 800,000 years of ice core records , and likely higher than anything since the Pliocene ( ~3 million years ago ) .
The idea that bacterial methane production at 4 km in the Earth ’s crust has anything to with this is laughable .

In summary , the relevance of these questions is extremely low , and even when the basic question deals with an issue that is relevant , the question itself is usually nonsensical and presupposes many assumptions that are certainly not a given ( at least in the real world ) .
In fact , for the couple of cases where the scientific content is high , the answer is in contradiction to Plimer ’s unstated assumptions .
The most obvious use of these questions to support a ‘ we do n’t know everything , so we must know nothing ’ type of argument , which is a classic contrarian trope , and one that is easily dealt with .
These questions have as much to do with a debate on human caused climate change as tribbles have to do with astrobiology .
Both are troubling , but for very different reasons .

Tyler Cowen has responded to Pete over at Marginal Revolution .
Tyler seems to be arguing that the preferred way , for many libertarians , of dealing with failing banks is no better and probably worse than what actually happened , namely TARP and the other bailouts .
The preferred way for many of us was to let those banks go through the normal bankruptcy and reorganization process .
Tyler argues that this too is " government intervention " and that it is " ill - suited " to dealing with the sorts of problems we saw last fall .
He offers no argument for the claim of " ill - suitedness . "
One commenter rightly notes that in the world of the second best , he 'd prefer the known , predictable process of bankruptcy over the new , uncertain processes of the bailout .
I think that 's exactly right .
One can make a Higgsian point here about regime uncertainty : we 're always better off ( in the world of the second best ) by operating under the known and predictable set of government rules than adopting new ones that have never been used before , or giving purely discretionary power to government agencies .
But there 's more to it than that .
We also know from Higgs and public choice theory more generally that once powers are given to government during a crisis , they never totally disappear when the crisis is over .
So even if one thinks there was something unique about the situation last fall , it 's naive to think that the powers the Fed and other agencies grabbed to fight it would go away in the long run .
From a libertarian perspective then , the bailouts look like a really bad idea in the longer view .
Now Tyler and others might respond with : " but wait a second , if you did all of this through the bankruptcy courts , would n't that be enlarging government 's size as well ? "
Yes it would but with one HUGE difference .
Giving more cases to bankruptcy courts would be an increase in the scale of government , but not in its scope .
This scale vs. scope distinction is one Higgs makes at the beginning of Crisis and Leviathan but is often overlooked in quick discussions of its main arguments .
Higgs refers to " scale " as government growing not by adding new powers but by having to do more with its existing powers due to things like growth in the population or the economy or in other factors that would draw more heavily on existing processes .
" Scope , " by contrast , refers to the set of powers governments have .
Growth in scope means acquiring new powers .
In Higgs 's theory of crises and government growth , the key point is that crises lead to expansions of the scope of government that do not ever completely disappear .
Returning to last fall : the bailouts gave government new powers it never had before , expanding its scope , but using the bankruptcy process would have only expanded the scale of powers it already had .
Forced to make that choice , a libertarian perspective would see increasing the scale as the notably lesser of two evils .
It was inevitable that the state would be involved in resolving the banking situation one way or the other , but in that second best world it is much better to choose a known and predictable process that only expands government 's scale over one that expands its scope by giving it powers it previously did not have .
From a libertarian perspective neither is ideal , but I would argue growth in scale is much less damaging than growth in scope , in the short run and especially the long run .
I think Tyler 's response completely overlooks these Higgsian points .
A former Los Angeles police officer , who was off duty when he pulled a gun and threatened a man at the Redondo Beach Pier , was sentenced Tuesday to four years and four months in state prison .
" Your conduct does require state prison , " Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen A. Marcus told David Woon Chong following his no contest plea to making a criminal threat .
" Your actions were not justifiable . "
Chong , 39 , also admitted using a gun during the commission of the March 15 , 2008 , crime .
" I do think the conduct by the defendant was very , very serious , " the judge said .
Noting that Chong had served 10 years in the Los Angeles Police Department and three years in the U.S. Army , Marcus said he believed the former officer could create a new life after being released from prison .
As a result of his plea to the criminal threat charge , Chong withdrew his May plea to an assault with a firearm charge stemming from the same incident .
Authorities said he pointed a handgun at the man 's head during one of two confrontations .
" I think that given the ( defendant 's ) actions and everything that I know about the defendant , that it's a fair sentence , " Deputy District Attorney Amy Pellman Pentz said afterward .
" I 'm very disappointed , " Chong 's attorney , Gerson S. Horn , said of the prison sentence .
" In my mind , this is a perfect case for probation . "
Chong has since been diagnosed as bipolar , " finally put on the appropriate medication " and stopped drinking , his lawyer said .
Chong -- who received " all kinds of commendations " during his LAPD tenure -- has since been fired by the department , according to his attorney .

Today another former member of the IDF 's " Child Killing Unit " speaks out .
And again , we see that Israel has a long standing policy of killing children , torturing children , jailing children , and , get this , using " Military Tribunals " to try children aged 16 .
Witness the sickness of these people : " You take the kid , you blindfold him , you handcuff him , he 's really shaking ...
Sometimes you cuff his legs too .
Sometimes it cuts off the circulation . "
" He does n't understand a word of what 's going on around him .
He does n't know what you 're going to do with him .
He just knows we are soldiers with guns .
That we kill people .
Maybe they think we 're going to kill him . "
" A lot of the time they 're peeing their pants , just sit there peeing their pants , crying .
But usually they 're very quiet . ''
LIKE THIS : from the BBC : A former Israeli military commander has told the BBC that Palestinian youngsters are routinely ill - treated by Israeli soldiers while in custody , reports the BBC ' s Katya Adler from Jerusalem and the West Bank .
Eran Efrati is a former commander in Israel 's army .
He served in the occupied West Bank .
In a discreet park in Jerusalem we meet to discuss allegations that soldiers like him often mistreat Palestinian minors , suspected of throwing stones .
Mr Efrati - who left the army five months ago - says the allegations are true :
'' I never arrested anyone younger than nine or 10 , but 14 , 13 , 11 for me , they 're still kids .
But they 're arrested like adults .
" Every soldier who was in the Occupied Territories can tell you the same story .
The first months after I left the army I dreamed about kids all the time .
Jewish kids .
Arab kids .
Screaming .
'' Maybe [ the kid is ] blindfolded for him not to see the base and how we 're working ...
But I believe maybe we put the blindfold because we do n't want to see his eyes .
You do n't want him to look at us - you know , beg us to stop , or cry in front of us .
It 's a lot easier if we do n't see his eyes .
'' When the kid is sitting there in the base , I did n't do it , but nobody is thinking of him as a kid , you know - if there is someone blindfolded and handcuffed , he 's probably done something really bad .
It 's OK to slap him , it 's OK to spit on him , it 's OK to kick him sometimes .
It does n't really matter . ''
Young Palestinians are mostly arrested for throwing stones at Jewish settlers or Israeli soldiers .
Night - time arrests
At a recent protest , I watched a gang of Palestinian boys darting amongst the olive trees , picking up stones and rocks to throw at the soldiers .
Some used sling - shots .
Many had a scarf or shawl wrapped round their face to hide their identity .
The soldiers responded with tear gas and sound grenades .
Sometimes they have used rubber - coated bullets too .
Often after an incident like this , Israeli soldiers raid a West Bank village .
Usually in the middle of the night .
LIKE THIS : The arrests can be brutal .
'' Their faces were painted when they came for him .
It was frightening .
All those soldiers for one boy .
They put iron weights on his back in the jeep and beat him all the way to jail .
He could n't get up for a week . ''
Mohammad Ballasi's 15 - year - old son , also called Mohammad , was arrested by Israeli soldiers for stone - throwing .
We met him and his wife just outside an Israeli military base in the West Bank .
Palestinian youngsters are tried in military tribunals .
The tribunals regard minors as Palestinians aged 16 or under .
In Israel 's civil courts minors are young people under the age of 18 .
( IMPORTANT NOTE HERE :
This is quite stunning , because in actuality , the IDF have a policy of allowing and encouraging , the killing of children aged 12 .
So what we see , is Israel has a policy of killing 12 year olds , trying children aged 16 and lower in " Military Tribunals " no less !!
Yet , for Israeli " children " Israel decides to use the worldwide legal age of 18 for their own .
So , in effect Israel has three policies when it comes to Palestinian children .
All of them Illegal )
The first time Mohammad 's parents saw him since he was arrested two weeks before was at his trial .
He pleaded guilty .
'' When you 're beaten like that , you would confess against your own mother , " said Suad Ballasi , choking back tears .
'' He 's a child .
His friends are playing in the street and he is in handcuffs .
I could n't stop crying in court .
My heart feels like it 's going to explode . ''
The human rights organisation Defence for Children International ( DCI ) has written a report accusing Israel 's military of what it describes as the systematic and institutionalised ill - treatment and torture of Palestinian children by the Israeli authorities .
Gerard Horton is an international lawyer for DCI .
He said Mohammad 's Ballasi 's story is a familiar one .
'' We see these stories again and again .
Israel is a signatory to the UN convention against torture .
It 's also a signatory to the UN convention on the rights of the child - and under customary international law , it 's not permissible to mistreat and torture , particularly children , who are obviously more vulnerable than adults . "
He told me that Israel arrested 9,000 Palestinians last year .
Seven hundred of those were children .
Mr Horton says the military tribunals need to process cases quickly .
DCI believes the system is designed so that it is in an adult or a child 's interest to plead guilty .
Gerard Horton says Palestinians tend to end up in jail longer if they try to fight their case .
Mohammad Khawaja had just turned 13 when he was arrested .
'' They dragged me from my home by the scruff of the neck .
The more I cried the more they choked me , " he said .
" My mum was screaming .
They pulled me along on my stomach .
My knees were bleeding .
They beat me with their guns and kicked me all the way to the jeep .
" They cuffed my hands and legs , blind - folded me and left me there for 24 hours .
I thought I was going to die .

Carlito from Carlitos ’ Contraptions had a problem , he had a locked safe that he wanted to open and he did n’t want to get a professional in to do the job for him .
So what did he do ?
Rather than cut it open or blow it up , he built a contraption that made use of a micro-controller and a servo motor to automatically dial out every possible combination .
Unfortunately , the servo motor that he selected was not powerful enough to do the job , better luck next time , Carlito ; we look forward to seeing Mk2 .

Libertarian environmentalism is not a contradiction of terms - nor is free - market environmentalism ( another good summary can be found here ) .
Free - market environmentalism , however , is too focused on property rights and tort reform .
While these are both highly productive and praiseworthy measures , I believe a broader approach is necessary .
Simply put , libertarian environmentalism seeks to improve the environment without the use of force .
Many environmentalists today ( I dare say a majority ) rely too heavily on force to achieve their goals .
They look to government to punish and coerce individuals to behave a certain way .
The government often acts in accordance to their will , as the government has grown accustomed to using force to achieve other goals .
Environmentalists and the government justify their use of force by reason of market failure .
To the contrary , it is the government 's failure to allow the market to correctly function .
Rather than relying on force , libertarian environmentalism encourages environmentally - friendly actions through economic incentives .
You could replace the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) with the Environmental Incentive Agency ( EIA ) , replacing negative reinforcement with positive reinforcement .
Critics of both libertarian and free - market environmentalism are quick to bring up global warming .
While I am more inclined to believe in climate change over global warming , I made my feelings clear in yesterday 's post on the topic :
If a cap - and - trade system ( hereon more accurately referred to as a " carbon quota " ) were implemented in the United States , the level of emissions would be completely arbitrary .
No scientist knows the level of carbon dioxide at which the atmosphere become irreversibly unstable .
Without knowing the upper limit , any restriction in quantity will necessarily be made through guesswork ( or , even worse , through politics - i.e. what sounds politically popular ) .
I wo n't deny the existence of climate change .
However , it is more a regional phenomenon than a global one .
For example , many environmentalists cite the melting glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro as a sign of global warming .
These people overlook basic science .
The area surrounding Mt. Kilimanjaro has been largely deforested by the local population .
Due to the deforestation , less water evaporates from the trees , providing less snowfall to replenish the glaciers each year on the mountain .
If force was the appropriate means to achieve environmental goals , authoritarian countries like China would have spotless environmental records
There 's no need for the government to force individuals ' behavior when private sector solutions are available
Do not allow the supporters of cap - and - trade ( " carbon quota " ) mislead you by stating they are " creating a market " for carbon .
They are using force to achieve an unscientifically - based goal .
I will not completely ignore the climate change issue .
In a previous post on climate change in Africa , I stated : A 2006 study by Quan Li and Rafael Reuveny found that increased levels of political freedom have been shown to lower CO2 and NOx emissions , decrease rates of deforestation and land degradation , and reduce water pollution .
As I mentioned previously , factors such as deforestation are major contributers to climate change .
Forcing a carbon tax or carbon quota on the economy is not the most efficient way to tackle problems like deforestation that directly contribute to climate change .
However , I will not deny the role of increased carbon emissions on climate change .
I previously blogged on private sector solutions to this problem , including a group of UK and US scientists who plan to create wind - powered ships to increase cloud cover , reflecting the suns rays , without affecting regional weather patterns .
The plan costs $ 9 billion to test and launch 1,900 ships ( a cost of less than $ 5 million per ship ) .
For a bicyclist , Darwin Hindman is rather nattily attired , wearing a crisp tweed blazer and an orange silk tie as he pilots his ancient mountain bike through the center of Columbia , Missouri .
Hindman , 76 , ( pictured ) is this Midwestern town ’s mayor and a survivor of both esophageal and prostate cancer .
As he glides along , coattails flying , he is savoring the streets of Columbia , which he ’s transforming into one of the nation ’s premier cycling cities .
“ Here outside this café is a huge corral of racks for locking your bike , ” Hindman says , riding along happily .
“ And here , we ’ve painted a bike lane .
We want bicyclists to feel as happy as larks out in the road . ”
Until recently , Columbia ( pop. 100,733 ) was , like most American cities , designed almost exclusively for automobile transit , offering up a host of four - lane mini- highways over which motorists could zoom between parking lots .
For Hindman , a retired lawyer , the situation was all wrong .
“ If we depend too much on cars , then we increase our reliance on foreign oil , childhood obesity goes up , and life just is n’t as much fun , ” he says .
Across the country , the number of bicyclists has exploded .
Between 2003 and 2007 , the number of American bike commuters increased 38 % .
Yet many of these riders are forced onto dangerously crowded streets and roads designed for motorists , not bicyclists .
In fact , in 2007 , 698 cyclists nationwide were killed and more than 44,000 were injured in collisions with motor vehicles .
The Federal Highway Administration has launched a pilot program with an aim to make roads safer and more enjoyable .
More than $ 90 million has been allocated to four communities — Columbia , Minneapolis , Sheboygan County , Wis. , and Marin County , Calif .
Each will receive about $ 22.5 million to make them more bicycle - and pedestrian - friendly .
With the support of Sen. Christopher S. Bond ( R. , Mo. ) , who helped launch the program , Hindman recently ordered concrete bike paths alongside Columbia ’s streets , rejiggered major intersections for bike safety , and turned existing residential streets into “ bike boulevards ” with painted bike lanes and obstacles to slow down cars .
Other cities are enacting their own changes .
New York City just spent three years building 200 miles of bike lanes .
Louisville , Ky. , lured more than 10,000 cyclists to a Mayor ’s Memorial Day Hike & Bike Ride .
And tiny Carmel , Ind. , identified a 100 - mile network , an “ Access Bikeway , ” that consists of existing streets on which cyclists can safely ride .
Congress is watching the Federal Highway Administration ’s pilot program closely .
Rep. Jim Oberstar ( D. , Minn . ) is now pushing for the passage of a new transportation bill that reportedly could devote up to $ 1 billion a year to facilitate biking and walking across the country .
But not everyone is happy about the new embrace of cycling .
Sen. John McCain ( R. , Ariz . ) has decried “ pet projects like walkways and bicycle paths , ” saying they come “ at the expense of our nation ’s roads and bridges . ”
While it may be too soon to gauge the success of early efforts , bicyclists in Portland , Ore. , are setting the pace .
Since 1992 , the city has spent almost $ 60 million — or roughly the cost of building one mile of an urban highway — to enhance its cycling infrastructure .
The number of riders flowing across the city ’s bridges has more than quadrupled , and on one bridge last year , more than 20 % of all trips were made by bicycle .
Portland , meanwhile , has become one of the few U.S. cities to decrease its greenhouse - gas emissions below 1990 levels .
Columbia is still far from equaling Portland ’s gold standard , but Mia Birk , once Bicycle Program Manager for Portland and now a principal in a transit - planning firm there , notes : “ There ’s no overnight magic wand you can wave .
It takes a generation to change an ingrained habit like driving , but Columbia is on its way . ”
From 2007 to 2008 , the number of cyclists riding midweek increased by 71 % .
There are now about 10,000 people riding Columbia ’s streets .
Among the new converts is Bonnie Trickey , a 66 - year - old mortgage broker who had scarcely mounted a bike in three decades — and was afraid to brave Columbia ’s streets .
Trickey took a city - sponsored cycling - safety class and now rides through Columbia ’s hillier neighborhoods for an hour most mornings .
Likewise , Alvin Sweezer , 40 , a school custodian , commutes 15 miles each way from his home .
Sweezer ’s journey begins at 5 a.m. , in darkness , and wends up a couple of steep hills and over a potholed country bridge before passing a yard full of dogs who invariably greet him with bloodcurdling growls .
Still , he says , “ Even if it snows , I ride in .
They plow the roads pretty good around here . ”
But Columbia ’s most stalwart cyclist is probably the mayor .
Hindman rides about 60 miles each week — to the grocery store , to meetings , and to the dog park , hauling his faithful mutt , Loki , in a bike trailer .
Hindman ’s next goal is to connect every neighborhood to a bike path , in the hope that he can continue to wean citizens from auto - dependence .
“ If we could get people to use their bikes or walk on 20 % of their short trips , I ’d be delighted , ” he says .
Meanwhile , the mayor will keep pedaling .
“ Every ride is different , ” he says .
“ Every ride is a new adventure . ”
OTHER BIKE -FRIENDLY CITIES
Besides Columbia , Mo. , and Portland , Ore. , many other cities are promoting bicycling .
Some innovative plans :
• Boulder , Colo .
At least 95 % of major roads have bike lanes or trails .
In 2005 , the city was among the first to launch a Safe Routes to School program to encourage kids to walk and bike to school .
• Tucson , Ariz .
All new street construction is required to include bike lanes .
The city created a “ Share the Road ” safety guide for bicyclists and motorists .
• Davis , Calif .
One of the first cities to incorporate bicycling into its transportation infrastructure , the university town of 60,000 has more bikes than cars .
Experts began examining the grave last year DNA tests have started on the remains of hundreds of WWI soldiers whose remains were found in a mass grave in northern France last year .
Genetic samples from living relatives have been taken to identify British and Australian remains taken from the site of the Battle of Fromelles .
Soldiers from Bristol , Gloucestershire , Warwickshire , Worcestershire were heavily involved in the fighting .
The exhumed bodies will later be buried with full military honours .
The grave was found after detective work by an Australian historian .
Fromelles on 19 July 1916 , a frontal assault on German positions , cost the lives of more than 1,500 Australians and 500 British troops .
The 11 - hour battle was the worst single loss of Australian life in the nation 's entire military history .
Military honours The British 61st Division , featuring the 4th ( City of Bristol ) , 5th and 6th battalions of the Gloucestershire Regiment alongside men from the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and the Worcestershire Regiment , were heavily engaged in the attack .
Other British units , including the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Regiment , also sustained heavy losses as they attempted to support what was intended to be a diversionary attack to take pressure of Allied forces on the Somme .
List of British casualties who may be buried at Fromelles German forces , who suffered only moderate casualties , are believed to have featured the then 27 - year - old Adolf Hitler .
Australian amateur historian Lambis Englezos was honoured by the Australian government after his research led to the grave 's discovery .
Although the battle is largely forgotten in the UK , in Australia it is remembered as a national tragedy of the same note as Gallipoli .
Richard Hope - Hawkins , of Bristol , is waiting to hear if the grave , which was hastily dug after the conflict by the Germans , contains the remains of his late uncle 2nd Lt George James Mitchell .
" I feel very emotional about it .
My late grandmother , great - grandmother and mother all talked about George James Mitchell and I think it 's wonderful that they are now hopefully retrieving his body . "
Richard Hope - Hawkins has researched his family 's history As well as using DNA analysis , archaeologists will try to match up artefacts found with some of the bodies .
Train tickets , a heart - shaped pouch and even a stamped toothbrush have been discovered so far .
Once everything has been done to identify the remains , each one will be buried with full military honours at a new military cemetery .
The work on the grave is being supervised by the Berkshire - based Commonwealth War Graves Commission .
Anyone who believes they may be related to a British soldier killed at Fromelles should contact the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre by calling 01452 712612 extension 6303 or emailing fromelles@spva.mod.uk

I think this video speaks for itself – I love it .
It ’s by Diego Stocco , who was also responsible for the “ Music From A Tree ” video I posted on the Production Advice Tumblr blog yesterday .
Why do I love it ?
Because it’s :
Beautiful
Musical
Witty
Unique
Original
Punky
– wait , punky ?
[ Insert FX of record scratch / car screeching to a halt / etc ]
What the hell am I talking about ?
Punk means something different depending which side of the Atlantic you grew up on , but either way , what do these delicate ambient textures and found sounds have to do with either the Ramones or the Sex Pistols ?
The answer is – DIY ethos .
Regardless of what it sounded like , a key element of punk was that anyone could make music – provided they sing a bit , or strum and hit something .
The modern equivalent is a laptop ( and a microphone ) – so , you do n’t even need an instrument !
Diego is using ProTools , but there ’s plenty of highly affordable – or even free – software around that can do the same job .
Every Mac comes bundled with a copy of Garageband these days , for example , which includes the “ musical typing ” feature , so you do n’t even need a keyboard .
Music From A
Tree is almost better than Music From Sand in this respect , because there is n’t even any additional audio processing going on .
No effects , no samplers – it ’s just patterns built up from real noises .
What else do I love about these videos – shall I count the ways ?
The improvised stethoscope mic ?
Taping mics to his fingers ?
Shaving bits of wood off the twigs to tune them ?
Playing the tree with a bow ?
Emulating waves crashing by playing grains of sand …
If you write ambient or electronic - influenced music you ’re probably already looking for that lapel mic you never used for your last mobile phone so you can tape it to your toes , but maybe if you ’re writing more conventional music these ideas do n’t seem so relevant to you .
If so , I say – think again .
Individual , original , unexpected and delightful sounds can add something to almost any musical genre .
Hang a mic out the window and record wind and birdsong behind your acoustic guitar piece .
Sample a dustbin lid and mix it with the snare sound in your latest metal tune .
Instead of a guitar solo , sing it with a paper and comb through your guitar amp .
Use a tin of pulses as a shaker , make your own glass harp , sample your grandmother ’s teeth – I do n’t care , just get some 21st Century punk DIY into your music !
This , however , is probably taking it too far .
( Warning , contains scenes some people – including me – may find distressing )
Regardless of your opinion of the ethics of piano murder , Diego has done an incredible amount of cool stuff – I strongly suggest you follow the links above and check out his music on BandCamp .
Are you already using “ found sounds ” in your music ?
Will you , now ?
Please ?!

In the public eye , the worst terrorist atrocity ever carried out in Britain , the murder of 270 people , remains a crime unsolved .
Its perpetrators are unpunished .
The one man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 was last week released from a Scottish jail .
Abdelbaset al - Megrahi was given a hero 's welcome in Libya , where he is now free to die from the cancer that was the ostensible reason for his release on compassionate grounds .
That the regime of Muammar Gaddafi would seek to make political theatre out of Megrahi 's homecoming was inevitable .
That is one of the Libyan regime 's preferred styles of diplomacy .
The implied message is that the ailing bomber was a hostage of the west , freed by some ingenious stratagem of the country 's " brotherly leader " .
Colonel Gaddafi's son , Saif , has stoked speculation that Megrahi 's freedom was a quid pro quo for some concession in access to Libya 's oil and natural gas reserves .
That is denied by both the British government and by the devolved Scottish administration , which jealously guards its constitutional autonomy in judicial affairs such as prisoner release .
The Scottish justice secretary , Kenny MacAskill , engaged in a certain theatricality of his own when delivering Megrahi 's fate .
The Libyan 's prostate cancer , he said , amounted to a death sentence in " a higher court " .
So the courts of men should show mercy .
Thus , too , would Scotland as a whole , Mr MacAskill suggested , show its moral superiority to the merciless criminal .
It was a fine oration that summarised a sound liberal principle : that justice is not always the same as vengeance .
But that is beside the point , because justice has never been served in relation to Lockerbie .
Megrahi did not testify in court , but there was enough incriminating testimony by others for a panel of judges to find him guilty .
A co-defendant was acquitted for want of evidence .
A coherent narrative of how the plot was hatched and executed did not come out .
It is impossible that Megrahi acted alone .
It is also implausible that he will have been released from Scotland without consultation at the highest level of British government .
But it suits Alex Salmond 's nationalist administration to show that it can take momentous decisions .
It also suits the Labour administration in Westminster for the decision to be seen to be Scottish .
Megrahi's extradition from Libya in 2000 to stand trial was the product of careful diplomacy .
So was the Libyan regime 's payment of compensation to families of the Lockerbie victims in exchange for a lifting of trade sanctions .
After the 11 September attacks in 2001 , Colonel Gaddafi was cajoled , threatened and enticed away from pariah status in the world .
He renounced weapons of mass destruction ; he opened his country 's energy sector to foreign investment .
Those deals are bound to colour perceptions of the decision to free a Libyan intelligence officer serving time in a British jail for a terrorist attack .
They make the " compassionate release " story look naive , dishonest or both .
Meanwhile , the group whose interests are least served is the relatives of the victims .
Their entitlement to know the truth about flight 103 has been forgotten by the British government .
There is no one behind bars in connection with the most murderous terrorist attack on British soil .
Justice has not been seen to be done .
Instead , all that is in the public view is a sequence of events that are easily threaded into a narrative of conspiracy .
Perhaps that is not so .
Maybe Megrahi was released because the Scottish administration took pity on him .
In which case , the government in Westminster must have an opinion on whether that was the right decision .
But if the prime minister has a view , he is not sharing it .
That is a mistake .
Official silence over the legacy of the Lockerbie bombing has gone on for far too long .
• This article was amended on Friday 28 August 2009 .
We said that Abdelbaset al - Megrahi was found guilty by a jury ; in fact , he was found guilty by a panel of judges .
This has been corrected .
Admittedly , when we saw Game Informer 's survey that pegged Xbox 360's failure rate at 54.2 percent , we were thinking that was a bit steep of a number , possibly bumped up a few digits from some possible sampling errors .
So when we were gearing up to read Microsoft 's statement responding to the data , we fully expected some harsh rebuttal of the number .
Turns out we got disappointed .
A spokesperson for Redmond pointed to its superior entertainment value , its " best warranty in the industry " and its " constantly improving design , manufacture , and performance . "
At no point is there a dispute or even direct reference to the findings , which is really something that could 've helped public perception on a nagging issue .

1st Course : Cauliflower Panna Cotta
per se , New York
Though it generally works out that ordering the tasting menu is a more “ adventurous ” course of action than ordering a la carte , I think this is much more often a function of the lack of an ability to choose your adventure rather than the offerings at hand .
I also think this is much more true in the U.S. , where diners are less adventurous and the tasting menus more everyman than in Europe ( I would include the rest of the world , but the rest of the world does n’t necessarily eat the way people in the northern half of the Western hemisphere do ) .
The tasting menu has become a predictable , formulaic story .
It ’s not just a matter of beginning , middle , and end any more .
It ’s become a comfort zone for fine diners and , I suspect , chefs .
Admittedly , I ’m one of them .
But it ’s almost gotten to the point where I could approach Parker Bros .
about making a board game out this , or cash in at Bravo , suggesting they make a tasting menu game show : “ Guess That Tasting Menu . ”
Let ’s give it a whirl .
You get three clues .
We ’ll start out easy :
Challenge # 1 : Name the protein .
Clue # 1 : 2nd Course on a 3 - Course Tasting .
Clue # 2 : Average fine - dining restaurant .
Clue # 3 : It ’s not chicken and it ’s not beef .
Answer : Salmon .
Here ’s a harder one :
Challenge # 2 : Name that course .
Clue # 1 : It comes before the pre-dessert .
Clue # 2 : It ’s not meat .
Clue # 3 : It will most likely show up on wheels .
Answer : Cheese course .
And , an even harder one :
Challenge # 3 : Name that pre-dessert .
Clue # 1 : You eat it with a spoon .
Clue # 2 : It ’s creation did not rely on an ice cream maker .
Clue # 3 : It does not contain dairy .
Answer : Coconut tapioca .

Can YOU crack the code ?
I ’ve given it a shot and come up with a rough snapshot of tasting menus circa first decade of the 2000s .
For a basic fine dining tasting formula , you ’ll most likely see :
Amuse Bouche
Forgettable Bread
Something Raw
Something Foie
Something Fish ( salmon or scallop )
Something Meat ( beef or lamb )
Something Chocolate
For an above - average fine dining tasting menu , you ’ll most likely see :
Amuse Bouche
Good Bread / Decent Butter
Something Raw
Something Foie
Something Fish ( upgraded to a white fish : cod , or bass , or turbot )
Something Meat ( if the beef has n’t been upgraded to Kobe or some stock with provenance , then lamb )
Something Sorbet ( fruit - based )
Something Cheese or Fruit
Something Chocolate
Good Coffee
Petits Fours
It gets less predictable at the elite fine dining level .
All the same , you ’ll most likely see :
Multiple Amuses Bouche
Excellent Bread / Excellent Butter ( multiple choices )
Something White , Pureed and Topped with Caviar ( cauliflower , parsnip , and celeriac are all candidates )
Something Raw
Something Foie ( generous tranche of brioche is a must )
Something Pasta ( bonus point if the pasta is filled )
Something Sea ( upgraded to lobster , or some white fish done in an unfamiliar fashion )
Something Meat or Fowl ( the rarer the breed the better , supplemental price if it ’s game with shot )
Something Cheese ( on a cart )
Something Pre-Sweet ( most likely better than what is to follow )
Something Sweet 1
Something Sweet 2
Excellent Coffee
Petits Fours ( multiple flights )
Cute Take - Home Pastry

Many chefs also seem to be under the belief that the seriousness of their tasting menu is buoyed by :
1 . The appearance of at least one dish made freakishly Asian with miso this or yuba that ;
2 . The addition of black truffles , regardless of the quality or season ; and / or
3 . Table - side entertainment – be it bird autopsy , dissection of a side of beast , or dramatic feats with a sauce boat and a spoon .
And my favorite crutch : the legitimacy of a chocolate dessert has come to hinge on the ability to name the chocolate ’s far - flung origin .
If only I could get away with serving “ Hershey , Pennsylvania Chocolate Cake ” in my home .
This , of course , is a cynical , rough , and tongue - in - cheek caricature of an otherwise respectable form of a chef ’s creative outlet ( at least , that ’s what I thought tasting menus were supposed to be ) .
I ’m not saying that this sort of formulaic institutionalization is necessarily a bad thing .
Of course , a lot of it depends on what is being done with what products .
Of course , this is just how our society thinks of food in a linear progression .
Of course , I find comfort in familiarity and secured expectations – I happily accept the general small - to - large , fish - before - meat , end - with - dessert progression .
And of course , I willingly and often surrender to the above - mentioned equations .
The most compelling cases are those where the tasting menu represents the chef ’s most treasured and classic dishes .
This is especially true when I ’m visiting a restaurant that I ’ll most likely not be able to revisit in any predictable amount of time .
[ See Paul Bocuse , The Fat Duck , and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road ( note the title of that blog post ) . ]
But I truly relish those rare occasions when chefs surprise me with something novel , something that steers a wide berth around cliches , and – most importantly – something wholly theirs .

Building brand equity .
If you take away only one concept from this article , please let it be this one !
In this internet fueled economy , brand strength is everything !
But brand and brand equity are often misunderstood concepts , the easiest way to think about brand equity is that it ’s the sum total of feelings people get when they think about your business or service .
And it ’s important to remember that brand equity can be positive or negative .
A company like Kiva has copious amounts of positive brand equity – their business impacts the world in a positive way and they are nearly universally liked because they are fair and pleasant to work with .
On the other hand , negative brand equity ( like Mr. Madoff ) , is that horrible , sinking feeling that people get when any mention of your name is raised , which , as you can imagine , makes doing business very difficult .
Brand equity is one of the most monumentally important parts of running a successful business .
If people associate your business with nice feelings and positive images – they will want to work with you .
If they associate nothing but let downs and suffering with your brand , it does n’t matter how good your work is , no one will ever come knocking .
Let ’s take it from the top
From the very first step setting out as a freelancer , you ’re giving up the security of a consistent paycheck for the freedom to work with who you want and when you want .
There are a lot of risks , but there are also plenty of rewards for those who succeed .
First time freelancers and those just starting out often ask about finding those initial clients .
A reasonable request : but one that is , unfortunately , very hard to answer .
Starting a business , especially a one man shop ( in the way that most freelancers operate ) is a very individual process .
Everyone has their own story and their own path .
However ; after conversations with many freelancers and my own experiences , I ’ve come to learn that there are a few common themes that can go a long way towards helping rookie freelancers get up and running .
It pays to have a plan
In the beginning , it ’s tempting to try and take every job that comes your way .
But taking every job is a mistake .
You will end up over - stretched on vastly different projects , trying to work with clients in industries that you know nothing about .
Instead , take some time before you even start trying to recruit clients to formulate a plan .
Ask yourself what type of work you want to do , with what types of clients ?
Knowing your audience and knowing your focus from the outset will help you to qualify prospects and qualify their projects .
For example , imagine that , after much reflection and research , you decide that you want to focus solely on designing and building webpages for Broadway actors .
You live in New York City and many of your friends are actors , plus you just love the theatre .
From that decision , you now have a clearly defined market and a clearly defined product for that market .
Finding prospects and explaining your business becomes easier for you , and easier for those prospects to understand .
Tip : The Elevator Pitch :
An elevator pitch is a one and a half to two minute summation of what your business is and how it benefits your prospective clients .
If you ca n’t concisely explain what it is that you do and how it helps your clients in that short amount of time it ’s a pretty good indication that you need to focus your business goals a little more .
Having a clearly defined plan also simplifies the process of qualifying clients and potential projects :
If it does n’t fit into your plan – do n’t take the work , it ’s that simple .
It may feel counter - productive at the start to be turning prospective clients away but , remember , you ’re in this for the long haul and building a brand around your work takes time , commitment and focus .
You ca n’t build a brand by working for everyone doing whatever project they happen to have .
Every person you know is your audience
When you ’re constructing your plan , it ’s important to think about what you want to work on and where you want to be in the future but do n’t forget to include the groups that you are already a part of and the people you already know .
Your hobbies can be a great source of business and a great way to get your freelancing business off the ground .
If you have a lot of friends that are actors , and you love the theatre – that might be a good industry to focus on .
If you really love photography – you can focus on serving galleries or photographers .
If you already know you ’re passionate about the subject material , doing the work becomes that much easier !
And you ’ve already won half the battle with the people that know ( and trust ) you , so do n’t be afraid to ask .
Family , friends , old coworkers ; they are all potential clients .
A word of warning though ; mixing business with pleasure can be dangerous territory and certainly not the area for hard selling tactics .
Here are a few guidelines to make sure your sales pitch remains respectful of your current relationships :
Make sure you ’re clear about your intentions .
If you ’re starting a new business – it should be clear that you are going to be charging for your services .
Be certain , from the start , that your potential client ( and friend ) knows that you ’re not giving work away for free .
Only offer help where you can make an honest , positive difference .
These people trust you , do n’t abuse that trust just to build your portfolio .
In the long run , your friendship ( and your reputation ) is more important than your portfolio .
Start small and over - deliver .
Do n’t promise the moon in order to sell your services .
It ’s always better to start with a small project and execute it perfectly .
If you have an idea on how to expand the project , discuss it after you ’ve proven you ’re a genius .
Buy local , Be local
Another good place to start is by focusing locally .
While it ’s certainly more intimidating to walk into a local business and try to sell you services face to face , it can also be a lot more powerful .
It is important to remember that not everyone is as comfortable with doing business over the internet as us web professionals ; for many clients , it ’s easier to put trust in another local business because they can see and touch the person with whom they are doing business .
Physical meetings settle fears about fly - by - night internet operations that might just be trying to get their check and deliver something sub-standard .

But face to face selling is a lot more difficult than sending out a few hundred emails and waiting for the responses to come pouring in .
Here are a few tips for successful face to face selling :
Be Prepared :
It ’s not just for the Boy Scouts !
Make sure you understand your client ’s business before you walk through the door .
It ’s an instant credibility booster when you can show that you clearly understand the problems that your prospective client is facing .
Show your past successes :
Have a few anecdotes and a few samples of your work ready to show .
Not an entire tome of every site you ’ve ever had a hand in – just a few of the best will suffice .
Do n’t be afraid to ask :
When you ’ve shown that you understand your prospective clients issues and challenges and you ’ve established the quality of your work , it ’s time to ask for what you want .
Do n’t beat around the bush , just tell the prospective client what benefit you can provide them and how much it will cost them .
Be forthcoming and honest about what you charge and , above all , do n’t be embarrassed about the number you give them ; this is business after all .
Working locally is also a great way to build a community around your brand .
A community that you can touch and feel and talk to on a regular basis can be a gold mine for freelancers because smaller , local - run businesses are generally well connected with each other and are quick to offer recommendations ( when deserved ) to other local businesses .
I ’ve heard of freelancers that have built websites for , quite literally , every small to medium sized business in their town .
They started with one and , based on glowing recommendations and personal connections , were comfortably in work for years to come .
Expanding your reach
So you ’ve established yourself , you ’ve got a steady flow of business and you ’re relatively comfortable , but how do you take your business to the next level ?
How can you earn more while maintaing the same hours ?
Hitting an earnings plateau is a common problem for small businesses , especially one - person operations .
Sure , you could bring in employees or sub - contract out some of your work to other freelancers but your underlying problem still remains .
You are doing work for other small to medium sized businesses that can only afford to pay a certain amount .
To make the jump into a higher tax bracket the name of the game is brand recognition and differentiation .
People far and wide need to know your brand and they need to have an acute understanding of why they know your brand .
In essence , you need to set your business apart from , and above , the competition .
Cast a wide net
Moving from a client base of small fish to one of big fish takes time and , unless you live in one of the major corporate centers of the world , it takes geographical expansion .
You cannot source all of your work locally anymore – and this is where advertising comes into play .
Contrary to what many web personalities these days would have you believe , advertising is not dead .
No , in fact , it ’s more alive and more helpful that you may know !
The trick with advertising though , is getting it right :
Favor highly targeted , captive audiences :
Place your ads within ad networks who cater only to your design / development niche .
Broad campaigns are costly and yield low conversion rates , whereas targeted ads to people who are actively looking for a web designer or developer can cost far less and provide many more conversions .
Place the ads yourself :
By directly contacting small niche blogs and other sites that you know to be frequented by the exact clients you hope to attract you can generally pay less for advertising space .
In addition , forming a relationship with the people on the other end is likely to allow you more control over when and how your ads are shown .
Maintain a consistent message :
Make sure that all of your advertising is consistent with your brand .
And I ’m not just talking about the design of your ads .
Your message and your tone are just as important as how your ad looks .
Consistency across all of these areas will help to build a solid brand identity .
Publicity Stunts 2.0 : Better yet , save those ad dollars , challenge yourself to pull off something incredible in a short period of time ( build a working web app in 12 hours , etc. ) or redesign the homepage of a potential client ’s site and then send them redesign idea with your sales pitch included .

It ’s important to note :
You ca n’t just run a few ads and expect the business to just pour in .
Effective advertising takes time and , above all , constant measurement to be successful .
Start small and keep good records of new business that is a direct result from your advertising efforts .
This way you can focus your dollars on efforts that pay off and drop advertising with little to no return on investment .
Let the love grow
You ’ve heard it before , but it ’s so important that it ’s worth mentioning again :
Teaching the world what you know is a tremendously powerful method of establishing credibility and bringing in new clients .
If you ’ve established your business as the expert in a given niche of design or development you ’ve , more than likely , built an incredible store of very specific knowledge and experience .
While it would seem to make good sense to keep that information to yourself ( in order to preserve your competitive advantage ) the opposite is actually true .
Original image by Jeff Gardner
Write guest posts on influential blogs , post frequently to your own blog , make sure you ’re helping as many other designers or developers that you can .
Every new place you can get your name and your information only helps to spread your brand and solidify your status as an expert .
And contrary to belittling your competitive advantage ( remember , competitive advantage is a multi- headed monster and it takes more than just your knowledge to take your place in the market ) , it fortifies your position in the market as the most knowledgeable and skilled practitioner in your field .
Need an example ?
Think about the chefs of high end restaurants :
Why do you think they are so happy to write cook books full of their most prized recipes ?
I ’m sure the big royalty checks help , but it ’s because they know it takes more than the ingredient list to make a beautiful and delicious dish , and that those cookbooks are helping thousands of people cook better food for themselves , which only serves to build their positive brand equity and name recognition .
Charge More
Yup .
Simple idea right ?
You want to earn more ?
Then charge more .
If you have a constant stream of good business , and especially if you have to turn clients away because you are too busy , you should be charging more for your services .
Much has been written about the psychological link between perceived quality and price and this idea was covered extensively in my last article here on Smashing Magazine about pricing , but pricing can be a great way to control the amount of work you have on your schedule .
Working too many hours ?
Raise your prices and you ’ll cull some of the price conscious clients off the bottom .
Chances are , you ’ll be earning the same or more from less hours .
A wedding photographer that I know has been steadily raising her prices since about the third client she ever got and it ’s only fueled her business .
She is now charging at least double what she was originally charging and continues to increase her client - base .
Something to remember about price changes though .
If you are going to raise your prices , give fair warning to your current and possible future clients with an announcement on your blog about the price hike .
Being honest and forthcoming about what your prices will be and why you are becoming more expensive will generally quell any opposition from clients about the higher price tag on your services .
Hopefully I ’ve given some hope to those newbie freelancers out there and some encouragement to those sitting on the earnings plateau .
And I hope that everyone has taken away the idea that , more than any other single concept , the idea of Brand Equity should be the paramount concern in any marketing effort you decide to follow !

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , said he backs legislation introduced by Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , that would require the Government Accountability Office to audit how the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy and examines every aspect of the Fed , including how much it has lent and will lend to specific banks as part of its bank bailout program .
" We are serious about some legislation in this regard , " said Frank at a hearing on Paul 's bill .
" I have some concerns , some time needs to elapse before certain disclosures take place , we are working together ; we want there to be publicity but we do n't want there to be a market effect in the near term . "
The legislation introduced by Paul , which requires approval by the House Financial Service Committee before it comes to a vote by the full House , has 295 supporters in the House .
A POLICE finance officer who was cleared of stealing £ 20 from a policewoman ’s purse on a night out has been sacked from her job .
Former Miss York finalist Krystal Talmadge , 23 , who also served as a special police constable , was suspended on full pay while the police investigation into the alleged theft was carried out .
When she was cleared at York Crown Court in May , she spoke of her relief , saying : “ The whole thing has been a nightmare , but I knew that I was innocent and that has been proven now . ”
But last week , Miss Talmadge , of Gouthwaith Close , Rawcliffe , attended a disciplinary hearing and was sacked from her £ 16,700 - a- year job at Fulford Road Police Station .
In May , a jury found her not guilty of stealing £ 20 from PC Kealey Lockey ’s handbag at the Tru nightclub , where the two women and their friends met on June 15 , 2008 .
After the verdict , Miss Talmadge hoped to return to work immediately , but remained suspended on full pay while an internal investigation was carried out .
That led to a disciplinary hearing this week , at which she was dismissed from her civilian position with immediate effect , for gross misconduct .
“ There are no words to describe how angry I am by the situation , ” she said .
“ I was cleared at court .
I have n’t done anything wrong .
I am determined to fight this all the way .
I was n’t expecting to be sacked , especially without notice . ”
A police spokeswoman said : “ We can confirm that following a disciplinary hearing on August 12 , police staff member Krystal Talmadge was dismissed from her employment with North Yorkshire Police .
“ She has a right to appeal this decision , therefore it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage . ”
Miss Talmadge is now waiting for written confirmation of the reasons for the hearing panel ’s decision .
She said she will appeal against the decision .
She is still waiting to hear about whether she will be able to keep her job as a special constable .
“ If I had n’t gone to court this would n’t have happened , ” she said .
“ All the evidence used was evidence from the court . ”
She has filled the 14 months since her arrest by studying at university , visiting Australia and setting up her own chocolate fountain business .
But she said it had been the worst year of her life .
“ It has been hell because this was hanging over me , ” she said .
As a finance officer , Miss Talmadge , who was a Miss York finalist in 2005 and 2006 , looked after banking and petty cash among other duties for North Yorkshire Police ’s central area , which includes York , Selby , Tadcaster and Sherburn - in - Elmet .
In May , the jury saw CCTV footage of PC Lockey leaving her handbag in a VIP booth shared by Miss Talmadge .
While the officer was away , the camera captured Miss Talmadge apparently rummaging in the handbag for close to a minute .
Miss Talmadge told the jury she heard a phone ringing and was very drunk at the time .
She could not remember going through the bag and said she would not ruin her career by stealing £ 20 .

RESIGNING : Dennis Robertson has quit as southern manager of transport relationships for the New Zealand Transport Agency .
One of the South Island 's top transport officials and anti-drink - driving campaigners has quit his job after a drink - drive conviction in Christchurch .
Dennis Frank Robertson was convicted on July 23 in the Christchurch District Court .
He was fined and disqualified from driving .
Robertson 's conviction follows police college instructor Detective Sergeant John Gualter being caught weaving across three lanes of State Highway 1 near Wellington in November last year at 2 ½ times the legal limit .
He has yet to be sentenced , but has asked for a discharge without conviction .
Robertson 's alcohol level when caught is not known , and he would not comment yesterday .
Robertson was until last month southern manager of transport relationships for the New Zealand Transport Agency ( NZTA ) , which was established in August last year to combine Land Transport New Zealand and Transit New Zealand .
NZTA spokesman Andy Knackstedt yesterday confirmed Robertson had resigned .
" We are not in a position to make any further comment on this matter , " he said .
Drink - driving was regarded as a serious breach of the NZTA 's code of conduct for its employees , contractors and consultants , he said .
In 2003 , Robertson told The Press the answer to reducing alcohol on the roads was simple New Zealanders had to change their attitude .
" That is what challenging the New Zealand psyche is all about .
The solution is in our heads and we have got to get over the fact that we think it 's someone else 's problem , " he said .
In 1998 , he said the over - 30s appeared to be hopeless when it came to the message against drink - driving .
" Their attitude to drink - driving is quite negative and they indicate they will be the hardest group to change if we want to get the drink - drive - related toll down , " he said .
Robertson is chairman of the New Zealand Roadshow Trust , which promotes road safety with programmes in schools .
Robertson joined the Land Transport Safety Authority ( LTSA ) in 1996 as regional manager .
Before that he held positions in the health sector , firstly as a clinical psychologist and then in management roles in the 1980s and early 1990s .
I was pretty sloshed as I put another shot of tequila to my now - benumbed lips , but the same thought kept going through my whirling head : Total Fed Credit ( also referred to as Federal Reserve Credit ) , zoomed $ 70.3 billion last week !
Yikes !
$ 70.3 billion of new credit appeared , as if by magic , in the accounts of banks in One Freaking Week ( OFW ) !
And this is not , of course , new money .
Instead , this is Fed credit , which the Federal Reserve admittedly creates out of thin air at their whim and gives to the banks , but which BECOMES money when somebody borrows money from a bank .
And how much money can be created out of this Fed credit ?
Almost unlimited amounts , since the amounts of money that the banks must keep on hand as reserves against this new unlimited amounts  of new money and loans is , apparently , zero !
Hahaha !
 Fractional banking indeed !
Hahaha !
What a fraud !
And so I look around and wonder many things , such as ,  Who the hell is borrowing money ?
And for what ?
And why is my butt numb ?
As I try to focus my bleary eyes to scan the barroom , all I can see is a bunch of no-account , slovenly , lowlife , bad - tempered , low - IQ losers like me , drinking our lives away in some dingy , cheap bar that is far enough away from the family and co-workers so that I dont have to put up with any more of their silly crap , and if one of them does stumble in here , I am buzzed enough that I can use inebriation as an excuse to beat the hell out of them for being so stupid that , for instance , they dont buy gold when their moronic government is committing economic sin after economic sin !
Any one of which is more than enough to guarantee economic collapse and total ruination !!
And if you dont believe me , then go to Mises.org and do a little reading , and then after you have your Moment Of Economic Enlightenment ( MOEE ) , get back to me , saying ,  Although they never come right out and say it ,  We re freaking doomed !  about sums it up !
Now I am buying gold and guns since I have been shown True Mogambo Enlightenment ( TME ) , and now  thus filled with paranoia , panic and screaming outrage 
I worship at your feet as a Junior Mogambo Ranger ( JMR ) , where I can but hope that they are not as smelly as I have heard !
While we wait for you to finish your reading assignment , I did a complete 360 - degree turn on that barstool , but I never did see anybody that was borrowing money , since none of them had any , which I surmise from asking each of them to loan me some money , but all of them said they didnt have any .
But I did notice that all that spinning around made me dizzy !
Whew !
Downing another shot to steady my nerves and make  the spins go away , I happened to notice that the Federal Reserve bought up , for itself , a whopping $ 94.5 billion of worthless , toxic crap last week !
In One Freaking Week ( OFW ) !
That is $ 3,000 for every non-government worker in America !
What a blatant fraud !
I dont know exactly what they bought , but I am sure that it is not only the usual fraud of amassing a clot of U.S. government and agency debt , but also worthless bank securities that they have promised to buy as part of the Feds efforts to socialize losses by sticking everybody with inflation in prices as a result of such an inflation in the money supply , which is ( to use the correct  professional economist jargon ) Off The Freaking Charts ( OTFC ) !
And speaking of economists , the famous John Mauldin , in his Frontline Weekly Newsletter , has unwittingly agreed with me about something other than that we both agree that I am a know - nothing loudmouth weirdo .
Now , he has said just enough so that now I can say ,  John Mauldin and I say that  the majority of the halfwits who have been teaching economics , infesting schools with their loathsome ilk , are morons , as all of this economic calamity around the world , spawning unimaginable suffering and losses with much worse to come for a long time yet , took them all completely by surprise , while it was the classical , Austrian school of economics that had long predicted everything .
And now , John Mauldin and I laugh at them all , and we shall wax rich as Croesus , and gluttonously hedonistic so as to outshine Caligula as gold soars , soars , soars to the top of the moon as the dollar falls , falls , falls to the bottom of the toilet as a result of this huge , monstrous final debasement of the dollar of the satanic Federal Reserve creating the avalanche of credit , that creates the tsunami of money , to buy over $ 2 trillion in new federal government debt this year alone !
Hahaha !
Well be rich while everybody else is screwed !
 It s an ill wind that doesnt blow somebody some good ! 
Well , I admit that he did not actually say any of that , but he did mention my name once in a telephone conversation that I treasure to this day (  Hi , John !
This is the Mogambo !  and he said ,  What in the hell is a Mogambo ?  before he hung up ) .
And he did say almost the same thing , if you kind of read between the lines , when he writes ,  We have been teaching generations of MBA students economic garbage .
Gaussian curves and things you could model .
The classic line is from Ibbitson , is a brilliant professor and a brilliant mind , who said economics is a science .
No it s not .
It s barely an art form .
It s voodoo .
That s what we practice .
Exactly !
Ty Andros of TraderView.com explains that neither the Chicago School nor Keynes can explain what is unfolding , and in the Austrian School everything is and has been predictable .
Why are the first two considered mainstream ?
Because in both schools of thought , government is the answer rather than the problem .
For the mainstream , the problems can always be solved by borrow , print , lend and spend . 
And since we are talking about the abject failure , ridiculous theoretical underpinnings and laughable incompetence of the Federal Reserve , I admit that their performance is not as bad as those laughable institutions that have  School of Government  in their names , when they are , beyond a doubt , the most incompetent , traitorous bunch of fifth - columnist morons that this country has ever seen .
I mean , for crying out loud , government ( federal , state and local ) now spends half of GDP !
Hell , the federal government alone spends a third of GDP !
And governments now directly support half the population of the Whole Freaking Country ( WFC ) , and employs 1 out of every 7 workers in that selfsame WFC !
 School of Government ?
Hahaha !
Mr. Mauldin sums it up as ,  As we trained a generation to believe they could model , and they did it .
They modeled garbage , and now weve wiped out a generation of retirement income . 
Well , I would like to amend that to say that people who bought gold have not been wiped out , and if those people are as smart as they seem , then I am sure that they are hanging onto that gold since this is surely the beginning of Something Really Big ( SRB ) !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !

If discriminatory rhetoric falls in the forest and no media 's there to hear it , it unfortunately still makes our right less sound
by Jeremy Hooper
This weekend , when Maine 's anti-equality side holds its pointedly Mike Heath - stripped rally , there will be one group notably absent from the soiree :
The media .
It seems that while their gay - banning goals may be transparent , they have no desire for their events to be :
The Stand for Marriage Rally is being organized by Focus on the Family , The Maine Jeremiah Project , Family Research Council and Stand for Marriage Maine , which includes the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland .
Bishop Richard Malone is expected to address the crowd , along with religious leaders from Maryland and California .
James Dobson of Focus on the Family will provide a video message , Emrich said .
The event is free , but tickets are required .
Emrich said members of the media will not be allowed inside the event .
Opponents of gay marriage to rally in Augusta Sunday [ Morning Sentinel ]
( H/t : Dirigo Blue )
Interesting .
But of course in this day and age , anyone with a flip cam and a bit of intuition can be media .
Like , say , a Good As You reader who happens to resident in or near Augusta , and who wants to document the festivities on the sly .
That might be fun , no ?
Tix can be requested at [ email protected ]
Proceed as you will .
Your thoughts
I wonder if they have some kind of secret media detecter like at airport security .
No media = secerecy = shame = " they got something to hide " and they ain't proud of it .
You would think they would want to get free media coverage .

I suspect they dont want cameras their because they 'll be getting alittle to honest about why they want to make life worse for gay people .

Several Sudanese women have been flogged as a punishment for dressing " indecently " , according to a local journalist who was arrested with them .
Lubna Ahmed al - Hussein , who says she is facing 40 lashes , said she and 12 other women wearing trousers were arrested in a restaurant in the capital , Khartoum .
She told the BBC several of the women had pleaded guilty to the charges and had 10 lashes immediately .
Khartoum , unlike South Sudan , is governed by Sharia law .
Several of those punished were from the mainly Christian and animist south , Ms Hussein said .
Non-Muslims are not supposed to be subject to Islamic law , even in Khartoum and other parts of the mainly Muslim north .
She said that a group of about 20 or 30 police officers entered the popular Khartoum restaurant and arrested all the women wearing trousers .
" I was wearing trousers and a blouse and the 10 girls who were lashed were wearing like me , there was no difference , " she told the BBC's Arabic service .
Ms Hussein said some women pleaded guilty to " get it over with " but others , including herself , chose to speak to their lawyers and are awaiting their fates .
Under Sharia law in Khartoum , the normal punishment for " indecent " dressing is 40 lashes .
Ms Hussein is a well - known reporter who writes a weekly column called Men Talk for Sudanese papers .
She also works for the United Nations Mission in Sudan .
When Amanda Knox looked into an Italian documentary film - maker 's camera and recited the " to be or not to be " speech from Hamlet , the select few who viewed the film heralded it as a stellar performance .
It was the debut no one saw , however , because authorities blocked the documentary film about women in prison once they discovered Ms Knox was the star .
But when the 21 - year - old from Seattle takes the stand next week , she will have the biggest audience of her life .
The whole world will be watching .
" She will respond to all the questions and tell ' her ' truth , " said Luciano Ghirga , the Perugia lawyer representing her .
" She 's ready . "
Prosecutors allege that Ms Knox , her Italian ex-boyfriend , Raffaele Sollecito , and the Ivorian - born drifter Rudy Guede stabbed , strangled and suffocated Meredith Kercher , 21 , from Coulsdon , Surrey , in a struggle that ensued after the British student resisted a sex game on the night of 1 November 2007 .
Ms Knox also faces theft and slander charges in the case .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Guede was convicted in a fast - track trial in October and sentenced to 30 years .
Defence attorneys maintain he acted alone ; his appeal is scheduled for November .
After five months and more than two dozen hearings , the closely watched trial is now reaching its dramatic apex – with heartbreaking testimony from Ms Kercher 's mother , father and sister yesterday and Ms Knox taking the stand next .
The back - to - back Kercher - Knox testimony mirrors how public opinion is dividing into two distinct camps : the " innocentisti e colpevolisti " or " Innocents and the Guilties " .
On the one hand there are the vocal , media - savvy friends and supporters of Ms Knox , completely convinced of her innocence , who say the case is plagued by shoddy police work and a controversial prosecutor .
Others say the evidence is damning and criticise blind support of the pretty , all - American girl when the true victim is Ms Kercher .
Yesterday , few in the courtroom were unmoved as Ms Kercher 's father , mother and sister described the pain , anger and void in their lives .
Her mother , Arline Kercher , her voice quivering , spoke of the terrible effect on the family of her daughter 's murder : " Not just her death , but the nature of it , the brutality of it , the violence of it .
The great sorrow it has caused .
It is such a shock to send your child to school and they do n't come back .
We will never ever get over this . "
Meredith 's father , John , testified to his daughter 's physical strength and karate skills .
" She could have put up quite a fight , " he said .
But while yesterday was a sad and difficult day of testimony , it is harder to predict how it will go this week for Ms Knox , whose spontaneous and sometimes quirky personality has at times worked against her .
Her first declaration before the court , for example , was in response to Ms Kercher 's British friends ' testimony that they found it strange Ms Knox kept condoms and a sex toy in a transparent beauty case .
" I would like to make a brief clarification about the object in the bathroom .
The vibrator .
It exists , " she said .
" But it was just a joke , a gift from a friend before I came to Italy .
It is a tiny pink rabbit about 15 centimetres . "
Shocked journalists expecting a standard , rehearsed statement rewound their digital recorders to make sure they had heard correctly and began Googling the vibrator in question as if it were the alleged murder weapon .
But as the trial has plodded on , Ms Knox has seemed more confident and more serious each of the three times she has spoken out .
After police and interpreters testified about her interrogation the night before her arrest , for example , she claimed their version was not true , and that she had been pressured and mistreated .
But now that the prosecution has closed its case ( 228 piece of evidence and more than 400 traces of genetic material collected during six crime scene inspections ) , Ms Knox has more explaining to do – about why she implicated one African immigrant resident of Perugia , when another was involved , why she wrote conflicting statements , what she did that night , and possible explanations for why her DNA , blood and footprints were identified at the scene of the crime .
Last month , the Rome forensic police biologist Patrizia Stefanoni testified that five mixed DNA samples – blood or DNA that tested positive for both Ms Kercher and Ms Knox – were found in various rooms of the small villa the two women shared .
Their mixed DNA ( traces of genetic material , not blood ) were found on the 20in kitchen knife that prosecutors allege was used to stab Ms Kercher .

" On the handle there is the profile of Amanda Knox and on the blade there is the genetic profile of the victim , " Dr Stefanoni told the jury .
There were also footprints that Dr Stefanoni said were made in Ms Kercher 's blood , where Ms Knox 's genetic profile was also identified .
Forensic police say a bloody footprint on a bathmat is compatible with Mr Sollecito 's and his DNA is on a bra clasp found 40 days after it was initially noticed by investigators .
A second forensic geneticist testified for the Kercher family 's civil case on Friday that she agreed with Dr Stefanoni 's analysis and reconfirmed the prosecution 's reconstruction of a sexually motivated attack by more than one aggressor .
But defence teams have hired their own experts , who will try to pick apart the evidence :
Ms Knox 's blood in the bathroom cannot be dated – perhaps she was menstruating .
She regularly used the utensils in her boyfriend 's home , so of course her DNA is on the knife handle .
And , in cross examination of the prosecution 's witnesses , Ms Knox and Mr Sollecito 's attorneys revealed crime scene mistakes that could have led to inadvertent contamination of some evidence .
Her lawyers intend to ask for independent evaluation of the most contested evidence .
Ms Knox , however , is likely to focus on taking back something she lost control of early in this case : her image .
In the days immediately after her arrest , she was portrayed by the prosecutors and the press , particularly in Britain and Italy , as a twisted and diabolical sexual huntress .
Her family responded by hiring a Seattle public relations firm , which waged an international campaign using private investigators , lawyers and TV personalities to argue that she was innocent and being railroaded .
A Friends of Amanda group was founded to help " turn around the supertanker of character assassination and negative stereotypes " .
Multiple witnesses have testified about what they deemed Ms Knox 's suspicious behaviour – odd domestic habits , the cartwheel and splits she did while waiting in police headquarters , the overt canoodling with her boyfriend the day after her roommate 's murder .
" It seemed like a person who had gone crazy , " Ms Kercher 's best friend , Amy Frost , told the court in February .
But those who know her well say her personality as portrayed in court and by the press is at odds with the woman they know – an outdoorsy Seattle college girl who got good grades , liked yoga , soccer and rockclimbing , partied occasionally and kept extra condoms in her bag just in case .
So what ?
Out of context in a provincial , and very Catholic city such as Perugia ?
Yes , but is this wholesome , angel - faced pixie a cold - blooded killer ?
Some find it hard to believe .
Especially in Seattle , a city that is twinned with Perugia .
The two places are a natural match , both centres of learning and culture .
Seattle is also affluent , with hi-tech heavy - hitters such as Microsoft , Nintendo , Amazon and Boeing among the major employers .
Perugia is known for its chocolate ; Seattle for its coffee ( Starbucks was born there ) .
But Amanda 's Seattle was neither affluent nor alternative .
She played football while attending Seattle Prep , a private Jesuit high school , and got good grades , despite having to hold down two jobs in order to make ends meet .
She enrolled at the University of Washington , where she would study German , Italian and creative writing .
Again , she kept her grades up , while working in a university district coffee bar .
Like most college students , she partied , too .
Ms Knox 's mother and father ( now separated , but still friendly ) live a mile apart in middle - class homes in the Arbor Heights suburb .
While comfortable , the families are not rich , and the financial strain of the past year has been heavy .
The Knoxes have made multiple trips to Italy , paid lawyers ' fees , retained some of Italy 's best experts and hired a public relations company .
Family members take turns attending the trial and share a car to get around Perugia .
Interviewed earlier this year in Seattle , three of Ms Knox 's closest college friends said that they had been saving up money to travel to Perugia this summer to testify as character witnesses .
First to testify will be Andrew Seliber , who studied psychology and once lived in the same residence as Ms Knox .
For next week , however , her supporting cast will have to exit stage right as the spotlight turns on to Ms Knox herself .
As a communal witness , she will be asked questions by all the parties .
As the accused person on trial , however , she is not required to answer questions , or even pledge to tell the truth .
Ms Knox can say whatever she pleases .
She is expected to start her testimony in English , but is also fluent enough to speak in Italian , as she has in prior statements .
Legal observers say that exposing Ms Knox and her genuine - but - unpredictable personality on the stand is risky – it could go either very well or very poorly , but it was obviously a risk her lawyers were willing to take .
Eleven years after Cameron Diaz smoothed sperm through her hair , one taboo still exists in comedy and , contrary to what certain sections of the British media might have suggested , it does not involve Manuel from Fawlty Towers .
It is abortion .
There has been a bit of a hoo - hah in the US over an episode of Family Guy in which Lois , the main female character , considers an abortion .
To be precise , she considers the abortion after she agreed to act as a surrogate mother and the couple for whom she was acting as surrogate dies .
Her doofus husband , Peter Griffin , then meets some anti-abortion protestors and is momentarily swayed .
Then he is unswayed and she has the abortion .
The end .
As this summary suggests , this show was never intended as a wholly serious thinking point .
Nonetheless , it has managed to cause quite an outrage in the US , annoying both the pro-choice and anti-abortion camps , and Fox has now refused to run the episode .
Despite being neither as ingenious as The Simpsons nor as brilliant as South Park , Family Guy is often pretty funny and it has been nominated for a best comedy Emmy , the first animated show since The Flintstones in 1961 to be so , making it arguably the most influential cartoon series in America today .
Part of its appeal has been , as creator Seth MacFarlane puts it , its " edginess " .
Off the top of my head , the only American sitcoms that have featured a major character considering an abortion are Maude ( 1972 ) and Roseanne ( 1994 ) , plus the 90s whinge - fest Party of Five , although that was more sit than com .
The only one in which the character was allowed to have the abortion was Maud , which says something about the growing influence of the conservative movement on popular culture in America over the past three decades .
In the others , Roseanne found out she was n't actually pregnant and in Party of Five the character had what the scriptwriters almost certainly described as " a convenient miscarriage " .
That even Roseanne lamed out with her non-choice ending is definitive proof of how nervous US TV producers have become when it comes to abortion .
Fox 's squeamishness about abortion is no surprise , seeing as we 're talking about the unashamedly conservative Fox network here .
However , it is under the same umbrella as Fox News , on which the swivel - eyed bozo Glenn Beck recently claimed that President Obama is " a racist " .
Beck remains one of Fox News 's star presenters .
So chez
Fox the rules are , accusing your president of racism on a news channel = great !
But a fictional character having an abortion on a cartoon = get out of my house .
In fact it was the liberal outrage that initially surprised me .
After all , the anti-abortion sentiments come from Peter Griffin , who is to rational thought what Sarah Palin is to political acumen .
Although it is currently impossible to see the actual episode , there is a video of the actors doing a read - through of the script and then the outrage becomes understandable .
My goodness , Seth MacFarlane put some nasty words in Peter Griffin 's mouth .
And they 're not even funny .
Family
Guy still ostensibly toes the liberal line to appeal to its young audience , yet in order to maintain its " edginess " it seems to be becoming increasingly conservative under the Obama presidency .
This would explain why conservative wingdings Rush Limbaugh and Karl Rove are to appear on the show .
It also explains why MacFarlane recently said that Stewie , the villainous baby on the show , is gay – which " explains why he 's so hellbent [ on killing his mother ] . . .
He has a lot of aggression , which comes from confusion about his orientation . "
MacFarlane recently said that Brian , the family dog and moral centre of the show , has changed from being a liberal to a conservative because " now that Obama 's in charge , Brian finds . . . he 's not happy unless he 's the underdog , so to speak , so he switches parties . "
This could well apply to the whole show .
I 'd have thought that the current healthcare debacle would have given liberal satirists enough material but some , it seems , desire a bit more " edge " .
One might reasonably say that abortion – ha ha ha !
– does not lend itself to comedy anyway .
But then , neither does the Holocaust , and Mel Brooks squeezed comic milk out of that unpromising cow .
The only reason to make a programme about any controversial subject is if you are making a point , and comedy is often the best way to get that point across to a mass audience .
Team America : World Police , the film made by the people behind South Park , remains the finest commentary on American foreign policy ( again , not a naturally hilarious subject ) ever committed to celluloid , while South Park itself remains the shining example of how an edgy cartoon can make points without being preachy .
This has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative .
It 's about having the courage of your convictions .
Otherwise , you may as well be a dog , chasing the next bone of contention .
And so , continuing on this summer 's subject of " the Right Wing ( US and UK branches ) and how half - assed it can be " , we come to Norman Tebbit .
For someone who 's not around any more , he sure has been around lately , promoting some crummy book or t'other .
There he was on Saturday in one ­ paper , gabbling about how when he goes hunting he imagines that " the bird is Neil Kinnock or , more recently , Cherie Blair .
My aim is guaranteed to improve . "
Norman enjoyed this joke so much that he repeated it the next day in another paper , now adding Hillary and Tony to his target names .
" If it 's a David or a George I 'd probably miss because I would n't have my heart in it , " he added , kindly .
Now , some might think that political assassination jokes might be a little de trop in the Tebbit household , seeing as his wife was injured in an IRA bombing , but hey , what do I know ?
I 'm an immigrant who does n't give a hoot about cricket .
This week Hadley was heartbroken when Sarah Palin appeared to reject her offer of friendship on Facebook :
" I can't talk about this actually .
The grief still overwhelms me . "
To console herself , she watched the homage to
Palin on conservatives4palin.com , set to R Kelly music : " I wept until I puked . "

The Chicago Sun Times reports that budget woes will mean many city services just wo n't open tomorrow :
If you planned to check out a library book , visit a city clinic or have your garbage picked up on Monday , you 're out of luck .
The City of Chicago will basically be closed for business on Aug. 17 , a reduced - service day in which most city employees are off without pay , according to a release from the Office of Budget and Management .
City Hall , public libraries , health clinics and most city offices will be closed .
Emergency service providers including police , firefighters and paramedics will be working at full strength , but most services not directly related to public safety , including street sweeping , will not be provided , the release said .
That also includes garbage pickup .
Residents who receive regular collection on Mondays should expect trash to be picked up the following day , the release said .
Some other customers may experience a one - day delay as collectors catch up .
As part of the 2009 budget , three reduced - service days were planned for 2009 , days which are unpaid for all affected employees -- the Friday after Thanksgiving ; Christmas Eve ; and New Year 's Eve .
The City Council recently approved moving the reduced - service day planned for New Year 's Eve to Monday .
The 2009 budget anticipates saving $ 8.3 million due to the reduced - service days .
While lots of people wonder if the recession may spur more financial responsibility in household spending habits , there 's not enough talk about the possibility of more government financial responsibility .
Lots of things we do n't need -- like free public libraries stuffed with books people could buy for themselves or do n't want to read anyway - - may have to be cut back .
The ability to shut down services for a day -- and deprive city workers of pay -- shows that we may have the political will to actually make the cuts .
It was a move Lou Lamoriello tried to make many years ago , but could n’t .
But Friday , at long last , Lamoriello brought Rob Niedermayer to New Jersey when he signed the free - agent forward to a one - year contact .
“ I felt that we needed a little size and strength down the middle , and now , with Travis ( Zajac ) and Zubie ( Dainius Zubrus ) and Robbie , I think we ’ve got three pretty good size - strength center icemen , ’’ Lamoriello said in announcing the deal at the team ’s practice at the Prudential Center .
“ And we know Robbie well , of course , played against him in Stanley Cups , and he ’s had tremendous Stanley Cup experience , and can be used in different roles . ’’
Niedermayer , 34 , the younger brother of former Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer , had 14 goals and seven assists in 79 games last season for the Anaheim Ducks , and in 1,011 career games with Florida , Calgary and Anaheim , Rob Niedermayer has 171 goals and 257 assists .
The Ducks let him leave after his contract expired this summer , preferring to create roster room for some younger players , and with no appetizing contract offers awaiting him , Niedermayer contemplated going to Russia , to play in the KHL , with CSKA Moscow .
“ I thought that was something we were going to have to entertain , was maybe going to Europe , ’’ Niedermayer said on a conference call Friday afternoon .
“ It was close , but I ’m happy to be a New Jersey Devil . ’’
A half - decade ago , Lamoriello tried to acquire Rob Niedermayer in the hopes that might convince Scott Niedermayer to stay with the Devils .
That did n’t happen , of course .
Rob Niedermayer stayed in Anaheim , Scott Niedermayer signed there after the NHL lockout as a free agent , and the brothers won the Stanley Cup together with the Ducks in 2007 .
Rob Niedermayer said he spoke to his brother Friday morning about his new contract .
“ It was helpful , for sure , ’’ he said .
Niedermayer , 6 - 2 , 200 , figures to help most as a checker for the Devils .
He has made a living the past few years as a checking line forward .
“ My role with Anaheim the past few years has been to try to shut down the other team ’s top line , ’’ Niedermayer said .
“ He ’s a good two - way pro , has been for a long time , ’’ said Brendan Shanahan , who played against Niedermayer for years in the Western Conference .
“ I played against him — he ’s an honest player , he works hard .
I think he plays his best hockey in the playoffs . ’’
Niedermayer has 17 goals and 39 points in 104 career playoff games .
Lamoriello said Niedermayer ’s arrival would not necessarily affect the plan to move Patrik Elias from left wing to center .
But coach Jacques Lemaire admitted that if Niedermayer , who has been a center for all but the last few years of his career , plays center for the Devils , that might affect the plans for Elias .
“ Hmm . I do n’t know now .
A lot of things could change , ’’ Lemaire said .
Lamoriello was asked whether Niedermayer ’s arrival means Rod Pelley — who had been penciled in to take over the checking center position vacated by the departed John Madden — is out of the picture .
Lamoriello insisted that was not the case .
“ You know , he ’s playing well , ’’ Lamoriello said of Pelley .
“ When you have a chance to get better , you have to do that . ’’
Niedermayer called it “ ironic ’ ’ that he is now in New Jersey , where his brother played 12 seasons before leaving to sign with Anaheim in 2005 .
Scott Niedermayer signed a one - year contract for this season with Anaheim .
But Rob Niedermayer said one of the reasons he chose to come to New Jersey was because he believes the team can be a Stanley Cup contender .
“ That was something that really drew me to signing with Jersey , ’’ he said .
“ I ’m at a stage of my career where the Stanley Cup is the main concern .
And I think New Jersey has a real chance .
And that ’s what drew me here . ’’
NOTES
Lamoriello said tryout forward Andrew Peters
has agreed to a contract .
Mike Mottau and Mark Fraser ,
who both left Thursday ’s game because of injury , did not practice .
Both were described as “ sore ’’ by Lamoriello .
Linky :
First up , we have Justin Jones , age 16 , who may have a future as a Daily Show writer :
Obama 's speech was just dripping with socialist values , especially when he told kids " I hope you 'll all wash your hands a lot , and stay home from school when you do n't feel well , so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter . "
Oh , and the part about students setting goals for their education and asking for help when they worry they wo n't succeed ?
He is stealing the words right out of Karl Marx 's mouth . [ snip ]
The main message — do n't give up .
When life gives you lemons , make lemonade .
In these hard times , there is no better advice that the president could give to children .
Unless , of course , he tells them they better share all the profits they get from that lemonade .
The sarcasm is strong in this one .
The conversion to Obamazombie is complete !
Next up , Rachel Lubitz , age 17 , who proves that theory that adults telling kids not to do something will want to make them do it even more :
What I would most like to applaud President Obama on is taking the time to look at this new generation from ages 5 to 18 and letting us know that he cares .
The last time a President has gathered up the courage to do a thing like this was in the ' 80s with the first George Bush .
Obama was also able to make the right wing news media whine and moan on for weeks and weeks about a speech about staying in school and succeeding .
He made them look like overreacting schoolgirls jealous of the cheerleader with the quarterback boyfriend , and anyone who can do that has a friend in me .

Back when I was in high school , I developed a hobby of making various types of alcoholic beverages from raw materials that I could actually buy legally .
This is n’t to say that what I did with them was legal , but I luckily made it to age 21 without ever getting caught .
I started out by fermenting sugar water , which is ridiculously simple and is the epitome of frugality .
Eventually , I advanced to making wine from frozen juice concentrates , following a similar process .
I will describe both of these methods , providing a basic formula that can be used to make your own variations , if you choose to be creative .
Just follow these simple steps , and you ’ll be well on your way to becoming a vintner ( or to drunkenness ) .
Materials
Most importantly , you will need yeast , which is what actually produces the ethanol .
There are many types of yeasts , including those that are used specifically for making alcoholic beverages , but they are somewhat difficult to find in most grocery stores .
It is much easier and cheaper to just use active dry baker ’s yeast if you ’re willing to sacrifice a bit of quality .
The second thing you will need is sugar , which the yeast will convert into alcohol , once it is activated .
You will also need some type of juice , unless you ’re in the mood for some thrifty “ sugar wine , ” using water instead of juice .
Whether you choose to use regular juice ( one gallon ) or the frozen concentrated kind ( two cans ) , you should make sure that it does n’t contain any artificial preservatives , which would prevent fermentation .
Finally you will need a gallon - sized jug or two and a balloon that can be pulled snugly around the mouth of the jug ( I ’ll explain that later ) .
Brewing Process
First and foremost , you must make sure everything is sterile and squeaky clean to avoid bacterial denaturization .
If you bought a jug of juice or a gallon of water , then it should already be sterile .
Just be careful not to leave it exposed to the air for too long without the cap on .
Next , the sugar must be dissolved .
If you are using a gallon of juice , pour yourself a glass to make room in the jug , and add about a cup of sugar to the jug .
If you bought the frozen concentrate , thaw it out and add it to a half gallon of hot water , along with two cups of sugar to your jug .
If you ’re making sugar wine , use more water and about 3 cups of sugar .
After this , the yeast must be activated and added to the mixture , once it has cooled down to about room temperature .
You could always take your chances and simply add the yeast packet to the jug , but it would be smarter to follow the instructions on the packet to activate it first .
If you do n’t know how to do this , just add the yeast to a few tablespoons of warm water and a teaspoon of sugar , and stir it until everything dissolves .
Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it starts to froth up , then add it to the rest of the jug mixture .
Make sure the cap is screwed on tight , then shake it up until everything is thoroughly dissolved .
Now , the balloon comes into play .
Slightly unscrew the cap of the jug just enough to be able to let air out , then pull the mouth of the balloon down over the cap and all .
Then you will need to poke a tiny hole in the thickest part of the balloon with a needle or something that ’s equally thin .
When the yeast begins to ferment the concoction , it will start to bubble up with CO2 gas , which needs a way to escape the jug without exposing it ’s contents to the air , hence the balloon .
We all know what the world 's worst industrial disaster was : the gas leak from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal in central India .
On the night of 2 December 1984 , the creaky pesticides plant , which was lacking a number of basic safeguards , released a cloud of methyl isocyanate , phosgene and other gases over a densely populated city .
This poison gas killed thousands of people – some immediately , many others in the years that followed .
The death toll so far appears to be around 25,000 .
Hundreds of thousands of others were harmed , in many cases permanently .
The 25th anniversary falls in just over two months .
I mentioned it in my column last week , in relation to the Trafigura waste dumping scandal .
But until I received a letter about it last week , I had no idea just how little had been done to ensure that the remaining poison spread no further .
You might have imagined that after the global outrage this disaster caused , and the way in which Bhopal has become shorthand for corporate malfeasance and insouciance , that the site of this great crime would have been cleaned up and sorted out as quickly as possible .
That the plant , which was closed after the gas leak , would either have been demolished and removed or cleaned up and turned into a memorial for the victims .
You'd be wrong .
As the Bhopal Medical Appeal reminds us , the plant has instead simply been abandoned .
Hundreds of tonnes of deadly chemicals have been left there – in open pits or just piled on the ground – to leach into the water supply , where they continue to poison people to this day , causing cancer and foetal malformations , among other horrible effects .
The chemicals include deadly pesticides and their even deadlier precursors .
After drinking half a glass of water that the people of the city drink every day , the author Dominique Lapierre reported that " my mouth , my throat , my tongue instantly got on fire , while my arms and legs suffered an immediate skin rash .
This was the simple manifestation of what men , women and children have to endure daily , some 18 years after the tragedy . "
Seven years on , nothing has changed .
There has been no cleanup , no attempt to prevent the leakage from the site that takes place during every monsoon .
In 1994 , Union Carbide ( owned by Dow Chemical since 2001 ) sold the company 's Indian subsidiary , and hence ( or so it claims ) divested itself of all responsibility for the plant , the disaster and its aftermath .
The Indian government also appears to have washed its hands of the plant .
The people of Bhopal , who have already suffered so hideously , are being poisoned all over again .
Has nothing been learned ?
Are Indian lives considered so cheap that even the people of Bhopal , who are owed so much , can be treated like vermin ?
For how much longer will we stand by and let this horror continue ?

Volunteers involved in the search for British backpacker Jamie Neale in the Blue Mountains say they have not received any donations from the teenager , but are not seeking payment .
Mr Neale , 19 , says he lived off bush tucker , including seeds and weeds , and kept warm under strips of bark when he lost his way during a bushwalk in the New South Wales Blue Mountains on July 3 .
After 12 days stranded in the bush Mr Neale walked into a campsite and was taken into the care of hikers who took him to safety .
He spent two nights in hospital after the ordeal .
Mr Neale appeared on the Nine Network 's 60 Minutes program , which paid him $ 200,000 for his story .
The teenager and his father Richard Cass signed with celebrity agent Sean Anderson , who said the pair intended to donate some of the money to his rescuers .
A NSW State Emergency Service ( SES ) spokesman said the organisation had not received any money from Mr Neale .
" The last I had heard earlier in the week , there had been no payment to the SES and nor would we be seeking one , " the spokesman said .
" Our volunteers are just pleased to have achieved a good result in this case and that the person was found and reunited with his family .
" If Mr Neale or other people in these circumstances seek to get some financial gain out of the incident then that 's a matter for them . "
A Rural Fire Service spokesman said Mr Neale had not made a donation , but the volunteers do n't do their job for the money and were not expecting or waiting for payment .
There are also reports the teenager has cut his father out of the television deal .
The pair apparently had a fall - out when Mr Neale said he was keeping the money , UK newspaper The Sun reported .
Mr Anderson refused to comment on The Sun 's story but confirmed his company , 22 Management , is still looking after Mr Neale 's Australian interests .

Last night after the close , the major exchanges released their mid-month short interest data , or as some would say , their lack of short interest data .
As shown in the chart below , the average short interest as a percentage of float for stocks in the S&P 1500 is currently at 6.9 % .
This is the lowest level since February 2007 , when the average was 6.6 % .
In 2008 , it was the bulls who argued that high levels of short interest were a reason the market should rally .
With the recent data , however , it is now the bears who will argue that low levels of short interest suggest that investors are now too bullish .

Today , Zeldman issued an ultimatum that we ’ve all been feeling recently :
Chrome needs to support @font - face immediately .
— Jeffrey Zeldman ( @zeldman ) September 25 , 2009
It ’s true , every major browser supports @font - face :
Internet Explorer : since IE5
Firefox : since FF3.5
Safari : since Safari 3.2
Opera : since Opera 10
But ..
Google Chrome currently does not enable @font - face linking to ttf and otf .
It actually does support SVG fonts in a @font - face declaration .
View this demo in Chrome or Chromium to see svg fonts in action .
Divya has some great research around fonts and SVG if you ’re interested in more .
You can turn it on , at will
You can enable web fonts with an executable switch : −−enable - remote - fonts .
On Windows , you can tweak the shortcut path , like so .
With Chromium on OS X , you use Terminal to launch :
1 /Applications / Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --enable-remote-fonts
With proper Google Chrome on OS X , you need to escape the spaces :
1 / Applications / Google \ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google \ Chrome --enable -remote- fonts
With Chromium on Linux [ 1 ] :
1 chromium - browser -- enable - plugins --enable - remote - fonts %U
Once you enable it , all @font - face stuff works just as you ’d expect , including the bulletproof @font - face syntax [ demo ] and the Nice Web Type demos .
But we need web fonts working by default
Wait , so why is this wonderful feature disabled by default ?
Security review .
Ian Fette , the program manager of Chrome , indicated that they need to explore how do webfonts in a “ reasonably safe manner ” .
So that ’s the holdup .
This ticket on the Chromium bug tracker tracks the feature being enabled by default .
Okay , so when do we get our toy ?
Soon , in fact !
Chrome is my default browser , so my patience on this issue ran dry recently .
I emailed Takuya , an engineer at Google Japan , who is working on this and he said :
We are almost done .
The code is under review internally within Google .
I ’m expecting to make it public no later than a week or so .
So I expect we ’ll be seeing @font - face support enabled by default in the Chrome dev builds soon .
Based on their release schedule I think it ’ll be near the end of the year when we see it in Chrome stable .
That ’s good news ; let ’s hope we see it sooner .
Health care reform is quickly becoming the White House 's biggest battle of the year .
And with so many players involved — from family doctors to the unions — it can be difficult to sort out who 's on board with health care reform and who is n't .
That 's why we came up with this handy guide to the myriad players in the health care debate .
It 's not comprehensive — there are too many stakeholders to count — but it provides an overview of where the most influential interest groups come down on the issue .
If President Barack Obama had his druthers , he'd like us to think support for health care reform is rock - solid among hospitals , doctors , nurses and the insurance industry .
But we found it 's not so straightforward , an issue we explore in this Truth - o - Meter item .
We gave Obama a Mostly True for saying that , " doctors , nurses , hospitals , even the pharmaceutical industry , ( and ) AARP " say that health reform " makes sense to do . "
That 's because there 's a big difference between supporting health care reform generally , which is something nearly all health care professionals do , and supporting either the House or Senate overhauls being considered in the halls of Congress .
From our chart , you 'll be able to see that there 's actually quite a bit of division over how our health care system should be changed , if at all .
Organization Position - House Bill Position - Senate Bill American Medical Association Supports the bill because it would require coverage for all and include financial assistance for those who need it ; because it would end denials of coverage based on pre-existing conditions ; and because it would provide more money for primary care services .
Some AMA members , including associations in Alabama and Texas , do n't support the bill because of the public option .
No position American Hospital Association , represents hospitals .
No position on either bill , but opposes an administration proposal to create an independent group to study Medicaid costs because rural hospitals would fare the worst .
No position No position American Nurses Association Supports the bill for providing coverage for all , and because it would include a public option .
The bill also includes funding for more nurses .
No position AARP , represents people over 50 and Medicare patients Supports the bill because it would provide coverage for people who cannot afford it , and would end coverage denial based on pre-existing conditions .
Also , the bill would help Medicare patients who do not qualify for the prescription drug benefit .
Supports a bill passed by the Senate HELP committee because it would end discriminatory practices and because it would limit premiums and out - of - pocket expenses .
However , AARP is concerned that the bill would not put some generic drugs on the market fast enough .
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , PhRMA , represents drug companies .
Opposes the bill because expanding the prescription drug benefit to more Medicare patients would " constitute a tax increase on seniors because of the resulting increase in their monthly premiums . "
Still , PhRMA considers the bill progress toward " patient - centered health care reform . "
Supports the Senate bill because it addresses affordable health care and also protects patents on some brand name drugs .
Mayo Clinic , a renowned hospital that supports Obama 's call for health care reform
Says the bill must emphasize quality over quantity .
Medicare should pay based on results , not procedures , which is why Mayo supports the administration plan for an independent review of the Medicare system .
No position U.S. Chambers of Commerce .
We found no specific position on either bill , but generally opposes a public option that " would have an unfair advantage over private plans , eventually crowding them out of the market . "
It also opposes requiring smaller businesses to pay for employee health care .
No position No position America 's Health Insurance Plan , represents health care insurers .
Supports health care reform , but opposes the public or government - run option that it says would push private plans out of business and leave many uncovered .
No position Service Employees International Union Supports the bill because it believes the public option would increase competition and drive down health care costs .
Supports the Senate bill because it would include a public plan .
American Academy of Family Physicians Supports the bill because it would require everyone to have insurance and would provide coverage even with pre-exisiting conditions .
The bill includes incentives for general practitioners , who may prevent costly procedures through early treatment , but the group says a 5 percent bonus for general practitioners may not be enough to attract more medical students to the field .
The group wants 10 percent .

Common error messages
*
This is the tex prompt .
Latex decided your document was n't finished , possibly because you forgot an \end {document} .
" File `packagename.sty ' not found . "
You are trying to use a package that is n't installed .
You can ask your sysadmin to install it globally , or install it in your home directory .
See a section above about package installation
" \begin {something} ended by \end {somethingelse} "
You either did n't properly nest environments , possibly because you misspelled an environment name in an \end{} .
" Can only be used in preamble "
Something , like usepackage , author definition , bibliography style settings , color declarations , etc. that should happen after \documentclass and before begin{document} happened elsewhere , probably inside the document text .
" destination with the same identifier ( name{page.1} ) has been already used , duplicate ignored "
This is triggered by hyperref creating index links to numbered pages when you use \pagenumbering ( for example to get roman - numeral pages ( the book class does this implicitly ) .
Specifically , this happens when page numbering is reset , which means that there is more than one page with the same number , in which case you do n't have a simple 1 - to - whatever numbering anymore and the page number displayed on a page will often differ from the how - manieth page it is in the actual document .
If that 's okay / intended , you usually want to tell hyperref to create links and mention pages according to the way they are named ( e.g. ii ( 4 of 20 ) ) , by adding two options to hyperref : plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels .
If you switch to arabic and back , you will still likely have the title page be ( arabic ) 1 , the TOC and such i to whatever , and then the main content 1 to whatever -- so you 'll still have one duplicate , for 1 .
See also this explanation , this mention and more .
" Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr "
You have more & s in table data than you specified you have columns in the \begin{tabular} {columnspec} argument .
Can easily mean you forgot a \\ somewhere .
" Fatal format file error ; I 'm stymied "
This usually means that TeX 's files are in the wrong format after an install or upgrade .
Regularly a fmtutil -- all will fix this .
In my case I had upgraded to a slightly buggy beta ( ...version of teTeX ) .
A slight downgrade followed by a fmutil -- all fixed it .
See also pages like this .
" File ended while scanning use of ... "
Usually means a missing } somewhere .
" Illegal character in array arg "
You used a bad alignment letter ( as in l , r , c , and so on ) in the tabular column specification .
" Illegal unit of measure "
You always need units when specifying a length , even for zero lengths .
Missing \endcsname inserted
A TeX error that can mean various things , including accidentally using a backslash in an environment name , or forgetting a required argument in adjacent commands .
" Misplaced
oalign "
One reason is that you are using colortab with LCC / ECC and there is an empty line somewhere between the LCC and ECC .
" Misplaced \omit "
Seems to have many causes , but seems to usually be caused by a \multicolumn .
In my case I had a \cellcolor right before it , and multicolumns seem to be sensitive about the commands right before it .
" Missing } inserted "
Just that - an unclosed command ( or range ) .
Can also mean a missing obligatory argument .
" Missing \cr inserted "
Can mean various typos , such as a } too much .
" Missing $ inserted "
Can mean an unclosed math mode range ( like Costs $ 20 . ) , or something that should only appear in math mode , such as \ : and \ And .
" Missing delimiter "
Can be various types of typo , such as \left { when you meant \left\ { or \right when you want \right .
" Missing number , treated as zero "
Tex expects a number and you probably gave it either a string or nothing .
May mean you have a typo ( e.g. a missing \ ) in a command that should return a number .
" Overfull \hbox " and " Underfull \hbox "
Overfull and underfull hbox messages ususally come from TeX's perfectionistic word spacing / line breaking logic .
This is rarely visually problematic , though in some cases it is .
You can make TeX less strict by telling it to be \sloppy
If it seems TeX does n't know how to hyphenate a word you can tell it how , in the prelude : \hyphenation { man - u - script} , or inline : man\ - u\ - script .
Both only inform latex of how to hyphenate , and neiter has any visual effect until latex decides to hyphenate .
" Overfull \vbox " and " Underfull \vbox "
Like the hbox variants , but vertically .
Mostly seems to happen on when TeX can't really fit ( long , unbroken ) paragraphs well .
Also happens when floats are very high and wo n't fit on a page .
" Package array Error : Illegal pream - token ( 1 ) : `c ' used . "
Happens when you enter an illegal preamble character in \multicolumn ( you may be thinking of \multirow , where a column size goes in the second argument ) .
" Package inputenc Error : Unicode char \u8 : âsomething not set up for use with LaTeX "
inputenc allows you to use non-ASCII characters , and have TeX handle the necessary translation into TeX commands .
There are a metric ton of potential characters .
While most of the basics are covered , there are characters it does n't yet know about , many of which seem to be the ones more ambiguous in use , i.e. for which the right TeX depends somewhat on how you are using the characters , such as with some of the dozen or two existing quotation mark alternatives .
After you decide the mapping from Unicode codepoint to TeX you want , you must declare them , ading them to the document 's prologue , or perhaps to a file you include in every document you need the mapping in .
Examples :
% ' low single comma quotation mark '
\ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 2019 }{ ' } % accent acute , probably used as quote character \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 00B4 }{ ' } % ' double low - 9 quotation mark '
\ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 201E }{ `` } % some mathematical things : \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 00B1 }{ \ensuremath { \pm }} % plus- minus sign \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 00 BC }{ \ensuremath { \stackrel { 1 }{ 4 }}} % French / belgian / german angle - bracket quotation marks \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 00 ab }{ \lfqq } % or \guillemotleft ?
\ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 00 bb }{ \frqq } % or \guillemotright ?
\ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 2039 }{ \lfq } \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 203a }{ \frq } \ DeclareUnicodeCharacter { 20 ac }{ \euro } % from the eurosym package
The error does n't tell you the code point it 's missing , though .
One solution is to less the .tex or .log file .
Since it 'll likely be UTF - 8 , which uses runs of high bytes , it should be shown like < E2 > < 80 > < 9E > .
To decode this into the codepoint , use some unicode tool that allows input as hexadecimal UTF8 .
I use my own .
Googling for the byte sequence may also work ( try some variations , such as adding and removing spaces between bytes ) .
" Paragraph ended before \ somecommand was complete "
Tends to mean you forgot to close an argument , used a bracket ) instead of a curly bracket } or some such thing .
May also mean there is an implicit paragraph ( empty line ) inside a range ( ranges can be implicit , as with \ LCC to \ ECC in colortab ) .
" Runaway argument "
Tends to mean you forgot to end a command argument ( forgot a } ) ( the error appears mostly when there in a paragraph in what with this typo is inside the argument ) , or a mandatory argument is missing .
" Token not allowed in a PDFDocEncoded string "
Usually means that you are using hyperref 's bookmark option and the titles sent to those bookmarks contain TeX , which they should n't .
One solution is to disable bookmarks , another is to specify one string for typesetting , another for the according bookmark entry ; see pages on hyperref that mention \texorpdfstring .
" Undefined control sequence . "
You are using a command that is not defined .
Tends to mean a package was not included , you misspelled the command , or that you used a driver - specific command with a driver that does not support it and so does n't define it ( e.g. \ c@lor@to@ps in pdftex ) .
" Environment align undefined . "
The align environment is defined in the amsmath package , so include that .
Alternatively , emulate the align with a simple table .
Printing / conversion
" lpr : Error - scheduler not responding ! "
The dvips utility may be configured to send the PostScript it generates directly to the printer ( it 's a semi - default configuration ) , which means that a printer daemon must be accessible when you call dvips .
( an incorrectly set CUPS_SERVER or an incomplete CUPS configuration can also cause this - or similar for other print servers )
If , like most people , you just want a postscript file , explicitly tell dvips to write to a file ( - o outputfile ) , or change its configuration file ( named config.ps .
It will likely currently have a line like o |lpr )
" lpr : Error - no default destination available . "
Print server is available ( see dvips behaviour notes in the last entry ) but it has no ( default ) printer defined .
If you actually meant to print , you can set a default printer ( for the current user ) using lpoptions -d printername .
If you want a postscript file , explicitly ask for one , or configure dvips to write files by default .
Tex programming / package bugs
" Illegal parameter number in definition "
Happens when you defined a command with e.g. one parameter and you refer to parameter 2 .
" Command ... already defined "
Code tried to create a command or environment where one already existed under that name .
If this is your own code , try giving it another name , or if you mean to override behaviour , use the proper renew - type command .
We review flows of dense cohesionless granular materials , with a special focus on the question of constitutive equations .
We first discuss the existence of a dense flow regime characterized by enduring contacts .
We then emphasize that dimensional analysis strongly constrains the relation between stresses and shear rates , and show that results from experiments and simulations in different configurations support a description in terms of a frictional visco - plastic constitutive law .
We then discuss the successes and limitations of this empirical rheology in light of recent alternative theoretical approaches .
Finally , we briefly present depth - averaged methods developed for free surface granular flows .
September 11 – SWAT - style raids on 14 medical marijuana outlets in the San Diego area on September 9 resulted in 31 arrests , including a man in a wheelchair who was wrestled into a police car .
The action was the result of a four - month investigation by the San Diego district attorney ’s office , which claims the collectives were operating for profit in violation of the Attorney General ’s guidelines .
The raids came the day after the San Diego Board of Supervisors voted to convene a task force on medical marijuana , and weeks after the county finally began issuing medical marijuana I.D. cards to patients and caregivers , after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a case brought by the county against the state program .
Patients on - site at the raids were detained and handcuffed , and one wheelchair bound collective member was dragged into a police car .
The US DEA was present at some of the raids , and federal charges have reportedly been filed against two people , which means 5 - 10 year mandatory minimum sentences are possible even for small players .
Other than a raid at a San Francisco collective in March , one in Los Angeles in August , and a Lake County case that originated in 2005 , these are the first raids since Obama ’s Attorney General Eric Holder announced that his administration would not prioritize medical marijuana cases .
Medical marijuana collectives have proliferated since that announcement .
Oakland , CA was the first in the nation to vote in an extra sales tax for medical marijuana outlets in July , when the state Board of Equalization issued a report estimating legalization would net the state $ 1.38 billion in yearly tax revenues .
The City Councils of Los Angeles and Sacramento are both considering .
“ Where other cities are profiting from medical cannabis business , San Diego is wasting taxpayers ’ money on criminal arrests and prosecution , ” said California NORML director Dale Gieringer .

San Diego has long been the most hostile region of the state against marijuana .
A sting operation with undercover officers posing as patients nabbed Eugene Davidovich and others on state charges in continuing court actions .
The region has also cracked down on paraphernalia shops .
San Diego District Attorney Press Release
The legal basis for the DA ’s claims are unclear .
She states that the AG ’s guidelines require “ acquiring marijuana only from their members ” .
However there is nothing in state ( or federal ) law restricting acquisition or purchase of marijuana by anyone ; the law only prohibits illicit possession , and under Prop. 215 patients and caregivers are legally entitled to possess .
The DA also states that “ The law does not allow a patient ’s ‘ primary caregiver ’ to be a ‘ dispensary ’ . ”
While this is true , it is also true that the law allows legal patient “ collectives ” and “ cooperatives ” to operate dispensaries .
Even if some of the targeted dispensaries were illegally organized as “ primary caregivers ” rather than collectives , “ this does n’t justify the DA ’s strongarm tactics in sending in armed cops unannounced to raid , arrest and terrorize personnel and vandalize the premises , ” said Gieringer .
Perversely , police ripped out security cameras , even though one of their big supposed problems with cannabis dispensaries is lack of adequate security .
Patti Walker , a medical marijuana patient at Beneficial Care Collective in downtown San Diego said an officer pointed a shotgun at her face before she was handcuffed , arrested and taken to county jail , where she was “ treated like a filthy mutt . ”
The 20 - year - old college student at SDSU said she volunteers at animal shelters and senior homes regularly , and aspires to join the Peace Corps after graduation .
“ I ’ve had people cry on my shoulder about the pain and suffering they went through everyday of their lives and how grateful they were to have a place like our collective to go to , ” Walker wrote in an email .
“ I helped people with AIDS , cancer , depression , etc. who did n’t want to poison themselves with pills and chemicals , people whose lives were changed by the use of medical marijuana and there I sat in a jail cell all night for a victimless crime . ”
Walker said she and her fellow workers are all being charged with felony sale of MJ .

Justin Barrett , the Boston police officer suspended from the force for his e-mail likening Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , to a “ banana - eating jungle monkey , ’’ has filed a lawsuit against the Police Department , police commissioner , and mayor , saying the city violated his civil and due process rights .
The 18 - page lawsuit accuses the three parties of “ conspiring to intentionally inflict emotional distress and conspiring to intentionally interfere with the property rights , due process rights , and civil rights of the plaintiff . ’’
Barrett added to the controversy surrounding last month ’s arrest of Gates at his home in Cambridge , when he responded to a column by The Boston Globe ’s Yvonne Abraham , using the racial slurs in reference to Gates .
When police officials learned of the biting missive , they quickly moved to fire him .
Later , during a national campaign to save his job , Barrett told CNN he is not a racist and “ treats everyone with dignity and respect . ’’
Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis suspended Barrett last Wednesday , stripping him of his badge and firearm and later released a statement calling the officer ’s remarks “ racist and inflammatory .
“ These racist opinions and feelings have no place in this department or in our society and will not be tolerated , ’’ Davis said .
Mayor Thomas M. Menino called for Barrett ’s dismissal , saying : “ He ’s gone .
G - O - N - E. ’’
Representatives of both the mayor and commissioner declined to comment yesterday on the pending litigation .
According to the lawsuit , the mayor and commissioner ’s actions caused Barrett pain and suffering , mental anguish , emotional distress , posttraumatic stress , sleeplessness , indignities and embarrassment , degradation , injury to reputation , and restrictions on personal freedom .
Barrett , on the police force for two years , requested that they be enjoined from decreasing , terminating , or withholding any wages .
He also asked for money damages to compensate for the emotional and physical pain he suffered , attorney ’s fees , and punitive damages .
The suit also contends that Davis and Menino ’s treatment of the officer is “ disproportionate to the allegations against Officer Barrett given he has not had any meaningful opportunity to prepare any defense to the allegations based on [ their ] statements . ’’
Barrett had no prior disciplinary history ; and no investigation has begun for his termination , but Davis said at a press conference last Thursday that a hearing would be scheduled within the next 10 days .
Barrett said in the lawsuit that Davis and Menino ’s statements to the public in recent weeks have made it clear that he will be terminated and therefore any hearing or investigation will be tainted .
Boston police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said it was policy not to comment on pending litigation , and Menino ’s press office said they knew the suit had been filed , but had not been formally served .

Billions in bonuses for bailed - out bankers
1 August 2009
Nine major Wall Street banks that were among the biggest recipients of the US government bailout paid out nearly $ 33 billion in bonuses last year , including awards of $ 1 million or more to nearly 5,000 people , according to a report released Thursday by New York state ’s attorney general .
Six of the nine banks paid out more in bonuses than they made in profits — proving that the billions from the US Treasury went straight into the pockets of the best - paid executives and traders .
The nine banks awarded the bonuses — the largest in history — despite recording combined losses of $ 81 billion , and lining up to receive $ 165 billion in cash infusions from the US government .
Citigroup and Merrill Lynch lost $ 55 billion combined and still awarded $ 8.9 billion in bonuses .
The three most profitable firms , JP Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , awarded bonuses that amount to approximately double their 2008 profits : $ 9.6 billion in combined profits compared to $ 18 billion in bonuses .
The total bonus payout for each bank , together with the number of million - dollar - plus bonuses awarded , is as follows ( Bank of America and Merrill Lynch merged on December 31 , 2008 , so their figures are presented separately ) :
Bank Bonus total # > $ 1 m JP Morgan Chase $ 8.7 billion 1,626 Goldman Sachs $ 4.8 billion 953 Citigroup $ 5.3 billion 738 Morgan Stanley $ 4.5 billion 438 Merrill Lynch $ 3.6 billion 696 Bank of America $ 2.8 billion 200 Bank of New York Mellon $ 945 million 74 Wells Fargo Bank $ 978 million 62 State Street Bank $ 470 million 44
Of the 4,793 bonus millionaires , 836 received bonuses of more than $ 3 million apiece , and at least 40 received more than $ 10 million apiece .
The best paid banker , Citigroup ’s Andrew Hall , received $ 98.9 million for 2008 , while its CEO Vikram Pandit took in $ 38 million .
The bank itself had to be bailed out twice , with $ 45 billion in government aid .
These figures refer only to bonuses , usually paid at year ’s end , and do not include the six , seven and eight - figure salaries and other compensation paid out to the top Wall Street “ earners . ”
And the figures for 2009 are likely to be considerably higher — thanks to the run-up in the stock market generated by the bank bailout and other Obama administration handouts to the wealthy .
Goldman Sachs , for instance , has already set aside $ 11 billion for compensation , more than double its total in 2008 .
The report sheds light on the parasitic and socially destructive role of the American financial aristocracy .
What did these 5,000 gentlemen and ladies accomplish in 2008 to justify their million - dollar paydays ?
They played the central role in the greatest financial collapse in the history of the world , one which has wiped out untold tens of trillions of dollars in wealth , bankrupted giant corporations and entire countries , and plunged the world into the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression .
One could easily justify arresting the lot of them and parading them before television cameras as a public demonstration of the utterly irrational character of contemporary capitalism .
But these are the best - paid and most highly valued servants of the super - rich , the ones whose past financial manipulations added billions to the wealth of the billionaires .
Accordingly , they are to be protected from the outrage felt by the vast majority of the population .
The state attorney general ’s report does not name a single one of the 4,793 bonus millionaires , citing “ privacy ” considerations .
No such discretion is observed for small businessmen compelled to close their doors , homeowners foreclosed and evicted , or workers who lose their jobs and must file for bankruptcy .
All these names can be found easily enough on the Internet .
Compared to these figures , the $ 165 million in bonuses that were allocated by bankrupt insurance giant AIG , which created a public furor in March and led Obama to intervene to block legislation limiting bankers ’ pay , is a drop in the bucket .
The press coverage of the bank bonuses , particularly on the television networks , was notably restrained , particularly coming amid reports of growing unemployment and social misery ( the New York Times carried the bonus story side by side with a report on homeless people living in tents ) .
What could one do with the $ 33 billion wasted on bonuses to the Wall Street mafia ?
The sum is one - third larger than the budget deficit for California , which has compelled widespread cutbacks , furloughs and elimination of vital social benefits for millions in the most populous US state .
According to one study , total compensation at the nine banks for this year , 2009 , will hit $ 156 billion , more than the projected $ 139.2 billion in budget deficits of all 50 states combined , for the fiscal year that began July 1 .
This study estimates that while the aggregate net income of the nine firms will fall from $ 255 billion in 2006 to $ 211 billion this year , their aggregate compensation will rise from $ 143 billion to $ 156 billion .
In other words , the Wall Street elite will see its personal income rise , even though the income of the institutions they control declines , and the wider economy plunges into depression .
This narrow social layer that controls the financial levers stands as an absolute obstacle to any rational allocation and development of society ’s resources .
In fact , in its blind greed and obsession with self - enrichment , it undermines the viability of the very firms it dominates .
Both the Bush administration last year and the Obama administration today are the political servants of this corrupt , parasitic social layer .
It was to protect the interests of a few hundred billionaires and a few thousand Wall Street bankers and traders that Democrats and Republicans joined forces last year to push through the $ 700 billion bailout , the first in a series of raids on the Treasury which have mortgaged the entire resources of the country to the financial oligarchy .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs delivered the Obama administration ’s response to the Wall Street bonus report .
“ The president continues to believe that the American people do n’t begrudge people making money for what they do , ” he told the media .
This slavishness before Wall Street is in sharp contrast to the ruthless demands of the White House and its “ czars ” for the destruction of auto workers ’ jobs , the closing of auto dealerships , and the implementation of austerity policies by every state and municipality .
Only three days before the bonus report , Obama gave a lengthy interview to the editors of BusinessWeek magazine for a cover story assuring Corporate America that he was not anti-business .
“ My working assumption has always been , if the market could do it better , have the market do it , ” he said .
“ I have very little confidence , as I said , in some sort of command - and - control regulatory regime .
I think businesses create jobs .
And I ’m a big believer in the profit motive ... ”
Obama is a political tool of the corporate and financial elite , and his policies are dispelling whatever illusions were promoted among working people by the election campaign and the media celebration of the election of the first African - American president .
The working class must break with the Democratic Party and build an independent political movement to defend its own class interests .
At the forefront of this struggle must be the demand to break the grip of the financial mafia over American society .
The nine big banks profiled in the bonus report , and the rest of the major financial institutions , must be placed under the ownership and democratic control of the American people as a whole .
The resources plundered by this predatory social layer must be taken back and used to meet social needs — for jobs , education , health care , the repair of the social infrastructure and the natural environment .
A socialist policy of nationalization of the banks and the abolition of the stock exchange and all other forms of parasitic financial swindling is the only answer to the criminality and greed revealed in the Wall Street bonuses .

Not everyone in the coalition wants the deal blocked , some want revisions
Three technology heavyweights are joining a coalition to fight Google 's attempt to create what could be the world 's largest virtual library .
Amazon , Microsoft and Yahoo will sign up to the Open Book Alliance being spearheaded by the Internet Archive .
They oppose a legal settlement that could make Google the main source for many online works .
" Google is trying to monopolise the library system , " the Internet Archive 's founder Brewster Kahle told BBC News .
" If this deal goes ahead , they 're making a real shot at being ' the ' library and the only library . "
Back in 2008 , the search giant reached an agreement with publishers and authors to settle two lawsuits that charged the company with copyright infringement for the unauthorised scanning of books .
In that settlement , Google agreed to pay $ 125 m ( £ 76 m ) to create a Book Rights Registry , where authors and publishers could register works and receive compensation .
Authors and publishers would get 70 % from the sale of these books with Google keeping the remaining 30 % .
Google would also be given the right to digitise orphan works .
These are works whose rights - holders are unknown , and are believed to make up an estimated 50 - 70 % of books published after 1923 .
Comments on the deal have to be lodged by 4 September .
In early October , a judge in the Southern district of New York will consider whether or not to approve the class - action suit .
In a separate development , the US Department of Justice is conducting an anti-trust investigation into the impact of the agreement .
' Open access ' Critics have claimed the settlement will transform the future of the book industry and of public access to the cultural heritage of mankind embodied in books .
The Internet Archive scans around 1000 books a day at 10 cents a page " The techniques we have built up since the enlightenment of having open access , public support for libraries , lots of different organisational structures , lots of distributed ownership of books that can be exchanged , resold and repackaged in different ways - all of that is being thrown out in this particular approach , " warned Mr Kahle .
The non-profit Internet Archive has long been a vocal opponent of this agreement .
It is also in the business of scanning books and has digitised over half a million of them to date .
All are available free .
As the 4 September deadline approaches , the number of groups and organisations voicing their opposition is growing .
But with three of the world 's best - known technology companies joining the chorus , the Open Book Alliance can expect to make headlines the world over .
Microsoft and Yahoo have confirmed their participation .
However , Amazon has so far declined to comment because the alliance has not yet been formally launched .
" All of us in the coalition are oriented to foster a vision for a more competitive marketplace for books , " said Peter Brantley , the Internet Archive 's director of access .
" We feel that if approved , Google would earn a court - sanctioned monopoly and the exploitation of a comprehensive collection of books from the 20th Century . "
' Trust '
Much of the focus of the proposed settlement has been on anti-trust and anti-competitive concerns , but just as many are worried about privacy .
Privacy is a big concern for critics
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , the ACLU of Northern California and the Consumer Watchdog advocacy group wrote to Google to ask the company to " assure Americans that Google will maintain the security and freedom that library patrons have long had : to read and learn about anything ... without worrying that someone is looking over their shoulder or could retrace their steps " .
" We simply do n't like the settlement in its current form , " said Consumer Watchdog advocate John Simpson .
" There are serious questions about privacy and Google seems to be taking the view ' let us put this in place and we will do the right thing down the road ' .
That is simply not good enough . "
The American Libraries Association ( ALA ) agrees .
" We do think the product in essence is good but the proposed settlement asks us to trust Google and the other parties a little too much , " the ALA 's associate director Corey Williams told BBC News .
" When it comes to privacy , the agreement is silent on the issue and with regard to what Google intends to do with the data it collects .
It 's a great idea but it requires more trust than I think we feel comfortable being able to extend at this point , " said Ms Williams .
' Brave new world '
In its defence , Google has argued that the deal brings great benefits to authors and will make millions of out - of - print books widely available online and in libraries .
In a statement , the company said : " The Google Books settlement is injecting more competition into the digital books space , so it 's understandable why our competitors might fight hard to prevent more competition . "
The author said she is not surprised by the reaction to the settlment Despite the increasing tide of criticism over the settlement , there are some who believe there is not that much to fear .
Michelle Richmond is the author of New York Times best seller The Year of Fog , which is also being turned into a movie starring Rachel Weiss .
" The thing I keep hearing from authors is ' I do n't know what this settlement really means ' .
But this is the brave new world and we do n't really know where it is going , " Ms Richmond told BBC News " Most authors work for so little and start from the point of we are doing this for the love it .
But when there is this company that has nothing to do with the creation of the book or its publication , I think a lot of authors are concerned about this being a portal to greater access to their work without compensation for writers . "

What follows is to a large extent an abridged version of a very illuminating article by Steve Kangas , who died under mysterious circumstances , some say because of the kind of truth he exposed in what he wrote .
This carefully footnoted and well documented article originally appeared at the American Patriot Friends Network web site .
http://www.apfn.org/apfn/mockingbird.htm.
Go there to read all the footnotes .
Included in the article that follows is a summary of one of investigative reporter Gary Webb 's last articles to appear before he too died under mysterious circumstances .
In the San Jose Mercury News , Webb alleged that the CIA was complicit in large - scale drug smuggling into the US that allowed a good percentage of the millions in drug profits to be funneled to the Contra cause in Central America .
Problem was , the smuggling operation fueled a disastrous crack explosion in L.A. and other cities , and enabled drug gangs to buy automatic weapons , sometimes from the CIA operative , Oscar Danilo Blandon , who managed the smuggling operation .
As a result , parts of L.A. became a virtual war zone and many people died .

The wealthy have always used many methods to accumulate wealth , but it was not until the mid-1970s that these methods coalesced into a superbly organized , cohesive and efficient ' machine . '
After 1975 , it became greater than the sum of its parts , a smooth flowing organization of advocacy groups , lobbyists , think tanks , conservative foundations , and PR firms that hurtled the incomes and wealth holdings of the richest 1 % , and especially the top tenth of 1 % , into the stratosphere .
The origins of this wealth concentration ' machine , ' interestingly enough , can be traced back to the CIA .
The principle creators of this wealth concentration ' machine ' were Irving Kristol , Paul Weyrich , William Simon , Richard Mellon Scaife , Frank Shakespeare , William F. Buckley , Jr. , the Rockefeller family , and others .
And almost all had CIA backgrounds .

American software company RealNetworks has been banned from selling a program that lets people make copies of their DVDs , in a US court decision that could have far - reaching implications .
After a year - long case over the legality of the company 's RealDVD software , a district court in San Francisco ruled that Real had violated America 's copyright laws and granted a preliminary injunction against Real to prevent it selling the program .
The ruling stops Real from selling RealDVD , a piece of software that allows to make back - up copies of their movie discs and save them to their computer .
Although free DVD ripping software is readily available online , Real raised the hackles of Hollywood executives in 2008 because it paid for a license to the DVD Copy Control Association , believing that it could be interpreted to allow the services they wanted to provide .
In her ruling , Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said that the complex meant that it was not illegal for consumers to copy their own DVDs – just illegal to produce a program that allowed them to do so .
" While it may well be fair use for an individual consumer to store a backup copy of a personally - owned DVD on that individual 's computer , a federal law has nonetheless made it illegal to manufacture or traffic in a device or tool that permits a consumer to make such copies . "
The case was brought by the Motion Picture Association of America - the consortium representing Hollywood studios that has become notoriously litigious in the face of unauthorised downloading and online file sharing .
Dan Glickman , the head of the MPAA , hailed the verdict .
" We are very pleased with the court 's decision , " he said .
" This is a victory for the creators and producers of motion pictures and television shows , and for the rule of law in our digital economy . "
" Judge Patel 's ruling affirms what we have known all along : Real Networks took a license to build a DVD player and instead made an illegal DVD copier . "
Campaigners had argued that consumers had the right to make personal copies of material they had legally obtained , and that Real should not be punished .
Lawyers for the MPAA , on the other hand , said that Real was breaking the terms of its license and profiting from a system that made it possible for consumers to rent or borrow movies for a nominal fee before copying them .
The court sided with the film industry , largely because it said broke a licensing agreement to access privileged details of the copy protection codes , known as the content scramble system or CSS .
Although Judge Patel earlier ruling that CSS was a trade secret – indicating the possibility that she might rule against Real – another company , Kaleidascape , had recently been ruled to have not violated the law in a similar position .
Another scheme for unscrambling the code , called DeCSS , was also challenged in court after its creation - but Jon Lech Johansen , the Norwegian teenager credited with working on the system , was acquitted by a court in Oslo .
" Real will likely appeal this ruling , " said Fred von Lohmann , an attorney with the campaign group the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" Whatever the outcome of that appeal , this ruling sends a chilling message to any technology innovator interested in delivering new products that interact with the DVDs you own . "
Real Networks , based in Seattle , said that it was " disappointed " in the ruling and would take time to examine the verdict closely before considering whether to appeal .
" We have just received the judge 's detailed ruling and are reviewing it .
After we have done so fully , we 'll determine our course of action , " the company said in a statement .
New module decisions for 2.28

Hi ,
The release team met on Sunday to see how sunburnt the various members were .
There were certainly big differences .
Andre was bright red , while some who shall stay anonymous were , hrm , untouched by the sun .
Afterwards , we managed to find a few minutes to discuss the new module proposals .
Many thanks to the people who contributed to the discussion on the list , and to the authors and maintainers of the proposed modules !
Short summary =============
In : gnome - bluetooth ( desktop ) gnome - disk - utility ( desktop ) libgdata ( external dependency ) libseed ( bindings ) DeviceKit - disks ( external dependency ) WebKit / GTK + ( external dependency ) libchamplain ( external dependency )
Out : krb5 - auth - dialog icontool General note about the hal migration : some modules ( like rhythmbox / banshee , even if not part of the GNOME modulesets ) will rely on udev in the future .
This means they will need some work for non-Linux - based OS .
Help is needed to make sure this migration goes smoothly for those platforms .
Details ======= + gnome - bluetooth ( desktop ) - good doc , even an experimental port to mallard - works great => approved => bluez becomes an approved external dependency => has a runtime dependency on obexd + gnome - disk - utility ( desktop ) - stub documentation for the palimpset utility - replaces gfloppy ( in gnome - utils , already removed ) - needs a string review ( techy ones , missing comments , etc. ) .
Matthias can work with David on it next week - Linux - only for now ( but this is more related to DeviceKit - disks ) - optional dependency for gvfs right now - provides libraries with no guarantee for API / ABI stability => approved => non-Linux - based OS wo n't be able to use it unless Device Kit - disks is ported there .
We encourage people to work on those ports to offer the best experience to GNOME users on those OS . + libgdata ( desktop ) - good api doc - required for the current version of totem youtube plugin , and maybe later by evolution - some worries about the protocol being only used by Google at the moment ( on non - free services ) - we certainly want to allow users to access their data , though - technically not needed in the desktop => approved as external dependency + krb5 - auth - dialog ( desktop ) - reactive maintainer - minimal doc - suggestion to integrate it in seahorse or gnome - keyring - no reply from the community - neat tool , but that 's not something that end users will directly install themselves .
=> rejected because it does n't really fit the desktop set => suggestion to integrate it in seahorse , though + libseed ( bindings ) - was mainly rejected because of gjs vs seed for 2.26 - gnome - js - common was created to offer a common js module between gjs and seed - still , for reasons that are independent from the gjs and seed teams , there are technical differences that makes it hard to write code that can be used with both gjs and seed - gnome - shell will likely stay with gjs , but seed people offered to port it to seed - we want people to start using js in GNOME now since it will likely play an important role for the future => approved => people should write code that also works on gjs when possible , since we might later decide that gjs is more appropriate +
DeviceKit - disks ( external dependency ) - clearly the right way forward - DeviceKit - disks is not yet available on non-Linux systems - it requires recent udev & kernel - many things can already be done with gvfs only ( no need for hal or Device Kit - disks ) => approved => it 's preferred to keep a hal backend when possible ( instead of just removing it ) for portability reasons + WebKit / GTK + ( external dependency ) - good work done to fix issues - still not perfect for accessibility .
we trust the WebKit / GTK + team for fixing this => approved => the WebKit / GTK + team needs to continue work on accessibility => modules with WebKit ports should merge the relevant branches ( eg , yelp ) + libchamplain ( external dependency ) - people like it - needs to be ported to clutter 1.0 => approved if ported to clutter 1.0 + icontool ( external dependency ) - no reply to the mail by Frederic ( on June 10th ) - should replace icon-naming - utils - mostly useful for one - canvas work ( but from discussion with artists , it 's not completely ready yet ) - would the icontool - render be used during " make dist " or " make install " ? => rejected as it's not really needed now and we did n't get replies to questions ( it will probably be accepted when it 's ready )
Thanks , Vincent --
Les gens heureux ne sont pas pressés .
I used to write for the Huffington Post , an online news and blog collective .
It was started by Arianna Huffington during the Bush Era as a response to all the far - right online media .
I did n't agree with a lot of what was on there -- I am more centrist -- but at the time I thought it was necessary .
Then they started to promote far - left New Age nonsense , and when it came to vaccinations , HuffPo started posting all kinds of opinions that amounted to nothing more than out - and - out health threats .
While they do sometimes post a counter - argument , it 's still almost all alt - med , all the time .
Here 's the latest : a doctor named Frank Lipman is telling people not to get vaccinated against Swine Flu .
Instead he says you should wash your hands a lot , eat well , and take homeopathic medicine .
Yes , seriously .
And he does it while spouting quite a few of the standard antivax memes , like the flu wo n't be that bad ( maybe he should consult with Dr. Joe Albietz , who I 'm sure would disagree ) and my favorite , we do n't know how well the vaccine will work .
In fact , the vaccine for Swine Flu is based on many decades of research on how vaccines are produced , and will certainly work better than Dr. Lipman 's homeopathic " medicine " which we know is just plain old water , and totally useless .
I 'll note that on his own site he promotes acupuncture and chiropractic , too .
It 's the peddling of antivax rhetoric like this that drove me from HuffPo , and I 've let them know why .
I was a minor cog there , so I know it made no difference ... and the proof is that they still post articles promoting procedures known to be useless .
In fact , it 's worse than that , since someone might try the homeopathic water rather than get actual treatment .
So , as always , do n't listen to people like Lipman , or even to me when it comes to this stuff .
Instead , go to your doctor , a board - certified and science - based doctor , and ask them about the H1N1 swine flu , and see if they recommend getting the shot .
And yes , as soon as it's available here I 'll get vaccinated , as will my wife and daughter .
We talked to a real doctor about it , and we understand the threat of H1N1 , and we understand what vaccines do .
Tip o' the syringe to Dan Gilbert and Richard Saunders .
Note added after I wrote this : Mike 's Weekly Skeptical Rant has also weighed in on Lipman , and Salon.com has an article excoriating HuffPo as well .
Humans have always been appreciating and valuing the beauty and uniqueness of gemstones .
They are valued because of their impressive colors , durability , hidden energies and rarity .
Because of these very qualities , they retain higher monetary value and being used in decorative items and jewelry for centuries .
They are named as jewels , gems or gemstones , as they are just human concepts , they do n’t have any specific geological or scientific definition .
Different kinds of gems are being widely used in many different kinds of jewelries these days .
Women love gems , and often look for such gemstone jewelry that can go nicely with their attire .
Men usually wear them because of their healing powers .
When different gemstones like sapphire , diamonds , rubies and lapis lazuli are jutted in precious metals like silver , gold and platinum , they look really impressive and represent the aesthetic sense and taste of the wearer .
Though different kinds of gemstone jewelry have been ruling on the heart of men and women for quite some time , things have changed quite a lot these days , and now people ’s preferences have also changed .
Now they look for jewelry that is consisted of only gold , silver and platinum and they like to adore these metals with embedded gemstones , however , the jewelry that made of only and only gemstones without any precious metal is not quite popular these days in many such parts of the world as are reckoned the hub of jewelry trends .
All gemstones are beautiful , but all are not expensive , and many of them are available quite an affordable prices that can serve your purpose best if you ca n’t afford some really expensive jewelry .
Gemstones jewelry or to be more exact semi-precious gemstone jewelry can get immense popularity if it is offered with reasonable price tags and people are told about the hidden powers which usually associated with these stones .
These days all we want to look like our favorite celebrities , and no matter whether it ’s about dressing or jewelry , it becomes a fashion or trend what they wear and use .
Many different celebrities of showbiz and sports have been playing an important in the popularity of different kinds of jewelry .
The gemstone jewelry , which these celebrities often seem to use , has become quite popular among the people .
So , celeb - power can also play a great role in the popularity of gemstone jewelry .
As the nation continues to consider the implications of Alec Baldwin ’s potential future entrance into politics , CNN ’s Jack Cafferty already has his doubts about Baldwin ’s credentials .
He points out that Al Franken  the most recent celeb turned politician  at least went to Harvard , but Baldwin , pathetically , only managed to graduate from NYU .
Well , Baldwin , never one to hold his tongue , has decided to nip this whole “ not qualified ” thing in the bud before it spirals out of control  by making an example of the CNN anchor .
“ I would like to make a deal with Cafferty , ” he wrote on the Huffington Post last night .
Jack , you do n’t tell people that a career in the performing arts disqualifies them from seeking elected office , and I wo n’t say publicly that your being convicted of leaving the scene of an accident in which you struck a cyclist and then ran two red lights while you were pursued by the police and were subsequently ordered to serve 70 hours of community service back in May of 2003 disqualifies you from posing as a “ Man of the People ” on a major cable news network .
Fair enough ?
The more we think about it , the more we become convinced that , for the public good , this man must run in a political campaign .

Thousands of people turned up to auditions all over the country
It 's 0630 and I 'm standing outside London 's O2 Arena with a big crowd of people .
No , I 'm not queuing up to get concert tickets - I 'm lining up to audition for the X Factor .
I 'd received an audition letter , which sternly informed me that anyone who arrived after 0900 would not be seen , so I thought getting there bright and early would see me done by 1300 at the latest .
How wrong was I ?
A theme park - style snaking queue had already formed and I was seemingly at the back of it .
What are last year 's finalists up to ?
But everyone kept shuffling forward in stops and starts , eager to get that little bit closer to the door , so while we were moving I took the opportunity to check out my competition .
There were all the usual suspects - the flamboyant cross - dresser ; the two women in their wedding dresses ; and the man with a plastic chicken on his head .
I befriended the girl standing next to me , 23 - year - old Kenny from London , who had brought her husband along for support .
She had never auditioned before , but her husband had filled in the application form , so thought she 'd have a go .
Cunningly ( or so I thought ) I had brought a portable chair and Harry Potter book with me to pass the time .
It drew some curious looks at first - but I was vindicated two hours later , when people 's feet began to ache and those looks of pity turned to envy .
Finally , 0900 came and a warm - up man came out to greet the excited crowd .
Everyone was handed a ticket as they entered the O2 Arena
We were told to shuffle forward again so that , instead of standing in the rather polite two - by - two line we had formed , we lost any semblance of personal space whatsoever .
The reason for this eventually became clear : we would be filmed by overhead cameras while we waved our hands , bounced up and down , screamed and raised our arms above our heads in a cross while shouting : " I have the X Factor ! " ' Pick me Simon ! '
We did this for an hour until host Dermot O'Leary appeared and recorded some links to camera , followed by more cheering .
This lasted another long , tiring 60 minutes and the gathered throng were now becoming bored and tetchy .
At 1100 , we were finally allowed to enter the O2 Arena , but auditions were not to begin until everyone was seated .
It sounded reasonable enough but , with 10,000 people to process , we were n't all in place until 1215 .
At which point Dermot filmed yet more links and the crowd were made to repeat everything that had just happened outside .
The X Factor judges were not at the first round of auditions Unbelievably , production staff went around handing out hand - made posters for people to hold up saying things like " I have the X Factor " , " I love you Cheryl " and " Pick me Simon ! " .
I had always thought they were lovingly made at home ...
Once again we were made to stand up , sit down , scream , wave our hands and dance .
When the auditionees began to revolt ( there was audible moaning and complaining ) a member of the production team took out a loud - hailer and told us off .
If we did n't want to participate " then you should n't be here " .
One guy was singled out and made an example of .
He got up and left .
Nearly seven hours after I arrived , the auditions finally began in little makeshift booths in the middle of the arena floor .
No TV judges here - we were told we'd be singing to a member of the production team .
If successful , we 'd receive a golden ticket , allowing us to return and sing to a more senior production member .
If that went well , we'd get to sing for Simon and , presuming we made a big enough impression ( good or bad ) the footage might eventually end up on TV .
Feedback
Having the auditions in the open meant that everyone could see - and hear - everyone else 's performance .
There was a strange , hushed silence at first as people listened in , followed by gasps at certain show - stopping performances and cheers as people ran out waving their golden tickets .
The same songs could be heard over and over - And I'm Telling You from Dreamgirls , Bill Withers ' Lean On Me and various Alicia Keys tunes .
I was auditionee number 156097
In the booth , someone sang a pretty off - key version of I Will Survive , yet unbelievably ( or perhaps predictably ) he was given a pass to the next round .
Undoubtedly he was entertaining and would make good TV , but I could n't help thinking that , if the TV judges told him the truth , he would be mystified as to why he had been through so many gruelling rounds of auditions .
Finally , it was my turn .
I was greeted by a girl who looked like she was in her mid-20s and after a few pleasantries ( no chance to give my life story or find out why I wanted to win ) I sang a verse and chorus of Sam Brown 's 1989 hit Stop .
" Thank you , but I 'm afraid this time it 's a ' no , ' " she said .
" Okay , can I ask why ? " I replied .
" Sorry , we do n't give feedback . "
And that was it .
After 11 hours ' wait , it was all over in a minute .
I 'm no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey , but I can hold a tune , so I thought I had a chance of passing the first round at least .
I guess I should just be happy I was n't bad enough to be humiliated on national TV As I was leaving the O2 , Kenny caught up with me to find out how I got on .
She had n't made it through either , but I was surprised when she told me : " Next year I 'm coming back and I 'm going to be better prepared . "
Given the day I 'd just had , I think I 'll pass .

Well not quite .
There are a number of different steps that we have yet to go through before we can finish what is commonly called , the completion , of the well .
It would be nice , once the drill hits the oil - bearing rock , to say that you were done .
That having connected the feed line from the well through a choke valve ( that controls the outflow from the well ) , we could proceed to tie the outflow into some kind of collection network , and then we could sit back and count the money as it flowed by .
This is another in the technical series in which I talk about the different aspects of getting fossil fuels out of the ground .
Others can found at this link : tech talk .
This link is also available on the header of The Oil Drum home page .
At this point in the process the bottom of the well is still an open hole .
And one of the first things that we do is to flush out the drilling fluid , and then clean the walls of the well – firstly by washing the remaining mud from the well down in the production zone .
That means that the rock wall is exposed , just as it was drilled .
There are several issues that can come about as a result of this .
The first is that the rock we have drilled into can be fairly weak .
This is one of the peculiarities of geology .
To a degree the richer in oil the rock is , the weaker the rock will be .
( And that also holds true for oil shale - of which more at a later date ) .
Why is that ?
Well let 's talk a little about the rock structure , particularly in this post the porosity that it has .
( I ’ll talk about permeability next time ) .
There are , simplistically , two types of rock , that oil is usually found in and for now , to make a simple generalization , I am going to call them sandstone and carbonate ( as I said holding shale until a later time ) .
Sandstone rock is made up of relatively large grains that are glued together at the edges with various different types of natural cement .
The grains do not fit that well together ( think apples filling up a room , and connected where they touch ) .
We call the gaps between the grains , the pore space of the rock , and it is these gaps that the oil fills up to form the reservoir .
And so we can calculate the " free volume " , as it were , of the rock as the ( relative amount of free space in the rock , you can get this by subtracting the weight of the rock from the weight of the same sized piece cut from solid quartz and it will tell you how much empty space there is in the rock , and thus , how much oil there could be in that volume .
Section of sand with oil in the pores - – this is actually an oil sand , so the grains are n’t that well cemented together .
( Syncrude )
So say we had a core that weighed 144 lb / cu ft and the weight of solid quartz ( flint ) is 220 lb / cu ft .
Then only 65 % of the rock ( 144/220 ) is solid rock and the remainder is what is known as pore space .
Now these holes can be connected or totally separated , with each pore surrounded by a solid piece of rock .
Normally the percentage given is reversed , i.e porosity = proportion of void space to total volume , or in this case 35 % of the total volume is not rock .
( Another picture showing porosity of a sandstone can be found here .
Now in the reservoir rock this space is going to be filled with a fluid , either gas , oil or water .
For now let us assume that it is filled with oil .
What I have described so far is known as primary porosity , i.e. that which is created by this initial structure of the rock .
With carbonates more than sandstone there is a secondary porosity , and this is the porosity induced by rock movement and the dissolving of channels and holes in the rock by the movement of fluid over the rock through the millennia .
Again put simply the oil found in a sandstone will occur between the grains of the rock .
In the case of the carbonates , which normally have a much smaller individual particle size , the oil is more often usefully found in the cracks and joints formed were the rock bedding planes were created ( and which can be seen in exposed rock in a lot of road cuts along the highway ) .
The voids and spaces in the rock are also formed from the spaces from what might have been old coral reefs , or where water dissolved holes through the rock .
But sometimes the two methods of formation mix , and I would like to quote from Kenneth Deffeyes book " Hubbert 's Peak " ( my favorite text as an explanation of the geological case ) .
Fine grained calcium carbonate mud usually gets consolidated into massive limestones , usually with little or no porosity .
. . . . . . . About 10 percent of ancient limestones do have porosity .
. . . . . . Most massive and nonporous limestones contain textures made by invertebrate animals that ingest sediment and turn out fecal pellets .
Usually the pellets get squished into the mud .
Rarely do the fecal pellets themselves form a porous sedimentary rock .
. . . I twisted Aramco 's collective arm for samples from the supergiant Ghawar field .
. . . . Examining the reservoir rock of the world 's biggest oil field . . . a small part of the reservoir was dolomite , but most of it turned out to be fecal pellet limestone .
I had to go home that evening and explain to my family that the reservoir rock in the world 's biggest oil field was made of shit .
So there you have it .
And the reason for the quote is that the rock at the bottom of our well can be very weak , and may be left in poor shape by the oil drilling bit that just passed it by .
Now remember it is this wall around the hole that is the barrier through which all the oil in that rock must pass to get into the well .
So before we leave it we have to ensure that it is in as good a condition to allow that flow as possible .
( Hence the reason for the removal of the mud and the cleaning of the wall ) .
We also have to isolate the production zone from the rest of the well , and we do this with what is known as a completion or production packer .
Production packer ( B.J. Services ) - the three rings swell out and fill the gap ( pack it ) between the tool and the rock wall of the hole acting as a seal to separate the well below , from the well above – note the internal pipe to allow flow from the underlying part of the well .
One of the problems is that the drill bit may have overly crushed the rock , so that fine carbonate particles are pushed into the cracks and pores of the rock , right around the bore .
These can block the passages that will allow the oil to enter the well .
And so , in order to get rid of these particles , a strong acid can be poured into the bottom of the well .
This acidizing dissolves these fine particles and opens up the cracks leading out into the surrounding rock , so that the oil can flow into the well bore more easily .
Process of isolating and acidizing the formation .
Another problem is that the rock may be very weak , since a lot of its strength comes from the oil that fills the holes within it .
This oil only provides strength as long as the rock is totally confined on all sides , but when the pressure is removed on one side ( think of popping a champagne cork ) then the oil can flow away , taking the support for the surrounding rock with it .
If the rock bridges that are left are weak then they can crush .
This will cause the crushed rock ( sand ) to mix with the oil , which will require a de-sanding process at the surface , but it will also close some of the passages through which the oil is flowing to the well .
A well operator that speeds the flow of oil out from the rock around the well , can reduce the support that the oil gives to the surrounding rock to the point that it crushes , and permanently reduces oil flow into the well .
We can put in a screen that will hold the rock in place , but allow the oil to seep through slots in the screen wall .
Or , to stop that rock crushing from happening and to reinforce the rock , we can pump a layer of concrete into the bottom of the well , cementing a steel liner into the rock , just as we cased the well higher up the well .
The steel liner , or production casing , has , however , one problem .
Once it is cemented into place , there is this hollow tube all the way to the surface , but there is no way that the oil can get through the cement and the steel into that passage .
And this is where Her Majesty 's Explosive comes in .
Small , specially designed , explosive charges , known as shaped charges are now put together into specifically designed charge packages , and lowered down into the well into the completion zone .
Arrangement of shaped charges ( the yellow cylinders ) – when the explosive goes off the cones collapse and small liquid metal jets shoot out of the open end , through the casing , concrete and into the rock , creating a channel .
( Core Labs )
Here they are detonated , sending small jets of metal against the wall of the casing and perforating the steel and concrete into the surrounding rock .
There is an animation that shows the jet being produced ( see also information here ) .
Representation of shaped charges firing and penetrating the casing , cement and wall ( OSHA )
This gives the passage for the well to flow out of the rock and into the well bore .
We have finally completed the first stage of our oil production .
Again this is a very simplified explanation of a quite complex process , but it moves us along to consider some of the other issues relating to how the oil now flows to the well , that will be next .
Since this is simplified additional comments and questions are welcome .
Bachmann touched on the priorities of Republicans if they retook Congress in 2010 , to “ pass repealer bill after repealer bill , ” to prevent the creation of a one - world currency , and to pull the government back from the “ 36 percent of private business profits ” that she claimed it now controlled .
And she said Michigan residents were “ depressed enough ” without Gitmo prisoners being relocated to state facilities where they could inspire more terrorists .
“ This is where they learn conversion to Islam ! ” said Bachmann .
“ In the prisons ! ”
David Weigel was at a Michele Bachmann appearance in St. Louis this weekend to record her insanity .
As he writes at the Washington Independent , her speech was filled with the usual ACORN - hysteria , anti-Islam rhetoric , and anti-globalist dog- whistles :
But one of Bachmann ’s usual targets was missing from the speech : the US Census .
When Weigel asked her about it , the Minnesota Representative “ recoiled a little ” and moved to get in her limousine .
Aw , c’mon , Michele !
What ’s wrong with a little Census hysteria ?
It takes a certain type of fan to be passionate enough about a game to make yourself into a walking , talking advertisement .
Well one Killzone fan did just that , by having ‘ Killzone ’ tattooed on his leg , forever showing his love for the critically acclaimed FPS .
Whilst perusing Flickr , we stumbled across some pics of a fan getting a Killzone tattoo .
From the description on the flickr feed , it says that the person got the tattoo so that he would receive a free Sony HDTV , and PlayStation 3 as a prize from an unnamed magazine .

Top Chinese Cars
Some of the Chinese car making companies design specific cars each year meant for the big American market .
These top car makers have made 2009 a very special year with incredible deals and models being offered to the US market .
China is projected through the World Bank show as one of the upcoming and positive car making companies .
Their superheated run off had had over 10 % of the total car market in US .
This year it has been 6 % but then it is always expanding in new directions .
With greater plans ahead China is looking forward to surpass a lot of US car making companies in their auto sales within US territories itself .
Since the worldwide automobile sales have dropped since last year , the cars coming from China has also dropped down markedly .
But even then there continues to be great demands for Chinese cars which seem to be in no competition with other brands available in the US .
The Chinese cars have created their own niche in this market and show some promises to accelerate even further with the higher sales .
These are the following cars that have been making quite some celebrations with their popularity in the US market :
Brilliance GT :
This car is one of a kind that comes with dual door compact stature .
They have a 1.8 liter engine that is rated at 167 bhp .
The body is about 173 lb- ft with the torque mated at 6 - speed manually operated transmission .
This is a really sporty looking car that can come under the slot of sport compacts that are widely available in the US .
Great Wall Gwkulla :
This was one of the greatest yet stylish cars that you would see coming from China .
This electronic vehicle is all about largeness in size and big power coming from 50 KW with permanent magnet synchronous system .
This DC electric driven motor has had lithium ion batteries that come synchronized with ranges between 100 miles of changes .
This SUV is a great addition coming from the Chinese market .
It comes with a Hover H7 Concept which has a midsize of spute ute with 3.0 liter V - 6 , 6 - speed manual , automatic transmission and an all - wheel drive .

The H7 is also laden with high - tech features that had to be integrated with LCD instrument and a paneling system .
The panel displays allows for great night time vision and integrated climate plus multimedia control .
Roewe MG6 :
This is a Chinese version of the British idea of an MG6 .
If you have loved the previous MG6 then you would love this as well .
However it is popular in the US because of its low key sportiness but even then the handsome Roewe should be focused on to be bringing some more alternate looks to the US market .

The 4 - door car is coming out to be almost similar in different versions of itself across the world .
It always bears the sleek yet aggressive features .
This is another car coming from Shanghai auto shows and happens to be really popular in the US .
It is a midsize sedan with great looking front end as well as headlamps .
It just stays accentuated in its looks with the amazing crease line and the fore as well as hind fenders .
There are numerous stylish intricacies coming with this model that keeps it irresistible .
In past America , Japan and Europe have been importing cars from China regularly .
Now the Chinese market seems to be growing stronger in America .
Car buying explosion is being predicted again with the focus on more hybrid and eco friendly cars .
Mayhem in Gaza :
After hours of fighting Friday , Hamas ' security forces were able to crush an uprising by gunmen associated with al - Qaeda , in the wake of a provocative speech by a local imam critical of Gaza 's current rulers .
At least 16 people were killed in the clashes and more than 80 were reportedly wounded .
Earlier , the leader of the radical Salafi faction in Gaza , Abdul Latif Musa , slammed Hamas ' conduct as not sufficiently Islamic , as he declared the Strip an " Islamic emirate " and pledged allegiance to al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden .

Following fierce gunfights , eyewitnesses reported that Hamas was able to take over most rebel strongholds .
Friday night , Hamas forces reportedly bombed the last stronghold , where Imam Musa and his men were apparently barricaded .
According to one report , the commander of the al - Qaeda faction 's military wing , Abu - Abdullah al - Suri , may have been killed in the attack .
' Ideological deterioration '
Unconfirmed reports said a Musa loyalist blew himself up within a group of Hamas men near the mosque where the radical cleric spoke earlier .
According to other reports , Hamas members , some of them masked , were pursuing more Salafi loyalists in the Strip .
Hamas Spokesman Sami Abu- Zuhari addressed the fierce clashes in Rafah , characterizing the views presented by the Salafi faction as " ideological deterioration . "
" This group has no connection to any outside organization , " he said .
" No element or group has the authority to take the law into its own hands , and those who do not respect that will be dealt with by the security establishment . "
Meanwhile , members of the Salafi group , Jund al - Ansar Allah , said they were completely loyal to Musa and warned against any attempt to undermine the Islamic emirate he declared .
According to other reports , the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees was leading mediation efforts between the warring factions .
When he was n't busy giving colleagues the bird last week , Bill Heffernan was saying he does n't mind gay people .
Oh , sweet relief .
One of the great achievements of human existence is to be not minded , particularly if you 're not minded by a certifiable Liberal senator from Junee .
If only he 'd stopped there .
But in the Great Hall of Parliament House during a ' ' celebration ' ' of the fifth anniversary of the legislative ban on gay marriage , he allegedly told a protester : '' I do n't mind gay people , I just want you to stop f--- ing the kids . ''
Heffernan later denied using those exact words , but the long history of confusing homosexuality and pedophilia means to even mention the two in the same breath is to link them .
Despite his form , it is tempting to dismiss Heffernan 's comments as the obsession of a family man who likes saying it how it is .
But it 's not how it is : study after study has found the idea that gay men are more likely to molest children to be complete bunkum .
In 1994 , the respected medical journal Pediatrics published a study of 352 suspected victims of child abuse in Denver - 276 girls , 76 boys .
It found 269 were abused by adults , two of whom were gay .
Two .
In 222 cases , the offender was a straight partner of a close relative .
In other words , a child within that group was 111 times more likely to be abused by someone straight they knew , than by a homosexual , known to them or not .
In the discussion of Perl Applications for Normal Users , the subject of installation came up again .
User experience is n't always my primary concern , and I do n't mind overgeneralizing that to other parts of the Perl 5 community .
For example , many Perl community websites are unattractive visually .
There are exceptions .
The London Perl Mongers site is very attractive .
I also like the design of the Perl Moose site .
Yet a common refrain in many ( more heat than light , sadly ) discussions is that functional is more important than attractive .
Yes , that 's a false dichotomy .
I do n't want to restart the debate over the attractiveness of Perl 5 websites .
( I 'd love to see variant templates that writers , developers , and projects could borrow and adapt for consistency of good design , but that 's a different story . )
I want instead to talk about installation .
This ties in to Who Benefits from the CPAN ?.
Consider , for example , the amount of work required to configure a CPAN client in 2000 versus the amount of work required to configure the same client in 2009 .
This has improved .
Yet compare that to installing a random PHP application .
Preemptive ad hominem : if at any time you feel the need to comment here or elsewhere saying " You fool !
You foolish fool !
You want to turn Perl into Java , you drooling maniac ! " , you are a masochist and your opinion does not matter .
One commenter on the previous post praised Ruby Gems for not failing tests and not spewing diagnostic output and asking confusing questions .
Of course the thought of not running tests on installation horrifies me ( how do you have any idea if your software works ? ) , but the point is a good one .
What information do users need to know to install your software ?
What questions do you really need to ask them ?
We 've optimized the Perl ecosystem for Perl developers .
That 's good .
That helps us .
That does n't necessarily mean that what 's good for Perl developers is good for Perl users .
That also does n't mean that we can only optimize the experience for one group at the expense of the other .
We can do better .
I argue often for better defaults -- not just at the language level but at every level users might see .
Yes , I 've overloaded the word " user " .
Deal with it .
One important question for me as I ponder visions for Perl 5 and its ecosystem is " How can we improve the default behavior for novices and for most uses by experienced programmers while allowing experienced programmers to customize behavior for advanced uses ? "
That 's a language design principle .
If you analyze the design of Perl 5 , you 'll see Larry 's answers everywhere .
The same goes for Perl 6 .
I do n't have complete , systemic answers for that yet .
We have a lot to ponder .
As food for thought , consider the ( oblique ) connection between two comments .
The first comes from a critique of Python :
Also , its libraries require compilation .
What a nonsense .
The second comes from Scott Walters , specifically his Language choice motivated by greed journal :
Moose is good and Moose is great , but the real win would be to automatically install modules , automatically call the OS 's package manager to install libraries and other deps , to have created PHP before php did ( or after ) and have a libperl linking executable that outputs web pages ( period ) , and most of all , to have a sandbox mode enabled by default ( tired idea , I know ) where users can write code without getting yelled at by humans , only by the computer , even if just because the code is labeled ( all is fair if you predeclare ) as " babytalk " .
Perhaps this would be a mix of strict , diagnostics / warnings , and a Perl : : Critic policy that tries to help them in only the most immediate sense likely to be useful to novices in the short term .
How my PS3 loud fan noise problem was solved with a very simple method .
Karen Hartshorn
A University of Otago senior staff member researcher has left after it was discovered she did not have the doctorate from Cambridge University she claimed .
Karen Hartshorn was a science communicator in the internationally - acclaimed Dunedin Multi- disciplinary Heath and Development Unit .
Her role was to use Otago science research discoveries to write academic papers for publication in New Zealand and overseas , and to write newspaper and magazine articles for a wider general audience .
She left the university recently , about two weeks after the Otago Daily Times began investigating an anonymous tip she had inflated her qualifications .
The university will not confirm whether she resigned or was dismissed .
The ODT has been unable to contact Ms Hartshorn , despite repeated attempts , via telephone and visits to her home , over the past few days .
Investigations revealed she holds the BA from prestigious United States university Harvard she claims on her CV .
She was also a PhD student in geology in the earth sciences department at Cambridge University in the UK for four years .
But she never completed her Cambridge qualification .
Unlike successful PhD candidates , her name does not appear on the PhD graduates ' roll on the university 's library catalogue or in annual reports from the earth sciences department .
Responding to inquiries , Nicholas Saffell , from Cambridge 's office of external affairs and communications , said in an email Ms Hartshorn submitted a revised PhD thesis in September 2004 which was sent to the examiners , but she had not yet had a viva .
A viva is the oral examination required to complete the degree process .
Ms Hartshorn 's situation has some similarities to that of Mary Anne Thompson , the former head of the New Zealand immigration service who resigned earlier this year after it was discovered she did not have the doctorate from the London School of Economics she claimed .
Ms Thompson is still before the courts facing three charges of using a fraudulent CV to obtain public service jobs in 1989 , 1998 and 2004 .
Ms Hartshorn did not claim to hold a doctorate when she obtained her first job in Dunedin in 2006 as director of the New Zealand International Science Festival , the woman who employed her , Dame Elizabeth Hanan , said .
But at some point Ms Hartshorn began saying she had a PhD and using the title Dr .
In a March 2007 interview with the ODT , she said she had a PhD in geology from Cambridge and was referred to as Dr Hartshorn .
She was also listed as holding that qualification and title in the university 's 2008 and 2009 printed staff lists , and has been referred to as Dr in some official documents and funding applications since 2007 .
She was listed as Dr Hartshorn on the university 's main website staff list , although the title disappeared from the website about a month ago .
Regarded as capable and hard - working , Ms Hartshorn was being groomed for greater responsibilities within the university .
Information supplied to the ODT shows a possible career path to a senior role within the Dunedin Multi - disciplinary Health and Development Unit and a professorship within 10 years .
The person who approached the ODT about the matter said this was not only because Ms Hartshorn had inflated her qualifications but because of the belief the university had known about the issue since May or June and was trying to " sweep her actions under the carpet " .
The informant provided written evidence which showed Ms Hartshorn 's title " magically changing " recently from Dr to Ms on university material on the internet .
One was a press release first issued in November 2007 which described her as Dr Hartshorn but which was recently altered on the internet to read Ms Hartshorn , although the date and all other wording remained the same .
Several people who have had close contact with Ms Hartshorn since she arrived in Dunedin all said when approached they regarded her as a person of integrity .
Initially , they found it difficult to believe she may have exaggerated her qualifications , but as the weeks progressed and Ms Hartshorn became aware the ODT and the university were investigating , she fronted up to her employer and to at least two of the organisations she is involved with .
Science festival chairman Mike Harte said Ms Hartshorn told him she did not hold a doctorate .
He did not say when the conversation took place .
Asked how it had gone , he replied : " OK " .
Ms Hartshorn had outlined " a chain of events surrounding her studies at Cambridge " but would not elaborate .
Ms Hartshorn was still a member of the festival committee , he said .
Mr Harte said he had no further comment to make about whether she would remain on the committee until after the committee had met to discuss the issue .
He did not know when that would be , saying no special meeting had been called .
Last month , Ms Hartshorn was listed as Dr Hartshorn on the festival website ; by yesterday her title had changed to Ms. Mr Harte said he was not aware the change had been made and did not know who had made it .
Dame Elizabeth asked the ODT to go easy on Ms Hartshorn , saying the fact she did not hold a doctorate was " a storm in a teacup " created by " someone going to the press causing problems " .
She said Ms Hartshorn had done a " brilliant job " as festival director .
" She was employed because of her skills ... in science and event management .
She has certainly shown great abilities with the festival and with other organisations she is involved in . "
Yellow - eyed Penguin Trust general manager Sue Murray said she had been told Ms Hartshorn did not hold a PhD .
She said Ms Hartshorn was still the trust 's chairwoman - her qualifications had no bearing on her position on the trust .

The chorus of folks singing " meet the new boss , same as the old boss " just got a little bigger and louder yesterday , after the Obama Administration issued " new " rules for border laptop searches that bear an uncanny resemblance to the old rules .
To recap : Last August , the lame - duck Bush Administration codified a longstanding policy that allowed Department of Homeland Security officials to seize travelers ' laptops and other digital gear at the border -- with no questions asked and no guarantee of return .
Earlier this week the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information lawsuit demanding , among other things , to know whose laptops were seized and what happened to them .
[ Also on InfoWorld : " Obama 's cookies may not go down so easy " | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Perhaps coincidentally , a day later DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano issued " new directives " regarding electronic border searches .
The new rules are not a total stiff -- they put limits on the kinds of information DHS cops can look at , how long the DHS can hold onto your gear , and more oversight over the process .
But many who'd hoped for a significant change in the way civil liberties have been abused by our Uncle over the last eight years are probably outside right now scratching the “ Yes We Can ” stickers off their bumpers .
Even the ACLU says border searches are necessary to ensure our safety .
But like me , the group has more than a few problems with the how , the why , and the what .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Well , let 's start with the lack of probable cause .
The Obamanistas have left unchanged a Bush policy that allowed DHS agents to search any device of any traveler at any time -- no reason necessary .
Look the wrong way at an airport security agent who 's having a bad hair day , and say adios to your laptop , cell phone , iPod , digital camera , or virtually any other device more complicated than a hair dryer for up to 30 days .
Problem No. 2 : What exactly are they looking for ?
One of the biggest problems with laws designed to “ enhance national security ” is that they 're often used to circumvent restrictions on law enforcement abuse ( like , say , the Fourth Amendment ) in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism .
Just ask the guy who got arrested earlier this week for trying to smuggle child pornography over the Canadian border .
He 's one of an unknown number of pervs caught in similar circumstances , either by U.S. or foreign customs officials .
No one here is defending the right to carry kiddie porn , but what exactly does that have to do with national security ?
And if the feds are going to perform a digital cavity search for porn , why not pirated movies and music ?
Where is the line drawn and who draws it ?
As the Associated Press reports :
The searches , which predate the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , have uncovered everything from martyrdom videos and other violent jihadist materials to child pornography and stolen intellectual property , according to the government .
Then there 's all the stuff they find that 's not even illegal , just embarrassing , confidential , potentially damaging to a company ( like trade secrets or deals in progress ) , or simply personal .
The new rules call for this information to be “ destroyed ” within 7 days and require inspectors to consult an agency attorney before viewing certain information ( like medical records ) .
Why do I not find this comforting ?
Having just traveled over an international border with a laptop that is a ) full of recent work that can't be easily duplicated , and b ) not actually mine ( it 's a review unit ) , I can attest that having to surrender that machine for up to 30 days and get it returned to me wiped clean -- after having done nothing wrong or even suspicious -- would tick me off rather a lot .
Despite all of the above , I do not agree with those who will leap upon this as evidence the Obama administration is the second coming of Stalin .
Remember , this stuff has been going on long before the O - man took office .
The problem is that many us hoped for something better , not just more of the same .
What do you think of the " new " security rules ?
Will they reduce unnecessary intrusions on privacy and make us safer ?
Or is this more of the same old same old ?
Let fly below or e-mail me : cringe@infoworld.com .
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo has seen its share of luminaries in the ambassador 's suite .
Former Vice President Walter Mondale , former Senate Majority Leaders Mike Mansfield and Howard Baker and former House Speaker Tom Foley are among those who have brokered relations with a complex and critical ally in a region bristling with military and trade tensions .
President Barack Obama 's pick for the post is from a different mold : John Roos , a San Francisco Bay area lawyer , was the president 's chief Silicon Valley fundraiser and contributions " bundler . "
He has no diplomatic experience .
Mr. Obama 's choice of Mr. Roos , along with other political boosters -- from former investment banker Louis B. Susman , known as the " vacuum cleaner " for his fundraising prowess , to Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney -- has raised eyebrows among some who thought the president would extend his mantra of change to the diplomatic corps .
" We 're not only insulting nations [ that ] we 're appointing these bundlers to , we 're risking U.S. diplomatic efforts in these key countries , " said Craig Holman , a government - affairs lobbyist at watchdog group Public Citizen .
This tension can be traced back to Mr. Obama 's claim during last year 's campaign that President George W. Bush engaged in an " extraordinary politicization of foreign policy . "
Mr. Obama said he instead would ensure that hires are based on merit , rather than party or ideology .
The American Academy of Diplomacy , an association of former diplomats , seized on the comments in lobbying him to lower the portion of ambassadors drawn from outside the foreign - service establishment to as little as 10 % from the 30 % average since President John F. Kennedy 's tenure .
( Mr. Bush 's score was 33 % . )
President Obama yesterday referred to universal health care as a moral imperative ( report ) .
He was speaking to a group of people who are religious leaders , and attempting to enlist their support for his health care plan .
According to www.m-w.com ( definition ) , moral “ implies conformity to established sanctioned codes or accepted notions of right and wrong ” .
Certainly the Bible and many , if not all , religious documents contain an imperative to take care of those less fortunate .
Feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , healing the sick — these are acts of charity , which is a type of love .
It is interesting to hear the President promote the health care reform legislation as a “ moral imperative ” when he is n't generally going to a church ( but perhaps is getting sermons in the White House chapel ? ) and has publicly , in a speech overseas , averred that the United States is not a Christian nation ( but Christianity is not the only religion in play ) .
We also have an oft - referenced separation of church and state in this country .
One could conclude that he was promoting this as a religious act , since he was pointing it out to a group of the faithful , but I do n't think that was the intent .
I think it was more that he was pointing out “ what 's in it for you ” .
Legislation forcing health care plans on the whole country might cover that pesky obligation to be charitable to our fellow citizens on an individual basis .
It should also be noted that a thing is not bad or immoral just because one or more religions also support it .
Unfortunately , the President is starting down what I think is a slippery slope .
Legislation to provide health care insurance is one step , but what about legislation to give everyone food and clothing ?
Would n't that be equally “ moral ” ?
And decent housing , with paid utilities , should not be far behind .
After justifying the legislation on the grounds of morality , how does he avoid promoting these other legislative acts ?
The basic question I have is whether we want the government to start legislating morality .
Its lack of Constitutionality does n't seem to be an inhibition , based on Congressional legislative history over the last 80 years or so .
Even if we set aside the Constitution as a purely historic document , I think there is a disconnect between “ doing the allegedly right thing ” and “ doing the societally mandatory thing ” .
Some things need to be made laws because without them , it is impossible to have much in the way of an advanced society .
A single individual living on a frontier might not need a law against murder because there is no one to kill or be killed by .
A society of 300 million people would need this kind of law , or everyone would be afraid to leave their homes lest they be killed or their families be killed while they are away .
Other things need to be laws in order to establish a convention that promotes safety , like everyone driving on the right - hand side of the road .
When someone fails to do that , head - on collisions may ensue .
Where is the objective societal imperative to providing health care insurance for everyone ?
Admittedly some people suffer and even die without it , but many also suffer and die even if they have it .
The society is not in danger of becoming another Lost Colony due to lack of people .
That 's callous , yes , but we have lots of people and attrition due to lack of insurance or the medical care it might cover is at a financially tolerable level .
The human cost is another matter , especially for those who lose loved ones .
But insurance does n't guarantee health or long life or an easy death when the body simply can no longer hang on .
Promoting this as a moral imperative that fundamentally legislates specific charity is also bad because it removes the responsibility for taking care of others from the individual 's shoulders and places it on society , burdening even those who think death is natural and should not be impeded .
If your religion is totally against any form of medical care , you will be out of luck if the legislation passes because you will have to pay taxes and insurance premiums anyway .
And even if you believe in charity , you might figure your religious obligation in this area is taken care of .
Maybe on your own you would have given more , but hey , the government has it in hand .
You can't feel good about the act of charity because it is now merely obeying the law .
Those who receive the benefits do n't have any reason to appreciate your generosity because , from their perspective , it is the government that is giving them the benefits .
I do n't mind rendering unto Caesar that which is Caesar 's , but I do n't think my charitable obligation to take care of the less fortunate is Caesar's .
I am a person of faith , a Christian , and the Bible ( which I read through completely , every year ) does n't say anywhere that government should be taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves .
It says the believers should .
Some sources have tried to insist that religion is on its way out , but to me that makes it less compelling that government should take over .
If there is no religion , why take care of anyone at all , except as they are capable of contributing to society ?
This is the kind of thinking behind ideas like Ezekiel Emmanuel 's complete lives concept , that encourages more medical care be made accessible to those between 15 and 40 than to those younger and older .
This is how quickly one can go from a “ moral imperative ” to take care of others to an “ immoral ” imperative to only take care of those one derives a benefit from .
This is why I consider the health care insurance reform legislation to be an immoral imperative .
It takes responsibility from believers ( and kind - hearted non-believers ) and gives it to a government that derives no spiritual benefit from it .
The less we do in service to our religious beliefs , the less effect our religious beliefs manifest in our lives .
It actually interferes with the practice of our religions .
There are many reasons to be against the proposed legislation embodied in HR 3200 , but the supposed “ moral imperative ” is not a reason to be for it .
Mr. Obama said he had withheld making the intelligence public for months because it “ is very important in these kind of high - stakes situations to make sure the intelligence is right ”  a clear allusion to former President George W. Bush ’s release of intelligence on Iraq seven years ago this month that proved baseless .
Mr. Obama ’s hand was forced , however , after Iran , apparently learning that the site had been discovered by Western intelligence , delivered a vague , terse letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday disclosing that it was building a second plant , one that it had never mentioned during years of inspections .
By today the Iranians were aggressively arguing that the plant was a “ semi- industrial fuel enrichment facility ” and that they had voluntarily made its existence public .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on his annual visit to he United Nations , insisted that the effort was entirely legal , even if Iran had failed to declare its existence to international inspectors until days ago .
“ We have no fears , ” he said .
“ What we did was completely legal .
The agency will come and take a look and produce a report and it is nothing new . ”
He added : “ What business is it of yours to tell us what to do or not ? ”

But to the West , there was a sense that Iran had stumbled .
“ They have cheated three times , ” one senior administration official said of the Iranians .
“ And they have now been caught three times . ”
The official was referring to information unearthed by an Iranian dissident group that led to the discovery of the underground plant at Natanz in 2002 , and evidence developed two years ago  after Iran ’s computer networks were infiltrated by American intelligence agencies  that the country had sought to design a nuclear warhead .
American officials believe that effort was halted in late 2003 .
Mr. Obama said the secret plant “ represents a direct challenge to the basic foundation of the nonproliferation regime . ”
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was more blunt , giving Iran two months to meet international demands , and Mr. Brown said , “ The international community has no choice today but to draw a line in the sand . ”
By all indications , that line will be drawn Thursday , when the members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany meet with Iranian officials , the long - awaited “ engagement ” that Mr. Obama promised in his campaign .
But American officials said that they would seize the moment to impose “ crippling sanctions ” if Iran blocked inspectors or refused to halt its nuclear program .
Actually , Mr. Melnikov and his wife , Lina , almost never cook in the oven , which was new when they moved into their apartment in Gravesend , Brooklyn , three years ago .
Like many people who live with more stuff than space , they store kitchenware in it .
On the day it turned itself on , Mr. Melnikov recalled , his cellphone had rung in the kitchen .
He talked for about 10 minutes .
Then he smelled smoke .
The oven was roaring .
The thermometer was in flames .

“ Maybe the ringing cellphone turned it on , ” Mr. Melnikov suggested to the two men .
They scoffed .
He laid the phone next to the stove .
They dialed it .
Suddenly , the electronic control on the stovetop beeped .
The digital display changed from a clock to the word “ high . ”
As the phone was ringing , the broiler was heating up .
Three other apartments in the building are fitted with the same make and model oven : Maytag Model CGR1425ADW .
“ My phone turned on all of them , ” Mr. Melnikov reported .
“ One apartment had a General Electric .
It did n’t work on that one . ”
Last night on The Daily Show , Jon Stewart and his staff compiled a pretty amazing takedown of Fox News , branding the network as " the new liberals . "
Bill O'Reilly was not pleased by this , so tonight he offered a rebuttal .
Saying that Stewart " went off the rails " by " deriding Fox News , " O'Reilly took issue with the almost 8 - minute Daily Show takedown in which old clips of Fox News personalities criticizing the behavior of liberal political activists were juxtaposed with recent clips of Fox News personalities praising the same sort of behaviors they used to take issue with .
So O'Reilly went on his show tonight and blabbered about how Stewart uses his " license to distort " as a satirist to placate his " liberal audience . "
He mentioned how a recent Pew Research poll found that 45 % of Stewart 's audience identifies themselves as liberal , and thus anything done on The Daily Show is not to ever be taken seriously because it 's just a bunch of horseshit done to make their pansy - ass viewers chuckle ( HAHA ! ) while they do yoga on the floor in their communal living room inside of a flea - ridden loft space near the campus of Berkeley in a pathetic attempt to escape the miserable existence of their Godless lives .
Additionally , O'Reilly did play two clips from the offending Daily Show segment that appear to have been taken mildly out of context , but that does n't really matter anyway because we all already know that Fox News is the conservative network , the network of Jesus , and there 's no way they 'd ever shoot anybody a load of bullshit .
So just disregard Jon Stewart as he's just a funny liberal put on earth for our amusement and is to be taken no more seriously than a masturbating monkey or something , okay ?
Enlarge By Mark Blinch , Reuters People walk by a TD Canada Trust bank in April in Toronto 's Chinatown .
The CEO of TD Bank Financial Group ordered his traders to sell what he considered risky securities long before they imploded .
A PIECE OF THE ROCK A PIECE OF THE ROCK Banks ranked on a scale from : 1 ( may need government bailout ) to 7 ( sound ) : Country Rank 1 . Canada 6.8 2 . Sweden 6.7 3 . Luxembourg 6.7 4 .

Our northern neighbor sometimes seems so similar to the United States that it's hard to tell where the USA ends and Canada begins .
Here 's one way : Canada is the place with healthy banks , taxpayers unscathed by megabillion - dollar bailouts and no need to overhaul financial regulation because it was done right the first time .
As U.S. officials scramble to prevent a crisis sequel , the ability of Canadian banks to navigate the current financial storm is earning global plaudits .
The World Economic Forum in October ranked the country 's financial institutions No. 1 in the world for solvency .
U.S. banks came in 40th , two rungs behind Botswana .
Praise for the Canadian regulatory approach has come from former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker as well as the head of the National Economic Council , Larry Summers .
" Canada has come through this period with much less financial damage than we suffered .
... I think there are some lessons in financial regulation to be gained from what 's happened in Canada , " Summers told USA TODAY in a recent interview .
Indeed , Canada 's experience is reflected in elements of the Obama administration 's proposed revamp of financial industry regulation , the most sweeping set of changes since the 1930s .
One example is an increase in the capital buffer required of financial institutions , especially those whose failure would threaten the entire system .
Canadian banks must maintain high - quality capital reserves beyond international standards , thus limiting the banks ' use of borrowed funds for investments .
( Such leveraged financial bets magnify gains if they pay off — or losses if they do n't . )
" The proposals the Obama administration have come up with are certainly along the lines of our thinking , " says Mark Carney , governor of the Bank of Canada .
But the prospect of congressional turf battles prompted the administration to shy from tackling the fragmented U.S. regulatory system , meaning perhaps the greatest Canadian lesson is being ignored .
The administration opted to leave in place multiple financial regulatory agencies rather than mimic Canada 's most distinctive feature : a single powerful regulator , the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions , with a mandate to roam across banks , insurance companies and pension plans .
" We see everything .
...
If we see something that concerns us , we tell them to fix it , " says Julie Dickson , OSFI superintendent .
Along with a consolidated regulatory system , Canada also boasts a more conservative executive - suite culture .
Canadian bankers act less like Wall Street 's masters of the universe and more like sedate , green - eyeshade types .
Regulators are n't the enemy ; they 're an early - warning system that signals financial problems before they blossom into catastrophe .
In the U.S. , some blame the financial debacle on the 1999 repeal of a Depression - era law that prohibited commercial banks from owning investment banks .
But Canada notably allowed such mergers for more than a decade without incident before the U.S. scrapped its Glass - Steagall law .
Conservative management made the difference .
In 2005 , for example , Ed Clark , CEO of TD Bank Financial Group , which operates a U.S. retail subsidiary , grew increasingly worried about the complexity of some of the securities in the bank 's portfolio .
Clark did n't fully understand how the derivatives would behave in different market environments , and he suspected no one else did either .
So he did something almost no one on Wall Street had the foresight to do :
He ordered his traders to ditch the risky but highly profitable positions .
Over the next nine months , TD gradually unwound its derivatives holdings at a cost of more than $ 200 million in write - offs , which looks like a bargain compared with the $ 2.2 trillion in losses that U.S. - originated derivatives are expected to incur this year and next , according to the International Monetary Fund .
Still , at the time it was a controversial move , even within TD 's own ranks .
" I actually said internally , ' I 'm not going to be proven right in my career , ' " Clark recalled .
" I did n't see it blowing up that fast . "
Clark is happy to take a little credit for getting a big call right .
But he says far less dramatic factors at the core of financial industry operations also explain Canada 's stability .
Canada 's Big 5 banks , which account for about 85 % of industry assets , did n't make subprime loans to customers with weak or non-existent credit ratings .
And rather than package their mortgages into securities for sale to other investors , as U.S. banks did , Canadian banks held onto the loans .
Limits on the banks ' use of borrowed money to goose their investment returns further insulated them from the woes suffered by their American counterparts .
While Canada has avoided the more than $ 1 trillion the U.S. has at risk in its financial industry rescue , it has n't been able to dodge the economic fallout .
Thanks to its close links to the U.S. , unemployment is 8.4 % and total output in April was 3 % less than one year ago .

This used to happen so often it made Twitter 's " fail whale " famous .
However , as Twitter 's popularity has exploded and the hype surrounding it has become overbearing , the fledging company has gotten its act together in terms of keeping the site up .
Not so this morning .
( Update below :
It 's a denial - of - service attack . )
As I type , Twitter has been down for just over an hour .
From the company 's status blog : " We are determining the cause and will provide an update shortly . "
And , of course , when Twitter is unavailable people notice .
Writes Dan Frommer on Silicon Alley Insider : " Twitter is down !
This seems to be happening more , recently , than in the last several months .
What 's going on , guys ?
It 's going to be tough to become the next AT&T if you 're dead at 9 a.m. on a Thursday . "
The data does n't support Frommer 's suggestion that this is happening more often , although the contention does show how difficult it can be for a company to shake a bad reputation .
According to the Web monitoring company Pingdom , this is Twitter 's first outage of more than 5 minutes duration since June 16 .
Over the past six months , the site has had just under eight hours of downtime for an uptime record of 99.8 % .
Pingdom noted Twitter 's improved uptime performance in a report released in February .
What makes the ongoing outage curious -- and perhaps troubling -- is that the site is completely inaccessible ; no fail whale this time .
( Update , 10:25 : Hugh Briss , owner of Twitter Image , adds detail to the extent of the outage : " Twitter has been down for close to an hour now and when I say down I do n't mean Fail Whale " oops we 're having a problem be back in a minute " down , I mean down as in even the API apps like TweetDeck are n't working . " )
( Update , 10:55 : From Twitter comes word they are under attack : " We are defending against a denial - of - service attack , and will update status again shortly . " )
( Update , 11:20 : Twitter says " the site is back up , but we are continuing to defend against and recover from this attack . "
I could not get on the site just now . )
( Update , 11:35 : A commenter on Reddit contends that using Ruby on Rails may be why Twitter 's off the track .
" When people say Ruby on Rails does n't scale , this is the kind of thing they 're talking about .
Twitter got much better uptime by switching their messaging back end from Ruby on Rails to Scala .
If they want to be able to survive simple DoS attacks they need to move their front end away from Ruby too . " ...
Site 's still down from where I sit . )
( Update , noon : Twitter 's back . )
( Update , 12:10 : Site is up but it wo n't let me tweet , which is akin to a bar being open without serving drinks . )
( Update , 12:40 : Our long national nightmare is over : I can tweet again . )
The L.A. County Sheriff 's Department today provided new details on the three people who were burned while protecting their homes Saturday in Big Tujunga Canyon .
Two of the people injured refused a mandatory evacuation order , said Sheriff ’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore .
He said that the two did n’t realize how serious the threat of the fire was , and that they thought they could protect themselves by jumping into a Jacuzzi .
But when the 80 - to - 100 - foot flames came barreling through their neighborhood , they were seriously burned , said Whitmore .
They managed to get themselves help , he said , and the county sent in a helicopter and airlifted them to a hospital .
Wendell Potter is the health insurance industry ’s worst nightmare .
He ’s a whistle - blower .
Potter , the former chief spokesperson for insurance giant CIGNA , recently testified before Congress , “ I saw how they confuse their customers and dump the sick — all so they can satisfy their Wall Street investors . ”
Potter was deeply involved in CIGNA and industrywide strategies for maintaining their profitable grip on U.S. health care .
He told me : “ The thing they fear most is a single - payer plan .
They fear even the public insurance option being proposed ; they ’ll pull out all the stops they can to defeat that to try to scare people into thinking that embracing a public health insurance option would lead down the slippery slope toward socialism … putting a government bureaucrat between you and your doctor .
They ’ve used those talking points for years , and they ’ve always worked . ”
In 2007 , CIGNA denied a California teenager , Nataline Sarkisyan , coverage for a liver transplant .
Her family went to the media .
The California Nurses Association joined in .
Under mounting pressure , CIGNA finally granted coverage for the procedure .
But it was too late .
Two hours later , Nataline died .
While visiting family in Tennessee , Potter stopped at a “ medical expedition ” in Wise , Va .
People drove hours for free care from temporary clinics set up in animal stalls at the local fairground .
Potter told me that weeks later , flying on a CIGNA corporate jet with the CEO : “ I realized that someone ’s premiums were helping me to travel that way … paying for my lunch on gold - trimmed china .
I thought about those men and women I had seen in Wise County … not having any idea [ how ] insurance executives lived . ”
He decided he could n’t be an industry PR hack anymore .
Insurance executives and their Wall Street investors are addicted to massive profits and double - digit annual rate increases .
To squeeze more profit , Potter says , if a person makes a major claim for coverage , the insurer will often scrutinize the person ’s original application , looking for any error that would allow it to cancel the policy .
Likewise , if a small company ’s employees make too many claims , the insurer , Potter says , “ very likely will jack up the rates so much that your employer has no alternative but to leave you and your co-workers without insurance . ”
This week , as the House and Senate introduce their health care bills , Potter warns , “ One thing to remember is that the health insurance industry has been anticipating this debate on health care for many years … they ’ve been positioning themselves to get very close to influential members of Congress in both parties . ”
Montana Sen . Max Baucus chairs the Senate Finance Committee , key for health care reform .
Potter went on , “ [ T ] he insurance industry , the pharmaceutical industry and others in health care have donated … millions of dollars to his campaigns over the past few years .
But aside from money , it ’s relationships that count … the insurance industry has hired scores and scores of lobbyists , many of whom have worked for members of Congress , and some who are former members of Congress . ”
The insurance industry and other health care interests are lobbying hard against a government - sponsored , nonprofit , public health insurance option , and are spending , according to The Washington Post , up to $ 1.4 million per day to sway Congress and public opinion .
Do n’t be fooled .
Profit - driven insurance claim denials actually kill people , and Wendell Potter knows where the bodies are buried .
His whistle - blowing may be just what ’s needed to dump what ’s sick in our health care system .

Melissa Brandts was n't trying to take a photo of this ground squirrel at Banff National Park .

Ring light 4.0 : fiber optic TTL ring flash
Note from the author : my ring light pages have had hundreds of thousands of visits since I started writing them back in 2005 .
Fuzzcraft has been stampeded by StumbleUpon , has starred on Hackaday and DIYphotography , and is constantly being linked to from flickr , strobist and other blogs , forums , etc .
I thank you all .
It 's nice to have done something that appeals to so many people .
There 's something magical about ringlights .
The unnatural light cast , the halo shadows .
Yet the idea behind them is as clever as it is simple : looking through the light source .
Overview
Want to see more ring lights ?
See my full ring light overview page Quick overview : 4.1 Fiber optic TTL flash ring light , uses popup flash and 67 fiberglass bundles 4.0 Fiber optic TTL flash ring light , uses popup flash and 120 plastic fibers 3.1 2 CCFL continuous ring light 3.0 4 CCFL continuous ring light 2.1 52 mm filter mount 140 LED continuous ring light 2.0 52 mm filter mount 90 LED continuous ring light 1.0 Simple , 30 LED continuous ring light
You can't deny I 'm full of ideas .
After 5 earlier attempts at getting shadowless light onto a macro scene , some good , some bad , this is yet another approach : fiber optics .
I have n't seen many people try this .
The only good example is from a gentleman named Gene F. Rhodes , whose website has been offline for quite some time , but he 's far from enthousiastic about it himself .
Pete Ganzel did a project with a solid acrylic light guide .
Other fiber flash projects here and here , but 6 or 12 fibers are n't going to do the trick .
I aim to put over 100 fibers into this project .
I got myself 100 m of 1 mm unjacketed acrylic optic fiber .
This is the stuff they use for star ceilings .
I got it from fiberopticproducts.com .
The window on my main camera 's internal flash measures 20 x 6 mm , so it 'll fit 120 fibers .
Covering the whole window with fiber ends will put nearly all the available light ( theoretically 78 % ) into the fibers and onto the subject , but the high fiber count also makes it possible to get very evenly distributed light without the need for a diffuser .
I considered using larger diameter fibers , but I suspect these are much stiffer and wo n't spread the light as evenly as the small fibers .
Not having to use a diffuser will not reduce light output , while still having the option of adding one when light output is not very important .
Why am I using the internal flash for this and go though the trouble of mounting over a hundred little fibers ?
For several reasons :
Power : even at its relatively low power level ( most internal camera strobes are around 10 Ws ) , the internal flash still blows away continuous lights , including 1,000 Watts tungsten bulbs , let alone LEDs
TTL auto exposure : on most cameras , the internal flash has a very sophisticated TTL light metering system attached that almost guarantees accurate exposure with every single shot
Portability is an important factor as well
It has to be low cost ( duh ! ) .
A real ring flash is not worth the investment for me .
Building a real ring flash myself is an option , using a number of disposable camera flashes , but something like that will not be very portable and potentially dangerous , nor will the power level be adjustable .
It wo n't even support TTL light metering .
Maybe if I let it exactly mimic the master flash this might be worth a shot .
Ring light 5.0 ..?
For the ring mount , I got a 72 to 77 mm filter step - up ring .
I ordered a whole bunch of rings so I can fit the ring to other ( and future ) lenses .
The only problem with short lenses ( like the 50 mm 1.7 ) will be the excess length of fiber .
But it remains to be seen just how much trouble it will be .
Click thumbnails to zoom in .
Click again to zoom out , or use cursor keys to walk through all images .
1 1 . So , the dreaded cutting of plastic rings starts again !
I 'll save you the tiny details .
For some ring cutting examples , see the previous ringlights .
This is the mount .
The gap is there to be able to add a connector or something like that .
2 2 . Attached to the lens it looks like this .
Then it occured to me , that if I make a universal base mount , I 'd be able to exchange stuff without having to make a new filter mount every time .
And thus the fuzzmount was born !
The ring you see above is all there 's to it , really .
Any attachment will get a rear extended tube that shifts snugly over the fuzzmount .
The first attachment will be the fiber ring light .
Next was fitting the 25 cm fibers .
The actual outer ring to attach the fibers to measures 95.5 mm in diameter , meaning a circumference of 300 mm .
For 120 fibers , this means a spacing of 2.5 mm .
I prepared a plastic connector housing with a spacing of 2.54 mm - close enough - to hold the fibers in place while pressing them into double sided tape temporarily .
In addition , I stuck a lined paper strip onto the tube for fine tuning .
After everything 's in place , another plastic ring will act as a cover and the whole thing will be glued tight with polyurethane .
It 's important to use a socalled " inert " glue for this , like polyurethane , because any solvent based glue might damage the fibers .
To come to this conclusion , I tested several kinds of glue :
Hard plastic glue ( for PVC and ABS ) dissolves the fiber
Neoprene contact glue ( called " Bison kit " in Europe ) is tough as heck , but slightly eats the fiber
Silicone ( caulking ) does n't stick
Hot melt glue ( tack gun ) melts the fiber
Superglue ( cyanoacrylate ) eats the fiber surface
Modeling glue ( for polystyrene ) does n't stick
Pattex blue backed double sided tape ( NOT the red backed stuff ) is OK for temporary fixing
Pattex polyurethane glue ( " Krachtlijm " in Dutch , " Colle Forte " in French ) is the best I 've found .
This stuff may have many different names .
Just look for the word polyurethane , and make sure the stuff does n't foam up , like many polyurethane glues do .
3 3 . The fiber spacing tool .
4 4 . Sticking the fibers onto double sided tape .
5 5 . All fibers done , outer ring in place ( there 's still a gap to fill ) , glue setting while a tightened string presses everything together .
6 6 . And this is the contraption I ended up with .
You can see the fuzzmount in the center with the ring holding the fibers around it , fiber ends polished and all .
For those of you who will attempt this after reading this article , here 's a tip : get proper tools to polish the ends of every single fiber !
Otherwise forget the whole project .
If you do n't polish you may easily lose 75 % of your light output , because the light will hardly enter the rough fiber end at the flash head side .
It does n't have to be shiny like a mirror , but leaving rough cuts would seriously spoil the results .
Polishing requires you to get a 3 μm polishing film and takes a lot of time , not to mention it 's tedious as heck .
But patience is a virtue .
On the other hand , you 're already halfway there if you use a razor blade or other dangerously sharp blade to cut the fibers in the first place .
Next is connecting the 120 fiber ends to the flash head on my camera .
It has to be easily detachable , preferrably with a clip thingy or something .
Disappointingly , I discovered that , while 1 little fiber is very flexible , managing a bundle of 120 of these things is kind of a hassle .
Putting the spring tension of this bundle onto the pop -up flash mechanism might damage it .
Luckily , I also discovered that the temperature - controlled hot air soldering gun at my work place ( A Weller WMD - 3 ) is the perfect tool for safely and very slowly forming the fiber , and thus easing the tension .
A hair dryer , very carefully applied , could also do the trick ( at your own risk ! ) .
A reader got great results with hot water .
7 7 . On with the show !
I took some scrap pieces of acrylic and made a place holder for the fibers .
Remember that nearly every camera is different when it comes to the shape of its pop-up flash , so what 's shown here only works for the Konica Minolta Dynax / Maxxum 5D .
But the general idea should work for many cameras .
It proved impossible to get the fiber ends to line up correctly in the window .
What I did was push them all through , making sure the shortest fiber was also sticking out the window .
Then I glued everything tight .
I can't stress enough to use polyurethane glue for this .
The glue takes a few days on a warm , humid place to harden completely .
Then , using a razor blade or scalpel , cut the fibers , so they are flush with the adapter .
Depending on how neat the cuts are , you may want to polish the ends with polishing film ( or a dremel and a felt polishing wheel , if you can't get real polishing film ) .
8 8 . This is how it all adds up .
9 9 . View from the front .
A cross section of the adapter :
A : fiber bundle whose spring tension keeps it pressed lightly against the flash head
B : support plate that holds the fiber bundle at the correct height from the top of the camera
C : flash head
D : guide that slides snugly underneith the bridge shaped flash head and prevents the bundle from snapping off the head
E : top of camera housing
As you can see , I meticulously formed the bundle into a downward angle .
The flexibility of the bundle leaves a lot to be desired , but the way it is now , it fits the Sigma 17 - 70 lens ( my best performing macro ) fully extended and every lens that has about the same length .
With the bundle split in two halves , operation of the the zoom and manual focus rings is surprizingly easy .
The connector plate is held in place by a small amount of spring tension from the bundle , which obviously increases when the lens is retracted .
But , at this time , I see no need to improve the fit of the adapter .
10 10 .
Now , the answer to the question you 've all been asking : how does it perform ?
Image straight from camera , ISO100 , 70 mm , f/16
11 11 .
Well , to tell you the truth : it works absolutely great !
Image straight from camera , ISO100 , 70 mm , f/5.6
12 12 .
Shot in near darkness , using strobe focus assist and red - eye reduction .
Again , straight from camera , ISO100 , 70 mm , f/4.5
Now the incredible part , which is proof of success to me : for the bottle photo above , I was able to completely stop down to f/36 at ISO 100 and still the flash had n't run out of power !
I did notice a magenta color cast at f/36 , which may be due to reflections from the direct surroundings , probably my own face .
But who knows , maybe the lens was at fault .
It does n't matter , because no SLR lens is very sharp at f/36 .
Now the other incredible part , which is what this project has cost me :
30 m of 1 mm plastic optic fiber : about € 10
Filter step - up ring 72 - 77 mm : € 7,50
Monacor MBR - 85 bass port ( for the plastic rings ) : appx .
€ 10
Glue and tape : appx . € 5
Total amount : about € 33 .
The bass port came from my junkbox , and glue and tape are things every DIYer should have anyway .
So what I really spent on this is more like € 17 .
Some recent shots with my Sony Alpha 700 .
The standoff does n't really fit perfectly , maxing out the flash power quite rapidly at f/16 and ISO 200 , but I just wanted to try the ring on the Alpha 700 , and the results are quite good .
After this 10 minute shoot , however , the smell of melting plastic became apparent , and I had to dismount the ring to let the standoff cool down .
The battery was draining fast as well , with the flash popping at such high power .
13 13 . ISO200 , 70 mm , f/16
14 14 . ISO200 , 70 mm , f/8
15 15 . ISO200 , 70 mm , f/13
16 16 . ISO200 , 70 mm , f/16
What I would 've done differently is the length of fiber .
I started out with just 25 cm per fiber strand , and it proved to be a lot of trouble .
I believe longer fibers will put less stress on the camera parts , especially the pop -up flash .
The dangling bundle below the camera is probably something one would just have to get used to .
But for such a low budget solution with such astonishing results , this is a small price to pay .
Maybe I 'll build another one , so I can use them with different lenses , especially my sharpest tool in the shed , a 50 mm f/1.7 , and do portraits .
For this to work I 'll probably also have to use a ring diffuser .
Another option would be to use a telescopic light shaft to deal with different lens lengths .
The ring would simply get a protrusion where the light will enter from a rectangular telescopic tube running straight to the flash window .
Something like this :
Hover over the drawing to see the effect
A : telescopic rectangular aluminium tube , polished on the inside
B : support plate
C : flash head
D : guide that slides snugly underneith the bridge shaped flash head
E : camera body
F : zoom lens or non-internal focus lens
G : ring shaped light guide

Paper books may be low tech , but no one will tell you how and where you can read them .
For many people , the problem with electronic books is that they come loaded with just those kinds of restrictions .
Digital books bought today from Amazon.com , for example , can be read only on Amazon ’s Kindle device or its iPhone software .
Some restrictions on the use of e-books are likely to remain a fact of life .
But some publishers and consumer electronics makers are aiming to give e-book buyers more flexibility by rallying around a single technology standard for the books .
That would also help them counter Amazon , which has taken an early lead in the nascent market .
On Thursday , Sony Electronics , which sells e-book devices under the Reader brand , plans to announce that by the end of the year it will sell digital books only in the ePub format , an open standard created by a group including publishers like Random House and HarperCollins .
Sony will also scrap its proprietary anticopying software in favor of technology from the software maker Adobe that restricts how often e-books can be shared or copied .
After working on the latest cover for Macworld Magazine , Peter Belanger decided to show what is involved in making a cover , focusing on the three main areas : photography , photoshop and design .
Photographer Peter Belanger captured his work for a Macworld cover design by using time lapse and the finished video is remarkable .
The amount of camera equipment used to get what appears to be a fairly simply shot is surprising .
Photography is not an area I work with very often so maybe this is normal but it makes me want to explore it some more .
abc
Along with Peter is Rob Schultz who does all of the Photoshop work in the video and I believe does the layout design as well .
He uses a favorite software of mine Indesign but I would have guessed Quark for the layout of an Apple related product .
Anyway , check out the video below .
Make sure to stop by Peters portfolio site and check out his amazing photography .

Tech Specs :
Time lapse video was shot on a Canon 5D Mark II with a 24 mm - 70 mm zoom .
The actual Macworld cover was taken with a Phase One P65 + digital back attached to a 4Ã — 5 Sinar X camera with a 65 mm lens .

It should come as no surprise that Patri Friedman , son of anarcho - capitalist professor David Friedman , and grandson of Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman , is a guy who prides himself on having innovative and controversial ideas .
The project he ’s been devoted to for the past year and a half is called the Seasteading Institute , a research center with a mission “ to further the establishment and growth of permanent , autonomous , ocean communities , enabling innovation with new political and social systems . ”
Where did the youngest Friedman get this idea ?
“ I wanted to find other countries that I could possibly settle in , ” Friedman said .
“ After researching places that people have ex-patriated to like Costa Rica , I realized that no country is better than the USA .
So I looked into the idea of forming new nations .
The ocean is the best place to do this , because in the ocean you do n’t have to fight with others as you would have to on land . ”
The Institute defines seasteading as creating “ permanent dwellings on the ocean — homesteading the high seas . ”
Friedman cites Marshall Savage ’s The Millenial Project : How To Conquer The Galaxy In Eight Easy Steps and Wayne Gramlich , the man who coined the term “ seasteading ” in the early 80s , as inspirations for his work .
Gramlich happened to live just two miles from Friedman :
The two met and the rest is history , or should I say future .
Friedman ’s ideal is to live in a society where the rules are his own morals .
He says that this approach was selfish at first , but he then realized that he could create a movement that is larger than his own personal utopia .
“ Let lots of different groups try out their own ideas about utopia , ” he said .
“ They could vote to have a communist government .
Small numbers of people can try a better way to live .
A colony could start with about 100 people .
They ’d have to be dedicated but you do n’t have to find that many of them . ”
But creating utopias would n’t be the only benefit of seasteading : Friedman believes that mobile , floating societies will be more
resistant to climate change than land - based civilizations , particularly when fighting rising sea levels .
“ The threat of an ice age is much more disastrous than global warming , ” he said .
And should such an ice age come , Friedman thinks , it would be easier to move people toward the equator if they lived on seasteads instead of on land .
As for how these seasteads would be powered , there ’s solar energy , wind energy , wave energy , algae and phytoplankton energy , oceanic thermal energy , and more .
Fossil fuels would only serve as a backup energy source .
Though Friedman received an initial $ 500 k investment from Paypal founder Peter Thiel in 2008 , the financial meltdown has crushed his first dreams of creating a luxury hotel / colony off the coast of Southern California any time soon .
When I asked him if he thinks he ’ll see these ideas come to fruition in his lifetime , the 33 - year - old Friedman said , “ It wo n’t be for at least another decade , but I have many decades left . ”
Ron Paul 's Heirs or Will the Revolution Be Televised in 2010 ?
Texas Rep. Ron Paul 's fundraising success in 2008 has spawned copycats in 2010 .

The 2008 campaign may be over but the lasting " revolution " spawned by Rep. Ron Paul 's ( R - Texas ) candidacy continues to echo through the political world .
Paul , capitalizing on a healthy distrust of government and his strident opposition to the war in Iraq , became an Internet phenomenon -- using the web to raise an astounding $ 35 million for his longshot candidacy .
The financial network built by Paul during his presidential race has , somewhat amazingly , continued to produce for two men seeking to serve as the Congressman 's political heirs .
Rand Paul , who is running for the Senate in Kentucky and is the son of the Congressman , has already raked in $ 822,000 despite the fact that nearly the entire GOP establishment in the Bluegrass State has lined up behind Secretary of State Trey Grayson .
Peter Schiff , an economic adviser to Paul 's presidential campaign and a likely candidate for Senate in Connecticut , has raised $ 998,000 for his bid -- despite the fact he has yet to officially declare .
Both men have employed the " money bomb " approach ( encourage donors to all give on a certain day to post large 24 hour totals ) to fundraising that Paul pioneered in 2008 .
Jesse Benton , a spokesman for Paul during the campaign , said that he was not all surprised by the amounts of money both Rand Paul and Schiff had been able to raise to date .
He called the Paul movement " legitimate " and " real " , noting that the Campaign for Liberty -- an organization formed in the aftermath of the campaign and on which Paul serves as honorary chairman -- had raised $ 4 million since its founding in February .
" These are people who want to return to our traditional values of self reliance and liberty , " added Benton .
It remains to be seen whether either Rand Paul or Peter Schiff can crack the code to turn fundraising capacity into actual votes .
While Ron Paul raised vast sums of cash and had -- without question -- the most vocal and energized group of supporters on the Republican side , he was never a real factor in any state .
Paul won 10 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses -- good for fourth place -- and crested 20 percent in a handful of primaries and caucuses including North Dakota ( 21 percent ) , Montana ( 25 percent ) and Idaho ( 24 percent ) .
But , overall , he remained a bit player in the race for the Republican nomination .
Polling conducted in Kentucky suggests his son is a more legitimate threat to the party establishment .
Grayson led Paul 40 percent to 25 percent in a primary matchup conducted by Research 2000 for the liberal Daily Kos blog .
Schiff has fared far less well in polling on the Connecticut race .
In a late July Quinnipiac survey , Schiff did n't even receive one percent of the vote .
( Ouch ! )
Of Schiff 's candidacy , political analyst Stu Rothenberg wrote : " A majority of Connecticut Republicans are not ready for the second coming of Ron Paul . "
We tend to agree with Rothenberg that while the Paul message is VERY appealing to a small group of voters , it does n't sell well when presented to the broader electorate .
( Otherwise , we would have been listening to President Paul address a joint session of Congress last night . )
Still , the sums of money that Paul-ites have donated to Senate candidates in Connecticut and Kentucky are impressive and suggest that the Ron Paul Revolution -- such as it is -- may not be over just yet .
Energy giant Chevron Australia has signed deals worth up to $ 70 billion to supply liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) to Japan and South Korea over the next 25 years .
Chevron says it will supply Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas with a total of nearly 2.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year .
In a separate deal , Chevron will provide the South Korean energy company GS Caltex with 500,000 tonnes per year .
The gas will come from the Gorgon gas fields off the Western Australian coast .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has told Parliament the project will provide an enormous boost to the national economy .
" These are massive projects that will generate economic growth , income , jobs and prosperity for the nation for decades to come , " he said .
" In light of this announcement , I would congratulate Chevron Australia ; these sales do not come to pass easily .
" I 'll also congratulate our counterparts in the Western Australian Government . "
Last month ExxonMobil signed a $ 50 billion deal with China to supply 2.25 million tonnes of gas over the next two decades , also from the Gorgon gas field .
The Gorgon project , a joint venture between Chevron , ExxonMobil and Shell , is expected to generate $ 40 billion in Government revenue and create 6,000 jobs at the peak of construction .
The West Australian Opposition Leader Eric Ripper has welcomed the agreement but says the State Government has to make sure the investment translates into work for West Australians .
" There needs to be a strong focus on local content to make sure that the state and its people get full benefit from these massive investments in prospect , " he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - News Corp , which is trying to stem newspaper revenue declines , could charge for access to its news websites by the middle of next year , and might break off its relationship with Amazon.com Inc ’s Kindle e-reader if it can not get better terms .
Rupert Murdoch , CEO of News Corp , arrives for lunch at the Sun Valley Inn in Sun Valley , Idaho July 10 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
Rupert Murdoch , chief executive of the global media empire , said on Thursday that he is unhappy with the Kindle ’s control of relationships with newspaper subscribers , and might seek a better deal with rival e-reader maker Sony Corp .
Amazon officials did not return calls seeking comment .
Murdoch ’s comments come after News Corp , whose properties include The Wall Street Journal , cable programmers , local TV stations and movie studios , reported a 10.7 percent drop in quarterly revenue to $ 7.67 billion , which was in line with expectations , according to Reuters Estimates .
It forecast operating revenue for fiscal 2010 , which ends next June , would rise in the high single digits on 4 percent revenue growth .
“ I think it looks reasonable , ” said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank .
“ They gave a pretty realistic view of where the growth is coming from and where it is not going to come from , particularly the advertising - supported businesses . ”
Shares of News Corp were flat in extended trading .
Murdoch said the worst might be over .
But another fight looms : persuading millions of people to pay for news on the Internet when most get it for free .
He did not provide details on a conference call with reporters and analysts , but said that he wants to make people pay for access to his news websites by the middle of the 2010 fiscal year , which ends next June .
“ An industry that gives away its content is cannibalizing its ability to do good reporting , ” Murdoch said .
The Wall Street Journal , owned by News Corp ’s Dow Jones unit , now offers some paid and some free stories .
The move would affect news websites visited by millions of people around the world , including popular tabloids like the New York Post and The Sun in London , as well as other papers such as The Times of London and The Australian .
Publishers including
The New York Times are searching for ways to charge for news online , convinced that they must not give news through search engines such as Google and Yahoo .
Many new media experts say it would gut the ad revenue they get now and drive people away .
SLOW EXIT FROM TOUGH TIMES
News Corp ’s results reflected the tough conditions that media companies have operated in since the financial crisis took over headlines last year .
Its net loss was $ 203 million , or 8 cents a share , for the fiscal fourth quarter , ended June 30 , primarily because of charges at the unit that includes the MySpace social network .
Net income last year was $ 1.13 billion , or 43 cents a share .
TV revenue , including at its Fox Television Stations unit , fell as local TV station ad revenue fell 27 percent .
The HarperCollins book publisher lost $ 1 million on a 20 percent revenue decline .
News Corp ’s “ other ” segment , which houses MySpace and Fox Interactive Media , reported an operating loss of $ 136 million because of lower ad revenue at MySpace , which is facing rising competition from Facebook .
Revenue rose , however , at the filmed entertainment division , helped by DVD sales of films such as “ Slumdog Millionaire ” and “ Marley & Me . ” Cable revenue also rose .
News
Corp shares have more than doubled since hitting a low of $ 4.95 in March , as big media companies from Time Warner Inc to Viacom and CBS Corp have said in recent weeks that ad declines are beginning to ease .
News Corp ’s results reflect “ the general notion that the other media conglomerates have reiterated over the past week that the worst is behind us , ” said Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce .
Excluding impairment charges at MySpace and other business units , adjusted operating income was 19 cents a share , compared with 30 cents last year , about in line with Street estimates .

State may close park gates , but it wo n't keep me out
Logic gives you what you need .
Passion gives you what you crave .
In the end , it 's passion that feeds your dreams or part of you dies .
When it comes to logic , it makes financial sense to keep all state parks open .
Last year , state parks had 79.6 user visits that generated $ 2.6 billion in spending during those trips .
For every dollar the state put into parks , it generated $ 2.35 in tax revenue .
Yet in his last - minute line - item budget cuts , Gov. Schwarzenegger slashed general fund money to state parks .
That cut is equal to only one quarter of 1 percent of the state 's $ 24.3 billion budget deficit , yet could close 100 parks starting in September .
When it comes to passion , I 'll tell you this : Nobody is going to keep me out of the state parks .
A lot of people feel exactly the same .
We share one thing in common .
We have spots in parks where we know " The Power of Place , " where we are free of all cares .
These spots make us whole .
One of these places for me is in the interior of Big Basin Redwoods State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains , at the brink of Silver Falls in Berry Creek Canyon .
You can touch the water as it flows past and watch it sail over the cliff , then turn to your right and take in the lower cascade of Golden Falls , flowing like a giant golden water slide .
Big Basin Redwoods is one of the parks that probably will be on the list of park closures because loses money on offseason weekdays .
But when the waterfalls flow in Berry Creek Canyon , I 'm going .
They can close Big Basin headquarters , gate the road and parking lots , put up no parking signs and have helicopter surveillance , but I 'll go .
I know the woods better than they do , and I defy them to catch me .
It 's also my belief that the state 's residents already own these parks , and we do n't need somebody 's OK to use what already belongs to us , within rules designed to prevent damage , of course .
Some time after Labor Day , the first closures will start .
That is when the flow of user - fee money from day - use and camping always slows , especially on weekdays .
The best estimates are 100 parks will get locked up this fall , possibly 25 in the Bay Area , and a lot more next year .
Parks avoiding closure will be those with OHV use and boat ramps , which are self - funding , and parks where local groups , and county or national park units step forward to help fund and run them .
The conflict will spark when the gates are locked and " park closed " signs go up , and people go anyway .
You do n't suddenly tell millions of people they can't go for a hike at their favorite parks .
Case closed : A boating accident at Clear Lake two years ago that led to the death of a passenger and attracted the attention of boaters across the state was put to a close this past week when a Lake County jury acquitted the driver of a sailboat of two charges and deadlocked on a third .
Bismarck Dinius of Carmichael was at the tiller of a friend 's sailboat running at night when a speedboat running at more than 40 mph plowed over the top , killing a woman who was aboard the sailboat .
The driver of the speedboat , an off - duty sheriff , claimed Dinius was operating the sailboat without its running lights on as required at night .
The defense , however , presented expert witnesses that testified that the sailboats running lights were on .
A Lake County jury found Dinius not guilty of felony boating under the influence causing great bodily injury and a misdemeanor count of boating under the influence .
The jury deadlocked 11 - 1 in favor of not guilty on a charge that he was boating with a blood alcohol level more than 0.08 .
The operator of the speedboat , Russell Perdock , faced no charges .

An 1890 photograph , where a stuffed black mountain lion ( or something like it ) is sitting on a balcony in the background , was passed along by John Hibble of Aptos .
The photo is from a building located in what is now Forest of Nisene Marks State Park .
It could be a jaguar , but Hibble believes it is a black mountain lion .

Two mountain lions were spotted at 100 yards along with a few deer carcasses at a ranch near Tomales in Marin County , reported Michael Hart in Marshall .

Stunning :
The sight of 400 big trees , probably about 600 in all , cut down last week near the pet cemetery in the Presidio as part of the Doyle Drive project in San Francisco is a shock for those who did n't know it was coming .
Jeremiah Cummings Blames His Misfortune on HBO Host Bill Maher 's 2008 Film ' Religulous ' Jeremiah Cummings blames his woes on his interview in Maher 's film " Religulous . "
Sept. 24 , 2009  --
Preacher Jeremiah Cummings says his life was changed forever – and not for the better – after he appeared in political commenter Bill Maher 's documentary " Religulous . "
According to Cummings , Maher " ruined [ his ] life . "
Cummings sued Lionsgate Entertainment , the film 's distributor , for defamation of character and sought $ 50 million in damages .
He later dropped the case , but says the film has triggered lawsuits against him and impoverished him .
The preacher wants his life back , he says .
" They are not telling the whole story the way I gave the interview , " Cummings , 58 , told ABCNews.com of his appearance in the 2008 film in which Maher interviewed the Orlando - based evangelist .
As a result of the film , Cummings says that he's now unable to pay the rent on his Orlando home that he shares with his wife and three of his children , and has stopped getting requests for speaking engagements .
" This film hurt me tremendously , " said Cummings .
Cummings said that his troubles began in November 2006 when he was approached to be in a documentary for the PBS Broadcasting Network titled " A Spiritual Journey , " in which he was to discuss his " faith and conversion . "
Cummings , who was a member of the Philadelphia soul group Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes in the 1970s , is a former Muslim who converted to Christianity in 1997 .
But that documentary was not at all what it seemed , according to Cummings , who says in the complaint that his " true character was totally distorted on screen before millions of viewers for laughs . "
In the film , Maher asks Cummings to discuss how rock icons and religious leaders always seem to be dressed in " elaborate costumes . "
When Maher presses Cummings about his outfit during the interview , the reverend responds , " I always dress well " and notes that his shoes are not made of alligator , as the host suggested , but are lizard skin .
Maher does not let up , asking Cummings if it's not true that Jesus " championed the poor . "
The film then cuts to Cummings saying , " I like gold " and " People want you to look well . "
A Lionsgate spokeswoman dismissed Cummings ' complaints , noting that he dropped the case voluntarily .
She said the company " had no further comment . "
In a 2008 interview with The Los Angeles Times , Maher was asked how he was able to get people to agree to talk to him for the film .
Maher told the paper , " It was simple :
We never , ever used my name .
We never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews .
We even had a fake title for the film .
We called it ' A Spiritual Journey . ' "
Cummings says that he " did n't even know Maher " was going to be interviewing him until he sat down for the taping in November 2006 and that he 's sure " things were added " to the segment that he appears in during the editing process .
In June , after Cummings decided to drop the lawsuit " for the sake of his children , " the reverend says that a Maher producer offered him the opportunity to appear on Maher 's HBO talk show to discuss his gripes with " Religulous . "
" That 's not what I wanted .
I did n't want to go on his show , " said Cummings .
" I wanted a financial settlement because [ Lionsgate ] is making millions of dollars using me in the wrong way . "
But dropping the lawsuit was n't the end of Cummings ' legal woes .
Just three weeks before the suit with Lionsgate was dropped , Cummings was sued by two former parishioners from a ministry , the Amazing Life Outreach Church , that he started in Raleigh , N.C. , in the fall of 2006 .
The parishioners , Elsie Carter and Rodney - Daryl Jones , claim in the suit filed in Wake County that Cummings stole at least $ 400,000 from members of the ministry for his " personal use . "
Cummings , who says he has not been served with paperwork to appear in court , called Carter and Jones ' allegations " false " and accuses them of suing him for money they thought he'd get in a settlement with Lionsgate .
" I think it was done basically to continue to defame me and discredit me as a person , " said Cummings .
" These folks thought I was going to get a settlement . "
Reached by phone at her Raleigh home , Carter said " No " when asked if she sued Cummings in hopes that she would get some of the money he had requested from Lionsgate .
Today , Cummings says he regrets ever going to North Carolina , a decision he said led to him having to contemplate filing for bankruptcy and worrying how to feed his family .
" I need to start thinking about food stamps , " said Cummings .
" The biggest mistake I ever made was going to Raleigh , " he said .
" I should have remained out on the road and kept going as an evangelist , teaching people about faith . "
" I want my life back . "
Why Want to Be a Networker ?
Looking at the industry of network marketing people are fascinated by the lifestyle networkers are leading .
You need not be a millionaire to have lots of freedom – work from home to you schedule , earning not a linear but a recurring income to quote only a few features .
Now what is a linear income – it is an income which stops the moment your performance stops .
Look at at a lawyer or a shoe maker or a taxi driver or in fact many other professions – in each case the income stops as soon as you quit doing your job .
A recurring income is an income which keeps coming in after having done something right once .
What could that be – it could be a singer who recorded a cd which keeps being sold again and again earning him a constant income , or a writer who wrote a best seller book which keeps being sold , but of course it could be a network marketer who built his business once and solid .
Having such a recurring income permits the person a relaxed and comfortable lifestyle without having to worry about orders or money or a job – wow what a benefit to have .
Linear and recurring can be applied to other areas of business as well .
For example buying a car , providing you pay it in cash would be a linear purchase whereas the rent for a flat would be a recurring expense .
Provided you have paid into a pension scheme your pension will be a recurring income too .
Many people , however , cannot afford to pay enough into pension schemes that their pension will permit them to maintain their accustomed lifestyle once they are pensioners .
Therefore it is no surprise that many people want to become networkers and build a recurring income that will permit them to maintain their desired lifestyle .
Next time we will be looking as to what has to be watched out for when choosing a network marketing opportunity , that everything is in place and solid , so that the business will not only pay their retirement but will also pay their children and grandchildren !

Your Mentor with a Servant ’s Heart
Being born a Jill , I always have had an involuntary relationship with the name “ Jack . ”
For a few months in high school , I even dated a Jack .
I was thrilled when we broke up because I no longer had to hear the nursery rhyme every day .
But what is it about the name that has made it so dominant in our society ?
Why is it such a popular name ?
All this and more can be revealed when you just admit that “ you do n’t know Jack . ”

About the Name :
Phrases :
The namecame from a Middle English word , “ jakke , ” used to refer to any male , particularly those of the lower classes .
Many people mistakenly believe the name comes from “ Jacques , ” which came from the names Jacob and James .
English speakers associated the name Jack with John much more often than these other names , so the similar sounds are purely coincidental .
In the UK , the name is the most popular name for male babies between 2003 and 2007 .
In England , it has been the top name since 1994 .
The name is much less common in America , ranking in the top 30 - 40 names of male babies , but it is still much more popular than it was around 20 years ago , when it was closer to the 175th ranking .has been used for centuries and refers to a person who could do a variety of tasks .
The use of the word “ Jack ” was only included because it was still being used as a generic term for ‘ man ’ at the time .
It was not originally a negative expression , but at some point , people started adding on the phrase “ master of none , ” which made for a whole new meaning .
It can now refer to either phrase and , as a result , can be bad or good depending on the context .

And Jill came tumbling after .
Up Jack got and home did trot
As fast as he could caper ;
And went to bed to mend his head
With vinegar and brown paper .

Mother vexed did whip her next
For causing Jack 's disaster .
Now Jack did laugh and Jill did cry
But her tears did soon abate ;
Then Jill did say that they should play

Eventually , it began being used as a term for very little .

Official guidance to stop therapists offering gay people treatment to " change " their sexuality was called for today by the National Secular Society .
It made the move in response to a decision by the American Psychological Association to discourage its 150,000 members from making such claims .

In a letter to the Royal College of Psychiatrists , president of the NSS Terry Sanderson wrote : " We would like to suggest that the Royal College of Psychiatrists considers issuing an advisory to its own members that they should not offer to provide these therapies nor suggest that people seek them out elsewhere - particularly from religious groups .
" Enough research has now been done in this area to show that the therapies are not only ineffective , but often lead on to further problems . "
The NSS cited a survey by University College London of 1,300 therapists earlier this year which found that a minority had tried to change patients ' sexuality .
Mr Sanderson said : " The idea of curing homosexuals comes these days mostly from evangelical Christian groups who are convinced that the Bible condemns homosexual practice .
" Telling people that they can be " cured " of their sexual orientation suggests that it is an illness , and to suggest that they can be " converted " to heterosexuality raises hopes that will eventually be dashed , possibly leading to depression and suicidal impulses . "
The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it took the call " very seriously " .
A spokeswoman said : " The college takes very seriously the call by the National Secular Society to issue broader guidance to our members and will look into the issue further . "
Earlier this year the college said it shared American concerns over these practices , and that lesbian , gay and bisexual people had the right to be protected from potentially damaging therapies .

Changes Would Pose Serious Threat To Americans ’ Personal Information , Says ACLU
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 ; media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union submitted comments today to the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) opposing its recent proposal to reverse current federal policy and allow the use of web tracking technologies , like cookies , on federal government websites .
Cookies can be used to track an Internet user ’s every click and are often linked across multiple websites ; they frequently identify particular people .
Since 2000 , it has been the policy of the federal government not to use such technology .
But the OMB is now seeking to change that policy and is considering the use of cookies for tracking web visitors across multiple sessions and storing their unique preferences and surfing habits .
Though this is a major shift in policy , the announcement of this program consists of only a single page from the federal register that contains almost no detail .
“ This is a sea change in government privacy policy , ” said Michael Macleod - Ball , Acting Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ Without explaining this reversal of policy , the OMB is seeking to allow the mass collection of personal information of every user of a federal government website .
Until the OMB answers the multitude of questions surrounding this policy shift , we will continue to raise our strenuous objections . ”
The use of cookies allows a website to differentiate between users and build a database of each user ’s viewing habits and the information they share with the site .
Since web surfers frequently share information like their name or email address ( if they ’ve signed up for a service ) or search request terms , the use of cookies frequently allows a user ’s identity and web surfing habits to be linked .
In addition , websites can allow third parties , such as advertisers , to also place cookies on a user ’s computer .
“ Americans rely on the information from the federal government to research politics , medical issues and legal requirements .
The OMB is now asking to retain the personal and identifiable information we leave behind , ” said Christopher Calabrese , Counsel for the ACLU Technology and Liberty Project .
“ No American should have to sacrifice privacy or risk surveillance in order to access free government information .
No policy change should be adopted without wide ranging debate including information on the restrictions and uses of cookies as well as impact on privacy . ”
Obama Called Police Officer Who Arrested Gates , Still Sees ' Overreaction ' in Arrest
The president explained his remarks in a surprise appearance before reporters .
July 24 , 2009  -- President Obama called the Cambridge police officer who arrested his friend , prominent Harvard University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , but did not go so far as to say he apologized to the sergeant for saying the police acted " stupidly " during the incident .
Late today , Gates ' attorney , Charles Ogletree , told ABC News that his client was " relieved and excited " by the president 's telephone outreach .
" It 's going to bring together not only the parties to this particular episode but a larger community dialogue about how citizens and police can have more productive and effective exchanges , " Ogletree said .
Representatives of Sgt. James Crowley released a statement saying Crowley was " profoundly grateful " for the phone call .
" It is clear to us from this conversation that the president respects police officers and the often difficult and dangerous situations we face on a daily basis .
We appreciate his sincere interest and willingness to reconsider his remarks about the Cambridge Police Department , " the statement read .
Earlier today in an unannounced trip to the White House press room , the president clarified remarks he made at the end of Wednesday night 's press conference , reiterating his point that " there was an overreaction in pulling Professor Gates out of his home . "
But Obama said he had a cordial conversation with Crowley , who had complained about the president 's criticism .
Obama said laughingly he had a discussion with Crowley about the three of them having beer at the White House .
The president 's spokesman said it was Crowley 's idea for the three to get together for a beer .
According to Gates ' attorney , Gates does n't drink beer but he 'll show - up for the meeting .
The president also called Gates following his impromptu remarks and invited the Harvard professor to join him at the White House with Crowley in the near future .
" Because this has been ratcheting up -- and I obviously helped to contribute ratcheting it up -- I want to make clear that in my choice of words , I think , I unfortunately ... gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge police department or Sgt. Crowley specifically , " the president said .
" And I could 've calibrated those words differently .
And I told this to Sgt. Crowley . "
" I continue to believe , based on what I have heard , that there was an overreaction in pulling Professor Gates out of his home to the station , " the president added .
" I also continue to believe , based on what I heard , that Professor Gates probably overreacted as well .
My sense is you 've got two good people in a circumstance in which neither of them were able to resolve the incident in the way that it should have been resolved and the way they would have liked it to be resolved . "
Sources told ABC News the White House reached out to Tom Nee , president of the National Police Officers Association , who then contacted Crowley .
Crowley got the call while he was with his union supporters .
Obama said it was unfortunate that his comments , instead of illuminating , contributed to " media frenzy " and said he hopes this would be " a teachable moment . "
He also defended his decision to make remarks about the incident , saying , " The fact that this has become such a big issue I think is indicative of the fact that ... race is still a troubling aspect of our society .
Whether I were black or white , I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive , as opposed to negative , understandings about the issue is part of my portfolio . "
Obama ended his remarks jokingly , saying that Crowley asked him for advice on how to get the press off his lawn .
" If anybody has any connections to the Boston press as well as national press , Sgt. Crowley would be happy for you to stop trampling his grass , " Obama said .
Earlier today , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he did not expect Obama to have anything else to say about the incident , but the president 's call to Crowley and his surprise appearance reflect the White House 's determination to put an end to the controversy that has dogged him since Wednesday .
Obama today himself acknowledged that in the last two days , " Nobody 's been paying much attention to health care . "
Lawsuit On The Way ?
Alan McDonald , who represents Crowley , the veteran cop who teaches a racial profiling class for rookie police officers told ABC News earlier that the sergeant had not ruled out filing a defamation of character or libel lawsuit against Gates .
" He is exploring all of his options , '' McDonald told ABC News .
Though charges were dropped , Gates has loudly asserted his arrest was a result of racial profiling .
The arrest and subsequent storm of racially charged comments has enveloped the White House after Obama said on Wednesday the Cambridge police acted " stupidly " in arresting the prominent black scholar .
In a press conference held by the Cambridge police unions and Massachusetts Municipal Police Officers Association to support Crowley , members said they hope Obama and Massachusetts Gov. Patrick Deval will apologize for their remarks .
Crowley stood with them but remained silent .
McDonald argued that race " played no role in the decision making in this case , " adding that it was " inappropriate " of Obama to use this case to talk about racial profiling .
When making his remarks , the president acknowledged that he had not seen all the facts in the case and what role race may have played .
While there is a history of complaints by minorities against officers at the Cambridge Police Department , experts say it 's not out of the ordinary compared to other U.S. cities .
" The issues confronting Cambridge are not different from [ those ] in any other department , " Margaret Burnham , a Northeastern University law professor who has sued the department twice , told ABC News .
" These things [ like the Gates case ] happen across the country . "
Two Sides to the Story
Crowley offered his defense in an interview with Boston television station WHDH .
The police officer said he was just doing his job but that Gates continued to rant " that I was doing this because he was a black man in America , that I was a racist . "
Crowley said that while he was radioing in Gates ' name to the dispatcher for record , " I could n't hear myself say it .
He was yelling that loud , " Crowley said .
Gates told CNN that he complied with the police officer 's request for identification , but that Crowley did n't say anything or respond back and arrested him without explanation .
As to reports of him being disorderly , Gates responded : " Yes , look how tumultuous I am .
I 'm 5 ' 7 , I weigh 150 pounds .
And my tumultuous , outrageous action , was to demand that he give me his name and his badge number . "
Gates attorney Charles Ogletree told ABC News Thursday that Gates did not violate any law .
Today , the second police officer who was with Crowley during the arrest said the sergeant did what he was supposed to do .
Patrolman Carlos Figueroa told The Associated Press that when Crowley asked Gates to present identification , the professor shouted , " No , I will not ! " Figueroa said Gates called Crowley a racist and shouted , " This is what happens to black men in America ! "
Crowley has said he will not apologize for his actions .
In an exclusive interview with ABC News ' Terry Moran Thursday , the president defended his comments , stressing that " cooler heads should have prevailed . "
Obama said it does n't make sense to him that the situation escalated to the point that Gates was arrested .
During his news conference Wednesday night that was dominated by health care issues , the president , acknowledging that he did not know all the facts of the case and what role race may have played , said " the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home . "
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , who called Gates a friend , would not comment on the remarks the president made Wednesday .
" I was not there , and the words I would use are troubling and upsetting , " he told reporters Thursday .
But he did say that he was glad the charges were dropped and that Gates ' arrest was " every black man 's nightmare . "
" I guess you ought to be able to raise your voice in your own house without risking arrest , " Deval said .
Did Obama Go Too Far With Race Remark ?
Obama 's remarks have stirred national debate over whether Gates ' arrest was an issue of racial profiling , as he himself asserted .
" It 's not a case of racial profiling , " said NPR analyst Juan Williams on " Good Morning America . "
Williams made clear there are dangers when blacks are confronted by police .
" As someone who has been stopped , as a black person in America , I have a very deferential approach to cops .
I do n't speak to them in aggressive tones .
...
It 's just that cops can be very prickly , especially with a black guy . "
But Williams said the president went " way too far " without seeing the police report and knowing all the specifics of the case , as Obama himself admitted .
" I think what he now has to do is walk it back and say , you know what , I spoke out of turn here .
... I was reacting in support of a friend , and aware of larger racial issues in society .
But it does n't specifically apply to this case , which is not about racial profiling , " Williams advised .
Even actor Bill Cosby weighed in on the debate , telling Boston 's WZLX yesterday that he was " shocked " to hear the president 's statement .
But some say the president was right to bring up this discussion in a primetime speech .
" Have some people wanted him to bring this up sooner ? " asked civil rights activist , the Rev. Al Sharpton .
" Of course , we have .
But the timing had to be right .
He had the courage to take a position at a time when he knows some people will disagree . "
" If he had n't addressed it , it would have looked like he was ducking .
I was surprised he said what he said , because his words brought the conversation to a new level , " Sharpton said .
Although Obama has been vocal on past civil rights issues , he largely avoided race during the presidential campaign except for a singular speech he gave on the issue after his pastor was found to have made anti-American statements .
" No one wants to talk about race , " said Donna Brazile , a Democratic strategist and ABC News consultant .
" He [ Obama ] does not inject race into the conversation regularly because it clears the room .
There are designated times , like Martin Luther King Jr. Day or when we have a large gathering of black folks , like at the NAACP recently , but that 's about it . "
" In this case , he was asked a question directly , and he answered it honestly , " she added .
In addition to his specific comments about Gates ' arrest , the president Wednesday also weighed in about the race issue , saying that while he did n't know whether it played a role , " I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there 's a long history in this country of African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately .
That 's just a fact . "
Some observers questioned whether the president should have so strongly backed Gates , a longtime friend , over the police who arrested him without fully knowing exactly what took place between the professor and Crowley .
" Obama is the president for all American not just black Americans , " Brazile said .
" He has enough on his plate as commander in chief -- two wars , an economy in the tank -- that he should not necessarily become the healer in chief . "

Amidst the hoopla surrounding the battle for the NL Cy Young , there are inevitably pitchers who fly under the radar almost to the point where they are n’t even appreciated .
Jair Jurrjens is one of those pitchers .
While I ’m not going to say nobody acknowledges the job Jurrjens has done this year ( and oh yeah , last year too ) , I am convinced that he ’s not receiving enough love in the discussions of the games best pitchers .
With that being said , I ’d like to reveal the letter I ’m sending to the Braves organization .
Dear Atlanta Braves ,
Maybe between the pennant race and your future Hall of Famer Chipper Jones hinting at retirement , you have n’t fully kept track of the burgeoning ace you have in your rotation .
Or maybe it was the huge expectations you had for Derek Lowe , after you signed him for $ 60 million over four years this offseason ?
Should ’ve let him go to the Mets ; it could ’ve freed up some cash for a big bat you guys desperately need .
You guys are right in the thick of things , but with a 4.55 ERA on the year , his signing has been a bit of a letdown .
Could it be that you ’re already concocting potential trade packages for Tim Hudson this offseason ?
Or possibly Tommy Hanson ’s Rookie of the Year bid has you shopping around for party supplies ?
Oh no , I ’ve got it .
You ’re in awe that at 33 - years - old Javier Vazquez was able to chip almost two runs off of his ERA this year and is putting together the best season of his 12 - year career .
That ’s got to be it !
Whatever your preoccupations are , you ’re forgetting about your team ’s MVP , Jair Jurrjens .
If you ’re wondering what he ’s done , Jurrjens has only compiled the league ’s sixth best ERA at 2.70 ( which is ahead of Vazquez ’s 2.91 ) .
He ’s also got a solid 1.24 WHIP .
He ’s becoming a workhorse - pitching over 200 innings this year , at the age of 23 .
He only has 6.3 K/9 this year , but since when are superb strikeout numbers the only determinant of a pitchers value ?
Your beloved Greg Maddux had a 6.1 K/9 ratio , while Tom ‘ Terrific ’ Glavine had one of 5.3 .
It ’s not like those low strikeout numbers tainted their careers !
The 6 ’ 1 ″ right - hander is 13 - 10 on the year , which is identical to last season ’s totals .
His record is misleading , though .
Since he finished third in the ROY voting last year , Jurrjens has continued to progress .
His WHIP has dropped from 1.37 to 1.24 ; he ’s allowing less hits this year 7.9 H/9 compared to 9.0 H/9 last season .
He ’s also continuing to limit the long - ball , with a stellar 0.6 HR / 9 mark , which is right on par with his 0.5 HR / 9 last year .
Jurrjens ’ FIP of 3.71 indicates that maybe his ERA is a bit lucky , mostly due to the fact he has a pretty high 78.6 percent strand rate this season .
But even if his ERA is in the mid-3s , can we complain all that much ?
His BABIP of .276 suggests some moderation in his ERA is plausible if the season was longer , but it really is n’t too far away from the norm .
And while his fly ball rate has spiked to almost 40 percent ( from 27 percent last season ) , we can only hope it ’s a fluke .
Also , when you ’ve got three pitches - a fastball , slider , and change - up that have all slightly improved from last season , I ’d say the future is looking bright for your young ace .
For a glimpse ( based on Fangraphs ’ pitch metrics , measured in runs prevented per 100 pitches ) :
Fastball : 0.15 to 0.59
Slider : 0.40 to 0.54
Change - up : 0.57 to 0.62
Jurrjens pitches to contact , but when you exhibit decent control ( 3.2 BB /9 ) , have three solid pitches , and have no problems displaying your full repertoire ( 62 % fastball / 15 % slider / 23 % change - up ) , hitters have a tough time sitting on one pitch in an at - bat .
Although he does n’t throw particularly hard ( low 90s at best ) , the fact that he does n’t necessarily favor any one pitch bodes well for him .
Let ’s put his season in perspective : with the hundreds of pitchers who have thrown this year , Jurrjens has the 14th highest VORP ( as of 9/23 ) .
According to Baseball Prospectus , Jurrjens has a VORP of 53.5 .
For those wondering , Zach Greinke has a VORP in the 80s and everyone ahead of Jurrjens has one in the 50s or 60s .
The statistics do n’t lie ; Jurrjens has been stellar .
With my petition in mind , I ’d like you to nominate Jair Jurrjens as the Atlanta Braves ’ MVP for this season .
He has n’t received the love yet , so it ’s about time you show him some !
Best ,
Jimmy
What do you guys think ?
Is Jurrjens a top - tier starter ?
Or am I treating him too nicely ?
WASHINGTON --
There is a segment of society for whom traditional family values are increasingly irrelevant , and for whom spring - break sexual liberationism is increasingly costly : men and women in their 20s .
This is the period of life in which society 's most important social commitments take shape -- commitments that produce stability , happiness and children .
But the facts of life for twentysomethings are challenging .
Puberty -- mainly because of improved health -- comes steadily sooner .
Sexual activity kicks off earlier .
But the average age at which people marry has grown later ; it is now about 26 for females , 28 for males .
This opens a hormone - filled gap -- a decade and more of likely sexual activity before marriage .
And for those in that gap , there is little helpful guidance from the broader culture .
Brad Wilcox , director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia , argues that the " courtship narrative " in the past was clear : dating , engagement , marriage , children .
This narrative has been disrupted without being replaced , leaving many twentysomethings in a " relational wasteland . "
The casual sex promoted in advertising and entertainment often leads , in the real world of fragile hearts and STDs , to emotional and physical wreckage .
But it does n't seem realistic to expect most men and women to delay sex until marriage at 26 or 28 .
Such virtue is both admirable and possible -- but it can hardly be a general social expectation .
So religious institutions , for example , often avoid this thorny topic , content to live with silence , hypocrisy and active singles groups .
In the absence of a courtship narrative , young people have evolved a casual , ad hoc version of their own : cohabitation .
From 1960 to 2007 , the number of Americans cohabiting increased fourteenfold .
For some , it is a test drive for marriage .
For others , it is an easier , low - commitment alternative to marriage .
About 40 percent of children will now spend some of their childhood in a cohabiting union .
How is this working out ?
Not very well .
Relationships defined by lower levels of commitment are , not unexpectedly , more likely to break up .
Three - quarters of children born to cohabiting parents will see their parents split up by the time they turn 16 , compared to about one - third of children born to married parents .
So apart from the council of cold showers or " let the good times roll , " is there any good advice for those traversing the relational wilderness ?
Religion and morality contribute ideals of character .
But social science also indicates some rough , practical wisdom .
First , while it may not be realistic to maintain the connection between marriage and sex , it remains essential to maintain the connection between marriage and childbearing .
Marriage is the most effective institution to bind two parents for a long period in the common enterprise of raising a child -- particularly encouraging fathers to invest time and attention in the lives of their children .
And the fatherless are some of the most disadvantaged , betrayed people in our society , prone to delinquency , poverty and academic failure .
Cohabitation is no place for children .
Second , the age of first marriage is important to marital survival and happiness .
Teen marriage is generally a bad idea , with much higher rates of divorce .
Romeo and Juliet were , in fact , young fools .
Later marriage has been one of the reasons for declining national divorce rates .
But this does not mean the later the better .
Divorce rates trend downward until leveling off in the early 20s .
But people who marry after 27 tend to have less happy marriages -- perhaps because partners are set in their ways or have unrealistically high standards .
The marital sweet spot seems to be in the early to mid 20s .
Third , having a series of low - commitment relationships does not bode well for later marital commitment .
Some of this expresses pre-existing traits -- people who already have a " nontraditional " view of commitment are less likely to be committed in marriage .
But there is also evidence , according to Wilcox , that multiple failed relationships can " poison one 's view of the opposite sex . "
Serial cohabitation trains people for divorce .
In contrast , cohabitation among people who are engaged seems to have no adverse effect on eventual marriage .
There is little use in preaching against a hurricane of social change .
But the delay of marriage creates moral , emotional and practical complications .
The challenge , as always , is to humanize change .
The answer , even in the relational wasteland , is responsibility , commitment and sacrifice for the sake of children .
How many times have you come across a movie or a video clip and wished that you could put it on your iPod and watch it on the go ?
Or came across a DivX encoded video and wished that you could burn it to a DVD and play it on an old style DVD player ?
With the increasingly fast broadband connections that most of us have these days , videos are becoming as much a part of our daily internet consumption as text is .
But , unlike text , videos are not portable – You ca n’t just take a video from one source and play it anywhere you want .
Of course , with media players like VLC , this is less of a problem but even VLC ca n’t help you if you want videos from a random site to work on , say , your iPod .
If converting videos and juggling between the different file formats is becoming too much for you to handle , you should give WinFF a try .
WinFF is an open source GUI for the excellent command line video convertor , ffmpeg .
It combines an easy to use graphical interface with the feature set of ffmpeg to produce a one stop solution for all your video conversion needs .
WinFF is available for both Windows and Linux .
To get started with converting videos to your preferred format , download one of the pre-build installers for your preferred operating system and follow the usual installation procedure .
The first step to converting videos is to launch WinFF and click on the Add button to add a video to the queue .
If you have more than one files to convert , you can add all of them to the queue and WinFF will convert all them one by one .
Very helpful when you have a full folder of videos to go through .
The next step is to select the output format for the converted files .
WinFF does a very good job of categorizing and hiding the complexity behind all the different types of media that ffmpeg can work with .
From the Convert
To dropdown , select the type of video that you want to convert to .
This will select the codec that the video will be encoded with .
For an iPod , I chose the iPod+iTunes option .
WinFF then lets you select a device preset which lets you further fine - tune the output videos .
Choose , the one that suits your taste , select an Output Folder and you ’re ready to hit Convert .
The actual conversion can take some and so , if you ask me , this would be the right time to go get a mug of coffee ( or a bottle of beer ) for yourself .
Have you ever struggled with video conversion before ?
Which software did you guys use to convert your videos then ?
Let me know in the comments .
Only for you , children of doctrine and learning , have we written this work .
Examine this book , ponder the meaning we have dispersed in various places and gathered again ; what we have concealed in one place we have disclosed in another , that it may be understood by your wisdom .

Quotations
I know that we watched season 2 of The Next Food Network Star .
I know that I cared enough about it at the time to write this comic .
But , I swear , sitting here , I have no memory whatsoever of that season or anything that happened in it .
I remember that the show lost me when the Food Network brought in three of their most successful cooking show hosts to act as team captains and had them constantly antagonize each other .
Not only did that make me like the show less , it made me like those three hosts less .
It was a show so bad it damaged four or five other shows .
The show had an actual measurable blast radius .
Note from Missy : I had to look back through the Wiki for The Next Food Network Star to confirm that it ’s where the world was given Guy Fieri for the first time .
Turns out he was on season 2 ( if memory serves , we voted for Reggie ) , and this comic must have been written about season 9 , which aired in 2013 and had a contestant named Nikki and a guy who made pie .
Also , holy crap , it was season eight when they changed to the Alton / Giada / Bobby smack - talking team system .
So we watched nine or ten seasons of a show , and all I can really remember of that 100 + hours of television is 3 celebrity chefs being total dicks to each other , and a vague memory of greatly disliking Guy Fieri before disliking Guy Fieri became cool .
As always , thanks for using my Amazon Affiliate links ( US , UK , Canada ) .
Korean chemists have taken acidic zeolite catalysts to the limit in terms of thickness - creating ultrathin nano - sheets that are efficient and long - lived catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking and other petrochemical applications .
Zeolites are already used in the petrochemicals industry , but making the catalysts very thin means that reactant molecules can easily diffuse into the zeolite structure and product molecules can get out quickly , explains Ryong Ryoo of the Korean advanced institute of science and technology ( KAIST ) in Daejeon .
This improves the efficiency of the catalyst and reduces unwanted side reactions that can produce polymeric hydrocarbon ’ coke ’ that clogs the zeolite pores and eventually kills the catalytic activity .
To make the thin sheets , Ryoo and his team used a surfactant as a template to direct the growth of the zeolite structure .
The surfactant molecule has a polar ’ head ’ group - with two quaternary ammonium groups around which the aluminosilicate zeolite crystal grows - and a long hydrocarbon ’ tail ’ , which prevents the sheets from aggregating together into larger , three dimensional crystals .
When the surfactant is removed , these flakes pile up randomly with gaps in between which further aids diffusion to the catalyst sites .
’ Di-quaternary ammonium cations are very effective structure - directing groups for MFI zeolites , ’ says Ryoo , ’ but so far people have used small cations that end up totally included in the zeolite structure . ’
Using the protruding tails to prevent the crystals from growing in one dimension gives thin sheets which are only as thick as a single unit cell - the smallest repeating unit in the crystal lattice .
Ryoo admits that his original intention was for the surfactant to form micelles and to build the zeolite on the surface of those micelles to make a controlled three dimensional porous crystalline network .
But Duncan Macquarrie from the University of York , UK , thinks that the nano - sheet structure could have advantages over such mesoporous zeolites :
’ One of the benefits of microporous zeolites is shape selectivity - molecules react based on whether they can fit into the pore or not - and you tend to lose some of that in mesoporous structures . ’
Macquarrie adds that the thinness of the sheets also improves accessibility of catalytic sites within the structure - ’it ’s potentially the best of both worlds , ’ he says .
The team has tested the nano - sheets as catalysts in some representative reactions , using bulky molecules to determine the effect of increased diffusion within the zeolite structure .
The nano - sheet catalysts showed increased activity in all the reactions compared with the same weight of a standard zeolite catalyst .
When the team used their catalyst to convert methanol to hydrocarbon fuel , they also saw that the nano - sheets had greatly extended catalyst lifetimes .
Ryoo attributes this to the lack of formation of unwanted ’ coke ’ byproducts , which block the micropores of conventional zeolites because the product molecules cannot diffuse out fast enough .
With the nano - sheets , the small amount of coke that does form is mostly on the catalyst surface , so does n’t affect catalytic activity .
Zeolite nano - sheets could also have applications outside of catalysis , explains Mike Anderson from the University of Manchester , UK .
’ A long term goal of zeolite chemists has been to make large single crystal films of zeolites , which could be perfect membranes for separation . ’
He adds that Ryoo ’s work suggests a possible general method for making such films : ’if you could pre-organise the surfactant on a flat sheet , then perhaps you could encourage the zeolite to grow into very thin but extensive film structures . ’

SIR David Attenborough ’s refusal to “ credit ” God for beautiful creatures like hummingbirds in his popular wildlife programmes has made him a target for hate mail .
In an interview with the Radio Times about his latest documentary on Charles Darwin and natural selection , Sir David said :
They tell me to burn in hell and good riddance .
According to this report , he toldÂ the magazine that , whenever he is asked about his failure to give the Lord his due regarding beautiful things like hummingbirds , he replies by referring to :
A little child in East Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball .
The worm cannot live in any other way , except by burrowing through eyeballs .
I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator .
Sir David , who attended the Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester from the 1930s , told the magazine he was astonished at manifestations of Christian faith .
He said :
It never really occurred to me to believe in God – and I had nothing to rebel against , my parents told me nothing whatsoever .
But I do remember looking at my headmaster delivering a sermon , a classicist , extremely clever … and thinking , he can’t really believe all that , can he ?
How incredible !
Sir David also said it was “ terrible , terrible ” when creationism and evolution were taught in schools as equivalent , alternative perspectives .
It ’s like saying that two and two equals four , but if you wish to believe it , it could also be five …
Evolution is not a theory ; it is a fact , every bit as much as the historical fact that William the Conqueror landed in 1066 .
Speaking about the relationship between people and the rest of nature , Sir
David said :
People say to me : ‘ What is a mosquito for ?
They ’re no good for anything !’
The basic notion that the world is our oyster , that we have domination over all things , that they are here for us …
Asked where that view comes from , Sir David replied :
The Bible , of course .
Genesis , chapter one .
Speaking about views 2,000 years ago , he said :
New York State discriminated against thousands of mentally ill people in New York City by leaving them in privately run adult homes , which effectively replaced state - run psychiatric hospitals more than a generation ago but turned out to be little more than institutions themselves , a federal judge ruled on Tuesday .
The judge , Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn , ruled that the state was violating the Americans With Disabilities
Act by housing more than 4,300 mentally ill people in New York City in more than two dozen adult homes .
He said the residents had little hope of mingling with anyone in the wider community .
The nonprofit group that sued the state had asked Judge Garaufis to tell state officials they could no longer steer mentally ill people into adult homes .
He stopped short of that but directed the state to submit a “ remedial plan ” by mid-October .
The ruling , which applies to mentally ill people not considered dangerous to themselves or others , suggested that the state would have to begin finding individual apartments or small homes for virtually all adult - home residents who wanted one .
A spokeswoman for Gov. David A. Paterson had no immediate comment about the 210 - page decision .
“ We ’re reviewing it , ” said the spokeswoman , Marissa Shorenstein .
Designed by Zoran Sunjic from Croatia , this creative LED staircase handrail system guides people through dark spaces both physically and visually .
In addition to looking cool , LED handrails would also eliminate the need for bright lights in places that are not used as frequently .
As a rule , you could always wait to buy a laptop , and find a better , cheaper one later .
But believe me , now is one of those times when you have to .
Here 's why you should wait — just two months .

A Way Better Operating System
We have been blunt about it : Windows 7 kicks ass , especially Vista's .
Sure you can upgrade a current Vista laptop to Windows 7 but there 's a hassle involved .
Buy a laptop now and you get a free upgrade to Win 7 , but the laptop manufacturer ( not Microsoft ) has to send you the install disc via snail mail after October 22 .
A clean install of the OS done at the factory is more likely to be hassle - free .
On top of that , a number of laptops will be optimized for Windows 7 , meaning they will have new hardware features that will take advantage of the new operating system which brings us to point number two .

More Power
If you have been looking for the opposite of a netbook and a high - end mobile machine , you 'll have your pick come November ( actually , late October ) .
That 's when Intel ought to roll out the latest edition of the Centrino platform , codenamed Calpella .
This chipset is expected to feature a less power - hungry version of the Core i7 desktop processor we like so much , with perhaps mobile Core i5 and Core i3 versions on the way later .
We expect a slew of these laptops to hit then .
We already know that MSI will ship 15.4 and 17 - inch notebooks powered by Intel 's new Core i7 7200 M , Core i7 8200 M , and Core i7 920 XM with Windows 7 .

Mac users take note :
The Centrino platform is also found in all manner of MacBook — just without the Intel sticker — so this applies to you , too .
And fans of the shiny white plastic MacBook know that it 's due for a cosmetic upgrade , so whether you want the faster processors in a unibody MacBook Pro , or a full makeover , inside and out , on the plastic MacBook , it pays to wait .

The arrival of 64 - bit - savvy Windows 7 and Snow Leopard means that system builders will also be able to bump up the RAM .
Now it will make sense to go beyond 4GB , pushing us out of the current RAM rut , though perhaps at an added cost .

The thin - and - light laptops that are coming are so thin they make me hungry .
If you do n't care about the kind of horsepower needed for games and 1080 p video , Intel is also shipping new dual - core ULV processors .
Laptops that used to cost north of $ 1,500 now thanks to Intel 's ULV ( once called CULV ) are gonna be under a grand .
The new dual - core chips are aimed at ultra thin laptops ( those right in between netbooks and mainstreamers , like the Acer Timeline ) .
MSI told us about the new Core 2 Duo SU4100 and SU7300 chips — it is our guess that these are the same chips that will be in Sony 's rail - thin X Series and Samsung 's X120 .

Sweet Deals
It may still seem too early think about holidays but , hey , autumn starts in two weeks .
Many of these new notebooks will be released at the end of October to coincide with Windows 7's Oct. 22 official launch date , and a scant month later we hit Black Friday and Cyber Monday , the biggest sales days of the year .
Retailers and manufacturers would be stupid if they did n't mark down even the newest stuff , so if you hold out just a few weeks , you will not only get the best laptops out there but you 'll get them at some unbelievable prices .

Future Features
We do n't necessarily expect you to wait for GScreen 's dual - screen laptop , but some other pretty great new technology will start hitting notebooks before year 's end .
SuperSpeed USB ( aka USB 3.0 ) will be showing up soon , and after Windows 7 arrives , more and more laptops will be built with multitouch capability .
Additionally , chances are good that the price of solid - state drives will start dropping , and that more laptop manufacturers will also start selecting the faster SSD models .

The future is upon us .
So do n't buy anything right now .
Save your money , handcuff yourself to a piece of furniture , and wait it out .
Just two months , that 's it .
OTTAWA — Army staff and National Defence headquarters officials were told in 2007 that young boys had allegedly been sexually abused by Afghan security forces at a Canadian base in Afghanistan , but the concern at the time was that the incident might be reported in the news media , according to military records obtained by the Citizen .
In addition , last year Brig. - Gen. J.C. Collin , commander of Land Force Central Area , passed on to the senior army leadership the concerns raised by military police who said they had been told by their commanders not to interfere in incidents in which Afghan forces were having sex with children .
The newly released records raise questions about a military investigation that earlier this year concluded that allegations about sexual abuse of Afghan children by members of the Afghan army and police were unfounded .
The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service also stated that its thorough investigation concluded allegations of such incidents were never reported to Canadian military commanders .
The allegations first surfaced publicly in June 2008 after concerns about the incidents , originally raised by soldiers and military chaplains , were reported in the news media .
Former Cpl. Travis Schouten told military officials he had witnessed an Afghan boy being sodomized by two Afghan security personnel at Canada ’s Forward Operating Base Wilson in Afghanistan in 2006 .
Another soldier also came forward to a Toronto newspaper to report a similar occurrence at the same base in 2006 .
A military chaplain talked about the abuse in a report sent up the chain of command at Canadian Forces Base Petawawa .
Two other chaplains have also come forward to state that soldiers came to them upset about such abuses .
The issue is sensitive for the Canadian Forces and the federal government as the Afghanistan mission has been promoted to the public as being about protecting Afghan civilians .
The Afghan National Army and police are seen as key to Canada ’s military withdrawal from that country in 2011 .
It is the position of the Canadian Forces that its troops have no jurisdiction over the activities of Afghan military and police personnel , even those operating on Canadian bases .
The military records obtained by the Citizen through the Access to Information law note that a 90 - minute meeting was held between an army public affairs staff member and a member of army commander Lt. - Gen.
Andrew Leslie ’s executive staff in the summer / fall of 2007 .
According to the June 2008 e-mail written by Lt.- Col .
Stephane Grenier , an adviser on operational stress injuries , the meeting focused on various controversies that might be brought out in the news media , including , “ ANP / ANA members having anal sex with young boys .
” ANP stands for Afghan National Police while ANA refers to Afghan National Army .
A second meeting about Afghan police and soldiers having sex with children was held later that week at National Defence headquarters involving senior members of the Defence Department ’s civilian and military public affairs staff , according to the e-mail .
In addition , on June 18 , 2008 , Brig. - Gen. J.C. Collin , commander of Land Force Central Area , passed on to Leslie ’s staff and Brig. - Gen. Ian Poulter the concerns raised by several military police officers .
Collin called the e-mail from the military police commander , “ rather disconcerting . ”
Included were details from military police who noted it was well known among Canadian troops that ANA and ANP personnel had sex with kids .
Another was upset that military police were told not to intervene in such matters , according to the e-mail .
“ At this late date I cannot specifically remember who delivered the said briefings however I can say that it was delivered in Gagetown and that it sparked considerable debate amongst the MP pers ( onnel ) , ” noted one police officer in an e-mail Collin forwarded to the army ’s senior staff .
The e-mail had been written by Maj .
V.R. Ethier , the commander of 2 MP Unit , the army military police unit of Ontario .
“ Of greatest concern to the MP members was the belief that if they were ( to ) intervene in any instances of this nature that they would not be supported by the C o C , ” the e-mail added .
C o C is a military term for chain of command .
Having sex with children is against the law in Afghanistan , but some military officers have argued that since it is practised by some Afghans , particularly in Kandahar , then the Canadian Forces should not get involved in what should be seen as a “ cultural ” issue .
Maj .
Francis Bolduc , deputy commanding officer of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service , said his organization ’s examination of the issue found no evidence to support the sexual abuse allegations .
He said a thorough review of military police records showed no complaints were made about the issue and “ all the allegations were unfounded . ”
Bolduc noted that the investigation found the sexual abuse concerns were never reported to commanders .
Asked about the e-mails from Lt.- Col .
Grenier and military police commander Maj. V.R. Ethier , he replied : “ This is outside our lane . ”
Bolduc said those issues could be looked at by a board of inquiry into the issue that had been ordered by Lt. - Gen. Leslie .
Last June , Defence Minister Peter MacKay told the House of Commons that troops would not turn a blind eye to the abuse of children .
“ Let us be clear , in no way , shape or form have Canadian soldiers and certainly the Canadian government ever condoned or excused allegations of sexual abuse against children in this country or anywhere else , ” he said .
Another incident recounted in the Ethier e-mail detailed how a complaint was made about the sexual abuse of children to his chain of command in 2005 - 2006 in Kandahar and after that an Afghanistan commander dealt with the situation .
In addition , Brig . - Gen .
Poulter received an e-mail on June 17 , 2008 indicating that the sexual abuse issue had been raised by a Canadian colonel , a veteran of the war , during a military training session about Afghan culture .
“ He emphasized that it is not a practice that Afghan men discuss or practise in an open manner … one of those things that Afghans know happens but nobody talks about , ” noted the e-mail to Poulter .
In addition , it appears senior Canadian commanders were also concerned about the abuse .
In a June 13 , 2008 , letter to army commander Leslie , the office of Lt. - Gen. Michel Gauthier asked that an investigation be started into the sexual assault allegations .
“ Furthermore , initial queries suggest there appeared to be some concern of the part of the Roto 2 BG chain of command with respect to certain off - duty activities related to the same incidents later raised to the reporter , ” the letter noted .
Paintings by The Great Iman Maleki
No , these are not photos , but actual paintings by the great Iman Maleki !
Maleki was born in Teheran , Iran in 1976 and was always fascinated with the magic of painting .
He was only 15 when he started to study with the greatest realist painter in Iran , Morteza Katouzian .
Since then he has had many successful showings of his paintings .
His most important exhibitions so far include the “ Exhibition of Realist painters of Iran ” in the Contemporary Museum of Art in Teheran ( 1999 ) , the “ Group Exhibition of KARA Studio Painters ” in the SABZ galerie ( 1998 ) and the SA’AD ABAD Palace ( 2003 ) .
He is now considered to be the best realist painter in the world because of his unbelievable talent and painting technique .
Below are the compilation of his most magnificent real paintings .

A low - calorie diet could be much closer to the diet that mice are adapted to in the wild , and therefore it could extend life simply because it is much healthier for them .
“ Life extension in model organisms may be an artifact to some extent , ” they wrote .
To the extent caloric restriction works at all , it may have a bigger impact in short - lived organisms that do not have to worry about cancer than in humans .
Thus the hope of mimicking caloric restriction with drugs “ may be an illusion , ” they write .
To decide whether life extension by caloric restriction is an artifact of mice in captivity , why not try it on wild mice ?
Just such an experiment has been done by Steven N. Austad of the University of Texas Health Science Center .
Dr. Austad reported that caloric restriction did not extend the average life span of wild mice , suggesting the diet ’s benefits are indeed an artifact of mice in captivity .
But others interpret his results differently .
Richard A. Miller of the University of Michigan , says the maximum life span of the wild mice was extended , and so the experiment was a success for caloric restriction .
Laboratory mice are very inbred , and researchers can get different results depending on the breed they use .
To put the mouse data on a firmer footing , the National Institute on Aging has set up a program to test substances in three labs simultaneously .
Its first round of candidate agents for reversing aging include green tea extract and two doses of resveratrol .
The resveratrol tests are still under way , but last month the results with another substance , the antifungal drug rapamycin , were published .
Rapamycin was found to extend mice ’s lives significantly even though by accident the mice were already the equivalent of 60 years old when the experiment started .
Rapamycin has nothing to do with caloric restriction , so far as is known , but the study provided striking proof that a chemical can extend life span .
Another result , directly related to the caloric restriction approach , emerged last month from a long - awaited study of rhesus monkeys kept on such a diet .
The research was led by Richard Weindruch of the University of Wisconsin .
As fellow primates , the monkeys are the best possible guide to whether the mouse results will apply in people .
And the answer they gave was ambiguous .
Your average run of the mill Mustang GT will set you back about $ 30,000 .
But sometimes you do n’t want to be just another guy or gal driving your everyday Mustang , you yearn for something more , something greater , something historic .
Enter Galpin Ford , who is taking 45 base Mustangs and transforming them into hand - built Lee Iacocca Limited Edition Mustangs , as the exclusive supplier .
These beauts are being created to commemorate the 45th anniversary of this pony car .
How much to participate in this celebration ?
Oh , just $ 90,000 .
So , what ’s all this coin get you over a regular V8 Mustang ?
If you are thinking crazy performance , think again .
Besides a nicely recontoured body and lots of signature badging and interior accentuation , the addition of the Ford Racing Handling Suspension Package is it .
Why not take things a bit further with the 45th Anniversary Edition Ford Mustang and opt for the 14 ″ Ford Racing brake upgrade , Cold Air Kit and supercharger ?
At least now , that puny 320 horsepower engine will make 400 .
This will only set you back a grand total of $ 115,000 .
Ok , so obviously this car is n’t about raw performance or the thrill of driving .
If you wanted to go that route and stay in the Mustang family , you ’d probably want to pick up the Ford Shelby GT500KR with 540 horsepower and a 0 - 60 mph time of 4.3 seconds .
You could probably grab one for somewhere just north of the list price of $ 79,995 if you shopped around , as many dealers ask for as much as $ 100 k .
In any case , the Iacocca Silver Edition Mustang is really about being part of an exclusive club of owners who will be paying homage to the man that started the pony car craze back in 1964 .

Mrs Clinton earlier laid a wreath for the victims of the 1998 embassy attacks US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has warned that the US will " take action " against Eritrea if it does not stop supporting militants in Somalia .
She said after talks with Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in Kenya 's capital , Nairobi , that Eritrea 's actions were " unacceptable " .
She also said the US would expand support for Somalia 's unity government .
Eritrea denies supporting Somalia 's al - Shabab militants , who are trying to overthrow Somalia 's government .
Al - Shabab is growing in strength and 250,000 Somalis have fled their homes in fighting between militants and government forces over the past three months .
Wreath - laying Mrs Clinton was holding the talks with the UN - backed Somali leader , a moderate Islamist , on the second day of her African tour .
Certainly if al - Shabab were to obtain a haven in Somalia which could then attract al - Qaeda and other terrorist actions , it would be a threat to the United States

Meeting Somalia 's al - Shabab Q&A : Somalia 's conflict

At a joint news conference with him after the meeting , she said : " It is long past time for Eritrea to cease and desist its support of al - Shabab and to start being a productive rather than a destabilising neighbour .
" We are making it very clear that their actions are unacceptable .
We intend to take action if they do not cease . "
She added : " There is also no doubt that al - Shabab wants to obtain control of Somalia to use it as a base from which to influence and even infiltrate surrounding countries and launch attacks against countries far and near . "
Mrs Clinton said if al - Shabab obtained a haven in Somalia " it would be a threat to the United States " .

The US has ruled out sending its forces to fight insurgents in Somalia .
But the AFP news agency quoted a state department official as saying on Thursday that the US supply of arms and ammunition to Somalia would be doubled from 40 tonnes to 80 .
Eritrean officials have repeatedly denied supporting al - Shabab , calling the allegations a " fabrication " of US intelligence .
Several Somali Islamist groups operated from Eritrea after being ousted from the capital , Mogadishu , when Ethiopian troops entered Somalia in 2006 .
Before the talks on Thursday , Mrs Clinton honoured the victims of the August 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , in a wreath - laying ceremony in Nairobi .
More than 220 people were killed and 5,000 injured in the first major attack by al - Qaeda on US targets .
AP news agency quoted her as saying that the embassy site was a reminder of " the continuing threat of terrorism , which respects no boundaries , no race , ethnicity or religion , but is aimed at disrupting and denying the opportunity of people to make their own decisions and to lead their own lives " .
There are reports that al - Shabab - the Somali Islamist group which favours strict Islamic law and is accused of links to al - Qaeda - is gaining support from militants around the world .
Earlier this week , police in Australia arrested several men , charging them with planning suicide attacks on a base in Sydney and saying they were linked to al - Shabab .
The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says President Ahmed needs all the support he can get .
Pro-government forces are only in control of a small section of the Somali capital , Mogadishu .
Our correspondent points out it is far too dangerous for the American secretary of state to venture into Somalia , as the fighting continues .
Kenya violence Somalia 's foreign minister told the BBC's Network Africa programme that Washington 's support for his government was a " golden opportunity " .
" It is absolutely clear that the people of Somalia are tired ... sick and tired of war , sick and tired of chaos , " he said .

The US admits it has supplied pro-government forces in Somalia with over 40 tonnes of weapons and ammunition this year , and another delivery of weapons is predicted , says our correspondent .
But there are growing fears that the Horn of Africa country - which has been without an effective central government since 1991 - risks becoming a haven for terrorists .
On Wednesday , Mrs Clinton held talks in Nairobi with Kenya 's president and prime minister .
America's top diplomat described as " disappointing " Kenya 's failure to investigate a bout of violence that left at least 1,300 people dead after the disputed December 2007 presidential election .
Addressing African leaders at Wednesday 's economic summit , Mrs Clinton said the continent had " enormous potential for progress " .
But she stressed that harnessing that potential would require democracy and good governance .
During her 11 - day trip Mrs Clinton will also visit South Africa , Nigeria , Angola , Liberia , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cape Verde .

Strikeforce was welcomed to the promotional battlefield Thursday when UFC President Dana
White publicly attacked the rival promotion for the first time following a pre-fight news conference for UFC 101 in Philadelphia .
White , who has praised the San Jose - based organization ’s efforts on numerous occasions , criticized Strikeforce for its decision to sign No. 1 - ranked heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko after White ’s previous negotiations fizzled with the Russian and his management and promotional team M - 1 Global .
Emelianenko will debut under the Strikeforce banner on premium - pay subscription channel Showtime this fall .
He is contracted for three fights .
“ He ’ll put them out of business , ” White said .
“ They have no money .
These guys have no money and they have no distribution .
Four f--- king people watch Showtime .
” White also referred to Strikeforce as “ Strikefarce . ”
“ Of course he ’s going to say that .
He ’s a promoter , ” said Coker during a teleconference call Thursday discussing the major signing .
“ He ’s going to go on and say what he ’s going to say , but we ’ve been in business a long time and I think we know how to operate a business and forged a relationship with Ken ( Hershman ) and Showtime and M - 1 .
I feel confident that we ’re going to have some great big shows with Fedor .
” Coker , who recently praised White and the UFC for “ saving ” MMA in North America , had told Sherdog.com on Tuesday that he believed his company ’s acquisition of Emelianenko would n’t spark hostility between the two outlets .
White ’s comments on Thursday suggested otherwise , though Coker seemed ready for what many believed to be inevitable .
“ Under the current circumstances , is anybody surprised ? ” asked Coker .
“ I do n’t think so . ” M- 1 Global was also targeted by White for its management practices with Gegard Mousasi , who had been scheduled to face Renato “ Babalu ” Sobral at Affliction ’s Aug. 1 event .
“ He was lied to .
It ’s a fact , ” White said , suggesting M - 1 had misled Mousasi .
It is unclear what moves , if any , were made by the UFC to secure the 23 - year - old fighter after Affliction signed over its contracts to the UFC .
White said he was unsure if his company had issued a cease and desist letter to Strikeforce and M - 1 to try and stop the bout now scheduled for their co-promoted Aug. 15 event .
“ Maybe we did , ” said White .
“ I honestly do n’t know .
I ’d tell you if I knew .
” White added that the UFC would be interested in the former Dream champion if he was n’t under contract elsewhere .
However , Coker announced last week that he ’d signed Mousasi to a three - fight contract “ a while ago . ”
Coker told Sherdog.com
Tuesday that Affliction had only a bout agreement in place with the Armenian - born fighter for the Sobral bout .
“ There has never been any side negotiations about ( Mousasi ’s ) contract , ” said M - 1 rep Apy Echteld , who had been designated to speak on the controversy during the call .
“ I spoke to ( UFC matchmaker ) Joe Silva about it last night for the first time , and they said the only thing they should try to do or should do is match the contract that Affliction had with Mousasi .
” Echteld said there had been “ some contact in the past ” with the UFC and stated that the UFC had “ tried to stop ” the bout in Strikeforce , but that Mousasi had already signed into a contract that he is “ happy with .
” Echteld said he was not sure on what grounds the UFC was making its claim to stop the bout from happening on Aug. 15 .
“ I really do n’t know , ” said Echteld .
“ Perhaps they wanted Mousasi in a cheap and easy way .
” White ’s accusation cast doubt on M - 1 ’s dealings with Mousasi , but also raised questions regarding how much control Emelianenko actually has over his own career .
The usually stoic fighter defended his and M - 1 ’s stance during the call Thursday .
“ I have the full control of the contracts and my career as well , and I get all the time financial reports and all contracts and all important issues are being discussed with me , and everything that I do n’t like Vadim ( Finkelstein ) tries to stand for , ” said Emelianenko through a translator .
“ I need to tell you I have complete control of everything that ’s going on .
” Emelianenko was also skeptical of the UFC ’s practices .
“ From my viewpoint , the UFC does not have the proper attitude towards fighters , ” said Emelianenko .
“ They do n’t consider fighters to be normal people , human beings .
What I think ( is ) that the UFC ’s attitude towards the fighters is not the correct one and I do n’t like their policy , which appears to be ( a ) really forced one , because the offer which we got was one kind , then on the Internet they published ( an ) absolutely different offer .
The offer that we got from them was really miserable . ” Vadim Finkelstein , M - 1
Global ’s president , also had some stern words for the White and the UFC .
“ I wonder whom does Dana White considers to be the best fighters ?
The fighters that have 4 - 1 records ? ” asked Finkelstein , referring to UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar .
“ Maybe this is the fighter which became the product of the great PR machine of the UFC .
Brett Rogers is a much better opponent for Fedor and also should be very interesting for fans as well , because he has 10 fights and not one loss . ” Finkelstein said the UFC had just as much to gain from the elusive signing as Emelianenko and M - 1 did .
“ Fedor ’s name outside of the U.S. is much bigger than the name of the UFC , ” he said .
If Fedor comes to the UFC , he ’ll make the UFC famous outside of the U.S. ” Other notes : •
Coker said the promotion ’s first pay - per - view event is “ probably six to nine months away . ” •
Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem is expected to defend his title this fall . •
On an event in Japan : “ The deal with Dream is really an independent deal than this deal ( with M - 1 ) , but we ’ll definitely have some conversations with everyone involved to see if it makes sense , ” said Coker . •
On Showtime ’s involvement with the acquisition of Emelianenko : “ We were involved enough to lend support and make sure that everyone understood how important we felt this was and how valuable we felt that Fedor and M - 1 was .
Beyond that , I ’m not going to get into how involved we were , ” said Ken Hershman , Showtime Sports Senior Vice President . •
Coker and Showtime have discussed holding a multi - night grand prix tournament format , but no immediate plans have been made .
( Coker had previously announced 135 - and 145 - pound women ’s tournaments will begin in November . )

Catching up on my weekend Web reading , I came across an interesting video from National Geographic , about dogs who sniff out cancer and health problems associated with diabetes .
One of the dogs featured , a collie named Tinker , began whining and barking when his owner , who has diabetes , experienced dangerous drops in blood sugar .
Although Tinker was n’t trained at first , his reactions to the hypoglycemic attacks led to further training as a qualified “ hypo alert ” dog .
The video also features the work of the British research center , Cancer and Bio-Detection Dogs .
The center has 17 rescue dogs at various stages of training that will be paired up with diabetic owners , including many children , reports Reuters .
Last year , researchers from Queen ’s University in Belfast decided to investigate anecdotal reports from dog owners who said their pets warned them of hypoglycemic attacks .
They surveyed 212 dog owners , all of whom had Type 1 diabetes , an autoimmune disorder that prevents the body from producing insulin .
A regular concern with Type 1 is that blood sugar will drop precipitously low , causing a person to fall unconscious .
Among the dog owners , 138 , or 65 percent , said their dog had shown a behavioral reaction to at least one of their hypoglycemic episodes .
About a third of the animals had reacted to 11 or more events , with 31.9 percent of animals reacting to 11 or more events .
The dogs got their owners ’ attention by barking and whining , ( 61.5 percent ) , licking ( 49.2 percent ) , nuzzling ( 40.6 percent ) , jumping on top of them ( 30.4 percent ) , and / or staring intently at their faces ( 41.3 percent ) .
A small percentage of the dogs reportedly tremble in fear at the time of a hypoglycemic attack .
To learn more , watch the three - minute video or read the transcript on the National Geographic Web site .
And for more on dogs detecting cancer read “ Moist Nose Shows Promise in Tracking Down Cancer , ” by my colleague Donald G. McNeil , Jr .
The active ingredient in many insect repellents , deet , has been found to be toxic to the central nervous system .
Researchers say that more investigations are urgently needed to confirm or dismiss any potential neurotoxicity to humans , especially when deet - based repellents are used in combination with other neurotoxic insecticides .
Vincent Corbel from the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement in Montpellier , and Bruno Lapied from the University of Angers , France , led a team of researchers who investigated the mode of action and toxicity of deet ( N, N - Diethyl - 3 - methylbenzamide ) .
Corbel said , " We 've found that deet is not simply a behavior - modifying chemical but also inhibits the activity of a key central nervous system enzyme , acetycholinesterase , in both insects and mammals " .
Discovered in 1953 , deet is still the most common ingredient in insect repellent preparations .
It is effective against a broad spectrum of medically important pests , including mosquitoes .
Despite its widespread use , controversies remain concerning both the identification of its target sites at the molecular level and its mechanism of action in insects .
In a series of experiments , Corbel and his colleagues found that deet inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme – the same mode of action used by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides .
These insecticides are often used in combination with deet , and the researchers also found that deet interacts with carbamate insecticides to increase their toxicity .
Corbel concludes , " These findings question the safety of deet , particularly in combination with other chemicals , and they highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the development of safer insect repellents for use in public health " .
Dick Cheney played a key role in US anti-terror policy after 9/11
The head of the CIA has accused former US Vice - President Dick Cheney of concealing an intelligence programme from Congress , a top US senator says .
The existence of the programme , set up after 9/11 , was hidden for eight years and its precise nature remains unclear .
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein confirmed that CIA chief Leon Panetta told Congressional committees he had abandoned the project on hearing of it .
He said that Mr Cheney was behind the secrecy , Sen Feinstein said .
There has been no comment from Mr Cheney .
War of words Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The California senator , who is chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee , told Fox News on Sunday that Mr Panetta told her about the programme on 24 June , shortly after hearing about it , and said he had cancelled it .
The Bush administration may have broken the law , Sen Feinstein said , adding that Congress should never be kept in the dark , even though the country was still in shock after the 9/11 attacks .
" This is a big problem , " she said .
" I understand the need of the day ... but I think you weaken your case when you go outside the law . "
But Texas Republican John Cornyn told Fox News that the allegations were part of political moves to distract attention from problems faced by Democrat leaders in Congress .
The claims come amid an increasingly bitter row between the CIA and Congress over whether key information was withheld about other aspects of the agency 's operations .
' Capture or kill '
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has claimed that the CIA misled her about interrogation methods including water - boarding , while other senior Democrats have quoted Mr Panetta as admitting that his agency regularly misled Congress before he took office .
CIA chief Leon Panetta is said to have closed the programme Details of the newly - revealed secret programme have still not been divulged .
However , the Wall Street Journal reports that the programme was an attempt to act on a 2001 presidential authorisation issued by President George W Bush to capture or kill al - Qaeda operatives .
Quoting current and former government officials , the newspaper says the CIA spent money on planning and possibly some training .
The New York Times , which broke the story about Mr Cheney 's alleged role , also quoted officials as saying the programme was launched by anti-terror operatives at the CIA soon after the 2001 attacks , and involved planning and training but never became fully operational .
Another unnamed official told AP it was an embryonic intelligence - gathering effort , aimed at yielding intelligence that would be used to conduct covert operations abroad .
But the BBC's Kim Ghattas , in Washington , says there is some debate in the intelligence world about how significant the programme actually was .
Regardless of the details , the debate now is about the secrecy that surrounded the programme and whether by concealing it the Bush administration broke the law , our correspondent says .
Veto threat Mr Panetta - who took over directorship of the CIA under President Obama 's administration - is said to have learnt about the programme only on 23 June .
The next day he called an emergency meeting with congressional intelligence committees to tell them about its existence and to say that it was being cancelled .
The allegations come as Democrats in Congress are trying to push through new rules that would increase the number of members of Congress who are told about covert operations .
The White House is threatening to veto the bill , fearing that operational secrecy could be compromised .
The CIA has not commented on the reports of Mr Cheney 's role .
" It 's not agency practice to discuss what may or may not have been said in a classified briefing , " said spokesman Paul Gimigliano .
" When a CIA unit brought this matter to Director Panetta 's attention , it was with the recommendation that it be shared appropriately with Congress .
That was also his view , and he took swift , decisive action to put it into effect . "
A CIA spokesman insisted earlier this week that " it is not the policy or practice of the CIA to mislead Congress " .
ROUND -UP OF OPINIONS ACROSS THE WEB CIA chief Leon Panetta 's accusation has got columnists , commentators and bloggers talking about the implications for Dick Cheney and the intelligence community .
Fox News 's Congress correspondent Chad Pergram wonders what the news reveals about the relationship between the intelligence community and politicians :
All of this is baffling .
But it points to one thing : a potential politicization of U.S. intelligence .
Someone leaking the allegation that this program was hidden from Congress by Vice President Cheney is political .
True or not , someone wanted to get that out .
The fact that the gang of seven leaked its letter is political .
Someone wanted that document publicized .
Rupert Cornwell in the Independent says that the US now needs a truth and reconciliation inquiry :
There will surely also be new demands for a broad investigation into how the Bush administration waged its war on terror .
The White House has so far rejected demands for a South African - style truth and reconciliation commission to examine what happened .
But for how much longer ?
In the New York Times ' politics and government blog , The Caucus , Janie Lorber pictures the scene of the CIA chief finding out about the project :
By law , intelligence committees are to be " kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity . "
But an amendment leaves some leeway for judgment when it comes to " exceptionally sensitive matters " .
While few details about the program have emerged , we do know that the agency 's current director , Leon Panetta , did not know about the program until June 23 when he was alerted by subordinates imagine that conversation at which point he halted the program and alerted Congress in closed - door meetings the following day .
Kansas City Star Editorial Page columnist Yael T. Abouhalkah looks at what this will mean for Cheney 's reputation : Former Vice President Dick Cheney 's penchant for keeping secrets may permanently damage his legacy as a patriotic American .
If Cheney were involved in purposefully misleading Congress , that could wind up being a huge black mark against the former vice president .
It begs for a complete congressional investigation , so the American people know whether Cheney violated his oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States .
Republican strategist Mary Matalin said on CNN that the reports about Cheney were a distraction designed to avert attention away from the policy struggles of the Obama administration :
The president 's agenda is almost in shambles .
His [ poll ] numbers are dropping .
Is n't it coincidental Every time they get in trouble . . . they dredge up a Darth Vader story .
The US veterans ' blog This Aint Hell takes a tongue - in - cheek look at the story :
The media and the Democrat Congress is having conniption fits because they think that the Evil Bush Administration ( TM ) had a secret program to kill terrorist leaders and they did n't bother to tell Congress about it ... Oh , no !
Bush and Cheney did n't support the operation ?
But that does n't fit the narrative !
Look , fellas , if we 're going to have an evil plot against Congress , we 're going to need Bush and Cheney involved , otherwise , how will we ever be able to impeach them ?
Um , retroactively ?
If I was going to have an operation against the nation 's enemies and I needed to keep it secret , I would n't tell the drama queen , leaky Democrats until the last possible moment either .
In the Huffington Post , comedian John Marshall sends up the story :
In lieu of an investigation , officials are considering commemorating Cheney 's vice presidency with an all - star memorial , to be broadcast on five networks and feature video clips of water boarding , sleep deprivation , e-mail mining , iPhone tapping and face shooting .
Fans could Twitter their favorite Cheney security violations .

Overview
Many teams at Cisco are dedicated to security research .
One team recently investigated botnets with the goal of improving existing detection methods and discovering the techniques botmasters use to compromise machines .
The team ’s efforts were rewarded through their protection of an important customer ’s network .
Their discovery efforts also yielded extraordinary insights into the mind and motives of a botmaster .
This paper discusses exploit protection and reports on the interviews the team held with the botmaster they encountered .
Defending a Customer from a Botmaster
Typically , administrators patch vulnerable machines or deploy some sort of intrusion prevention system ( IPS ) to protect against exploits .
Both approaches are effective the majority of the time , but neither approach protects systems against the uneducated user .
These approaches may not even protect people who take their machines home if the IPS is network - based .
The user who will click and run anything is the greatest threat to any network .
Internet relay chat ( IRC ) traffic on non-standard ports is a good indicator of malicious activity .
Simple botnets often use IRC as a command - and - control framework because the source code is readily available .
Joining a chat network is not botnet activity , but it is usually not work - appropriate activity .
Cisco offers a service that monitors and manages network - based IPS .
By monitoring certain alerts from this data feed , suspicious IRC traffic was easily found .
An Unsuspecting Customer
A Cisco customer was unaware of dozens of compromised machines .
A tremendous number of alerts including IRC activity , far larger than anything that could be benign , were occurring on the customer ’s network .
The traffic from several machines stood out from other systems on the network .
There are occasionally oddities in a network , but when a small subset of machines is observed sharing the same odd behavior , researchers should take note .
Figure 1 shows a data feed from a Cisco IPS device .
Figure 1 . Monitoring a Cisco IPS Data Feed
Looking at the signature alerts , it was clear that the affected machines had been compromised .
The Cisco IPS detected the attack , but unfortunately the customer was not running it inline or connected to the router , so the hits were not blocked .
There were several different botnets involved that looked strangely similar .
When inspecting the history of the machines , in addition to the IRC traffic , exploitation and reconnaissance attempts were discovered .
None of the traffic was encrypted , indicating that the attackers were either unsophisticated or unconcerned about hiding their tracks .
The botmaster occasionally took basic precautions , such as using server and channel passwords , but failed to encrypt the data .
Challenge - response exchanges were hidden in normal IRC traffic .
For example , upon connecting to a server , the bot would immediately have to ping “ MrB|g ” with the key “ s3cr3+sq|_|rr3l ” or it would be denied access to the server .
This challenge - response method was also used by the clients in response to certain RFC 2812 commands , such as a client - to - client protocol version request .
Additionally , the bots would respond to non-RFC 2812 commands .
It was noted that different botnets seemed to share many of the same commands .
This led to the belief that most , if not all , of these clients were based on a common source code .
Figure 2 shows the botnet .
Figure 2 . Botnet
At this point in the investigation , the team ’s largest concern was for the customer .
There was an urgent need to determine what the botnet was doing and what information had been compromised .
By using the Cisco IPS , a wide range of data about the command - and - control networks was captured .
For example , the network was separated into several discrete command - and - control nodes with different IP addresses .
Over the course of a few weeks , commands were captured and the network was monitored to see what information the botmaster was targeting .
An open source IRC client was set up to emulate an infected machine and join the network .
This allowed continuous monitoring without having to leave any compromised machines active .
The botmaster targeted employees instead of the company itself .
This action likely helped the attacker to remain undetected .
The botmaster ’s mode of attack involved stealing employees ’ passwords that were stored in Internet Explorer and then adding a redirect in the hosts file that enabled a man - in - the - middle attack against a bank in Latin America .
Stopping the Bot
Once the extent of the damage was determined , the bot needed to be stopped .
The team was able to demonstrate the modification of the hosts file , making the compromise irrefutable .
Some of the machines appeared to have been compromised dozens of times .
A worm or trojan would compromise the machine and update the hosts file , only to have it corrected by the virus scanner ( or other malware ) .
The correction would prevent the man - in - the - middle attack but the botnet would load normally .
This action occurred each time the system booted .
Some machines had dozens of entries that showed that the hosts file was corrected repeatedly .
It became clear that it was not feasible to clean every infected machine , because in the time it took to alert the company to the problem , the personal information of hundreds of employees could be compromised .
The customer did not have the capability of running Cisco IPS inline , so the firewall was examined .
When monitoring the botnet , it became very clear that the IRC servers would update fairly frequently .
The IRC servers would move ports , servers , and change passwords , sometimes several times a day .
This frequent updating made it extremely hard to block the command - and - control servers .
The team found a visible flaw in the attack : the botmaster had overlooked the update servers .
The botmaster had several domain names for the update server that could be broadcast by means of IRC to update the bots before a server change - over .
Close inspection revealed that the IP address of the update server always belonged to one of a small group of machines .
Blocks were put in place immediately .
When the botmaster issued the next update , only a few of the systems ( and none from the customer ) followed .
The botmaster repeatedly issued the update command to no avail .
When the machines were locked down to one IRC server , a single block was sufficient to disable the network .
Had the botnet - client been more robust , it would have been necessary to block backup networks .
In this case , the customer was lucky , and the single block was sufficient .
The team continued monitoring the network to ensure the systems were unable to reconnect to the network , giving the customer the needed time to reimage all of the compromised machines .
It was not a perfect solution , but it stopped the data leakage and prevented the systems from compromising other machines on the network .
Conversations with a Botmaster
With the customer protected , only curiosity remained .
The team wondered what type of attacker would go to such complicated lengths but leave such a simple hole in their plan of attack .
Did the botmaster have so many networks that it did n’t matter if one was blocked ?
Was the botmaster a script kiddie ?
For answers , one of the researchers decided to go back to a monitoring box and ask .
At this stage the customer was protected and the botmaster was likely away from the keyboard .
The researcher sent out an intrepid “ hey ” and received a response from the botmaster : “ ? ” Thus began what turned into a months - long conversation .
The botmaster , upon realizing that one of his bots was suddenly sentient , appeared to assume that the researcher was a fellow botmaster and that their respective networks had “ collided . ”
The researcher worked to strengthen the botmaster ’s assumption .
Pretending to be a fellow botmaster , the researcher asked about the server software .
Figure 3 shows the initial conversation with the botmaster .
Figure 3 . Starting a Conversation
After some inconsequential chat , the researcher asked if the botmaster was using his network for anything interesting .
The botmaster readily revealed his master plan : to compromise a few thousand machines and then sell them off in big batches .
With careful questions , the researcher learned from the botmaster that the market rate was about US $ 0.10 - $ 0.25 per machine and that the botmaster had recently sold 10,000 machines for US$ 800 .
In attempts to bond with the botmaster , the researcher discussed popular exploits , sharing stories of “ pwning , ” or gaining control of , dozens of machines at a time .
With a solid background in IPS , the researcher was aware of current trends in vulnerability research but asked in what area the botmaster focused his efforts .
The expected answer was a Microsoft vulnerability that worms such as Conficker exploit .
The botmaster ’s answer , however , was that he mostly focused on instant messaging software .
No vulnerability was required to grow his network .
Instead , he could spam 10,000 people with a simple “ check out this cool software ” message and rely on at least a one percent response from the recipients .
As an approach , it made sense , because the same process continues to work for spammers as it has worked for years , despite efforts at user education .
After revealing his methodology , the botmaster appeared to suddenly realize that perhaps he had shared too much information with an unknown person .
He quizzed the researcher on “ old school ” ( that is , previously well - known ) hackers .
The researcher responded that he did not know any of the old - school attackers .
( When the researcher later did online searches on the old - school attackers , most of them had been apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigations . )
By saying he did not know any of the attackers that the botmaster named , the researcher established credibility with the botmaster that he was not a law enforcement agent .
After this exchange , the botmaster gave the researcher his contact information through Microsoft Network ( MSN ) so the two could communicate more easily .
Figure 4 shows a trust - building session between the researcher and the botmaster .
Figure 4 . Building Trust
You Can Find Everything on the Internet
As any good hacker would , the researcher immediately keyed the botmaster ’s screen name into Google and found a few posts .
The posts led the researcher to additional handles , or usernames , which then led to hundreds of posts by the same author .
Under a different handle , the botmaster was the author of an enormous amount of IRC - based botnet software .
He was also very well known in the black hat community , where attackers and hackers share information .
Intrigued , the researcher decided to accept the botmaster ’s invitation to stay in touch .
The researcher created an MSN account and , over the course of several days , multiple MSN conversations were held between the researcher and the botmaster .
Topics focused primarily on secrets of the botnet trade and discussions of various software packages .
The botmaster confirmed the researcher ’s theory that many of the IRC - based botnets stemmed from a single source ; however , he declined to provide a copy of the modified version he had adapted .
Instead , the botmaster directed the researcher to an online forum that was contained a profusion of information regarding botnet activity .
Figures 5 and 6 shows the conversations of the botmaster directing the researcher to the forum .
Figure 5 . Directions to a Forum — Part 1
Figure 6 . Directions to a Forum — Part 2
One - Stop Botnet Shopping
The forum hosted discussions on all the information that anyone would need to form a botnet , including several detailed how - to guides .
The researcher was able to acquire source code for the bot and the server from the forum .
The server code was based upon a modified Unreal IRC server .
The client code , which would have no legitimate use , was a valuable source for IPS signatures .
While it would be possible that all of the command functionality could be rewritten , if botmasters were capable of doing that , they likely would n’t use the publicly available source code .
Entire sections of the forum were dedicated to the buying and selling of botnet paraphernalia , such as RapidShare file hosting accounts , packers , password lists , bot software , and password stealers .
The bot software is advertised much like any other software , listing various features such as “ four methods of command and control , ” “ undetected by virus scanners , ” “ anti-x ( sandbox , debugger , etc. ) , ” “ process monitoring , ” and so forth .
Several bot software authors have followed the Microsoft practice of offering multiple versions of software at tiered pricing levels .
The “ For Sale ” sections were governed by a very specific set of rules , including a rule that stated that botnet software could not be sold in the forum , likely due to the laws of the country in which the server hosting the forum resides .
The software for creating botnets , including directions and tutorials , was widely available for download or purchase .
It was forbidden to sell the software on the forum if the software was publicly available , a rule that seemed to be an attempt to deter botmasters from taking advantage of one another .
For concerned bot shoppers , all software was verified by a trusted moderator so that the buyer could trust that they would be receiving the software for which they were paying .
Pretense to Avoid Pwning
The customer who had originally been infected had been clean for months when the researcher decided to seek out the botmaster again to learn more about the botnet community .
The researcher was concerned about not revealing any specifics about the customer or himself but needed to establish a level of trust with the botmaster .
With these considerations in mind , the researcher decided it was more likely that the botmaster would speak with a journalist than an IPS specialist pretending to be a fellow botmaster .
After re-establishing contact with the botmaster , the researcher promptly “ confessed ” to being a reporter researching an article on botnets .
The researcher explained that he had contacted the botmaster again because he was seeking the most accurate data possible for his article .
The researcher expected his virtual disguise would pass the botmaster ’s scrutiny because of the widespread disdain by certain groups in the security community of the quality of security reporting .
Within the security community , there is a perception that only a few reporters actually understand the security topics that they cover .
Some part of nearly every story is wrong or greatly exaggerated .
For example , a recent article in PC World [ 1 ] stated that the widely publicized attack on the creator of Metasploit was performed by an unknown attacker who had weaponized Dan Kaminsky ’s discovery of a fundamental flaw in DNS [ 2 ] .
The article contained so many errors that , in addition to a printed retraction , additional reporting was required to correct the published description of the issue [ 3 ] .
H D Moore , Metasploit ’s creator , claimed that the statements attributed to him were completely fabricated [ 4 ] .
The botmaster had strong opinions on security reporting .
He mentioned conflickr in particular as example of faulty reporting that resulted in exaggerated numbers of systems affected .
One antivirus software company [ 5 ] had based its publicly reported numbers of affected machine on a variable in the URI sent from the compromised machines .
The variable , known as Q , reported the number of machines that had been successfully attacked to the botnet ’s command and control system .
This method of calculating the number of compromised machines was easily manipulated by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ( DHCP ) and other means .
A user on the company ’s public blog even posted a comment pointing out the possibility of easy manipulation , but the company dismissed the comment and did not correct its reported numbers .
The actual count of affected systems would not be realized until weeks later in a subsequent report by a separate research company [ 6 ] that explicitly pointed out that “ Q reports the number of machines that each victim claims to have infected .
Q may be artificially inflated by reinfections and DHCP effects ” ( The Q variable is the value in the URI that was thought to report the number of compromised machines . )
According to the latest report [ 7 ] , the numbers reported using the initial method was was off by a multiple of 50 .
Figure 7 shows a continuation of the conversation between the researcher and the botmaster .
Figure 7 . A Little Anonymous Fame
The researcher assured the botmaster that even if he chose not to be interviewed or answer questions , he could have a little " anonymous fame . "
Surprisingly , the botmaster agreed to participate .
Recognizing the unusual opportunity , the researcher suggested a TOR audio conference [ 8 ] using a method known as onion routing that would be untraceable .
The botmaster reported he did not have a microphone available , but more likely , he feared the researcher would try to trace him through the tunneling connections .
His reluctance to audio conference may also have been based on his lack of knowledge of the onion routing protocol .
The researcher ’s first question was why it would be preferable to sell bots instead of turning them into spam or phishing networks .
The botmaster ’s answer was that selling bots was a rarity ; normally , bots would be used as a network for phishing attacks .
When the researcher asked how much money could actually be made from phishing activities , the botmaster was evasive about his most lucrative bot activities , but said “ a guy he knew ” was able to earn US $ 5000 to US $ 10,000 a week solely through phishing activities .
Figures 8 and 9 show conversations about selling bots .
Figure 8 . Phish or Sell
Figure 9 . Lucrative or Unprofitable ?
The researcher offered the botmaster a lighter question , asking what was the strangest thing the botmaster had found on a compromised machine .
The botmaster replied he had found inappropriate pictures of a minor and had promptly reported the issue to the authorities .
The researcher asked the botnet owner about his proudest moment as a botmaster .
The answer involved the Windows Distributed Component Object Model ( DCOM ) attack ( MS03-026 , IAM 11104 ) , which exploited a bug in the DCOM Remote Procedure Call ( RPC ) interface .
The vulnerability existed in all modern versions of Windows at the time and was remarkably easy to exploit .
The botmaster said that when he ran the attack , his server was flooded with joins , with each join representing the compromised machine of an unsuspecting user .
The researcher and the botmaster continued to chat , discussing protective measures .
New security features in Windows Vista , such as kernel patch protection , prevented his bot from running in Ring0 [ 9 ] .
Ring0 is a term from system management mode .
Briefly , this protection system involves three rings .
Ring0 is the most privileged ring , where the kernel resides , and Ring3 is the least privileged ring , where a user ’s programs execute .
Given this limitation , the botmaster ’s bot would not function on the Vista OS .
Figure 10 shows the conversation about Ring0
Figure 10 .
Protective Measures
Over the course of the conversations , the botmaster revealed that he could never trust anyone 100 percent of the time and that it was necessary for him to be on guard constantly and follow good computing practices .
Other botmasters would act on any opportunity to take over his networks , and according to Google - cache hits , they had tried in the past .
However , lack of trust is common among botnet owners , and with good reason .
In one instance , the botmaster had used a hijacked account to impersonate a law enforcement official and force another botmaster to abandon a 6,000 - node network .
The botmaster had to remain alert at all times , his firewall blocking nearly all inbound connections , and surfing the Internet via proxy chains [ 10 ] to remain anonymous .
The botmaster recommended a list of best and worst sites that are based around forums .
Forums may facilitate the code re-use that is often associated with botnet clients .
The botnet community is similar to the open source community , in which more experienced users in the forum help or humiliate new botmasters .
According to the botmaster , only 20 percent really understand the code offered through the forums ; the rest simply run the code and do their best to follow the help files .
He estimated another three to five percent of botmasters write unique code .
Figure 11 shows a conversation in which the botmaster estimates the percentage of unique coders .
Figure 11 .
Who Writes Code ?
Conclusion
Many people , researchers included , wonder why attackers do not pursue legitimate IT or programming jobs .
According to the botmaster , the barriers to legitimate work are a criminal record and a lack of professional education ; frequently , both factors prevent attackers from gaining regular employment .
Figure 12 shows the conversation regarding barriers to legitimate occupations .
Figure 12 .
Why Not Get a Real Job ?
The researcher asked how attackers experience security companies and services , and whether the botmaster felt pressured by the security companies .
His response was that “ a few companies catch on very quickly but , for the most part , it is business as usual . ”
As the botmaster stated , running a botnet was his business .
The criminality of running a botnet was simply a by - product of his primary means of employment .
The botmaster 's product is a management interface to a multinode network that can be sold to other customers for a profit .
Perceiving himself as a small business owner , the botmaster is not concerned with impacting the functionality of a user 's personal computer or with the possibilities of identity theft or data leakage , but instead with generating income .
Anyone with basic computer experience is able to run a botnet .
It is not necessary to understand the code , nor is there a need to understand networking .
Both traditional and new media organizations frequently report on the need to patch against the latest threat that exploits a recent vulnerability .
Readers rarely hear , however , about the kid who lives in their neighborhood who runs a 10,000 - node botnet based off of MSN instant message spam .
All bots are not created with equal proficiency .
Botmasters are implementing cutting - edge evasion techniques to avoid detection and prevent reverse engineering .
It is imperative to keep attackers of both types in mind , professionals and script kiddies , when designing a network ’s defenses .
To effectively combat the bot economy , the cost of doing business must be raised by educating users and following security best practices .
Attackers pursue easy money .
Maximum gain with minimal effort is the prime motivator for a botmaster .
If the time required to compromise machines increases , attackers will move on to easier targets .
Patching is important , but user education is key .
A corporation can deploy the latest security measures but remain vulnerable to data theft , hosting spam servers , or worse .
Business users must be educated to comply with safe behavior .
If policies are not in place to limit the infiltration on non business communications or if users do not understand the importance of leaving random files unopened , there is little point in administrators patching machines .
Using Cisco IPS alerts , the research team was able to successfully identify and disable a botnet .
The IRC traffic on non-standard ports was a clear sign of compromised systems .
Without Cisco IPS , the customer would have been blind to the botnet activity and its employees could have had their stored password compromised leading to bank fraud or identify theft .
If the customer had been able to run the IPS inline , the compromise would not have occurred .
An intrusion detection system also has its place in a network ; without the history of previous alerts from a management tool , the remediation for the customer ’s system would not have been possible .

The “ world ’s fastest kettle ” makes an earlier attempt at a speed record in California
The land speed record for steam - powered cars has been broken for the first time in more than 100 years , after a British - built car achieved an average speed of 225 kilometres per hour ( 140 miles per hour ) on Tuesday .
Many of the earliest road vehicles were powered by steam , which were easier and safer to start than early gas - powered cars , which had to be cranked by hand .
But by the 1920s , the convenience of the internal combustion engine had essentially made steam cars obsolete .
Now , Charles Burnett III has driven them back into the spotlight .
He reached speeds of 219 km / hr ( 136 mph ) and 243 km/ hr ( 151 mph ) during two drives at California ’s Edwards Air Force Base on Tuesday .
That smashes the previous official record of 204 km / hr ( 127 mph ) set in 1906 by Fred Marriott of the US in a modified version of the then - popular steam car known as the Stanley Steamer .
Officials from motor sport ’s governing body , the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile ( FIA ) , are expected to ratify the new record shortly .
Advertisement
Superheated steam
Burnett drove a 7.6 - metre-long , 3 - tonne car called “ Inspiration ” that grew out of a 1997 student project at Southampton University .
The car ’s engine burns liquid petroleum gas to heat water in 12 suitcase - sized boilers , creating steam heated to 400°C .
The steam then drives a two - stage turbine that spins at 13,000 revolutions per minute to power its wheels .
The FIA requires two 1.6 - km - long runs to be performed in opposite directions – to cancel out any effect from wind – within 60 minutes .
Ramp up
Inspiration made the first run at 0727 PDT ( 1427 GMT ) and turned around for the return run with just eight minutes to spare .
Before and after each timed run , it took 4 km to accelerate and another 4 km to slow down .
The record - setting drives came after several earlier attempts had been thwarted by electrical faults , valve problems , a storm and a tyre puncture the previous week .
But the team is planning another run on Wednesday , to try to get even closer to the car ’s theoretical top speed of 274 km / hr ( 170 mph ) .
Various groups are trying to develop new steam cars , but none have yet found an efficient way to convert the fuel ’s energy into forward motion .
I ’ve done a fair amount of reading and thinking about the theory and practice of germplasm collecting in my time , but I do n’t think I ’ve ever come across an example similar to the one described in a recent paper in Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution .
In it , Swedish researchers describe how they took advantage of a couple of interesting quirks in the history of Sweden to devise what I think is a pretty novel strategy for sampling agrobiodiversity .
They were interested in collecting germplasm of hops ( Humulus lupulus ) for a new genebank that ’s under development .
Now , the thing is that , although this crop is no longer grown in Sweden now , for 400 years from 1442 doing so was compulsory , in order to guarantee sufficient domestic production for beer - making .
Very sensible , too .
Initially , all peasants were required to grow at least 40 hop poles .
By 1483 , the quantity was increased to 200 hop poles .
The law was not formally repealed until 1860 .
As a result of this law , the plant has left several financial , fiscal and legal imprints on Swedish history .
The second historical curiosity about Sweden is that it boasts a unique set of some 12,000 large - scale maps dating back to the mid-17th century .
Because of the hops law , hop gardens are actually marked on these maps in some detail ( click to enlarge ) .
So the collectors used what they call a “ history to plant ” method to identify likely areas for collecting , using not only maps such as the one reproduced above , but also …
… medieval charters from the fifteenth century files of land belonging to the abbey of Vadstena , documents from the expeditions of Carl von Linné and his pupils from the eighteenth century and also documents from the breeding program in Svalöf from the beginning of the twentieth century .
And a pretty successful strategy it was too .
We found no hop plants at locations which were not indicated in the maps as hop gardens .
Today living plants were possible to find in more then 33 % of the total inventoried sites , indicated as hop gardens on large - scale maps .
As I say , I ca n’t think of another example of the use of historical maps to locate specific crops for sampling .
No doubt the specific circumstances that made this possible in Sweden are not all that common around the world .
Anyway , if you know of similar work , let me know .
Always interested in keeping up to date with the latest in germplasm collecting .
Officials said there were growing reports of bribe - taking at the airport
Staff at Nepal 's main international airport are to be issued with trousers without pockets , in an attempt to wipe out rampant bribe - taking .
The country 's anti-corruption body said there had been growing complaints about staff at Kathmandu 's Tribhuvan airport .
A spokesman said trousers without pockets would help the authorities " curb the irregularities " .
The move comes after the prime minister of Nepal said corruption was damaging the airport 's reputation , AFP reported .
The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ( CIAA ) said it had sent a team to the airport to " observe the growing complaints about the behaviour of airport authorities and workers towards travellers " .
" We discovered that the reports were true , " spokesman Ishwori Prasad Paudyal told the AFP news agency .
" So we decided that airport officials should be given trousers with no pockets . "
He said the Ministry of Civil Aviation had been instructed to put the measure in place as soon as possible .
" We believe this will help curb the irregularities , " he said .
The BBC's Nepali service says almost all incidents of petty corruption have been directed at Nepalese travellers rather than tourists .

こういう名前の変数が出てくるのだが、意味わかる？
答え：受付禁止情 報
今読んでいるPL/SQLコードは本当にひどい出来なのだが、その中でもネーミングが群を抜いてひどすぎてむしろ笑えてくるので、ここでさらしてみたい。
先ほどの例でわかると思うが、悪しきネーミング習慣である 子音 母音抜きの嵐である。変数名だろうが関数名だろうがこのルールで命名されているので、暗号文を読んでいるような気分になる。
他には、例えばこんなのがある。
SKSI 作成 HNKN 変換 KKT 確定 CHKN 中間 DTM Datetime DTA Data
こうして見ると、ktkrやwktkとなんら違いがない。
" 作成 " のような、比較的簡単に対応する英単語が見つかるものまで日本語 子音 母音抜きで書くという徹底ぶり。でも " 情報 " はINF だったりする統一感のなさ。そしてこれらが単独ならまだしも、複合して出てくるから始末に負えない。なぜなら、単語間の区切りが無いからだ。例えば、YYKTRKSUKTKSYSIINFHYJまでくるととても読めたものではない*1。
また、英単語そのままでよいはずのところも意味不明の改悪をしている。INFは一般的だからいいが、DTMと書かれたら普通は別のものを連想するだろう*2。特にDataをDTAにするところなんて神懸かっている。"
a" を一つ抜くことで誰が幸せになるというのか。
俺は変数名に日本語のローマ字読みを使うことは反対しない。しかし、普通にローマ字書きすればいいのに、なんでこういうマネをするのか。
おそらく、PL/SQLの識別子には30文字までしか使えないらしいので極力短くしているのだろう。しかし、PL/SQLはパッケージを使えるんだから、それを利用してもっと責務を分割してわかりやすい構成と名称にすることはできたはずだ。数百行の関数が頻出しているのを見れば、そうできないはずがない。コード全体の設計のまずさが、ネーミングにまで悪影響を及ぼしている。
そう、ネーミング以外にも、長すぎる関数、無意味なコメント、変更箇所をコメントアウトして残す、などなど技術者を詐称するカスがやりがちなアンチパターンを一通り取りそろえているのだ。それゆえに、なにか事情があってこのような有様になっているのだろう、と好意的に考えられない。おそらく単に担当者が無能なのである*3。
ただでさえ読みづらいコードを必死に頭に収めようとようとしているのに、こうした名前の変数の意味を解読している間にそれまで読み込んだ処理内容が頭から抜け落ちてしまう。恐ろしく困難なミッションである。そのくせ、これを成し遂げたところで自分のキャリアにとって何のプラスにもならない。何より、この妙なネーミングに適応するのがいやだ、脳が汚染される気がする。
ここは地獄だ 。

Rating : 4.5
Pros :
The best book available on Ruby
Cons :
Not suitable for beginners
Reviewed by : Mike James
This is clearly an important book as it's written by the creator of the Ruby programming language , and an experienced and well regarded author .
If you check the Amazon reviews you will also find that the book scores a straight 5 from everyone and the reviews are slightly in awe of the volume .
However , if you read carefully what people say you might come to the conclusion that the comments do n't really justify the " perfect " rating .
This is without doubt a good book on Ruby but it has some shortcomings .
The most important is that this is n't a book for the beginner because it tackles topics in an order that reveals the structure of Ruby rather than provides a good and easy introductory pathway into the language .
It also does n't make a good technical reference because it simply is n’t exhaustive and it is n't a good cookbook because that 's not what it sets out to do .
What it does set out to do is explain some of the more unusual approaches of Ruby to programming methodology .
In this it succeeds in explaining ideas such as Ruby 's approach to functional programming , objects , the use of iterators , blocks and meta programming in general .
It often fails to explain the differences between Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 and never mentions other dialects such as IronRuby .
Even when it does draw your attention to differences between 1.8 and 1.9 it rarely comments on how to get around the lack of some feature .
As you might expect from a team that includes the creator of the language , the authors tend to be rather too uncritical of Ruby and its place in the wider world of programming languages .
It would have been nice to read more comments that laid bare the problems with the language and how its philosophy fitted in with other modern approaches to programming .
Even with these criticisms I enjoyed reading it .
It 's well written , full of interest and rewarding .
It 's currently the best book on Ruby but it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement .
For now this is the de facto standard text on Ruby and if you want to know about the language you need to buy a copy .

ALEXANDRIA , Virginia ( CNN ) -- Former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana was convicted Wednesday on 11 of the 16 corruption charges against him in a case that included the discovery of $ 90,000 in his freezer .
Former Rep. William Jefferson arrives at U.S. District Court with his wife , Andrea , on June 9 .
A federal court jury convicted Jefferson on four bribery counts , three counts of money laundering , three counts of wire fraud and one count of racketeering .
He was acquitted on five other counts including wire fraud and obstruction of justice .
Jefferson , a 62 - year - old Democrat , was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 4 , 2007 , about two years after federal agents said they found the cash in his freezer .
Authorities said the cash was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on video .
Jefferson had pleaded not guilty .
He faces a maximum possible sentence of 150 years in prison , with sentencing tentatively set for October 30 .
After the verdict on the fifth day of jury deliberations , U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis turned down a prosecution request for Jefferson to be taken into custody , ruling that he posed no flight risk .
The verdict showed that " no person , not even a congressman , is above the law , " said U.S. Attorney Dana Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia .
Asked what might have turned the case in the prosecution 's favor , Boente said : " We always thought that a powerful piece of evidence in this case was $ 90,000 in a freezer . "
A stern - faced Jefferson emerged from the courthouse with his lawyer , Robert Trout , who said the verdict would be appealed .
" We 're very disappointed that the jury disagreed with us , " Trout said .
Asked how he was holding up , Jefferson smiled briefly and answered , " I 'm holding up , " before walking away .
Jefferson was accused of using his congressional clout between 2001 and 2005 to solicit and receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting products and services in Africa , especially Nigeria , and elsewhere .
The information on the cash discovered in Jefferson 's Washington home in August 2005 was revealed in an affidavit used to obtain a warrant to search Jefferson 's office in May 2006 .
Descriptions from the heavily redacted affidavit and pictures of the open freezer show bills wrapped in foil and tucked into frozen food containers , including a box for pie crusts and another for veggie burgers .
FBI agents told a judge the money was part of a $ 100,000 payment delivered by an informant in the bribery investigation , which led to guilty pleas by a Kentucky businessman and a former Jefferson aide .
Jefferson , who graduated from Harvard Law School , represented Louisiana 's 2nd Congressional District , which includes most of the New Orleans area
He held office for 18 years , or nine terms , before he lost his House seat to Anh Joseph Cao in the December 2008 election .
" This is a difficult day for the people of New Orleans and Louisiana , but now we can turn the page on a negative past to focus on a positive future , " Cao said .
" My thoughts and prayers go out to Mr. Jefferson and his family during this time . "
As a representative , he served on the House Ways and Means Committee 's subcommittee on trade and on the Budget Committee , and he co-chaired the caucus on Africa Trade and Investment as well as the caucus on Nigeria .

A nutrition company owned by the same company that owns the Atlanta Braves is selling steroids over the Internet , according to allegations in court papers unsealed Thursday .
The nutrition company , BodyBuilding.com , is selling dietary supplements that contain steroids and designer steroids , including a substance found in the raid on the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative in 2003 , the court papers said .
Federal authorities unsealed a search warrant on Thursday after agents raided the headquarters and a warehouse of BodyBuilding.com in the Boise , Idaho , area .
In 2008 , Liberty Media purchased a controlling stake in BodyBuilding.com for over $ 100 million .
Liberty Media bought the Braves from Time Warner in 2007 .
Among the other businesses in which Liberty Media has interests are QVC , Ticketmaster and DirectTV .
The raid was part of an ongoing effort by the Food and Drug Administration to target companies that are selling steroids as dietary supplements .
Unlike drug makers , which must demonstrate that a drug is safe and effective before the agency approves it for sale to the public , dietary supplements are a largely self - regulating industry .
German engineer Max Schiemann was among the first engineers to develop a commercial trolleybus system for passengers at the turn of the 20th century .
He also created some unique cargo systems .
1. Hafenschleppbahn in Altona ( 1912 -1950 )
The most succesfull ( and most remarkable ) trolleytruck network designed and constructed by Schiemann was the " Hafenschleppbahn " in Altona , today an area in Hamburg .
The road from the port to the town was so steep that horses had severe difficulty climbing it .
Trolleytruck technology came to the rescue , but the electric trucks on the one kilometre long track ( up and down ) did not replace the horses .
The trucks were used as an assisting power source .
As can be seen on the pictures below , the trolleytruck pushed or pulled one or more horse cars , while other wagons ( handcarts included ) were also attached to the convoy .
( The guy on the bike is not ) .
This hybrid system combining electricity with animal and human power started operation in 1912 and remained in service until 1950 .
Each day , around 200 wagons were pulled or pushed up the hill , each convoy transporting 5 to 7 tonnes of cargo .
In the first ten months of its existence , the road trains took more than 22,000 wagons up the hill .
Total electricity consumption during that period was 30,878 kilowatt - hours .
The maximum speed of the trolleytrucks was 10 kilometres per hour while climbing the hill and 30 kilometres per hour on flat terrain .
The average speed of the convoy was 5 to 8 kilometres per hour and the trip up the hill took 8 minutes , coupling and uncoupling included .
In total six trucks were used , several of them at the same time ( two trucks crossing posed no problem since the one coming down was not connected to the overhead line ) .
Fees were collected during the trip .
The service was initially exploited by the " Gesellschaft für gleislose Bahnen Max Schiemann & Co. " , from 1922 it was run by the town of Altona , and later by the city of Hamburg .
2. Bielatal Bahn ( 1901 - 1904 ) & Industriebahn Wurzen ( 1905 - 1928 )
The first system built by Schiemann and his " Geselschaft für gleislose Bahnen Max Schiemann & Co. " was the " Bielatalbahn " , a 2.8 kilometre long track in Sachsen .
It carried both passengers and cargo ( mainly for a paper factory ) .
The track operated only from 1901 to 1904 , but the infrastructure was reused to build ( part of ) a new line close to Leipzig : the " Industriebahn Wurzen " , an exclusive cargo line which was in operation from 1905 until 1928 .
It was 3.46 kilometres long ( 4.23 kilometres up to 1914 , when an extra track was in use ) .
The cargo system consisted of 2 trolleytrucks , 10 wagons for coal transport ( each with a capacity of 6 tons ) and 27 wagons for flour transport ( each with a capacity of 5 tons ) .
Each truck had a power output of 25 HP and could pull a maximum of 3 wagons with a total weight of 15 tonnes ( comparable to this contemporary truck ) .
The speed of the road train was 6 kilometres per hour when loaded and 8 kilometres per hour when unloaded .
The trolleytrucks were initially equipped with wood and iron wheels with spokes , only later to be replaced by rubber tyres .
The same trucks were used for the full 23 years , accidents did not occur .
The line was constructed to transport flour from a flour mill to the cargo train station .
An extra track carried coal from a mine to the station , but was closed when the mine shut down in 1914 .
On average , 300 tons of cargo was transported each day .
Planned extensions to a wallpaper factory and a felt factory were never realised .
Since the production facilities of Schiemann were located in the same town , the track was also used to test vehicles and convoys for other lines .
Allegedly , the owner of the flour mill also had a small private passenger vehicle for use on the line .
3. Kalkbahn Grevenbrücker ( 1903 - 1907 )
The first trolleyline built exclusively for cargo ( the " Kalkbahn " ) was installed in Grevenbrück , a village in the present - day municipality of Lennestadt in Nordrhein - Westfalen .
The 1.5 kilometre trajectory served to transport limestone from a quarry ( opened in 1902 ) to the train station .
The route went straight through the town and crossed an old bridge .
The line opened in 1903 and was closed in 1907 , when the quarry was relocated .
The service was operated by the mining company itself , the " Grevenbrücker Kalkwerke " .
About 20 convoys passed each day , at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour ( loaded ) or 7 to 8 kilometres an hour ( unloaded ) .
The trucks could pull 3 to 4 wagons ( each with a capacity of 5 to 6 tonnes ) in good weather conditions , and 2 wagons when there was ice or snow .
In winter , the trolleytrucks were equipped with snow tyres ( above ) .
For the same reason , the wagons on the first Schiemann system ( the Bielatalbahn described above ) were equipped with skates .
The trolleytruck was also used to pull a rolling mill for road building ( below ) .
The " Kalkbahn " was built in just 3 months .
Financial savings were about 33 percent compared to the same trajectory by horse cart .
The town of Grevenbüch also had a second line , the " Veischedetal Bahn " ( scroll down ) , which was in operation from 1904 to 1916 .
Until 1907 it transported both passengers and goods ( mainly tobacco to some cigar factories ) , after that date it carried only passengers and mail .
The route was 8 kilometres long and the vehicles attained a speed of 18 km/h .
Both trolley lines came together at the train station , but they were not interconnected .
4. Other Schiemann trolley lines
Max Schieman built 12 lines in total : several passenger trolley lines as well as some more routes that were used to transport both passengers and cargo .
The " Gleislose Bahn Blankenese - Marienhöhe " ( below ) had a length of 3 kilometres and carried passengers between the train station and the town .
It was in operation from 1911 to 1915 .
The passenger line " Gleislose Bahn Ahrweiler " was in operation from 1906 to 1917 and had a length of 5.5 kilometres .
The 4.5 kilometres long " Gleislose Bahn Monheim - Langenfeld " transported both goods ( 5,000 tonnes per year ) , passengers and mail .
It was in operation from 1904 to 1908 and was the only line that was discontinued because of technical problems - the trucks were too heavy and damaged the road .
Contemporaries of Schiemann , building or experimenting with trolleytruck systems , were Werner von Siemens , Lombard Und Guérin ( France ) , Carl Stoll , Charles Nithard ( France ) , E.Cantono ( Italy ) , Hans - Ludwig Stoll and Lloyd - Köhler .
World War I slowed down the further development of trolley systems , and it was only in the 1930s that the technology really took off .
Only for passengers , though , since cargo systems never became widespread .
Trolleytrucks ( and trolleybuses ) would make a lot of sense these days .

Great ideas tend to make so much sense that you wonder why they took so long .
Here 's another : USAA , a privately held bank / insurance company , is updating its iPhone app to let customers snap both sides of a check for deposits .

The bank 's VP tells
The NY Times that once you hit the send button , the deposit is made just like any other check — you wo n't have to mail it in later , either .
As everything will be handled electronically , the bank will suggest customers simply void the check before either filing or discarding it .
The Times does point out that the capability will only be available to customers who are either eligible for credit , or have some type of insurance through the bank , but I gotta tell you — if my bank had this , I 'd definitely use it .
Being able to deposit at the ATM is one thing , but this screams convenience .

Would you use such a feature , or would concerns over the iPhone 's security make you too wary ?

Josh stood up .
He saluted smartly .
" Send me an owl . "
" Come on , they 're waiting for us .
Fogg is freezing his ass off . "
" Good for him .
Too much ass on that man anyway . "
Quentin got Josh out of the library and heading toward the rear of the House , though he was moving slowly with a worrying tendency to lurch into door frames and occasionally into Quentin .
He did an abrupt about - face .
" Hang on , " he said .
" Gotta get my quidditch costume .
I mean uniform .
I mean welters . "
" We do n't have uniforms . "
" I know that , " Josh snapped .
" I 'm drunk , I 'm not delusional .
I still need my winter coat . "
Grossman is an author and critic for Time and has written for a number of high - profile magazines .
He is a talented writer and handles his story telling with skill .
His characters have depth and this story takes on a very gritty sense of reality , something that is not often found in fantasy .
I was impressed with his writing , yet at the same time I was torn with how I felt about the book .
I found it to be compelling and at the same time difficult .
It took me a few weeks to process the whole thing and get an idea of why the book impacted me the way that it did .
I 'm going to lay that all out now , but I have to say that when reviewing fiction I work very hard to avoid discussing plot .
In this case , it will be impossible to some extent .
I do n't think I 'm going to give away anything that the promotional material does n't make pretty obvious , but anyone who wants to go into this book knowing as little as possible should stop reading now .
The protagonist , Quentin Coldwater , is a nerd .
He 's an academic over - achiever living a life of privilege , set on a path of success .
He 's also extremely unhappy , feeling disconnected from the rest of the world .
He struggles with his inability to connect with others and the meaninglessness of life .
He has sought out and found some respite in the fantasy world of Fillory , a magical land created and explored in the books of an American author that lived in England .
At the start of The Magicians Quentin in on his way to an interview as part of the admissions process for Princeton .
But this does not end up as another normal day for Quentin .
Rather than his ultimate destination , Princeton , Quentin ends up at Brakebills .
Brakebills is a university in upstate New York where students learn magic .
While Hogwarts was not the first literary school of magic , it is the model Grossman has in mind and he is very up front about that fact .
The students take part in a magical game called Welters .
At one point a team member of Quentin's , Josh , is absent at the start of a match .
Quentin hunts him down and the following interaction takes place between the two of them .
This sliver does a lot to reveal the similarities and differences .
Brakebills is very much like Hogwarts in external ways , and completely different in substance .
The school is for adults , not children and the life that Grossman portrays is much more in line with reality than fantasy .
This is not a book to pick up for a young child .
This story contains profanity , sexual content , graphic violence , as well as alcohol and drug abuse .
This is where I ran into my first issue with The Magicians .
I 'll get to that shortly , but first I 'd like to finish laying out what the book involves .
Not all of Brakebills is lifted straight from Hogwarts , though I do n't think the reader with much experience in reading fantasy will find anything that could really be called new .
What there is , as I have mentioned , is very well done .
Grossman builds up to moments of palpable tension .
He pulls the reader into the life of Quentin and shows real finesse at times .
His characters very much come alive , in their brief moments of joy and in their many moments of pain , frustration and loss .
Anyone who has felt the hurt of being outside , dealing with the cruelty of others or a general questioning of meaning will be able to relate well to the protagonist .
Eventually school is over and the students graduate .
And here is the turn that I think the promotional material makes obvious but some may not want to know about going into reading the book .
The second section of the story begins as Quentin and his fellow Brakebills alumni find out that Fillory is real .
They immediately prepare to set out on an expedition to the land they 've loved since childhood .
That Fillory is better spelled N - a - r - n - i- a is just as obvious as the connection to Rowling 's work .
Quentin and company enter Fillory using magic buttons that take them to an intermediary world of fountains .
Jumping into each fountain takes a person to a different world .
They have to take care to jump into the correct pool at the base of the fountain that will take them to Fillory .
Fillory is a land of talking beasts and magical creatures .
So what sets
The Magicians apart from lesser books that lift heavily from other works ?
Why is The Magicians a strong story while something like Eragon is a weak rip - off ?
I think it boils down to two elements .
First is Grossman 's strong writing .
Even if this were just a big piece of fan fiction , it would be well written fan fiction .
Secondly , this is n't just an homage to the work of others .
While Grossman has lifted the settings and externals , the substance is completely different often to the point of taking a position that is completely antithetical to the original work .
My first problem , which I tie to the very adult content is wrapped up in why I read fantasy .
I read fantasy on many levels as a form of escape , much like Grossman 's character Quentin did .
Much of the fantasy I 've read is not only fantasy but it is written for children .
At the bottom of it all there is no real risk or fear .
I read with anticipation , not of an outcome but rather how that outcome will be worked out by the author .
There is often death or treachery but it takes on a fairy tale like quality .
It does not feel real or cruel but rather cartoonish .
Grossman completely jettisons any of this kind of approach .
He tackles the safety of these children 's tales and eviscerates it .
The violence in The Magicians is not cartoonish , it is often cruel even sadistic .
There 's not much in the way of escapism here .
What Quentin finds is that magic does n't change the basic underlying facts of life , not even traveling to another world does this .
This is combined with the fact that much of Grossman 's realism includes behavior and speech that is n't something that I would consider normal or appropriate .
It may be for others but this is n't a book I would feel comfortable recommending to friends or family .
Then there is my second issue .
I 've read that Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy is intended to be a type of anti-Narnia .
Well Grossman does n't just create an alternative world that is contrary to Narnia .
He destroys Narnia from the inside .
And this caused issues for me in both sections of the book at times .
Not because of ideological difficulties with what Grossman puts forward but because it would frequently push me outside the story as it felt like Grossman would move from telling his own story to commenting on the story of another .
It is n't that what he has to say about the other stories is n't interesting and that he does n't bring up intriguing issues and criticisms of both , but rather that it jarred me out of the narrative as the story became more a work of exposition .
Something like the flashbacks to History and Moral Philosophy class that fill so much of Starship Troopers .
The author shows his hand , that he is more interested in making a point than telling a story .
The fact that a major component of the book is polemic in nature means much of the discussion around the book will not be about plot or setting but rather about the argument the author sets forth .
I do n't agree with Grossman 's premise or conclusions but I do admire how well he states his case throughout the entire book , not only in those portions that might feel a bit preachy .
I 've read in an interview Grossman did about The Magicians that he feels that Rowling lets her characters solve their problems , rather than resting on divine intervention like the characters of Lewis 's works .
This is reflected in how he handles the world of each , though I would argue that this is not the case , especially in light of how Rowling 's series ended .
I think it does explain why he is so much rougher on Lewis .
Anyone looking for a dark story that questions the assumptions and underlying principles of those that are not so dark should really enjoy this book .
Any parent that picks it up for their young one because they hear it compared to Harry Potter is in for a rude surprise .
Those looking for a fun little escape from the real world wont find it here , though things are so grim at times they may find the real world a bit of a relief after the weight of Grossman's .
The Magicians held my attention and I was impressed with Grossman 's ability , unfortunately at the same time I was a bit disappointed with how he used that ability .
With something this subjective your mileage may vary , and since release The Magicians has hit number nine on the New York Times best sellers list .
Viking set up a number of web sites to support the release of The Magicians .
This is not so much about the book itself but will be of interest to readers and I think is an interesting development for book lovers in general .
There are four sites The MagiciansBook.com is a normal promotional site with information on the book .
ChristopherPlover.com brings to life the fictional author of the Fillory books .
Brakebills of course has a site , obfuscated just like the school itself .
Finally there is Embers Tomb a wealth of Fillory related information .
The Fillory and Plover sites come across as very genuine and will probably snag a reader or two into some level of confusion .
The Brakebills site is a bit too over the top to be taken seriously but then again , with real news sites quoting The Onion and the occasional uproar I see over humor sites like Objective Ministries there probably will be some who think it is a real school .
You can purchase The Magicians from amazon.com .

( CNN ) -- German car manufacturer BMW has announced it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the current season after a " landmark " decision to restructure the group 's motorsport activities was made by the company 's board in a meeting on Tuesday .
BMW Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One at the end of the 2009 season .
A statement on the BMW Sauber F1 Team 's official Web site stated that " the Formula One campaign is [ no longer ] a key promoter for us " and that " current developments in motor sport " had resulted in the decision .
Dr Norbert Reithofer , chairman of the BMW board of management , said : " Of course , this was a very difficult decision for us .
But it 's a resolute step in view of our company 's strategic realignment . "
The team currently lie eighth in the constructors ' world championship with eight points after 10 rounds and of their two drivers -- Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld -- Heidfeld sits a lowly 13th in the drivers ' championship with just six points .
BMW are the second manufacturer to pull out of F1 in a further blow to the sport after Honda 's withdrawal before the start of the 2009 season .
CNN 's analysis of BMW 's exit from Formula One . »
However , since Wednesday 's announcement , rival German car manufacturer Mercedes have reconfirmed their commitment to the sport .
" We regret the withdrawal of BMW from Formula One .
This decision will not have the slightest influence on our commitment to Formula One , " a spokesman for the company told AFP .
Motorsport 's world governing body , the FIA , reiterated their belief that the move was an indication of how the global economic downturn was affecting the sport .
In a statement on their official Web site , they said : " The FIA regrets the announcement of BMW 's intended withdrawal from Formula One but is not surprised by it .
It has been clear for some time that motor sport cannot ignore the world economic crisis .
" Car manufacturers cannot be expected to continue to pour large sums of money into Formula One when their survival depends on redundancies , plant closures and the support of the taxpayer .
This is why the FIA prepared regulations to reduce costs drastically .
" These measures were needed to alleviate the pressure on manufacturers following Honda 's withdrawal but also to make it possible for new teams to enter .
Had these regulations not been so strongly opposed by a number of team principals , the withdrawal of BMW and further such announcements in the future might have been avoided , " the statement added .
BMW entered Formula
One with a takeover of the Sauber F1 team in 2005 and finished fifth in the constructors ' championship in their debut campaign , before racing under their own name in 2006 .
With an aggressive aim of winning the world championship within three years , the team came close in 2007 finishing second to Ferrari , thanks largely to the exclusion of McLaren - Mercedes from the manufacturer 's points standings .
In 2008 , the team captured third , thanks in part to a first win in the Canadian Grand Prix for Polish driver Kubica .
The statement continued : " It only took us three years to establish ourselves as a top team with the BMW Sauber F1 team .
Unfortunately , the team were unable to meet expectations in the current season . "
The car - builder was also unable to " quantify redundancies " that may come from the move which follows the exit of Honda in December .
The Japanese manufacturer -- who according to FIA president Max Mosley were spending $ 500 m a season to compete in the sport -- cited the " sudden contraction of the world economies " as their reason to end racing .
This led to Mosley spearheading an FIA plan to enforce controversial cost - cutting measures on the teams for the 2010 season .
The Formula One furor explained .
These measures , which split opinion within the sport , are expected to be adopted in a watered - down form and could eventually save $ 60 million from the cost of running a team , according to Mosley .
However , the FIA were prompted by BMW 's exit to warn again that if the measures were weakened too much the positive impact on the sport could be reduced .
" As a result of a sustained cost - cutting campaign by the FIA , new measures are in the process of being agreed which should make it easier for new teams to enter and enable existing ones to participate on much reduced budgets .
" It is no secret that these measures do not go as far as the FIA would have liked but a compromise was needed in the interests of harmony in the sport .
Hopefully it will be enough to prevent further withdrawals and provide a solid foundation for Formula One , " the statement read .

Mark Cavendish and his Team Columbia - HTC teammates .
( Image credit : AFP )
Mark Cavendish claimed that there had been no Columbia plan and no attack as the wind whipped off the Mediterranean and blew across the Camargue marshlands .
But the stage three winner ’s version of events was contradicted by his Columbia - HTC teammates Michael Rogers and George Hincapie , who were both key protagonists in the great escape .
According to the rider himself , it was Rogers who instigated the move that forced the split .
" The other teams were n’t going to help us close the gap [ to the break ] but with 40 km {actually at 32 km to go - ed. ] to go we made a right [ turn ] and the wind was coming from the left hand side , ” explained the Australian .
“ I asked the guys to just do 5 km as hard as they could .
We opened up an echelon and the rest was done . "
This area is notorious for vicious crosswinds – two years ago , on a stage into Montpellier , the Alexandre Vinokourov - led Astana team adopted an identical tactic on these pan -flat , wind - battered roads .
On that occasion there was only one big loser , Christophe Moreau .
Two years on , despite the fact that the wind was a light breeze compared to last time , there was carnage , with Alberto Contador , Cadel Evans , Carlos Sastre and the Schleck brothers among the overall favourites to concede valuable time .
Columbia - HTC seemed to find willing allies in Astana , despite the fact that Contador and Andreas Kloden were missing .
Lance Armstrong , though , was there , prompting speculation that he might have had prior knowledge of the attack .
Hincapie , who rode by Armstrong ’s side for all seven of his Tour wins , was asked that question , and he responded initially with a blank expression , as though weighing his words carefully .
“ I saw Lance , ” he shrugged .
“ I mean , he was obviously excited [ to be in the move ] but we were there , just doing our job .
" We had Mick Rogers there , " Hincapie continued , " and people were just sitting back [ not helping with the chase ] .
But we saw a moment to attack and we took it . "
Coming just 24 hours before the team time trial , for which Columbia - HTC and Astana are favourites , it was perhaps surprising to see both teams working so hard .
" No , " said Rogers when asked whether he thought the other teams had expected such a move .
" But we ’ve got nothing to lose , and we had nothing to prove here .
We spent some energy , but so did the guys behind chasing us , so everyone ’s going to have sore legs tonight . "
Rogers was the last rider in the lead group to be credited with the same time as Cavendish after puncturing in the final kilometre .
An Australian digital agency is advertising for someone to take on a “ supplied persona ” and surreptitiously promote clients on blogs and chatrooms .
In an ad for a “ social search consultant ” currently on Gumtree , Geoffrey Emerson – boss of recently launched agency The Prosperity Principal says :
“ The job requires you to have very good search skills to find conversations online .
You will then take on a supplied persona and join in on the conversation .
“ You will have to be clever and adaptive , if you do n’t know about a subject then you will have to learn how to “ sell ” yourself as authentic .
“ This is NOT spam , you are adding value to the conversation .
You are respectful and knowledgeable and most importantly having fun .
“ If this sounds like you and you have strong English writing skills , then please I want to hear from you . ”
Emerson – previously head of digital at Sydney PR agency Zing conceded to Mumbrella : “ It ’s a link bait job .
There ’s no two ways about it , it ’s black hat .
But it ’s not spam . ”
He said that an example of the service he is providing through his agency ’s “ trusted avatar ” product would be where someone working for the agency joins in a conversation taking place online about finance .
He asid : “ We ’d say ‘ here ’s a great site that ’s offering a great deal – why not take a look ? ' ”

Asked if the poster ’s affiliation with the client would be disclosed , he said : “ No .
The comments would be deleted if you did that . ”
He added : “ Clients get five to seven inbound links a week .
And it absolutely works .
“ I realised when I created this product that I might not be popular for this and I ’m popping my head up a bit .
“ If some of the social media fraternity do n’t like this and have a go , what does it matter ?
We ’re not spamming . ”
Participants used a 40 - cm gripping tool to perform tasks
The brain represents tools as extensions to the body , according to researchers writing in Current Biology .
After the use of a grasping tool , participants asked to grasp an object with their own hands did so more slowly and sluggishly .
Blindfolded participants also overestimated the length of their tool - using arm after the exercise .
The research seems to confirm a century - old hypothesis that the brain models tools as parts of the body .
" There is a great debate in neuroscience about the representation of the body and representation of space , " said Lucilla Cardinali of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research ( Inserm ) in France .
" There are a lot of papers about the effects of tool use , but they all focus on space - none investigated the effect on our own body , " she told BBC News .
Ms Cardinali and her colleagues tested that effect by giving participants a gripping tool , similar to the tool commonly used to pick up rubbish .
They had to use the tool to pick up and replace a small block .
After just a few minutes of the task , they were then asked to pick up the block using their own hand , or to simply reach out and place a finger on top of the block .
This is the first unambiguous and definitive proof that using a tool modifies the representation of our body
Lucilla Cardinali
Inserm
The team found that the participants ' performance was noticeably different in carrying out those tasks than they had been before using the tool .
They accelerated and decelerated their movements more slowly , taking a longer time overall - which the team attributes to adjustments the participants needed to make in the absence of the tool .
Long thought
More telling , however , was an experiment performed with the participants blindfolded after the tool use .
After an experimenter touched the participants ' elbow and middle fingertip , they were asked to point using the other hand to those two locations .
After a session of using the tool , the participants indicated locations further apart than before tool use : they seemed to perceive the tool - using arm as longer .
" This is the first unambiguous and definitive proof that using a tool modifies the representation of our body ; previous studies suggested this but never proved it directly , " Ms Cardinali said .
Patrick Haggard of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London , UK , said that the study contrasted with prior work that concentrated on the perception of space , rather than the body performing an action in that space .
" Previous studies had shown that using tools changes the way humans and animals perceive external space , bringing far - away objects into reach , " he told BBC News .
" Neuroscientists have known for a long time that the brain 's map of the body is not static : in fact , the brain needs to adjust to the changes in our body that occur with growth , ageing , and traumas such as amputation or injury .
" But this paper shows how rapid these adjustments are . "

As I have often said , and proved with documentation , forced institutional schooling was never a home - grown American phenomenon , but from the beginning was an importation from a socialist European military state by our industrial leadership , an import imposed by force on our population which , in many locations reacted violently to what was widely seen as a coup by financial [… ]
When I was 14 , my family and I made our way to my father 's military club in Khartoum where we had been dining for years .
On this occasion , we were denied entry as I was not wearing a headscarf .
Upon my father 's protestations that this had never happened before he was informed by staff that it was the government 's new directive ; all women had to wear the hijab in public and no trousers or revealing clothes were permitted .
We went back to the car , fashioned an awkward headscarf for me to wear and made our way to dinner as my teenage embarrassment obliterated my appetite .
This was life in the new Khartoum after the National Salvation coup in 1989 .
Music with " irreligious " lyrics was banned from the airwaves , open - air parties using sound systems were prohibited after 11 pm ( spawning what came to be known as the " overnight " , where the performer was smuggled indoors to entertain the cognoscenti until the wee hours of the morning ) and a strict curfew was imposed .
Officious gatekeepers were positioned outside college campuses to veto female attire , and many 's the time they sent a frustrated student in search of a safety pin to reunite the hems of an offending slit skirt .
Last week , several women were rounded up at a cafe in Khartoum and flogged for sporting indecent wear , namely trousers , while the remainder await trial as they had refused to plea bargain and accept a punishment of " only " 10 lashes for their sins .
Until recently , sporadic raids on private parties in Sudan were not uncommon , particularly on New Year 's Eve .
If there was alcohol on the premises there would be hell to pay .
The manner of punishment was often deliberately humiliating : head shaving , flogging or alerting the families of those appearing to be particularly cocky or affluent to inflict maximum ignominy .
Over the past few years however , there has been a discernible relaxation of those draconian public decency laws .
In a city allegedly under sharia law , an increasingly affluent populace , an influx of expatriates and an expansion of the United Nations mission have created a sort of bubble of restaurants , banqueting halls and other venues where women mingle with men , smoke shisha and roam hijab - free and trouser - clad .
The group of arrested women , unfortunately for the Sudanese authorities , included Lubna al - Hussein , a rather feisty female journalist and employee of the UN who appears to be spearheading a campaign to garner maximum publicity for her coming trial .
The group also reportedly included non-Muslim women from the south of the country ( a minority in the north and one that was assured , as part of the north - south peace agreement , that sharia would not apply to its members ) .
The incident has prompted a member of the southern SPLM – now incorporated into the ranks of the government – to demand an investigation into the event , hinting at concerns over the viability of a united Sudan as the 2011 referendum ( when the south will vote for or against secession ) looms .
The difficulties of governing two different communities in one country under two different sets of laws are highlighted by the harsh punishment for brewing of illegal alcohol known as " araqi " , more often than not concocted by poor women from the south .
On a recent trip back to Khartoum , I watched from my window as a family of southern squatters stood by while their makeshift tents were burned to the ground by public order police as punishment for brewing alcohol illegally .
There has been a media blackout on the latest floggings in Khartoum and the word on the street is that the security officer who engineered the cafe raid was a lone ranger provoked by al - Hussein 's tone when he urged the women to act or dress more modestly .
Her lawyer stated that such raids were to remind people " that Big Brother is watching you " , and there is certainly an element of this in the government 's rather erratic approach to its implementation of sharia .
Since this commitment to divine law is cosmetic and not in earnest , the religious whip is cracked when there may be a perception that the regime is going soft , using Islam as proxy for authoritarianism .
However , the whole affair is embarrassing for the government , which finds itself in a Catch - 22 .
To go ahead with the trial of the remaining women would be a step backwards , bad for its new foreign investment - attracting , oil - exporting image ( France has already expressed its chagrin ) , but President Omar al - Bashir et al are not yet secure enough in their positions to accept the ongoing dilution of religious decorum , dismantle public order laws and withdraw their mandate from such outfits as the public order police .
I predict a face - saving magnanimous presidential " pardon " , such as the one bestowed upon Gillian Gibbons – one that does not discredit the initial charge but halts proceedings or stays punishment .
What these women were wearing is hardly the point .
They were just an easy target for someone 's discomfort with the challenge they posed to convention , traditionalism and the status quo .
As with all self - declared Islamic governments , what a woman wears becomes no longer an issue of religious modesty but one of audacity and defiance to a regime 's raison d'etre and authority .
I recently published an article “ Grandmother Scores Huge Victory over Monsanto . ”
The article was a magnet for controversy because I claimed the best way to fight Monsanto and HR 875 was by growing your own food and saving seeds .
Linn Cohen - Cole , the libertarian grandmother at the forefront of the anti-HR 875 campaign called me “ dangerous ” for fostering complacency by encouraging readers to grow their own food instead of send e-mails and faxes … that no one reads .
The Cornucopia Institute and the Organic Consumers Association has already assured organic advocates that HR 875 , the Food Safety and Modernization Act , is only “ trying to improve the safety of food products derived from large industrial processing facilities and does not intend to trample organic farmers , backyard gardeners or consumers of fresh local foods . ”
Following the April 3 Cornucopia press release , “ Family Farmers Fear Being Run over by Food Safety Juggernaut , ” organic food activists received a mass e-mail exposing the role of Linn Cole in spreading disinformation about HR 875 :
Subject : RETRACTION : URGENT !
Monsanto Bill to Ban Organic Food : “ Monsanto , or one of their proxy groups , is actually feeding libertarian groups disinformation on this bill .
The bill does n’t ban organic .
When you make that misinformed , but well - intentioned call to your Congressman , you are doing exactly what Monsanto wants — coming across as an ill - informed and hysterical extremist .
Monsanto is making a last - ditch effort in this PR war , but they have already really lost it . ”
Monsanto lost it because 43 million Americans , including First Lady Michelle Obama , have risked going to jail for growing their own food !
This will help you understand what really happened :
1. Monsanto is one of the most powerful multi-national corporations in the world .
The Global One - World Government New World Order conspiracy , of which Monsanto is a part , is aimed at controlling millions via the food they eat .
“ Control oil and you control nations ; control food and you control the people , ” said Henry Kissinger in 1970 .
2. Monsanto uses overt and covert strategies to accomplish their goals .
Monsanto is behind both sides of the battle over HR 875 .
They do n’t leave important matters like these to chance .
3. Monsanto ’s tentacles reach into every aspect of our society : government , private industry , the military , law enforcement and , of course , agriculture .
Large , small , organic and non-organic farmers — and do n’t forget libertarian grass roots activists — are all influenced directly and indirectly by Monsanto .
The company that rose to power in the 20th century as a leading chemical giant now focuses on agriculture .
In Monsanto ’s world , there is no room for the family farmer .
The company ’s well - known corporate bullying tactics have made this clear .
Just ask Percy Schmeiser , the brave Canola farmer who dared to take on Monsanto .
4. HR 875 ’s vague wording was intentional .
5. Family Farmers ( organic and non-organic ) are under attack , but not by Congresswoman DeLauro , the author of HR 875 whose husband was a political consultant to Monsanto 10 years ago .
6 . The timing of HR 875 coincides with the slow food , Locavore , and urban gardening movements in the United States and , for that matter , any slow food movement anywhere in the world .
7 . The E-coli and salmonella outbreaks related to spinach , tomatoes and peanuts are the work of Monsanto ’s agents :
Things do n’t happen ; they ’re made to happen .
8. Healthy Family Farm owner Sharon Palmer was arrested for selling raw goat milk , and the Ohio food co-op raided Gestapo - style was obviously instigated by Monsanto agents in a move designed to intimidate urban gardeners .
It does n’t matter if libertarian grandmother Linn Cohen - Cole , or Paul , a farmer from Wisconsin , were accidental dupes or knowing agents of Monsanto ’s disinformation campaign .
It only matters that the disinformation campaign was discovered before it wounded the health freedom movement .
Spreading misinformation , misleading or outright false information is not the way to defeat “ food safety ” legislation , because when you make that misinformed but well - intentioned call to your Congressman , you are doing exactly what Monsanto wants — coming across as an ill - informed and hysterical extremist .
The very clear and present danger is that our “ unelected representatives ” will be forced to sit down and actually read HR 875 .
But when they do , they wo n’t find a ban on heirloom seeds , farmers markets or backyard gardening , because it is n’t there .
Does anyone think Monsanto would actually put in writing that we are going to arrest Michelle Obama for planting a garden ?
If they did , our representatives would n’t need a flood of frantic messages hollering that HR 875 is the bill that will “ kill all farms and eat your babies . ”
No , believe it or not , our representatives eat and go to farmers markets just like we do .
So who is behind this disinformation campaign ?
The Natural Solutions Foundation ( NSF ) originated the Linn Cole articles .
The Organic Consumers Association and other legitimate heath advocates have been questioning the NSF for several years , and the criticism is universally the same :
Why does the NSF keep turning out factually inaccurate , hysterically grim articles such as Linn Cole’s ?
The answers start with the NSF founders , husband - wife team Albert Stubblebine and Rima Laibow .
Now , when I accuse these people of being disinformation professionals , let me explain .
I ’m not saying they ’re doing sloppy research , and I ’m not saying they ’re being overzealous .
What I am saying is that they are working , for pay , to spread false information and to make their organization look like a legitimate activist group .
My conclusion is Stubblebine and Laibow are using the Natural Solutions Foundation — and Linn Cole — to undermine the health freedom community by spreading disinformation about HR 875 .
Stubblebine is a retired U.S. Army major general who designed AEGIS , “ a major Homeland Security private initiative . ”
Given this background and his ties to the U.S. intelligence community , eyebrows were raised in the health freedom community in early 2005 when , along with Laibow , Stubblebine launched the NSF website and began to promote his wife as an expert on Codex Alimentarius , the commission working to adopt strict new guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements .
Dr. Rath , founder of the 4.dr - rath - foundation , a legitimate health advocacy group , and the author of A Modern Major General Exposed ?
writes :
“ It quickly became apparent to experienced health freedom observers that Stubblebine either had n’t done his homework properly , or that he and Laibow were intentionally spreading inaccurate and misleading material about Codex and other related dietary supplement issues via their website and press releases .
Moreover , despite repeated concerns being expressed by more experienced health freedom observers , Stubblebine and Laibow continued to disseminate this material , and pointedly ignored requests to remove it from their website . ”
In my “ Scared to CodeX Death ” article , I refer to Dr. Rima Laibow when I write : “ And although the effects of Codex are devastating and will result in humans dying from starvation and preventable diseases from under-nutrition , any claims that WHO or FAO have released epidemiological projections are untrue . ”
Dr. Rima Laibow , to the consternation of those fighting Codex , is the source of the untrue claims about the “ epidemiological projections ” in her YouTube video “ Codex Alimentarious & Nutricide . ”
The NSF pair want to discredit HR 875 , because when the cleverly worded HR 875 finally goes to committee , Monsanto will unleash a massive PR campaign aimed at , guess who ?
Linn Cohen - Cole and the other lefties who , according to Monsanto , are spreading false and misleading information about an innocent food safety bill .
Later , the headlines such as “ HR 875 does n’t criminalize small agriculture ” will warn the population about health freedom activists who , by spreading misinformation , are threatening our food safety and free speech .
Then , HR 875 and the real threat , HR 859 , are passed without fanfare .
End of story .
And when the son of HR 875 is born , the one that really makes it illegal to grow your own food and have a garden , activists will gear up for another war , but it will be too late .
The battle cry from Monsanto will be heard loud and clear :
“ Remember HR 875 !
Do n’t listen to these reactionaries .
They will do anything to cast Monsanto as the Agent Orange - eyed monster .
Vote here . ”
And the epitaph will be written : “ The Grandmother Who Cried Wolf ”
So if you want to fight Monsanto , take up your hoes and join the 43 million urban gardeners .
You see , what Monsanto is really afraid of is that we are starting to cooperate with each other and grow our own food .
It ’s called the Power of Community .

Bujtor István július végén , életveszélyes állapotban került a veszprémi kórházba .
Állapota fokozatosan , lassan javult , és csütörtökön arról érkezett hír , hogy a művészt kiengedték a kórházból , és rehabilitációját Budapesten folytatják .
A Figyelőnet értesülései szerint Bujtort két napja a budapesti Állami Egészségügyi Központ intenzív osztályán kezelték , és már a Veszprémi Megyei Kórházból való átszállítása óta nem voltak agyi életjelei .
Bujtor Istvánt az 1980 - as A Pogány Madonna óta szinte mindenki a dörzsölt , vitorlázást és nőket sem megvető balatoni nyomozó , Ötvös Csöpi szerepéből ismeri .
Csöpi és partnere , Kardos doki ( Kern András ) összesen négy bűnügyet göngyölítettek fel a moziban ( a Madonna után jött a Csak semmi pánik , Az elvarázsolt dollár és a Hamis a baba ) , tíz év kihagyás után , a 2000 - es években pedig átköltöztek a kisképernyőre , hogy a Zsaruvér és csigavér - tévéfilmekben folytassák a balatoni nyomozást .
Az eredeti Ötvös csöpi-filmek valami egészen egyedit tudtak : a korábban magyar filmen nemigen létező vicces akciókrimik menőségükkel elérhető közelségbe hozták a nyugatot , miközben a mindenki számára ismerős és kedves balatoni hangulatot árasztották magukból .
Bujtor nem véletlenül találta ki , hogy az Ötvös Csöpi - filmek helyszíne a Balaton legyen , szenvedélyes vitorlázó , hatszoros magyar bajnok volt .
Persze az 1942 - es születés ű Bujtor karrierje nem Csöpivel kezd ődött .
A közgazdász végzettségű Bujtor első filmszerepét az 1964 - es A kőszívű ember fiai - ban játszotta , első főszerepét pedig az ugyanebben az évben bemutatott Máriássy Félix rendezte Karambol - ban alakította , ahol féltestvérével , Latinovits Zoltánnal játszott együtt .
Bujtor István és Kern András a Hamis a baba című 1991 - es filmben
Folyamatosan kapta a filmszerepeket , miközben színházban is játszott : pályája során tagja volt a győri Kisfaludy Színháznak , a József Attila Színháznak , a Pécsi Nemzeti Színháznak , a Vígszínháznak , a székesfehérvári Vörösmarty Színháznak és a veszprémi Petőfi Színháznak , melynek 2007 végétől igazgatója volt .

A Sándor Mátyás utolsó jelenete és végefőcíme
Jelentősebb filmes , illetve tévészerepei közé tartozott a Bors ( 1968 ) című tévésorozat , Simó Sándor Szemüvegesek ( 1969 ) című filmje , Szomjas György Talpuk alatt fütyül a szel-e ( 1976 ) és az 1979 - es Sándor Mátyás című Jules Verne - adaptáció .
Számos színházi rendezés fűződik a nevéhez , a Petőfi Színházban az elmúlt évadban mutatták be a Száll a kakukk fészkére alapján készült Kakukkfészek című darabot a rendezésében , amelyben Bromdent , a hatalmas termetű , magát süketnémának tettető indián szerepét is eljátszotta .
Bujtor István és Eperjes Károly a Kakukkfészek című előadásban
Filmrendezőként először A Pogány Madonná - ban próbálta ki magát , és a többi Ötvös Csöpi - filmet is ő maga jegyzi , valamint A három testőr Afrikában című 1996 - os Rejtő Jenő - adaptációt .
A Szomszédok című tévésorozat huszonkét epizódját rendezte , a 213 .
részben szerepelt is : Taki bácsival , Almával és Sándorral hajókázni indultak a Balatonon .
Rendszeresen szinkronizált , elsősorban Bud Spencer filmjeit : huszonhétszer kölcsönözte a hangját az olasz színésznek .
Insanity .
Reality .
Mundanity .
And Whatever Hits Us .
By Jonathan H
On Memorial Day of 2007 , and then again in December , I visited two separate Titan I missile sites .
The first was quite the introduction .
The second was mind - blowing .
There are no words to describe being in what is perhaps the world ’s largest underground missile complex .
In fact , I ’ve tried more than once , and in my mind have not achieved an adequate description .
Last month , I clicked on a random link and encountered the narrative of another man who had done the same .
His words , and his story came much closer to describing the feeling in detail .
Even better , this man knew all of the intricacies of the base .
He was a true savant of Titan I – and probably the foremost non-military expert of these historic bases .
I contacted him and asked if he would be willing to talk about his experience and he readily agreed .
Though he prefers to be known here only by his first name , he was more than willing to tell me his story .
Discovering a “ Titan ” in an Early Tour
It was 1993 and Pete had just moved into Colorado .
He managed to come in contact with someone who gave him a tour of one of the nearby sites .
“ This man had been there once before and had taken some pictures , ” Pete said , “ but he did n’t really have much in the way of technical information , he simply knew they were there . ”
Pete ’s first impression was much the same as mine : “ I was amazed at the scale , ” he said .
Years passed , and around 1998 Pete had casually mentioned his visit to a friend , who had become so interested in the Titan site that he developed a business plan around its purchase .
That ’s how Pete originally got full , unfettered access .
It was the beginning of a long - term obsession and the start of detailed foray into the operations and the minutiae of the entire base .
A Dash - 1 Opens Doors
In the following months , Pete and two others descended deep into the snakelike passageways of the base discovering bits of the past along the way .
With cameras and bright sources of continuous illumination in tow , Pete was able to capture – unlike anyone I ’ve known before – the entire Titan complex .
Every nook , every tunnel seems to be covered in detail .
His site ( http://www.chromehooves.net) is filled with what were once top secret blueprints of each staircase and ladder , the silos , terminals , emergency escapes and air shafts .
In fact , all of this would perhaps not have been possible had Pete not encountered a serendipitous find : Buried deep beneath stacks of junk , in a small room next to the power dome , Pete had found a complete Dash - 1 .
What is a Dash - 1 ?
It is essentially the technical manual to a Titan 1 complex ( You can download a Dash - 1 here 75 MB – PDF ) .
“ Typically a lot of documents were destroyed , ” Pete told me , “ A lot of the [ documents ]
I saw down there I have n’t seen anywhere . ”
Within the 120 lbs of papers he would come to know the inner workings of Titan I ’s operation – even the most mundane of activities , including detailed instructions on how to clean the launch console .
Pete was able to glean all he needed to know from the Dash - 1 and the nearby materials .
It was his source book for his next project .
“ I had a big set of blueprints for the Titan base and I thought I could translate these things into a game map , ” Pete told me matter - of - factly .
The Original Blueprint of the Titan Power Dome
Pete ’s Three - dimensional Map of the Power Dome and nearby structures of the Titan base .
On his own , on evenings and weekends , in the period of about six months and comprising well over 100 hours worth of work , he constructed a detailed three - dimensional game environment that depicts what it feels like to be inside of an entire Titan base .
As someone who has been inside of a base thrice , I could honestly say that it was an eerie and realistic journey back into those spaces .
It sparked memories of visits to the silo that I did n’t know existed .
I had felt the same feeling that came upon me as I looked down into the empty void of the silo – and it all happened from my laptop .
I knew I had to talk to the man who created this game map .
Titan I Adventures in Narrative
As an interviewee , Pete is quite modest , but modest men are usually those who have the most to be proud of .
I know for a fact that nobody but Pete ( other than perhaps a few military contractors and past base personnel ) could tell me the thickness of concrete inside of the power dome ( “ less than two feet thick of reinforced concrete at the apex ” ) .
The research alone – including the images , which I ’ve seen nowhere else despite all of my own former efforts at researching the bases , are telling witness to his fastidiousness .
Pete had an explanation for each intricate , working part .
For example , he knew the weight of the missile ( “ in excess of 200,000 pounds ” ) ; he knew that the emergency exits were once full of sand ( “ A winch lowered the hatch safely as the sand poured in and the tunnel cleared ” ) ; and he even knew the dirtiest , grittiest details ( literally ) – the bathroom fixtures were built to be entirely shock proof , the toilets of which are probably the only toilets in the world sitting on shock absorbers .
The facility seems to resurrect itself through Pete ’s descriptions .
Everything becomes an anthropomorphic organ .
The power dome is the “ heart ” of the site , and the control center ( a much smaller dome , but no less important ) its “ brain . ”
One gets the sense of a massive , underground living organism , precision - engineered to deliver deadly weapons .
Its proper operation is contingent on so many working parts that it almost becomes impossible to fathom how these things ran smoothly with little mishap and few fatalities .
Then there are the construction images …
I ’m sure Pete spent nearly as much time researching the bases as he did creating the 3 - D fly - through of the base .
I have never seen construction photos in such detail .
Pete was able to dig up images from inside the silo , artistically captured in dramatic lighting and angle .
The airman stands on the crib structure ; to the side of him is a massive Titan I Missile .
Off - gassing liquid oxygen seems to move within the image .
The ominous weapon of mass destruction sits — peacefully , ironically — in its crib awaiting orders .
In fact , I myself have received messages from airmen who served within the Titan bases during the most chilling moments of the Cold War .
Some recall the tense few months of standoff during the Cuban Missile Crisis .
It was perhaps the proudest moment in the history of Titan I and an unplanned yet convenient justification for their construction .
Peter approaches such facts neutrally and without agenda .
He seems to see the sites as , primarily , a gigantic artifact ideal for study through observation .
Never once do the political or moral implications enter into his narrative .
It ’s almost refreshing to see his approach materialize .
It truly is a rare thing to have such a vast and time - consuming project not become something of a moral crusade .
Pete ’s Final Days in the Titan Base
For Pete , though , Politics was too small ( or too big ? ) of a subject to take up when his mind was set on one thing :
The complete and unhindered exploration of the base .
After all of the webpages one navigates in his site , the crux of it all is saved for last .
Clicking through the blueprints you eventually find yourself at the silos themselves .
Punctuated by photographs from its operation are the personal reflections of a man obsessed : “ The missile is protected within the silo by 2 silo doors , each weighing around 115 tons each and opened and closed hydraulically by 2 pistons that control movement in both directions .
Within this steel and concrete chrysalis , the missile rests atop its launcher platform , ensconced within a massive steel cribwork comprising the launcher system where it waits for the orders that will transform it from a mass of inert metals and propellants into a weapon of terrible power . ”
In those sentences I finally saw it all .
Those of you who have been inside of the silo know the bare nature of the huge cylinder of air .
Today , the crib structure is largely absent from all but one or two of the sites today .
Instead , what occupies the space is – well – space .
And before reading Pete ’s description I could finally imagine what it was really like .
Pete knew what he had to do next .
His window of opportunity was closing .
Pete writes on his site : “ There was one place I had seen precious little of , and another I had not seen at all .
With my mind completely gone , I set about planning on how to see the catwalk level of the silos . ”
With only a few months left of access , Pete set out alone towards Silo # 3 .
With a rough sketch of his route planned , he decided to make the climb .
Below him was 100 feet of standing water full of volatile organic compounds and god - knows - how - many - dead - rats ; above was the catwalk .
Between him and the catwalk was a hodge - podge of service pipes , bones of crib beams , and conduits .
Pete went up with no climbing equipment or buddy .
His journey was pure madness , but a type of madness that he does n’t regret .
“ I ca n’t say that I would n’t do that again . ” he frankly told me .
“ After a while you kind of forget what you see and curiosity sets in again .
I just had to see it while I had the opportunity . ”
Looking Ahead
As Pete finished up his conversation with me , I knew I wanted to know what final thing :
What did he think would happen to these sites .
Where will they be in 100 , or even 1000 years ?
I had my own answer , but I knew his take would be much more interesting .
He approached my question with a moment of silent thought .
His wheels were turning .
He was contemplating the engineering of the site , the thickness of concrete .
The supercomputer inside his brain ( like any human brain , multiples more powerful than the actual nerve center of the Titan I ) was quickly figuring out his answer .
Pete said he thinks these bases will remain beyond even 1000 years from now .
“ I was peering underneath the deck plating in Tunnel Junciton # 10 near the large raw water conduit leading to the tank and spied the only living thing I ever found in the site : A lone salamander . ”
His answer was a surprise to me and it only led to a hypothetical soothsayer ’s look into these vast , underground ruins .
If Rome had its roads and China had its wall – would these voids become monuments to our civilization ’s ingenuity long after we ’re gone ?
Will America be known for its military might through these giant sites ?
Or will we create something even larger and more dramatic to put civilizations centuries ahead of us in awe ?
I said goodbye to Pete and closed the screen of my laptop .
It was an unusually warm day in San Francisco as I walked down Mission Street .
Still , such bright surroundings — sunshine and fresh fruit on sidewalks — could n’t take my mind off of one thing .
Among the many things
Pete had seen underground they were mostly dead things , whether they were the rats that had fallen into the 150 - foot silo ; the unfortunate rabbits that catapulted themselves into an emergency exit portal that went five stories down ; or even the garter snake that had somehow navigated its way into the control center only to find itself famished until it had become a skeleton .
Despite the myriad of journeys he took , Pete had never seen a living creature until one of his last trips underground .
There , in the bottom of the deck plating of Tunnel Junction # 10 he saw a tiny creature fully functioning and alive .
The image stayed indelibly imprinted in my mind as an emblematic metaphor .
Then again , I ’m always trying to inject meaning into everything .
Maybe it was exactly how Pete described it .
Maybe it really was just a “ lone salamander . ”

I wanted to find the best solution for waterproofing the speakers that I had selected , or at least make them water resistant .
But , i also wanted to maintain sound quality .
The solution that I devised was to glue gun the speaker into the grill with a thin layer of plastic between the paper cone and the grill .
I used thin , yet strong plastic from a clear trash bag ( black would work just fine ) .
The important part is to stretch the plastic taunt as the glue is cooling , so that it will still transmit sound clearly - much like a tympanic membrane .
After the glue cooled , I trimmed away any excess plastic to prevent any buzzing or rattling .
It is also important to thread the speakers through holes from inside before sealing it , as the hole is too small for the whole grill assembly to fit through .
With this particular speaker grill design , I also decided to use some of the surplus plastic ( trimmed from the container ) to seal the two sound ports on each grill .
IT HAS been deep and nasty .
But the worst global recession since the 1930s may be over .
Led by China , Asia 's emerging economies have revived fastest , with several expanding at annualised rates of more than 10 % in the second quarter .
A few big rich economies also returned to growth , albeit far more modestly , between April and June .
Japan 's output rose at an annualised pace of 3.7 % , and both Germany and France notched up annualised growth rates of just over 1 % .
In America the housing market has shown signs of stabilising , the pace of job losses is slowing and the vast majority of forecasters expect output to expand between July and September .
Most economies are still a lot smaller than they were a year ago .
On a quarterly basis , though , they are turning the corner .
This is good news .
The first step in any recovery is for output to stop shrinking .
But the more interesting question is what shape the recovery will take .
The debate centres around three scenarios : “ V ” , “ U ” and “ W ” .
A V - shaped recovery would be vigorous , as pent - up demand is unleashed .
A U - shaped one would be feebler and flatter .
And in a W - shape , growth would return for a few quarters , only to peter out once more .
Optimists argue that the scale of the downturn augurs for a strong rebound .
America 's deepest post - war recessions , they point out , were followed by vigorous recoveries .
In the two years after the slump of 1981 - 82 , for instance , output soared at an average annual rate of almost 6 % ; and this time round , output has slumped even further , and for longer , than it did in the early 1980s .
Pessimists , meanwhile , think this downturn 's origins favour a weak recovery or a double - dip .
Unlike typical post - war recessions this slump was spawned by a financial bust , not high interest rates , and when overindebted borrowers need to rebuild their balance - sheets and financial systems need repair , growth can be weak and easily derailed for years .
Japan 's 1990s banking crisis left the economy stagnant for a decade ; a premature tax increase in 1997 plunged it back into recession .
V for vulnerable
Neither of these parallels is exact , because today 's global slump combines several types of downturn and an unprecedented policy response .
In formerly bubble economies , it is largely a balance - sheet recession .
Debt - fuelled consumption has been felled .
But the scale of collapse was broadened and deepened by the freezing up of the machinery of global finance , a dramatic collapse in confidence and stock - slashing .
It was then countered with the biggest stimulus in history .
The shape of the recovery depends on how these forces interact .
In the short term that shape could look beguilingly like a “ V ” , as stimulus kicks in and the inventory cycle turns .
In emerging Asia , the unfreezing of trade finance , a turnaround in stocks and hefty fiscal stimulus are powering a rebound .
Government support , especially employment subsidies and incentives toa buy new cars , has cushioned demand in Germany and France ( see article ) .
With export orders rising and confidence growing , the next few months could be surprisingly buoyant .
Even in America , the fiscal stimulus is kicking in , the “ cash for clunkers ” scheme is a big , if temporary , prop to output and firms will , sooner or later , stop cutting inventories .
Yet a rebound based on stock adjustments is necessarily temporary , and one based on government stimulus alone will not last .
Beyond those two factors there is little reason for cheer .
America 's housing market may yet lurch down again as foreclosures rise , high unemployment takes its toll and a temporary home - buyers ' tax - credit ends ( see article ) .
Even if housing stabilises , consumer spending will stay weak as households pay down debt .
In America and other post - bubble economies , a real V - shaped bounce seems fanciful .
Elsewhere , it will happen only if vigorous private domestic demand picks up the baton from government stimulus .
In Japan and Germany , where joblessness has further to rise , that seems unlikely any time soon .
The odds are better in emerging economies , especially China .
But even there an array of reforms , from a stronger currency to an overhaul of subsidies , is needed to boost labour income and encourage consumption .
Until that shift takes place , the global recovery will be fragile and probably quite feeble .
A gloomy U with a long , flat bottom of weak growth is the likeliest shape of the next few years .
Cancer impacts millions of lives for the worse every year .
Despite this difficult reality , it appears that we are becoming increasing successful in our efforts to stem the tide of patients who fall victim as time goes on .
According to a recently published report in the journal Cancer Research , cancer mortality rates have been steadily dropping over the last three decades .
“ Our efforts against cancer , including prevention , early detection and better treatment , have resulted in profound gains , but thesegains are often unappreciated by the public due to the way the data are usually reported , " said Eric Kort , M.D. , one of the study ’s authors and former research scientist at Van Andel Research Institute ( VARI ) in Grand Rapids , Mich .
So what ’s wrong with how these “ profound gains ” are reported ?
The problem , according to Kort , is that Cancer mortality rates are typically reported as composite age - adjusted rates .
And while those have slightly declined since the 1990s , they tend to emphasize the outcomes of elderly Americans , whose mortality rates are obviously much higher than those among younger patients .
To account for the potential bias of the age - adjusted rates , Kort took a different approach with his research .
By stratifying cancer mortality rates by age , he found that every group of individuals has seen a drop in cancer mortality since 1925 .
Unsurprisingly , it was the youngest groups that saw the biggest decline at 25.9 percent , and these tend to be the individuals who are overlooked by traditional mortality statistics .
Also contributing to the public ’s ignorance of the improvements in our efforts against cancer are the World Health Organization ’s statistics on cancer incidence rates and mortality proportions .
These rates are increasing as the years go on and are usually the only numbers that the public hears about .
While they are accurate , Kort and other researchers point out that they can be misleading if not taken in context .
While both heart disease and cancer have been declining , heart disease mortality rates have been declining much more rapidly .
And while it 's true that cancer incidence ratescontinue to grow , the decreased mortality across all age groups shows the effect of improved screening and treatment .
In particular , “ we 're able to do amazing things with leukemia and lymphoma that used to be a death sentence but now we are curing many of these cancers , " Richard Severson , Ph.D. , a cancer epidemiologist at Wayne State University , pointed out .
Though our ability to prevent and treat cancer still has a long way to go , we ’ve taken tremendous steps in the right direction and had a positive impact on cancer mortality .
Hopefully with more research which accounts for often overlooked factors the public can be made aware as well .

Biafra ’s back – and this time he ’s packing a ‘ real ’ band .
The former Dead Kennedys frontman is re-energised by fronting a new group , The Guantanamo School Of Medicine , who tour the UK in September 2009 .
Alex
Ogg chews the fat with him
Biafra wrote some of the smartest punk songs extant .
In ‘ Holiday In Cambodia ’ , alongside the other DKs , he arguably wrote the best of them all .
But skimming over the drama that unfolded amid litigation from ex-members – as well as the spoken word shows and the occasionally inspired collaboration that constitute his post - DKs career - Biafra ’s now back at the helm of a going concern .
One that , he notes , is a continuation of the Plastic Surgery Disasters era of the Kennedys that he consistently , and mistakenly , counts as its zenith .
A cause for unrestrained celebration we say when pondering the Guantanamo School of Medicine ’s new album , The Audacity of Hype .
This is your first band proper since the Kennedys , rather than a temporary collaboration .
Jello Biafra : Yeah , it was something I ’d wanted for a long time , and adventures good and bad over the years prevented it .
If spoken word had n’t taken off , I ’d probably have bored in on it a lot sooner .
But when you find you have other gifts than the ones you already realised , and that they ’re having the kind of political impact that you were trying for in your music , one has an obligation to use it .
Were you looking to recruit the right people , or the right people just came around at the right time ?
JB : Well , I talked to Ralph [ Spight ; guitar ] years ago , and we almost got it going then with Jon Weiss [ drums ] .
But then he decided to go full force with the Hellworms .
Then last winter , when we decided to expand to two guitarists , Kimo Ball [ rhythm guitar ; ex- Victim ’s Family ] won the day at the auditions .
Everybody rocked , but he was the craziest and weirdest of the bunch when we decided we ’d see what happened if we just jammed .
So is the band now a permanent aggregation ?
JB : Hopefully .
Billy Gould [ bass ] already left , because Faith No More reformed .
So he ’s off re-conquering Europe as we speak .
So for the tour we ’re borrowing Andrew Weiss , Jon Weiss ’s brother , from Rollins Band , Ween , Butthole Surfers and other things .
Knowing you have the band together , does that inspire you to write more ?
JB : If only I had the time !
So much of my day is spent with one interruption after another , putting out fires at the label , dealing with phone calls .
Do you have any idea how big the backlog is with me !
I wish I was as efficient as Billy Childish but I ’m just not , and my music does n’t work that way .
I can only get so many songs recorded and finished properly at a time .
I probably have around 60 songs where the music and lyrics are arranged , then there ’s a whole other pile of really cool riffs and ideas for lyrics that have n’t been put together yet .
I ’m not very good at doing that quickly , or magically coming up with a great song while riding in a van .
I have to be left alone to work on it for it a while .
I took that to an extreme after I did the first Lard album and the ones with DOA and NOMEANSNO and Tumor Circus , which were done in one big frenzy .
Then I decided I have to hide to write the songs I really , really want to write .
And that wound up taking years .
And when I came out of my cave , all the musicians I wanted to work with were gone !
They were either in bands that they would be fools to leave , who had gotten much bigger by then , or they had developed drug problems or lost interest in music .
Or the big bands signed to a major label and then they lost interest in music , and THEN some of them developed drug problems !
So all these things kept flipping in and out of my hands .
Plus , maybe I had delusions of grandeur , visualising that it would be great to have this person and that person in the band , ignoring the fact that they all lived in different parts of the country , if not across the ocean , and would n’t necessarily want to move .
The whole Dead Kennedys imbroglio seems to have gone quiet for the moment .
JB : Not for me , it has n’t !
I had two threat letters from their lawyer in the past month or so .
And now their manager , whose other major client is a Christian folk act , is running around Hollywood shopping a Dead Kennedys documentary project – like the Metallica movie or something .
I have no interest in that whatsoever .
And I ’m going to leave it to YOU to explain why it would be such a nightmare for anybody to try to make something like that , based on what happened with your attempts to do a balanced story [ the abandoned 30th anniversary reissue liner notes ] about the Fresh Fruit album .
They were trying to use me to persuade you to go on that Fresh Fruit DVD .
JB : Boy , am I glad I was n’t in that .
That ’s exactly the kind of stupid - ass documentary of the band they want to make and everything was dumbed down and harmless and lovey - dovey , touchy - feely , burn - out nostalgia .
We might as well have been Air Supply .
I ’m not going to be dragged through that again .
Why do I want to spend all this time quarrelling over the past when I have new songs and a new band , and I feel much more alive doing that than going over and over every last little granule of misinformation about Dead Kennedys ?
I ’m proud of the music , I care about it and respect it much more than those guys do .
And yes , we will play a little bit of that on the tour .
But like the gigs I did with the Melvins , it will be dominated by new songs .
I get very suspicious when punk bands say , really , we were just a rock & roll band all along .
Sorry !
The Clash being the obvious example .
JB : You said it , I did n’t !
Cos no - one ’s supposed to rag on The Clash , because Joe Strummer died so prematurely .
But I agree with that .
When they came over here on their first American tour , they denied they were a punk band and denied they were a political band .
I guess I grew up suspicious of the attitude that rock & roll stood for – macho , conservative , self - satisfied .
JB : That was part of the thing that drew me to punk so much – finally there was the true spirit of rock & roll brought back again – it was scaring the shit out of all the right people , plus the lyrics did n’t have to be so stupid any more .
I ’ve never liked love songs .
I hated them when I was a seven - year - old in second grade and first discovered rock & roll in the fall of ’ 65 .
Then as a teenager I realised that love songs were n’t just stupid , they were lying to me !
Romance did n’t work like that at all !
All it did was string people along on false hope like hope - dope dealers or something .
Another thing that came to mind after staying away from this all these years - it ’s kinda sad .
I wrote down all the songs from my past that might be cool to play in this band some day , and there turned out to be so many of them , we ’d have had to play a set as long as the Grateful Dead .
So some of those songs will never see the light of day on a stage – there ’s Dead Kennedys songs , Lard songs , the ones with Tumor Circus , DOA , NOMEANSNO .
We have n’t gotten to it yet , but I really want to see what an audience does if I can get the band interested in the idea of playing our really heavy songs and then playing one of the country songs off Prairie Home Invasion [ Biafra ’s 1994 collaboration with Mojo Nixon ) .
And then go right back to playing the heavy shit again .
I think that would be cool .
That reminds me of your update of ‘ California Uber Alles ’ , ‘ We ’ve Got A Bigger Problem Now ’ , on In God We Trust , which worked really well , going from lounge jazz to hardcore and back .
JB : That was just a result of the band goofing off at practice and at sound - check .
Will Shatter from Flipper was one of our harshest critics - and one of everybody ’s harshest critics !
He said , ‘ You ’re always so stiff , playing the same way – why do n’t you play it THAT way ! ”
So it just wound up becoming an alternate version .
Who knows , THAT might come back eventually too !
If you ’re taking requests , I ’d love to hear ‘ Life Sentence ’ again .
JB : Too bad !
The Melvins wanted to play that , so we did .
It ’s not going to be in our set , though .
Dale Crover - it was his idea to play the song .
But as we learned it and everything , he realised it was draining him so badly as a drummer , that he was liking it less and less .
Quite hard on the vocals as well – with the neo -yodelling !
JB : Yeah , there are some places where I ran out of breath .
The tour that blew my throat the worst is the one that was dominated by a lot of the songs on In God We Trust .
I did n’t realise till I listened to some live cassettes after the 82 tour in England , that we turned almost every song into an In God We Trust song – there was no difference in tempo between ‘ Nazi Punks Fuck Off ’ and ‘ Man With The Dogs ’ .
The new album starts with ‘ The Terror Of Tinytown ’ - a Bush II song .
JB : Yeah .
The question being , why a song about him , and why now ?
Well , is he really gone ?
His policies are still in place and Obama seems to be clinging to more and more of them with each passing week .
I ’m really frightened that he ’s reneging so much on trying to put a stop to human rights violations and torture .
You ’re frightened by the fact that Obama is backtracking – but are you surprised ?
When you did your spoken word show 18 months ago , you did n’t seem sold on the idea that Obama represented a brand new dawn .
JB : It was weird to me from the very beginning that all the big banks who backed George W Bush for two terms threw all their money into Obama next time around .
They were n’t giving that kind of money to Hillary or McCain .
So something was up from the get - go .
‘ Terror Of Tinytown ’ is an infamous low - budget movie from the 1930s – an all - midget western .
It ’s so metaphorically similar to Bush ’s rationale and mentality going into Iraq , that I just could n’t resist .
And you pointedly note that 9/11 was more Spinal Tap than conspiracy .
JB : My point was a reply to people who are obsessed with the idea that Bush and Cheney , and the people around them , blew up the World Trade Center themselves , and it was all an inside job .
You know , I love conspiracy theories , but I prefer that they be supported by logic and science .
Bush and Cheney were n’t smart enough or competent enough to pull off something like that .
They could n’t even overthrow Hugo Chavez , for Christ ’s sake , when they tried that coup over the weekend .
He was back in office by Monday morning .
The point being that the wild theorising distracts from what ’s really taking place ?
JB : Well , as you might guess , I get some hardline 9/11 conspiracy theorists at my shows .
And they are furious with me when I do n’t devote the whole show to 9/11 conspiracies , and then even more furious when they find out I do n’t even agree with them .
It ’s like trying to reason with an anti-abortion zealot or an uber - vegan .
It ’s just complete religious fanaticism .
Besides , it makes no strategic sense from a military point of view to blow up your most valuable real estate and kill 3,000 of your own people just to launch a war you were going to start anyway .
All they would have had to do was stage another attack on a ship like the USS Cole , or better yet , do it all at the special effects department at Fox News , and we would be stuck in Iraq anyway .
‘ Clean as a Thistle ’ - there ’s another reference to a former president there – Clinton - and sexual hypocrisy .
JB : Yeah , in a way it ’s a song that ’s never out of date because some other right wing , fundamentalist Christian , family values Nazi Republican lets his penis get him into trouble yet again .
Right after we finished mixing that song , sure enough , Mark Sanford , the governor of South Carolina , who some were projecting as a Republican nominee for 2012 , completely disappears for a week .
It turned out he was down in Argentina fucking some woman he ’d met [ Sanford ’s voting record includes attempting to impeach Clinton over the Lewinsky affair ] .
And he still has n’t resigned !
He ’s also the same governor who walked into the state legislature wielding a live baby pig , claiming that there were n’t enough budget cuts to services in the state budget , and the pig let go and shit all over his nice new suit .
Wrecked the carpet too , from what I read .
There ’s a fair amount of medieval references and imagery , notably on ‘ New Feudalism ’ , which attacks NAFTA specifically .
Is that how you see it ?
That we ’re back in a robber baron era where the strongest prevail ?
JB : We ’re not going back , we ’re there .
We ’re right in the middle of a full - on robber baron era .
I first started using the term ‘ new feudalism ’ in the late 70s to describe the slow , ongoing corporate coup , and of course it was put in writing and shoved in everyone ’s face with the GATT treaty that spawned the infamous WTO .
NAFTA stands for North American Free Trade Agreement , and there ’s nothing free about it .
It ’s just corporate managed trade .
It ’s the same scam as the GATT Treaty and the World Trade Organisation , where laws passed by democratically elected governments go out of the window if a corporation thinks it ’s interfering with its right to make money .
That means environmental laws , factory and workplace safety laws , the right to organise a union , etc .
Or , in the case of places like Colombia and Mexico - the right to organise a union without getting killed .
There ’s a wrongful death lawsuit winding through the American courts now filed against Coca - Cola on behalf of the families of murdered union organisers in Colombia .
In terms of NAFTA though , what ’s amazing is the numbers , where they can sue governments for , in terms of exercising any kind of restraint – for example , restricting importing petrol additives into Canada .
JB : Plus they can also say you do n’t just owe us for profits we lost this year – you owe us for profits we would have made in the next 20 years , and you have to pay all 20 years of those profits right now .
That was the logic that East Bay Ray and co got away with when they sued me too !
They brought the Grateful Dead ’s accountant in to claim that if ‘ x ’ amount of money is spent on advertising , that means ‘ x ’ amount more sales will automatically happen .
And the jury of yuppies fell for that .
It ’s sort of the same thing if you have a dairy cow that dies prematurely of mad cow disease or whatever – what is the value of that cow ?
The milk that you already produced that you took to market and sold ?
Or should somebody pay you for the rest of the theoretical life of a normal dairy cow .
And that ’s the angle that all those Wall Street robber barons used to get all that bail - out money out of the American government – this is the money we would have made if these real estate scams had n’t gone belly up .
Therefore we should get all that money that was based on speculating on money that never existed in the first place .
Reminds me of the sheep compensation schemes run by the Ministry of Defence here , where a few farmers worked out it was cost - effective to herd their older sheep straight into firing ranges .
JB : I know a better one that !
A friend of mine ’s father knew someone in Denver who lived at the bottom of a hill .
In Denver it snows and gets very cold in the winter and there ’s a lot of ice .
So he would leave this car at the bottom of the hill , and pour water all over the street to ice the street up .
He ’d wait for a car to skid and crash into his car .
He ’d get his money from the insurance company and then never fix the car !
The next time it got icy , another car would hit the same car and he ’d collect on it again .
That ’s the American spirit in a nutshell .
‘ Panicland ’ seems to be about people losing the ability to communicate with each other .
JB : Yeah , also , it ’s how hysteria imposed from the outside can affect the herd too .
You know , you ca n’t fly if your name is Mohammed or Ali , cos we ’re terrorised by terror on TV .
Later there ’s that line about not being able to book an airline ticket if you ’re black .
JB : Yeah , trying to buy an airline ticket in cash while black ?
That ’s in ‘ Three Strikes ’ .
That was a real case too , where an African - American florist was flying from Nashville to Houston to buy a bunch of fresh flowers that had just come in from the Caribbean , and those transactions were always done in cash .
By paying for his plane ticket in cash , and because he was black , he fit the Reagan / Bush administrations ’ official regulations for the profile of a drug dealer .
So they confiscated the money on suspicion of dealing drugs and refused to return it .
That ’s what they can do , under the draconian anti-pornography and drug laws ; they can seize all your property and sell it before you even come to trial .
I was fascinated by ‘ Electronic Plantation ’ - there are too few songs about RSI !
JB : They want some people to wear GPS devices while at work now , so they know where everybody is in the building , that might be costing them money .
Never mind all the money hiring people to watch all the GPS on the radar !
There ’s also a pun in there that ’s probably not familiar to you – ‘ Locked in the Research Triangle / Shirtwaist Fire ’s flame ’ .
The research triangle is a hi-tech boom area of North Carolina , and the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire was a very famous tragedy in the annals of union organising in America .
There was a sweatshop where the female workers were chained to the desks , and the door to get out was locked .
The building caught fire and they all died .
I think it was before WWI .
However , not that much has changed .
On Prairie Home Invasion one of the songs Mojo sings is ‘ Hamlet Chicken Plant Disaster ’ , which really was a chicken processing plant in North Carolina where they locked all the workers inside and they got killed in a fire .
And that happened in the late 80s / early 90s .
And just think - thanks to our friends at the WTO and through NAFTA , we can have more and more of this brought back !
Now they ’re telling all the laid - off auto workers in this country , hey , the only way we can save your precious General Motors or Chrysler – never mind paying you good wages to design and build bullet trains or more fuel - efficient cars , forget that , no !
You want your job back ?
You can work for the same wage that someone would get to make the same car in Mexico or even China .
And Obama is backing this .
I wanted to talk about ‘ I Wo n’t Give Up ’ .
That ’s probably one of the more personal songs you ’ve written .
JB : Yeah .
The fangs are n’t as sharp in that one as they usually are with me , but it ’s kind of my opening salvo for the age of Obama .
The heartbreak already goes on in the first verse , but at the same time , should we just give up now ?
No , fight harder .
It does have that ‘ We Shall Overcome ’ feel .
In terms of the rest of the album , you riff on a lot of the problems .
But it ’s quite a striking antidote to the rest of the album ’s contents .
JB : The only time I tried to write a Fugazi song , or an anthem or something .
Trouble is , I discovered to my horror in the studio that it ’s a motherfucker to sing right – so I do n’t think it will ever spread as far and wide as ‘ We Shall Overcome ’ .
But at least I tried .
On ‘ Strength Thru Shopping ’ – you revisit that old DKs line , " Give me convenience or give me death " .
You talk a lot here about how self - delusionary consumerism can be .
JB : That song actually had to be cut way down , there were several more verses , and we could n’t figure out which ones to pull out , because they were all so funny .
I guess there are so many idiotic manifestations of consumerism to pick from .
JB : Yeah .
I think took out the part about people buying fake fruit and putting it in the refrigerator and locking their jewellery inside it ?
There are also fake rocks available too that ’s actually a safe – and no - one will think to look in your garden for your precious family jewels .
And I can just see the jewels ’ owner all dressed for the ball running around – ‘ Harold , Harold , I ca n’t find my brooch , where ’s my brooch , it ’s disappeared ! ’
‘ You ’re going to have to have to go out in the garden and get it , dear . ’
‘ Dressed like this ?’
No , and which rock was it ?
JB : Yeah !
‘ Pets Eat Their Master ’ – that ’s a good old - fashioned Biafra fantasy revenge thing , a bit like ‘ Funland At The Beach ’ .
Having some fun with the idea of roasting corporate yuppies .
JB : Then again , I often wonder if I should quit dealing with so many worst - case scenarios , because they keep coming true !
‘ Islamic Bomb ’ , from Never Breathe What You Ca n’t See [ Biafra ’s 2004 album with the Melvins ] came true right before the album came out .
They caught Mad Doctor Khan selling Pakistan ’s nuclear secrets in $ 60 million gift packages to Libya , North Korea and Iran .
But do you have fun writing those types of songs ?
Some of the other songs are very didactic , they contain a lot of information .
JB : I really feel triumph if I ’ve finally got the lyrics done and they make me laugh .
And I feel diabolical again !
I was never about the rock & roll hero thing – I always liked playing the villain and the saboteur .
Sometimes that even means I sabotage myself , but somehow I ’m still here .

Somali insurgents take their positions in Tarabuunka in Mogadishu , July 23 , 2009 .
( ( Mowlid Abdi/ Reuters ) )
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon called on all countries Thursday to provide urgent military support to Somalia 's embattled transitional government , warning that its survival is at stake .
Two allied Islamist insurgent groups — al - Shabab and the Islamic Party — launched an offensive that has killed hundreds of Somalis and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes .
Ban said the violence has worsened the humanitarian crisis in the country , with at least 3.2 million people — 43 per cent of Somalia 's population — requiring food and other aid .
Ban Ki-moon is calling on all countries to provide urgent military support to Somalia 's government .
( ( Lee Jin-man / Associated Press ) )
The fragile UN - backed government and an undermanned , poorly resourced African Union peacekeeping force have struggled to defend government buildings , the port and airport in the capital , Mogadishu .
The government holds only a few blocks in the city .
In a quarterly report to the UN Security Council , Ban appealed to the international community " not to waver in the face of the recent upsurge in fighting . "
" The coming days and weeks will be critical , " the secretary - general said .
" The government clearly needs urgent military support in areas of personnel , arms and logistics to sustain its success in warding off insurgent attacks and defending key installations . "
" I , therefore , appeal to the entire international community to render urgent support to the government of Somalia , without which it may not be able to establish itself , " Ban said .
Relief comes slowly
The transitional government led by President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed has called for military and other assistance , but the response has been slow , though the U.S. government sent 40 tonnes of weapons last month .
As of June 30 , the AU force in Mogadishu had 4,300 troops from Uganda and Burundi , just 54 per cent of its authorized strength of 8,000 .
Ban said steps are under way to deploy a third battalion from Burundi .
Sierra Leone and Malawi each pledged a battalion in June , but he said they need logistical support before they can deploy .
The secretary - general said it is important that donors who pledged more than $ 213 million US in April to support the AU force and Somalia 's security institutions honour their commitments — and he called for additional support to strengthen the peacekeeping force .
The Government of Canada has provided more than $ 35 million Cdn in development assistance to Somalia since 2006 , according to a government website .
Somalia has not had a functioning government since the ouster of a longtime dictator in 1991 and is riven by fighting among clan warlords and an Islamist insurgency that gained momentum in 2006 and has killed thousands of civilians and sent hundreds of thousands fleeing for their lives .
Ban said he was " deeply concerned by attempts to use force and violence to topple the transitional federal government , " stressing that they " must not be allowed to succeed . "
" Insurgent groups , such as al - Shabab , are alleged to be extorting money from private companies and recruiting young people to join the fight against the government in Mogadishu , including child soldiers , " he said .
As a result of the recent fighting , Ban said , there has also been a marked deterioration in the human rights situation with reports that insurgents have used civilians as human shields , which may constitute a war crime .
Latest statistics show that Australia ’s population is growing at a rate of more than a million every three years .
This growth rate is being driven primarily by record rates of immigration and a relative young population , itself a product of rapid past immigration .
Doubtless Peter Costello ’s baby bonus has also made the situation worse by encouraging the increased fertility rates of Australian women .
At the present rate Australia will have a population of about 50 million by mid century and 100 million by the end of the century .
If this sounds implausible , consider that at the end of World War II , just 64 years ago , Australia ’s population was only 7.5 million , i.e. it has almost tripled in that time .
This population growth should be considered an economic and environmental problem of huge proportions .
From the economic point of view , Australia relies mostly on mining and agriculture for its export earnings .
These industries require a very small proportion of the population to operate ( although it is true that due to inadequate training in the technical trades and engineering , they have suffered a temporary labour shortages in recent years ) .

The growing population in Australia will not increase exports of iron ore , coal or gold and will reduce our exports of food as we are forced to consume more of our output internally .
The money that comes to Australia from the sales of our resources presently gets divided among 22 million Australians .
When the population doubles the amount per capita will halve .
There are plenty of examples around the world where resource based economies , almost all of which do not rely on a large fraction of their population to produce the export income , are worse off with large populations .
Compare the UK with Norway , both supposedly rich from North Sea oil .
The UK , with a population of about 60 million , spent the income and will soon run out of oil .
Norway , with less than five million people , could afford to save a huge proportion of its income in large government investment funds .
Norway ’s future is assured .
During the recent resources boom , Australian governments squandered the bulk of the tax revenues generated by the mining companies , at least partially , in building infrastructure for an unnecessary population explosion .
As an example of this problem , consider the state of Queensland ’s finances which are caught between falling resources income and the staggering costs of providing the infrastructure for a third - world rate of population growth .
In the post war period of immigration there were some sound reasons to expand Australia ’s population .
There was a genuine , if exaggerated , security concern which was a rational response to the near death experience that Australia encountered in World War II .
There was also a concerted effort to expand Australia ’s manufacturing industry which , it was argued , needed a larger population to make it viable .
In the days of poor transport , we needed large internal markets .
All those factors have now changed .
Manufacturing in Australia is on its knees and a growing population will not help .
Mining , agriculture , tourism , and the education of foreign students are our biggest export earners and do not need a growing population .
From the environmental side , a growing population is an obvious problem .
Currently we have water shortages of varying severity in all our big cities which would have been less acute if we had maintained our population at levels of 20 years ago .
Melbourne would not have to contemplate encroaching into its green fringe or building a desalination plant if its population was n’t growing .
Finally , if you believe that C02 causes climate change , Australia ’s population growth will make it almost impossible to achieve meaningful emission reductions .
We have to reduce per-capita emissions by 50 per cent every 40 years just to keep our total emission at present levels .

Even though the problems of population growth are obvious , it is a political sacred cow that can not be argued or debated .
None of the major political parties will argue for lower immigration because they are scared of being labeled racist .
Even the Greens who have a useful population policy are almost always silent on this issue .
They should be arguing for lower immigration every time the Australian Bureau of Statistics population figures are released .
There is also an unholy alliance between the right wing who want a growing population to feed our housing construction industry and the extreme left who want to allow the whole world to come to Australia on compassionate grounds .
The housing industry is the main beneficiary of high population growth .
Every year we have to build a city the size of Canberra just to house our growth .
Unfortunately this is not a productive activity , unlike building a factory , a mine , the scientific development of better farming practice , a medical breakthrough or an environmental improvement .
House construction appears to be good for us because it employs people in the short term , but in the long run it will get us nowhere because it is not an investment in production .
The reality is that Australia has too many people in the industry .
Although the housing industry has always been a big winner from our population policy , there is now another big player that has its snout in the immigration trough .
That is our education sector .
Presently , applicants who wish to migrate to Australia and have a qualification from an Australian institution get preferential treatment .
This has spawned a massive industry in education which could only be described as an enormous immigration scam .
In the lobby of a large Pitt Street building recently I noted that half the companies in the building were involved in either immigration advice , or education for foreign students .
Many companies were doing both .
A Pinch too much
Last week , Joey Hess revealed that the Palm Pre running on WebOS uploads very specific information about your location and application usage to Palm on a daily basis .
Although it ’s allowed by the EULA that you must accept to use the Palm Pre , it still seems a little …creepy , especially if used for the wrong reasons .
The only “ bright ” side to this story is that it was for the Palm Pre , not for the iPhone .
Apple has been in the news a lot lately for its AppStore shenanigans , but at least they do n’t go so far as to track your location .
Right ?
Well , sort of .
Although we have yet to find an application by Apple that tracks your location , there are certainly a number of “ free ” applications in the official AppStore that are designed to do just that .
Case in point : there ’s this rather cute / gimicky app that lets you determine the tip for your waiter or waitress by tilting your phone as you pass it around the restaurant table .
But if you dig a little deeper ( like bushing did ) you ’ll find it uses a library by Pinch Media that is specifically designed to track your geographical location through time , then upload that data to Pinch Media .
( Oh and it also show you an ad , as an extra bonus ) .
Being an approved app , it must first ask you for permission to use your location .
If you tap “ Do n’t Allow ” , it will ask you again in about a minute , the next time its ad changes .
So you either stop using this app ( because it pesters you so much about the location question ) , or you finally submit and tap “ OK ” .
From that point on , your location and path info ( your actual physical path through your area each time you launch the app ) belongs to Pinch Media , Inc .
We think that ’s a Pinch too much .
Update : A commenter named fusen pointed out this post by 0th3lo .
who details Pinch Media ’s SQL info ( it includes your gender and birthday , when possible ) and goes so far as to say “ no doubt , ANY pinchmedia iPhone application is spyware ” .
Maybe it ’s time to pressure Apple to boot Pinch Media apps from the AppStore ?
Update : Pinch Media have blogged about the data collected by their analytics library here .
Update : Jailbroken users are now at a distinct advantage when it comes to data tracking .
saurik has worked with Pinch Media and some other data trackers to develop an “ opt - out ” feature for data collection !
It ’s called PrivaCy and is now available via Cydia !
JREF Swift Blog
We Provide The Tool , Use It Correctly
This is not a new video , but it needs to be brought to our attention once again as it demonstrates that tools are ineffective if they 're not used properly .
In this video you 'll see Glenn Beck interviewing John Edward , and it starts off great .
" Could you sleep at night knowing if you were n't on the up and up ? " asks Glenn , and we 're hopeful as we watch John Edward squrim .
And then comes the question - why wo n't you take the JREF Million Dollar Challenge ?
And the answer tells us a lot .
John Edward can't answer that question , so he does n't .
Instead , he says " why would I be tested by a guy with an adjective as his first name ? "
Well John , why would we listen to a guy whose South Park appointed adjective seems so fitting ?
( As an aside , it seems that the Australians know how to deal with this guy more effectively than Glenn Beck . )
But the failure here is n't with Edward , it 's with Beck .
He 's invoked the challenge appropriately by asking the key question " If you can do the things you claim , why do n't you win the million ? " and then utterly and completely failed to follow up on Edward 's non-answer .
By laughing along with Edward , Beck has failed his audience and himself .
By the way , the " scientists " Edward mentions at the University of Arizona 's Human Energy Lab is the notorious Dr. Gary Schwartz , and the testing was covered by Randi in this Swift article ( you 'll need to scroll down a bit ) .
It 's shocking what feats you can accomplish when you 're allowed to peek .
Edward still owes us an answer .
There is no excuse for not taking the challenge .
If you do n't need the money , great , you can donate it to any charity you 'd like .
And if you are n't willing to spend 30 minutes of your time to earn $ 1,000,000 for a charity , I think that actually does answer the question .
The answer is : because South Park is right .
Cross -dressing MI5 whistleblower David Shayler is evicted from farmhouse
Former MI5 whistleblower David Shayler was evicted today from the National Trust farmhouse where he had been squatting .
Shayler and seven other squatters were ordered to leave the Surrey property after a court hearing last week .
Judge Robert Reid QC said the group , who did not attend Guildford County Court , were trespassing .
Manhandled : David Shayler lies prone on the ground as he is evicted from the National Trust - owned property in Abinger , where he has been squatting in since June
On his knees :
The former MI5 agent stumbles to the ground as officers and bailiffs work to remove him from Hackhurst Farm
They had already been warned to vacate Hackhurst Farmhouse , Abinger , which they moved into on June 26 .
One man was arrested for drugs offences during the eviction today , which saw members of the group forcefully removed from the farmhouse .
Speaking after the eviction , cross-dressing Shayler said : ' I wonder if the council tax payers think it 's a good idea to have police surrounding us , when we 're a bunch of harmless hippies ?
' This must have cost them a fortune . '
Last month , he unveiled his alter - ego ' Delores Kane ' to reporters , posing at the farmhouse with false breasts , mini-skirt and ginger wig .
The troubled Shayler also revealed how he now often dresses in women 's clothing and claimed it was ' part of the prophecy ' because ' Jesus was a transvestite ' , adding : ' It was important to have feminine attributes and the people I live with do n't mind at all . '
Ladylike :
The former spy enjoys dressing as a woman and is also known as ' Delores '
With a mug of tea and seated in a plastic garden chair in the front room , Delores enjoys some time out with fellow squatter Chris Owen last month
Unrepentant : Shayler , who believes he is Christ , addresses the press outside the squat , near Guildford last week after receiving the eviction notice
Shayler claimed the group were entitled to stay in the property as it was vacant when they arrived .
They had been given until 4 pm yesterday to leave of their own accord , but after they refused to do so , police and bailiffs attended the house at about 11 am to evict them .
Shayler said the group held a party last night to celebrate their last night in the farmhouse , and alleged the squatters were ' manhandled ' out of the house .
The former spy , who also claims he is Jesus Christ , said he would challenge the eviction and added : ' Christ is the authority of the law and this is a violation of the law .
If people dragged the Queen out of her house there would be an outcry . '
A Surrey Police spokeswoman said : ' Surrey Police assisted in carrying out an eviction notice at Hackhurst Farm in Abinger this morning .
' Officers were on hand to deal with any breaches of the peace and a 27 - year - old man of no fixed abode was arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and possession of a Class A drug . '
A National Trust spokeswoman said : ' We are pleased to finally have our property back .
' We are a charity supported by public donations , and the process of recovering the house over the last few weeks has cost us over £ 10,000 . '
Shayler said he is now homeless but hopes to stay with friends , and added : ' We are going to try to open up another property .
We will take it as free men . '
Resisting : Another squatter makes things difficult for the police and bailiffs , as Shayler looks on
A couple of weeks ago I had a chat with Nicholas Francis , one of the founders of Unity 3D , the game development suite .
I ’d already been looking at Unity because we ’d seen a bunch of games using it .
The guys over at Blurst use it to make their crazy output , and things like the lovely PuzzleBloom have been turning up on the web more and more .
I even downloaded the 30 - day trial and messed about editing terrain and adding weird noises to seagulls for a while , at which time Paul Barnett from Mythic dropped me a line to say he was using it to prototype new game projects .
I ca n’t say I spend a great deal of time playing around with development suites , but the accessibility of this one certainly intrigued me .
I was glad to be able to put some questions to Francis , and ask a bit more about what his company was up to .
They were , it seems , making a nuclear - powered toaster …
RPS : How did the company start ?
I know it started with games , but what was the route into game engines ?
Was there a particular catalyst ?
Francis :
Well , I guess we were basically just three guys who wanted to make computer games .
We met at an OpenGL development conference and we said “ look , let ’s work on a technology component set that we can all share ” .
Instead of all making our own engines we should pool and make one .
And of course we could n’t decide which game to make – I wanted to make a top - down racing shooter , Joachim wanted to make an underwater Top Gun flight sim , and so on .
In the end we made a game with a rolling ball , so it all came out of this crazy dream .
We all moved in together and sat and coded for years .
And , then , well , we had n’t actually thought about making middleware – we were making games – this was seven years ago , when the market was a little different .
Anyway , when you get coders together to work on a problem , they wo n’t solve the problem so much as create a tool to solve a problem for them .
Our problem was “ we want to make games ” , and so we spent a long time making the editor , making it really polished , and making this good user experience so we could actually use the tool .
We released our first and only game and thought , “ hey , this editor is pretty good , why do n’t we get it out there to everyone . ”
After that we decided to concentrate on the engine technology .
Of course we then a problem of how to price it …
How do you price technology ?
Back then we knew nothing about the market and had no idea .
One thing we thought about was the camera market .
So you have big and expensive cameras which do n’t sell very much , and at the other end you have really cheap consumer stuff , which sells loads .
But in the middle there ’s this market for the sort of guy you might call a “ prosumer ” , something like that .
We wanted to be something like that .
So we wanted to make the barriers to entry minimal , but balance that with the technology being powerful enough to take you as far as you want to go , as with the cameras in the same range .
So that ’s how it happened .
We then just worked hard in it , for years .
RPS : So “ making games ” was the basic philosophy for the company …
Francis : I ca n’t pinpoint one philosophy , we ’re not quite that groomed yet !
I guess the aim , though , is simply to put a powerful technology into the hands of anyone who wants to play a game , which is a lot of people .
RPS : But why is what you ’re doing good for the aspiring game designer ?
There will be loads of indies or wannabe indies reading this article , and , well , the first thing I noticed on the Unity site is that you have cheap package targeted at them .
Why is it good for them ?
Why should they use this over anything else ?
Francis :
Well , we have done this in order to make games .
We ’ve seen where the bottlenecks were !
Some of the worst stuff was iteration time – when you have an art asset how quickly can you get it into your game ?
That is vital .
We ’ve always had this idea of an integrated development environment .
If you can get your asset straight into your editor , or if you can go and change a texture in Photoshop and the game can pick it up while you are still running , then you can really quickly iterate your design .
If you change a model in Maya the game will reimport it and make sure that everything works .
None of this is rocket science !
But it is about applying polish over time to make it as good as it can possibly be .
RPS : So why is the “ professional ” package so much more expensive ?
Francis :
Well , there was n’t any kind of masterplan , because we started out knowing nothing about the market .
But we ’ve always wanted everyone to be able to get into this tech , and then we also want it to be so that if you are serious about it you will be okay with paying us money .
That ’s the basics : anyone can get into it and taste it .
We just want to get it to people .
You can release a game on the basic licence and then upgrade , a kind of bootstrap process .
Feature - wise there is so much in there , especially for all the features in the pro licence .
RPS : You hear about other games tech communities sharing their experiences and solutions a fair bit , is that the same for Unity ?
Francis :
We have eight thousand users on the forums and a lot of those are just trying it and playing around , but others are professional developers , and they do help each other .
One amateir guy will try and help the professional and back and forth .
It ’s hard to even keep up with the posts of eight thousand people .
Users are supporting themselves , but we will be there to fix any bugs , of course .
RPS : And does that community produce any surprises ?
Anything weird emerge from the tech ?
Francis : Yeah , wow .
A lot of those surprises came in like the first year , because there were a lot of people using it .
There were a lot of people with a really creative background – you do n’t have to be a C++ developer !
– working on things , and so in that first year we had a lot of really weird games come out .
So after that sort of time you just do n’t get surprised by stuff :
Oh yeah , a flying camel game , whatever .
A bigger surprise , perhaps , was that we had some high end users .
We got the Cartoon Network to buy into it and use it for the FusionFall game , and we had EA doing Tiger Woods .
Tiger Woods !
RPS : That comment about the C++ developer is an interesting one .
I talked to some developer friends about Unity and their general reaction was “ oh well I like to just program all my own tools , no use for me ” , do you find that you find more resistance in that experienced set to using Unity , than say less technical types ?
Francis :
We ’re seeing it somewhat less now , but I think that is partly because the tools have become much more powerful .
We ’ve always had this idea about “ well you should n’t have to deal with the source code ” , and that has set a very high barrier for us .
But on the coder thing … well , I think many coders actually want to code , and gamers are an excellent excuse to be able to do that , but others have realised that getting the code interpolation right when you are importing animations just is n’t that interesting a problem to solve .
When you use Unity you ’re not that close to the metal , but you can make with plugins , and you can work on the more fun parts of your game .
RPS : Some teams have said to me that they did n’t choose Unity because they could n’t play around with the source code ?
Is that a problem ?
Francis :
Well it ’s not a problem now , because we have source code licences .
You can write to us and get a licence on the source code .
The other thing we get is people from studios saying “ oh hey , I want to get the source code so that I can mess around with this and that ” , but then we talk to them and find out what they want to do , and when we find out we can say “ well you can do this and that , you can do it this way already inside Unity ” .
So often it ’s just a case of getting to know the tools .
If they do n’t know the tools they do n’t know whether they need the source code for what they want to do .
Once we solve that it ’s suddenly something they do n’t have to worry about any more .
Often , then , it is only a problem in people ’s perceptions .
Our job is to make sure you do n’t really need it .
People should be making games , not dealing with debugging .
“ We suffer so you do n’t have to ! ”
That ’s one of our internal mottos .
Lots of people have suggested that professionals wo n’t use Unity because they want source code access , but then professionals started using it .
And back at the start of when we were doing this people were saying “ no one will buy middleware , because they will want to have have maximum control through source code ” and then everyone starts buying middleware .
If your tools are good enough people do n’t want source code .
They make assumptions about what they need , because that ’s what they used to .
RPS : Yeah , that ’s a difficult communication problem is n’t it .
I ’m leafing through your documentation and tutorials , and it ’s pretty sprawling …
Francis : Yeah , and there ’s a hundred pages coming out for iPhone development too .
You know , because of the webplayer there ’s always an issue with backwards compatibility , and we can spend hours arguing about function , and testing for function , and we can have this intellectual Darwninism going on with features , and that can take as long as it has to .
I think it ’s a well structured API and tool set , easy to get into , and once you ’re in there you just start asking “ how can I do this ” .
We just had some guys do real time global illumination just using our standard API .
So we have all this documentation for people who want to find out , but other people , most other people , they wo n’t really care about it .
They just want to get on and make a game !
RPS : People seem a bit reticent about the Unity browser plugin … do you see yourself as like a super Flash plugin , or something different ?
Francis : No .
We have an idea of Unity which is “ console quality games on the web ” so that might seem like “ oh , it ’s 3D Flash ” , but it ’s a real game engine .
We have the physics , we have the 3D audio , we can do all of these things .
We are a real 3D game engine company , the difference is you / can / you use the webplayer as a better Flash .
If you want to make 3D games for a browser , you can do that .
But let ’s come at this from another angle .
In the past everyone was doing physical distribution .
Everyone hated that because you had limited shelf space , so you moved to downloadable executables , but then other companies were saying “ that ’s just another barrier , that ’s just more steps in the way ” , so you just want to get them online immediately .
You want to get games working in Facebook so they they can play against each other right there , right away .
Of course the scope of Unity is that you can do hardcore 3D development , or you can just make a 3D banner .
That ’s hard for us because we have different messages to send out to people .
Someone from an Adobe Director background comes in and goes wild with all the things you can do on the web , while a traditional game developer is looking elsewhere and aiming higher .
But really , from a user perspective , the Unity plugin just gets more people playing games , faster .
An example of this is the Cartoon Network ’s Fusion Fall game .
That was made as an executable in another engine and then at some point they realised they had a 1.5gig download for a game targeted at teens !
They ca n’t wait through that , but they will play it if they can get to it via their browser .
RPS : Will there be more and more 3D games played via browsers then ?
Francis :
It seems to me just that people are playing more games and they are playing them in different ways .
I ’m not going to come along and say “ oh browser games are the future and traditional games are dead ” because that ’s just not what ’s happening .
It ’s a mix .
As a game developer you just have to meet players where they are .
If you are doing a hardcore shooter they ’re going to expect an executable , if it ’s more casual they ’ll want to browse it .
But people do want to get at games faster .
They like Steam because you put your card details in and then you can just download the games you see online , and it ’s why the iPhone is popular because it ’s so easy to get a game and play it , right away .
RPS : Were you surprised by the success of the iPhone ?
I mean you support it , so did you expect it to take off ?
Francis :
Oh , it surprised us .
We have two hundred games in the app store .
Well , our uses have 200 games .
When you have Unity you have the tools and whatever you make is yours .
A bit untraditional , because people usually think “ we need a cut of the profits ” .
When you buy a hammer , you own the hammer .
You build a house with it , it ’s your house .
The person who made the hammer does n’t get a cut of the house .
It ’s the same for us .
We ’re seeing around one iPhone game released every day since we launched .
We ’re selling a lot of iPhone Unity .
Of course Apple ’s business model is in a box : there ’s one way to get apps , and they get a 30 % cut .
That ’s it .
No one who has an iPhone feels uncomfortable about it .
RPS : That ’s interesting .
The idea of a kind of universal fabricator for games .
Build it with one toolset and export it to a whole load of different places .
Someone could make a 3D game and have it online to download , or in a browser , or on an iPhone .
Francis :
We are looking at 360 and PS3 development too .
Our goal is , of course , write once run anywhere .
Of course you are going to struggle to write a game that works well on PS3 , iphone and PC all at once , but we ’re going to go as far as we can to help people achieve that .
Things might need to be cut down , but core code will just work .
RPS : What ’s the future for Unity then ?
Multiplayer and MMO support ?
Francis :
Well we are geeks , we will just keep on adding cool new tech , more cool tools for people .
We have multiplayer in there , just up to 64 - players , LAN and internet and that sort of stuff .
As for the MMO stuff , a few of the big MMO platforms now have Unity integration kits .
These guys are good at that , so in a way that is sort of covered .
People are more and more online , and so a networked games are feasible and you can pick your own back end to do that .
The message though , we need to get out , is to not be fooled by how simply Unity can look .
I took two years out just to make games with Unity , to figure out what we could do and what we could improve .
And we do that .
We ’re taking high end tech and dressing it up to look like a toaster , Unity is the toaster that is nuclear powered via it ’s own core .
People just see a toaster .
We want to keep it simple and easy to get into , but that does n’t mean you ca n’t get to the dirty bits .
Russian Oil and Gas Industry Surprises Analysts
Renaissance Capital oil and gas analyst Alex Burgansky , who ranks at the top of the list of sector analysts in Russia , shares his insights on the industry and its issues in this exclusive Energy Report interview .
Russia 's 2009 oil production is up a bit — contrary to the collapse many commentators had predicted — but issues remain .
Alex expresses some worries that Russia 's oil production will decline , for instance , unless its tax regime stops discouraging investment that taps into the strong reserve base in core producing areas .
He also talks how Europe 's infrastructure affects the gas it imports from Russia and other parts of the world .
The Energy Report : You focus on the oil and gas markets in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States .
Can you give us your perspective on the oil market there ?
Alex Burgansky : Russia is the biggest oil producer in the world , but the Russian domestic market is not as big as the oil production .
Russia 's consumption of hydrocarbons is only about 25 % of the domestic oil production , so Russia exports the majority of oil it produces and whatever it refines .
I think the biggest issue that concerns most investors as far as Russian oil production is concerned is the growth rate or decline rate .
At the start of the year , there were calls made by quite a large number of commentators that Russian oil production would decline this year by quite a considerable amount .
The numbers published were between 1 % and 5 % and even 7 % .
In actual fact , the Russian production is up this year .
Year to date it is up 0.4 % and we believe it will be up 0.3 % for the full year .
This growth has really surprised a lot of market commentators .
Although we probably will experience some decline next year because we 're simply not going to see as many new projects launched as we have this year , I think we 'll still end up with a relatively robust production .
We certainly do not believe that it 's going to fall off a cliff the way people had expected .
TER : You indicated that you expect some decline in Russian oil production because there are n't as many projects moving forward .
Is that due to lack of good projects or lack of financing like we 're seeing in the rest of the world ?
AB : It 's not really a lack of good projects .
The Russian reserve base is very strong .
The average life for proved reserves of oil is 22 years , which is a very lucrative figure compared to most other oil producers in the world .
For most of the listed companies in Russia , the figures are even higher .
For LUKOIL Company ( LKOH ) , it 's 24 years ; for Rosneft ( ROSN ) , 26 years ; for Tatneft ( LSE : ATAD ) , 30 years — very , very high numbers .
They form the basis for continuing growth in Russian oil production .
There are plenty of projects in Russia , both new projects and existing brownfield projects .
Russia is a very mature producer .
If you exclude all the drilling activity taking place every year , then Russian organic decline in production is close to 19 % .
To compensate for that organic decline , Russia drills somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 wells every year .
And then there are two important questions .
One , is there enough oil in Russia for 5,000 or 6,000 wells to penetrate ?
In my view , the answer is yes .
As I explained , we are dealing with a very large reserve base .
And the second question : is there enough money in Russia to do that , and can it be done economically ?
The answer to this question is not so obvious .
TER : Why is that ?
AB : Certainly this year , particularly in the first half , coming from a significant financial crisis , the Russian oil companies did suffer from a certain lack of operating cash flow and , therefore , the amount of new activity came down .
Thus , even with the existing brownfields , they have n't been drilling as many wells as required to keep production more or less flat .
We did have the benefit , however , of new fields being launched .
That not only offset the decline in the underlying production but also compensated for the insufficient number of wells being drilled .
But the Russian tax regime is unfortunately not very conducive to investment in the new projects .
As a result , outside of five or six projects being launched this year , very little has been formed in the pipeline over the past few years .
We need further action on the part of the Russian government , further relaxation of the tax regime to encourage Russian oil companies to invest in the greenfields .
TER : How likely is such action ?
AB : The Russian government has made some significant changes already , but those specifically relate to the new production provinces .
Instead of unifying the tax regime across the whole of Russian oil production , the government just gives certain tax breaks if the oil companies move into the specific territories .
For example , tax breaks are in place for the East Siberian fields , for Timan - Pechora ( which is far north ) and certain other areas .
The problem is that those tax breaks do not really address the fundamental issue of the core producing areas .
They are very mature , and additional investment is required to slow down or stop production declines .
There are some deeper horizons , for example , that could be targeted in the existing production areas in West Siberia .
Changing the tax regime to acknowledge and accommodate higher costs in the existing production areas would be very welcome by the oil industry .
At the moment , the Russian government tells the oil industry where the incentives are and where development should take place .
So far , the government seems reluctant to give decision - making power to the oil companies themselves .
But presumably the Russian oil industry is best positioned to identify where the incremental capex should go and whether it should go into the existing brownfield developments in West Siberia as opposed to the new production provinces .
The greenfields might be too difficult to develop and too far away in terms of timeline , and infrastructure might be lacking .
Instead of investing in those places , the decision might be to invest in the existing production provinces and try to drive production growth from there and just utilize the existing assets a bit better .
Going to the deeper horizons is certainly more expensive , oil quality is different , flow rates are much lower , the drilling costs are much higher and , in the absence of any tax changes , it will be very difficult for the oil companies to do that economically .
Therefore , they are not now doing the work that otherwise probably would have made sense for them and we are waiting for the government to make some further decisions insofar as the regulation and taxation issues are concerned .
TER : Do you have a sense of when some decisions will be made ?
AB : This is constantly on the government agenda .
However , as the financial crisis erupted and the oil price collapsed to the point that it was hovering around $ 40 or $ 50 per barrel , Russia was not in the mood to change the tax regime significantly .
Now that the oil price has recovered and prospects for it to stay at this level are a lot better than at the beginning of the year , I think the government is actually coming back to the idea of reforms in the Russian oil sector .
There is not a lot of clarity on whether harmonization can be achieved across the new fields and the old fields .
That would be ideal .
At the moment we 're just looking for some additional tax breaks for the individual production provinces .
In October and November , we expect some further tax breaks on export duties for oil produced in East Siberia .
Then in 2011 we expect that the government might come up with a totally new taxation regime for the new fields .
At this stage , that 's unlikely to affect the existing fields but we certainly expect more incentives for the new developments .
TER : Are the potential tax breaks for the existing fields required to make current production companies profitable or more viable ?
AB : No , not at all .
They are very profitable as they are .
If no more tax breaks are given , there will simply be less investment going into Russian oil production and therefore you will see production start to decline .
We saw this last year when Russian production fell for the first time since the mid-1990s , certainly for the first time in more than 10 years .
It declined last year by 0.8 % .
This year , as I said before , some people expected production to collapse .
We certainly never thought it would collapse , but we did think it would decline .
Instead it 's actually growing as a result of benefits from past investments in the new fields coming on stream this year .
But we 're simply running out of the pipeline of these new fields .
Therefore , next year there will be a lot fewer fields coming on stream ; in the absence of new incentives to put more money to work to grow Russian oil production , it will naturally start declining , with organic decline rates of around 19 % and growing .
Every year , Russia will have to drill more and more wells to try to keep oil production flat and that requires more capex every year .
If tax breaks are not forthcoming , the oil companies will simply not have enough cash flow to grow .
In that case , their production will decline faster despite the fact that there are plenty of reserves for them to recover .
TER : What are some of the companies in Russia that investors in the West should consider ?
AB : The two largest oil producers are LUKoil and Rosneft , which also are among the very few that are growing their production this year .
We believe both of them are capable growing their production next year as well , as a result of new developments coming on stream .
They have downstream operations in addition to upstream operations and Lukoil in particular also is quite well diversified internationally , both in oil production and refining .
The company 's key focus is still on Russia , which is by far the dominant part of its operations , but LUKoil has more international exposure than any other Russian oil company .
TER : Are there other companies that you follow ?
AB : LUKoil , Rosneft , TNK - BP , Surgutneftegas , Gazprom Neft and Tatneft — these are the six that are listed and they are the six largest oil companies in Russia .
And there are obviously gas producers we cover as well .
Gazprom is , by far , the largest one — in fact the largest gas company in the world — and the second largest gas producer in Russia is Novatek .
They are also listed and we also cover it .
TER : In addition to the major Russian plays , you follow Tethys Petroleum Ltd. ( TSX : TPL ) .
Can you give us some comments on that ?
AB : Tethys is one of the most interesting exploration plays in our geography .
Unlike Rosneft , Lukoil , Tatneft or Gazprom , it is a very early stage company focused more on exploration and less on development or production .
Only a very small percentage of its reserves are currently represented by proved reserves ; most of its portfolio is actually in resources .
The company 's prime attraction , we think , is a significant , very large - scale exploration property in Tajikistan , where the company 's current license covers over 35,000 square kilometers in an area where not a lot of exploration activity has been undertaken in the past .
Tethys is utilizing new western technology in what is widely believed to be very prolific plays from the point of view of reaching more hydrocarbon resources .
We think that is a very interesting opportunity .
Tethys also has two development properties in Kazakhstan , where they produce gas , and also an oil operation in Uzbekistan .
They are actually a pretty well - diversified operation .
They 're focusing on Central Asia , which has very significant potential in hydrocarbons , in both oil and gas .
We think significant exploration opportunities exist in this area , with Tethys being one of the largest exploration plays .
TER : When would you expect Tethys to have some proven reserves ?
AB : The company is currently undertaking a drilling program , which consists of three deep wells , one each in Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan .
We expect some preliminary results from these wells to be announced over the course of the next few months — so by the end of 2009 or early 2010 .
If successful , they could convert a significant portion of resources into proven reserves .
TER : Are there any regional issues that Tethys — or any company — will face moving from proven reserves into production ?
AB : Once the reserves are identified , the first key issue any company would face is funding .
That 's less of an issue for a large company like LUKoil , but it 's certainly an issue for a small company like Tethys .
They recently did a placement to raise money to continue with the exploration work , but if they are successful with proving some of the resources , they certainly would have to go back to the market to raise more money .
I would say it would be a very good problem to have , though , because it would mean that they have increased the value of that opportunity significantly .
The second issue is the off - take , which could be an issue , particularly in Central Asia and particularly with gas .
In general , Central Asia is producing more gas than it consumes .
However , both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are importing gas at the moment .
So they are short of gas on average and , therefore , Tethys has chosen those areas where they can actually find off - take agreements for their gas .
On top of that , there is a significant infrastructure available , built back at the time of the Soviet Union .
There are some new pipelines built as well , going mostly into Russia , where the contracts can be signed to export gas from those areas in case of significant further discoveries — which is entirely possible .
As a matter of fact , plenty of producers in Central Asia already have agreements in place with Gazprom to sell gas to Gazprom or export it to Europe through Russia .
So the gas off - take could be difficult ; but I think in the case of Tethys , the risk is mitigated by the fact that , first of all , we are talking about a relatively small development and , secondly , because Tethys is located in regions that are short of gas .
As far as the oil is concerned , it 's much easier to move , particularly in that we are talking about relatively small production .
At the moment , Tethys is simply trucking oil from its field in Uzbekistan to the neighboring railway terminal , where then it goes by rail to the nearby refinery .
In case of any significant discoveries in Tajikistan or further discoveries in Uzbekistan , other solutions certainly will have to be found , but there are plenty of oil pipelines in the region .
Tethys could potentially connect to them and there are also other opportunities .
They could continue to truck oil or ship it by rail ; the infrastructure is in place in most of the areas where Tethys operates .
TER : Any other issues ?
AB : Yes .
The third issue is the economics , including taxes .
The good thing about Tethys is the Tajikistan production - sharing agreements they have , where they are operating under the PSA rules with very benign taxation .
That assures that if any commercial discoveries are made , it is very likely that tax wo n't be a material issue for them .
TER : How do you view opportunities for investors in the Russian natural gas market ?
AB : The Russian market and the European market are very different from the U.S. market .
The U.S. gas market is predominantly a spot market , with about 95 % of total U.S. gas supplies being bought on spot terms and only about 5 % on a long - term contract basis .
In Europe it 's the other way around , and the difference is due to the fact that Europe does not have as much infrastructure as the United States does .
The U.S. has an extensive gas pipeline network , very transparent pipeline access rules and plenty of underground storage facilities .
That 's a massive infrastructure to maintain the spot trading in gas .
The infrastructure does not really exist in Europe .
There are certainly pipelines , but underground storage is quite limited and there are no clear third - party access rules .
For these reasons , Europe is really a long - term contract market .
There is a small but growing share of the spot market and it is natural that investors are concerned these days , inasmuch as there seems to be quite an abundance of gas around the world and they worry that excess gas supplies will make their way into Europe and displace existing suppliers such as Gazprom .
The Gazprom share price since the start of the year certainly has suffered relative to other Russian hydrocarbon producers , and certainly relative to the oil companies .
I believe one of the reasons it 's suffered was the concern that there was going to be too much gas coming into Europe and that Gazprom production could be affected negatively .
In reality , I think those concerns have been significantly exaggerated .
The spot volumes of gas , LNG cargoes , cannot really displace the long - term contract gas with pipeline gas for the reasons I mentioned .
Gazprom also is protected through its long - term contracts , which on average have the duration of about 30 years .
They provide a very long - term framework for gas supplies into Europe and have minimal off - take commitments associated with those contracts , with the off - take commitments actually growing .
This year , those off - take commitments are close to 140 billion cubic meters .
Next year they will be 160 billion cubic meters and growing to 168 billion cubic meters by 2020 — and that 's not taking into account the new additional supplies that could go into Europe through the new pipelines that are likely to be built .
The North Stream and South Stream pipelines will potentially further increase Gazprom supplies into Europe ; that 's part of the reason why I have a view that Gazprom 's market share could grow .
But even in the absence of these new projects , Gazprom supplies into Europe will grow on the basis of the existing contracts .
Therefore , I think the concerns about LNG volumes displacing Gazprom 's gas in Europe are a little bit exaggerated .
TER : Are you following other gas company plays in Russia ?
AB : Yes .
There are a couple of others .
The second largest gas producer is Novatek , but the key issue that Novatek and other gas producers face is inability to export gas .
The Russian domestic gas price is significantly below not only the European price , but even the netback of that European price .
So once you deduct the transportation costs and deduct the export duty , the European price probably remains around three times higher than the domestic gas price .
Gazprom , of course , not only has access to the European gas market , by law Gazprom is the monopoly exporter of gas out of Russia .
So all the other Russian gas producers — there are plenty of them — are hurt by their inability to export gas .
At the same time , the domestic gas price has been increasing in the past few years and that has attracted a large number of new players into the gas market and has resulted in quite a lot of new capacity coming on stream as far as the gas production is concerned .
In some cases , of course , new capacity is being built now with the new fields to be commissioned over the next two to three years .
These other gas producers in Russia , in the absence of the ability to sell gas to Europe , have to compete ever harder for domestic customers .
We expect their ability to charge a premium over the regulated level — which certainly was the case over the past few years — to disappear .
So if one chooses to invest in Russian gas producers , I would favor Gazprom because it can sell gas to Europe and because its production and pricing prospects are much more visible than in the case of so - called independent gas producers .
TER : Most North American discussion about Russia 's natural gas exports centers on European countries being the primary importers — almost to the point that Russia has a monopolistic control .
What is your perspective on that ?
AB : First of all , it is not true .
Europe consumes around 600 billion cubic meters of natural gas and Russia supplies about 150 billion cubic meters on average .
Gazprom is the only Russian supplier to Europe and it is a considerable player in Europe , but certainly by no means the monopoly supplier of gas .
We believe that Gazprom 's market share probably will grow over time , but it will remain significantly below even 30 % of the European market .
So Gazprom 's an important player , but not a dominant player at all .
TER : What 's the biggest misconception North Americans have about Russian oil or gas production or markets ?
AB : This year , I think certainly the biggest misconception on the oil side is that Russian oil production is going to collapse .
As we discussed , I do n't think that 's the case .
We 've actually had similar issues about gas production .
If you go back two to three years , there was significant concern that Gazprom in particular had not been investing enough to maintain production levels .
That was a misconception .
Certainly Gazprom had enough production capacity then .
Now there seems to be another misconception that there is too much gas around and that Gazprom wo n't be able to sell as much gas as it wants because it 's going to be displaced by LNG in Europe in particular .
As I said earlier , I do n't believe that is the case because Gazprom is protected by the long - term contracts , which have minimum off - take commitments .
Therefore , we think the volumes that Gazprom will supply to Europe are pretty stable .
They 're not really affected significantly by changes in spot market prices and they 're certainly not as volatile as market sentiment , particularly among U.S. investors .

The cyberattacks Thursday and Friday on Twitter and other popular Web services disrupted the lives of hundreds of millions of Internet users , but the principal target appeared to be one man : a 34 - year - old economics professor from the republic of Georgia .
During the assault  the latest eruption in a yearlong skirmish between nationalistic hackers in Russia and Georgia  unidentified attackers sent millions of spam e-mail messages and bombarded Twitter , Facebook and other services with junk messages .
The blitz was an attempt to block the professor ’s Web pages , where he was revisiting the events leading up to the brief territorial war between Russia and Georgia that began a year ago .
The attacks were “ the equivalent of bombing a TV station because you do n’t like one of the newscasters , ” Mikko Hyppönen , chief research officer of the Internet security firm F - Secure , said in a blog post .
“ The amount of collateral damage is huge .
Millions of users of Twitter , LiveJournal and Facebook have been experiencing problems because of this attack . ”
The blogger , a refugee from the Abkhazia region , a territory on the Black Sea disputed between Russia and Georgia , writes under the name Cyxymu , but identified himself only by the name Giorgi in a telephone interview .
Giorgi , who said he taught at Sukhumi State University , first noticed Thursday afternoon that LiveJournal , a popular blogging platform , was not working for him .
“ I decided to go to Facebook , ” he said .
“ And Facebook did n’t work .
Then I went to Twitter , and Twitter did n’t work .
‘ How strange , ’ I thought , ‘ What a coincidence they all do n’t work at once . ’ ”
In what was presented to the public this week as a clarification of its privacy policy , the US Dept. of Homeland Security published a paper referring to new guidelines for its immigration and customs agents regarding how they may conduct border searches of travelers ' computers and electronic media .
Clarifying the existing law , both sets of guidelines reiterated the department 's policy created during the previous administration : Agents may seize , detain , and / or retain individuals ' PCs and media without having reason to suspect that those people or those machines and devices are connected with a crime .
" ICE [ Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] Special Agents acting under border search authority may search , detain , seize , retain , and share electronic devices , or information contained therein , with or without individualized suspicion , consistent with the guidelines and applicable laws set forth herein , " states the new policy for immigration authorities published last August 18 ( PDF available here ) .
" Assistance to complete a border search may be sought from other Federal agencies and non-Federal entities , on a case by case basis , as appropriate . "
The guidelines for Customs & Border Patrol ( CBP ) agents says pretty much the same thing , adding that whenever a CBP agent encounters technical trouble figuring out how a mechanism works , or what the meaning of some piece of information is , he can seek help from other US government sources .
" In such situations , Officers may transmit electronic devices or copies of information contained therein to seek technical assistance from other federal agencies , " reads the CBP guidelines ( PDF available here ) .

What 's been a subject of contention ever since the government tightened border inspection policies in the wake of 9/11 has n't been so much agents ' rights to act without suspicion ( although for some , that already crosses the line ) as the authority DHS grants them to transmit the information they find elsewhere , under the auspices of " seeking help . "
Both guidelines now state that agents may only seek help from other federal sources , but they are not explicit with regard to what level -- for example , whether a private consultant under retainer for the FBI would qualify .
In their assessment of the extent of the risks this clarified policy might pose to citizens ' and visitors ' personal privacy , published last Tuesday ( PDF available here ) , both border agencies , acting jointly , identified six specific areas : " ( 1 ) travelers may need additional information regarding the authority [ agents have ] to conduct border searches ; ( 2 ) the traveler may be unaware of the viewing or detention of his / her information by CBP and ICE ; ( 3 ) personally identifiable information ( PII ) may be detained where it is not needed ; ( 4 ) PII may be misused by CBP and ICE officers ; ( 5 ) CBP and ICE may disclose PII to other agencies that may misuse or mishandle it ; and ( 6 ) new privacy risks may arise as the technology involved in this activity is ever - changing . "
In other words , individuals may not be fully informed as to the extent of agents ' authority , and what safeguards there may be to protect identifying information from falling into the hands of someone who can misuse it -- the privacy threat here being that the traveler may not know what the threat really is .
The solution , DHS asserts , is by making that information about the private information that could be misused , public -- specifically , by publishing it in the Federal Register .
Under the heading , " Principle of Transparency , " the DHS report explains , " When ICE or CBP retain information from electronic devices , that information may be subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act .
The Privacy Act requires that agencies publish a System of Records Notice ( SORN ) in the Federal Register describing the nature , purpose , maintenance , use , and sharing of the information .
This PIA and the several SORNs published by DHS provide notice of the retention of PII at the border and the retention of some of the contents of electronic devices . "
So at the very least , an explanation of the events surrounding the detention or seizure of travelers ' computers may be available online to those travelers ( along with everyone else ) on GPOAccess.gov .
However , the Department goes on to say , the extent of the information shared online this way may be limited , especially with regard to how much the detained information is being shared , as well as with whom .
This is for the good of any investigation that may arise .
" Because notifying the traveler of the sharing of information could impede an investigation or other law enforcement or national security efforts , CBP and ICE do not make the information sharing process fully transparent to the public , " the report states .
" To ensure the protection of personal data without compromising the investigation , CBP and ICE have instituted strict oversight and review processes .
Generally speaking , information , including PII , will be shared with other agencies where CBP and / or ICE require subject matter expertise , decryption , or translation . "
Those oversight and review processes will make the sharing of that information with other agencies legal and permissible under the Privacy Act of 1974 .
Appropriate safeguards and audit trails will be kept to track when and where information is exchanged , but for the sake of privacy , that information will be kept private .

1988 : Three Italian Aermacchi MB -339 fighter jets collide in midair at the Ramstein air base in Germany , killing 70 people and causing serious injuries to 346 others .
It 's one of the worst air show disasters in history .
The accident occurred at the culmination of a complex maneuver by Frecce Tricolori , Italy 's military stunt - flight team .
Known as " the pierced heart , " the exercise calls for two groups of aircraft to form a large heart shape in front of the audience , with a solo jet flying through the lower tip of the heart at the completion of the trick .
The culmination of this maneuver occurs only 135 feet above the crowd .
When performed flawlessly , the stunt is exhilarating .
But with all the close - quarters aerial maneuvering , there 's zero margin for error .
And this time an error occurred at the end of the stunt .
The piercing aircraft piloted by Lt. Col .
Ivo Nutarelli came in too low and too fast at the end of the maneuver .
The pilot of a nearby plane , Lt. Col. Mario Naldini was unable to compensate for Nutarelli 's mistake .
The nose of Nutarelli 's plane collided with Naldini 's tail section at around 300 miles per hour causing Nutarelli 's plane to disintegrate .
Naldini 's plane , now completely out of control , clipped a third jet in the formation , piloted by Captain Giorgio Alessio .
His plane then crashed into a Black Hawk med-evac helicopter on a taxiway near the runway , killing the copter 's pilot .
Worse yet , a fireball of shrapnel and jet fuel from the initial impact of the Nutarelli and Naldini planes exploded onto the crowd of thousands just a few hundred feet below .
All three pilots were killed .
Nutarelli and Naldini both died on impact .
The pilot of the third plane , Captain Alessio , managed to eject but was killed when his chute did n't open — his egress occurred at too low an altitude .
The observing crowd bore the brunt of the impact .
A blazing cauldron of petroleum and white - hot shrapnel from Nutarelli 's plane rained down on hundreds of spectators .
Thirty - one people died outright at the scene .
Another 36 succumbed to their injuries in the ensuing weeks — mostly of severe burn trauma .
Almost 500 people had to receive medical attention .
Compounding the tragedy , enormous snafus took place in the emergency response .
Because the accident happened on an American military base , German ambulances were not allowed to enter at first .
Numerous communications mix -ups resulted in the delay of victims being routed to hospitals and paramedics not being able to treat severe injuries in time .
And the only med-evac helicopter on the scene had been destroyed in the crash .
Because the accident occurred at an air show , there was plenty of pro and amateur video and photography , and investigators were quickly able to determine what went wrong and why .
Most aerial disasters happen because of an lengthy list of multiple complex factors .
Not the Ramstein crash .
This tragedy came about because of one simple reason : pilot error .

Salary ... Salary ... Salary ...
Until you came up behind me , I was on cruise control .
I pegged you for another of those nose - pickers of the interstate .
But when I moved to pass a truck , you sped up to tailgate me .
You got behind me — breathing down my neck — and then you flashed your headlights .
You know I could n’t hear your car horn .
But flashing your headlights meant I was supposed to get out of your way .
But I was doing ten miles above the speed limits already .
Hey , pal , you should n’t ask me to get out of your way when I ’m already speeding .
But I moved aside and then I thought —
How dare you get angry !
My job is not to help you break the laws .
How do you like someone riding your ass ?
You being in front of me means a lot to you .
And I guess if we were both going to a mutually agreed - upon destination , you crossing the finish line ahead of me might matter .
But we are n’t — which makes you look shallower than the bird bath in my back yard .
I learned the two - second rule on following other cars .
I ’m following the guy ahead of me , minding my own business , not pushing him .
Then you jumped between us .
You do n’t respect the distance I ’m trying to keep .
You do n’t respect me .
But I forgive and I forget .
Then the next day you ’re back .
You came up behind me and rode me , bumper to bumper , until you were close enough to see who printed my bumper sticker .
And I was supposed to ignore that ?
You take it as a personal affront that I am in the lane ahead of you .
Man , I was here first .
I was here before you .
I saw you .
You only speeded up because I got in front of you .
I got your number , son of a bitch .
You do n’t own the road .
So you wait .
You hang back until I ’m done with it .
Stop pushing me , I bitched when you drove past .
Inside your car , you were busy looking at your watch .
I made faces at you when you sped past me .
I looked mean and angry , as if I had been squinting into the morning sun .
But you did n’t look my way .
You did n’t care about me .
Drinking coffee from your commuter mug was more important .
I thought about it afterwards .
I ’m driving two tons of steel , you ’re driving two tons of steel , and you want to play kiddy games at freeway speeds ?
You do n’t have stopping distance .
Why do n’t you go suck a knife ?
But then —
You ’re the same clown I saw on the surface streets .
You come from behind me , cut around me , jump back into my lane , you cut me off , and I have to slow down or rear - end you , and then you speed up and get my green light and I have to wait until the light turns greens again .
Yeah , I saw you on the surface streets a second time , too .
You come from behind me , cut in front of me , we go about a dozen yards , then you hit the brakes , and make a right turn into a driveway ahead of me , making me hit my brakes , and I ’m cursing you .
After , I feel like I ran four miles .
I have to take deep slow breaths to catch myself .
Listen —
I ’ve always been annoyed that speeders " expect " us to let them speed .
Who says we have to let ’em ?
Why should I care that some clown gets angry because I ’m obeying the laws of the road ?
But then I saw you again .
You like to sit back there like a bandit in the bushes , ready to bushwhack me , ready like an enemy jet aimed at my blind side .
I was in the right lane , and you saw me coming up behind a semi , and you were behind me in the left lane — and you sped up to pass me .
A slow - moving truck was coming down the on - ramp ahead of us — and you sped up to keep me from moving into the left lane .
You saw the same thing ahead of us that I saw .
You saw how slowly that semi coming down the off - ramp a quarter - mile ahead of us was moving .
You saw how he was going to take over the lane in front of me .
But you sped up just fast enough to cut me off .
Yeah , I could n’t believe it !
As soon as I put the turn signal on , you — the guy behind me — you sped up to cut me off and keep me from moving into the passing lane , blocking me from entering your lane , keeping me from moving into the fast lane , forcing me to slow down to match the speed of a slow - moving semi entering the Interstate .
You were talking on your cell phone as you drove past me , too busy flapping your lips with your office or your wife or your client to pay attention to my needs .
But that was n’t all , either .
I guess you ’re too oblivious to me to care about me as you drifted over the yellow line into my lane , but you insist I should be responsive to you .
Now I know who you are and I see you every night at this time .
All you have to do is get home , right ?
Do you really have to get home before me ?
Will the world end if you do n’t get home earlier than everybody in front of you ?
Does everybody in front of you have to move out of your way and get home after you ?
Does nothing in the world work right tonight unless you get home first ?
Who the hell are you ?
You would rather run me off the road rather than let me slow your driving .
Where are you going that is so important ?
Are you bleeding ?
Why do n’t you call for an ambulance ?
Do you need to go pee ?
Is your teeny weenie what makes you drive so fast ?
Why are you so sneaky ?
Do you think you ’re getting away with something ?
When you force me out of what I want to do , you are telling me your life is more important than mine is .
Because there was another time –
I got out of your way — got into the right lane — and then , after you passed me , you got into my lane and slowed down , and then I was stuck behind you .
You know , one day I wrote down your license numbers , thinking I would look you up later and see if you remembered the terrible way you drove on the Interstate .
But the folks at Motor Vehicles would n’t give your home address out .
These days I am so tempted to follow you home , to wherever you are going , fool , where a fool like you lives , and just tell you to your face what an ingrate and a bully and a jackass you are .
I tried following you home .
But then I could n’t , because I realized I would be just like you .
If I match your speed , I ’m as bad a driver as you are .
That ’s how you got away with it last time .
If I do find out where you live , you might want to get someone to start your car for you .
Who are you ?
The Bully .
I confess you do intimidate me when I see you fast approaching me in my rear view mirror .
How fast are you going ?
I wonder .
Are you smart enough , quick enough , to stop in time ?
And my heart starts throbbing and my throat constricts .
Yes .
You intimidate me .
Sometimes my palms are red from gripping the wheel .
But then you come back at me the next day .
I ca n’t believe how quickly you cut in front of me .
You wanted me to hit the brakes .
You have been counting on me being civilized enough not to hit your car .
But you have been pushing the envelope too long .
I drive differently now .
I look inside your vehicle now .
I see who you are .
You ’re always on the phone .
When you cruise past , I want to speed up and rear - end you so hard , you lose control and careen off the road into the ditch .
I do n’t mind you trying to go around me .
I would do the same in your place .
It ’s how you try to intimidate me — even worse — try to kill me — that gets me riled .
I feel shame .
My face shows it .
How come you drive so bad ?
The other night I saw you back there , ten cars back , matching my speed , just sitting there for the last two minutes .
But — I watched — and as soon as I got behind a semi and moved to pass that truck — I looked in the rear view mirror , and you were moving up on me .
I saw you closing the gap between us , closing in on me , galloping up the miles and speeding like the Greyhound bus after midnight .
I saw you speeding up and then you were tailgating me , you rude bastard , so closely I could n’t see your headlights !
You ’re driving me crazy !
If you do n’t kill me first .
So . . .
You do it your way .
So . . .
You do n’t have to follow the same rules as everybody else .
So . . guess how I feel about you .
I want to squeeze your neck like an orange until the juice is gone .
I want you dead .
Why am I so pissed ?
Because I should be looking forward and not fearing what ’s behind me .
Think about this :
Have you ever gotten onto the Interstate , driven for a hundred miles , then woke up ?
You got there — wherever there is — on automatic , you tell yourself .
Did you know the purpose of the Interstate Highway System was to get you from here to there without you having to think too hard ?
You screw it up , jerk - off !
Yeah , that ’s it .
We ’re baby - sitting you — me and the rest of us normal drivers — we are making a collective decision to let you pretend you ’re powerful and cool , that you deserve to get ahead of us , that we will forgive and forget the lunatic way you drive and the criminal way you make us change the way we drive .
We have to baby - sit you .
You sit up there in your captain ’s chair in your SUV , jockeying for position on the freeway , a cigarette in one hand , your cell phone in your other .
You are a fool .
You take too much for granted .
If I slam on the brakes — you ’re dead meat .
Push me and I will push back .
You should never do something that your insurance company will call you an asshole when they hear about it .
But you ca n’t stop being a fool .
I heard once somebody say that there was just one miserable son of a bitch who spends his entire day going from person to person making each person ’s day miserable .
I want to be him for you .
So now I plan on getting back at you .
Want to know what am I going to do ?
I will do what I can to piss you off .
When I see you coming behind me , speeding faster than the Greyhound bus , right when you ’re a couple of car lengths behind me , I will swerve — just a tire or two — over the line and into your lane .
And I will watch you wake up and slow down and hesitate , wondering if I am drunk or having a heart attack .
As you get close behind me , I will suddenly — deliberately — swerve over t he white line — both left tires , and I will startle you .
When you go to pass me , I will start matching speed with you , and then I ’ll start pushing you to go faster , faster , faster , and start sliding over the dotted line , to make you flinch .
When you tailgate me , oh , I will move aside and let you pass .
Then I will speed up and get in the fast lane behind you and tailgate you , just like you did to me .
And I will have my brights on , just like you did to me .
Right in your rear view mirror .
I can see myself getting behind you on the Interstate .
When we get stuck behind other cars in the fast lane , I will flash my headlights once a minute for the entire ten minutes you are stranded in place in front of me , locked into a position you do n’t want .
Move aside , my brights will say , move aside , you son of a bitch .
Ahead you will see a semi passing another semi .
We will all be stuck behind them .
When you speed up and tailgate me — are you going to pass all of us — cars and semis both — on the left ?
That ’s grass out there !
Sometime you are going to end up being behind me doing 75 , stuck behind me , last in line , a half - dozen cars ahead of you , and you self - absorbed son of a bitching leadfoot will be stuck behind me while a semi will be passing another semi ahead of us .
For a minute I will be tempted to stick my arm out of the window and motion you to go around me and the other six cars ahead of me that are blocking us .
Hell , you could do that — you could ride the grassy center strip of the freeway .
If you want to ride the grass in the center of the freeway , you go for it .
I wo n’t stand in your way .
Listen : I will be ahead of you .
You be patient .
You wait .
When you do pass me , you will flip me off with the Finger .
You will think it ’s over then .
What you wo n’t expect —
I will chase after you , get behind you , and start all over .
See , pal , I like playing mind games on the Interstate .
Maybe I know my games will backfire and kill me , but the thrill of screwing you over keeps me alive .
I just want to piss you off .
Monsters always want revenge .
Or they die trying .
When I get that rage inside me going strong , I do n’t care about you .
Afterwards maybe I ’ll say I do n’t know what came over me .
But I will be lying .
I will know what came over me .
You ’ve been driving me crazy !
Tomorrow I ’m bringing my gun .
I will pull out in front of you when you want to pass me .
I will watch you fume in the rear view mirror .
I ’ll bring my slide automatic to show you I mean business .
I ’ll hold it up so you can see it — and I will rack the action .
You get out of your car and come at me , I will kill you .
I swear to god .

One of Britain 's biggest online paedophile inquiries is to be challenged in the court of appeal amid allegations from campaigners that hundreds of men have been wrongly convicted in a mass miscarriage of justice .
For more than two years a small group of experts have claimed that Operation Ore , the police inquiry into thousands of British men , was tainted because the database at the centre of the investigation contained evidence of widespread credit card fraud .
Their allegations will be tested for the first time in the appeal court within weeks , when a judge examines a test case that could expose a huge miscarriage of justice , lawyers say .
The single judge will decide whether the case should go to a full appeal .
Chris Saltrese , the solicitor representing the convicted man , Anthony O'Shea , said : " If his appeal is successful the convictions of others for the same offence will fall too .
We are talking in the hundreds and we say this is a huge miscarriage of justice . "
An estimated 39 men have killed themselves as a result of being arrested and prosecuted during the Ore inquiry , and the details of every individual who was convicted or cautioned have been placed on the sex offenders register .
Senior officers in Ceop , the child exploitation and online protection unit , who co-ordinated the inquiry , have been anticipating the test case for some time .
They are adamant that Ore was an extremely successful operation , which led to more than 2,600 British men who downloaded images of child abuse , or attempted to , being brought to justice .
The vast majority of them pleaded guilty .
Operation
Ore began in 2001 after the conviction in America of a couple behind Landslide Inc , an online trading company that provided access to adult pornography and child abuse images .
US investigators passed the names of 7,100 Britons on the Landslide database to the national criminal intelligence service , a forerunner of Ceop .
The last prosecutions in Ore took place earlier this year .
O'Shea 's case is one of an estimated 200 or more involving men who were convicted of incitement to distribute indecent images of children .
A father of two , he was jailed for five months in 2005 for two counts of incitement to distribute indecent photographs of children and three of attempted incitement to distribute indecent images .
A lesser charge than possession , incitement was used in those cases where someone 's details were on the Landslide database but there were no images found on the suspect 's computer or in his home .
O'Shea 's home was raided in 2002 but no images were found .
Saltrese said his case was that he accessed adult pornography but that his legal team would produce evidence that his credit card had been fraudulently used to access a paedophile site within Landslide .
At the time the card was used O'Shea was at a festival in the south - west of England , Saltrese said .
Ceop says its figures suggest that 161 individuals were convicted of incitement , with 68 % pleading guilty .
But Saltrese , who represents dozens of those convicted , believes the figure could be much higher .
A separate campaign group says that it is dealing with the cases of more than 80 men .
" I have clients who have lost everything : their jobs , their homes , their marriages , their children and their health , " Saltrese said .
He and his experts have been able to get a copy of the Landslide database – which was never disclosed in full to the defence teams in Ore cases .
" It is absolutely riddled with fraud , " he said .
" We are not just talking about isolated incidents here .
In some cases clients did make a complaint to their credit card companies that they had been the victims of fraud , in others they did n't , but that is kind of by the by – even if they had n't made a complaint we say the evidence against them is unreliable . "
But other experts who worked closely with the police during the Ore inquiry and with defence teams strongly dispute the case put by Saltrese and his team .
Professor Peter Sommer , a leading expert in computer crime , said : " There were very high levels of correlation between people having subscribed to that website and people being found in possession with child abuse images .
" In the incitement cases they did not just use the details on the database as a reason to prosecute .
They went to the individual 's bank to confirm that transactions had taken place , they checked whether the individual had ever complained that his card had been used fraudulently .
They did not charge everyone they investigated . "
He said that although the defence teams were not allowed access to the whole database , experts had been given access to parts of it .
" I am not saying there may not be individual cases where the convictions might be unsafe but to say there was widespread fraud and a widespread miscarriage of justice does not to my mind stand up . "
Brian Underhill , the computer expert who travelled to America to copy the Landslide database for the police as part of the Ore inquiry , told the Guardian : " It 's been two years since the allegation of widespread credit card fraud was put forward and I have yet to see a fragment of tangible evidence to support the allegation . "
Ceop said that Operation Ore had involved an unprecedented number of cases , each of which was tested several times to ensure the validity of the intelligence and evidence before a prosecution was brought .
It said in a statement : " No evidence of widespread or endemic fraud has ever been found in relation to cases pursued to prosecution as part of Operation Ore .
The veracity of any evidence to contradict this should be tested in the criminal justice environment .
" To the best of our knowledge all incitement cases included additional evidence to support the prosecution beyond simple , single credit card details .
" At the time of Operation Ore , individuals were suspected of subscribing to a website offering child abuse images .
Those who had would have provided personal data to a registration page ... name , postal address , email address , a personal password and their credit card details ...
The IP address of the subscriber may have been captured by the system .
" We would have expected that once a defendant had raised the possibility of being a victim of credit card fraud , inquiries would be undertaken in order to ascertain if that was correct . "
The opposition gained another rallying point on Friday with the news of the death of another protester , this one with links to Iran ’s political elite .
Mohsen Ruholamini  whose father , Abdolhussen Ruholamini , is an adviser to another presidential candidate , Mohsen Rezai  died in custody at Evin prison after being arrested during demonstrations on July 9 , opposition Web sites said , citing relatives .
Image Conservatives were opposed to Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
Credit ... Abedin Taherkenareh / E.P.A .
Mr. Ruholamini ’s family had been told that he would be returning home , the Web sites reported .
It was not clear how he died .
The elder Mr. Ruholamini is a chemistry professor and the head of Iran ’s Pasteur Institute .
Mr. Rezai , a conservative and a strong critic of Mr. Ahmadinejad , is a former head of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
The news of Mr. Ruholamini ’s death is likely to stoke anger further among the opposition , whose leaders say the number killed in protests since the election is much higher than 20 , the figure the government provided .
The withdrawal of Mr. Mashaei ends a chapter that surprised and baffled many Iranians .
A former culture minister whose daughter is married to Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s son , Mr. Mashaei had reportedly said the Iranian people were friends with all other peoples , including Israelis .
After a storm of criticism from conservatives , he disavowed his comments , saying he had meant only that Iranians sympathized with those living under the Zionist yoke .
Still , promoting him to presidential deputy was a risky move , especially considering that Mr. Mashaei had made other gestures that angered conservatives , including attending a ceremony in Turkey in 2007 where women performed a traditional dance .
“ Maybe Ahmadinejad was trying to bolster his position vis - à - vis these political sharks ” in the conservative establishment , who have long been critical of him , said Mehrzad Boroujerdi , an Iran expert and associate professor at Syracuse University .
In any event , Professor Boroujerdi added , the fierce conservative reaction suggests that “ after the election crisis , not only reformists but hard - liners are smelling blood in the water and looking for concessions from Ahmadinejad . ”
Editor 's note :
This is part one of a two - part series .
Jim Fontella was based at Camp Lejeune in 1966 and 1967 .
He was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998 .
TAMPA , Florida ( CNN ) --
The sick men are Marines , or sons of Marines .
All 20 of them were based at or lived at Camp Lejeune , the U.S. Marine Corps ' training base in North Carolina , between the 1960s and the 1980s .
They all have had breast cancer , a disease that strikes fewer than 2,000 men in the United States a year , compared with about 200,000 women .
Each has had part of his chest removed as part of his treatment , along with chemotherapy , radiation or both .
And they blame their time at Camp Lejeune , where government records show drinking water was contaminated with high levels of toxic chemicals for three decades , for their illnesses .
" We come from all walks of life , " said Mike Partain , the son and grandson of Marines , who was born on the base 40 years ago .
" And some of us have college degrees , some of us have blue - collar jobs .
We are all over the country .
And what is our commonality ?
Our commonality is that we all at some point in our lives drank the water at Camp Lejeune .
Go figure . "
Starting in 1980 , tests showed drinking water at Camp Lejeune had been " highly contaminated " with solvents .
Several wells that supplied water to the base were found to have been contaminated in 1984 and 1985 , and were promptly taken out of service after the pollutants were found , the Marine Corps told CNN .
Among the chemicals later identified in the drinking water were trichloroethylene , a degreaser ; benzene ; and the dry cleaning solvent perchloroethylene .
Two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses , according to the Marine Corps .
But the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease do n't buy it .
Poisoned patriots ?
CNN's Special Investigations
Unit looks into the startling allegations of Marines and their sons .

" That 's literally unheard of to have 20 men come from the same place , walking on the same dirt , drinking the same water , " said Jim Fontella , who was based at the camp in 1966 and 1967 .
" I mean , there has to be a link there somehow .
And they 're saying that it could n't happen . "
Fontella , a Detroit native who fought in Vietnam , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998 .
When it returned after surgery , spreading to his spine and back , he " kind of manned up to it after a while and expected to die . "
" Once you have metastasis in the bone , it 's basically just a matter of time before you die , you know , " he told CNN .
" Luckily , I have already passed my due date by five years .
I outlived that death sentence I got . "
Fontella is one of seven male breast cancer survivors who spent time at Camp Lejeune who spoke to CNN .
Fontella said that at the time of his diagnosis , he did n't know men could get breast cancer .
Peter Devereaux , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 , was based at Camp Lejeune in 1981 and 1982 .
The cancer spread to his spine , ribs and hips .
" The difference with metastatic breast cancer means now there 's no cure .
So the average life expectancy is two to three years , " Devereaux told CNN .
" Being a man , I try to take care of my wife and my daughter , " he said , his voice catching .
" Now that I 'm considered disabled because I can no longer work and use my arms , you 're having challenges . "
Dr. John Kiluk , a breast cancer surgeon at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa , Florida , said he 's startled by the common threads among the group .
" The average breast cancer patient for males is about 70 years old , " Kiluk said .
" So when you have gentlemen in their 30s stepping forward , without a family history of breast cancer , that is alarming .
And the question is , why ?
Why is this happening ? "
As many as 500,000 people may have been exposed to the contaminated water over a period of 30 years , the Marine Corps said .
Partain , Fontella , Devereaux and others CNN interviewed are all members of " The Few , The Proud , The Forgotten , " which was set up to organize people who believe they have been affected by the contamination .
But in a written response to questions raised by the men , the Marine Corps told CNN that two studies have examined whether contaminated water led to illnesses among base personnel or their families .
" To date , these studies have not identified a link between exposure to the historically impacted water at Camp Lejeune and adverse health effects , " the service said .
In addition , it said a 2004 review by the Marine Corps found the service followed existing water quality regulations .
And investigations by the Bush administration 's Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency found no criminal conduct by Marine Corps officials and no violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act .
But Tyler Amon , an EPA investigator , told a House committee in 2007 that some employees interviewed during the criminal investigation appeared to have been coached and were not forthcoming with details .
The Justice Department decided against filing charges based on his concern , however .
Parts of Camp Lejeune have been included on the EPA 's Superfund list of contaminated sites .
Benzene , one of the chemicals found in the water there , is classified as a known human carcinogen by the federal government , while the other two are listed as potential causes of cancer .
Frank Bove , an epidemiologist with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry , said the level of contamination in one sample taken at Camp Lejeune was " the highest I 've ever seen in a public water system in this country . "
But , he added , " Whether exposures were long enough and high enough at Camp Lejeune to cause disease -- that 's the question . "
Researchers need to know more about where the men lived on the base , what kind of work they did , their medical histories and other details before reaching a conclusion , Bove said .
" We 're not sure there 's one common cause across all these cases , " he said .
" There may be several different causes . "
The Marines Corps said it has worked with environmental and health agencies " from the beginning " to determine whether the contamination resulted in any illness , and " this collaboration continues to the present day . "
But so far , " collaboration " does not involve medical care for the stricken men , who say they are now facing a bureaucratic Catch - 22 : The Marine Corps sends them to the Department of Veterans Affairs , which says it can't treat the men for a condition that has n't been shown to have been " service - related . "
" How could they do this to me after I served the country faithfully ? " retired Marine Rick Kelly told CNN .
" How could they do this to my fellow Marines ? "

Yesterday in the season premiere of Psych , Shawn expressed what the writers were thinking , essentially that The Mentalist is a carbon copy of Psych .
Steve Franks , the Psych showrunner offered this analogy " When you go to the cereal aisle in a grocery store , and you see Fruit Loops there .
If you look down on the bottom , there 's something that looks just like Fruit Loops , and it's in a different bag , and it 's called Fruity Loop - Os . "
I have watched every episode of both shows and enjoy both of them , so I think I can provide an objective look at the show unlike the Psych writers who seem to have sour grapes about the commercial success of The Mentalist .
The premise of The Mentalist is a former fake - psychic turned police consultant .
The premise of Psych is a fake - psych police consultant .
That may be similar , but both come from the idea that if someone is extra-perceptive , he / she can glean information that others can't , giving the impression of psychic abilities .
Since Jane in The Mentalist does n't claim to be a psychic anymore , everyone knows he is just meticulous in examining things a trait in regular detectives of other procedurals .
Both Shawn Spencer ( Psych ) and Patrick Jane ( The Mentalist ) say funny things , and have problems with authority .
The similarities between the shows stop there .
Psych is almost purely a comedy .
There are no laugh tracks , but a huge part of the show is dedicated to eliciting laughs .
The writing is quick and witty with references to all sorts of things .
On the other hand , The Mentalist at times delves into heavy drama though it can be lighthearted at other times .
Patrick Jane has a past filled with anguish and he has a lot of issues because of it .
Shawn is a classic slacker who fooled around his whole life .
Psych 's attempts at drama are in my opinion fairly weak and I do n't know how they can improve that considering how over the top Shawn is .
Both operate with real members of law enforcement , but often , Shawn will do things on his own ignoring Lassiter or Juliet .
They have never managed to stop him from doing something .
In The Mentalist , Lisbon can put her foot down on Jane and stop him .
Psych is dedicated solely to Shawn and Gus , but The Mentalist has a multitude of other characters to explore and a serial killer they are tracking .
Steve Franks got it wrong comparing them as Fruit Loops to Fruity Loop - Os .

In a move designed to give the government unprecedented control over what users will and will not be able to see on the Internet , the Chinese government reportedly wants all computers sold in China after July 2009 to come pre-installed software that automatically censors the Internet .
That 's not surprising when you consider the fact that China recently ranked number one as the most complete Electronic Police State in the world .

During the twentieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre this past week , China reportedly blocked access to websites like Twitter , Flickr and Hotmail in their attempts to quell dissent and to make sure that young people in China remain behind the government .

China Views Internet as Growing Threat
The order to install blocking software comes under a directive of China 's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology .
The Chinese government views the Internet as a tool of protest and worries that online debate forums in the country could be stirring trouble .
Green Dam , the program that will soon be required on China 's home computers , is designed primarily to stop access to adult sites .
A member of Jinhui Computer System Engineering company said that every PC will be shipped with the software before it is sold to customers effective July 1 .
The company is deceptively marketing the software as good news for users who should not uninstall it .
A second program called Youth Escort will be included to filter out rude or subversive words .

Once installed , the two programs can allegedly transmit personal information and make it difficult for users to tell what access is being denied .
Under the terms of the new rules , manufacturers have the option of shipping Green Dam on a separate disc but they have to report how many units have been sold together with Green Dam .

On Saturday , the $ 1.15 billion Cowboys Stadium in Arlington , Texas showed a Windows error message on one of its screens .
First the screen went blank , then there was some ASCII text shown , and finally the screen stated that " Windows did not shut down successfully . "
Such a message can be displayed if one holds down the power button to hard - restart a Windows PC , so the message alone does n't mean there was a crash , but viewers at the stadium insist there was gibberish on the screen just before the computer showed the message .
The message showed up during the NCAA season opener for Oklahoma and Brigham Young University .
No. 20 BYU upset the third - ranked Sooners 20 - 13 in Jerry Jones ' brand - new monument to Dallas Cowboys football and Texas excess .
One of the highlights of Cowboys Stadium is the enormous HD display hung above the field .
Along with the performance of the Sooners offense , the " Windows did not shut down successfully " message was one of the lowlights of the night .
This is n't the first time that Microsoft has suffered such an embarrassment , and it likely wo n't be the last .
Too bad we do n't know what iteration of Windows the PC was running , as we could probably lay the blame on an outdated version .

Afghanistan ’s gunpoint election
20 August 2009
By any measure , today ’s presidential election in Afghanistan is a travesty .
The poll takes place under conditions of a continuing foreign military occupation to prop up a puppet government that is notorious for its human rights abuses , corruption and failure to provide for the basic needs of the vast majority of the population .
The incumbent president and leading contender , Hamid Karzai , who was installed in office in 2002 by the US , is widely despised by the Afghan people .
Excluded from the field of major candidates is anyone who opposes the US - NATO occupation , despite the fact that it is opposed by a large majority of the population , particularly in the southern Pashtun region , where Taliban influence is strong .
Karzai ’s leading rival and former foreign minister , Abdullah Abdullah , was previously a spokesman for the Northern Alliance militias that helped the US topple the Taliban .
Despite the boosting of US and NATO troop numbers , the Taliban and its allies hold sway over large areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan and are calling for an election boycott .
In at least 60 percent of the country , polling stations are at risk of attack .
Some 440 out of 7,000 stations will not be opened at all as they can not be protected .
Around 100,000 foreign troops and 180,000 Afghan government army and police personnel are being deployed to secure the vote .
The Taliban and other insurgent groups , such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ’s Hezb - e - Islami movement , are intensifying their efforts to drive US and NATO troops from the country and overthrow the pro-US government .
All of the leading presidential candidates are promising peace talks and even power - sharing with the insurgents , but , with their support growing , the Taliban and Hekmatyar have stated that they will not enter into talks under conditions of foreign occupation .
To prove their reach , the insurgents have carried out high - profile attacks over the past week against the nerve centres of the occupation .
The NATO headquarters and the nearby US embassy in Kabul were targeted by a massive vehicle bomb on August 15 .
On Tuesday , Taliban fighters managed to position mortars within range and fire shells into the grounds of the heavily guarded presidential palace in the heart of the capital .
Numerous other attacks on US and foreign troops , Afghan security forces , election candidates and government officials have taken place this month , including in the northern provinces of the country where the Taliban insurgency was once believed to have no presence .
The US / NATO death toll for August has already reached 50 , following on from the war - high of 75 fatalities in July .
Each month , at least 150 government troops and police are also being killed , though official figures are rarely released .
The vote is expected to be very low in the south and east .
An Afghan judge in Uruzgan province told McClatchy News : “ Only 10 to 20 percent of the people will be able to vote .
When 80 percent of the people ca n’t vote , how can this be a transparent election ? ”
While the US will undoubtedly blame Taliban violence , eight years of indiscriminate air attacks , ground assaults and thousands of arbitrary detentions have generated deep - seated hostility to the occupation and its Afghan collaborators .
The US invasion has essentially placed back in power the Northern Alliance — the grouping of ethnic - based warlords who were overthrown by the Taliban in 1996 .
The only new faces are a collection of grasping émigré businessmen who have returned from the US and Europe to profiteer from multibillion - dollar “ reconstruction ” and “ aid ” projects .
In the central and northern provinces , the Tajik , Uzbek and Hazari warlords will largely dictate the outcome .
Karzai is expected to be the main beneficiary .
His two vice - presidential candidates and other supporters are prominent Northern Alliance members , and he is backed by a number of anti-Taliban Pashtun powerbrokers in the south — including his brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , who is accused of organising much of the opium and heroin trade out of Kandahar province .
Even the Obama administration has had to admit that the result will be tarnished by wholesale ballot - rigging , primarily by electoral officials appointed by Karzai .
It is believed that there at least 3 million duplicate or fraudulent voter registration cards in circulation , out of a total of 17 million .
The BBC revealed this week that its undercover journalists had no difficulty arranging to buy 1,000 cards — for $ 10 each — on the streets of Kabul .
If Karzai does not win outright , he will be forced into a run-off with the second highest vote - getter .
The most recent opinion poll conducted by the US International Republican Institute gave Karzai 44 percent against 26 percent for his closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah .
Two other prominent candidates , Ashraf Ghani and Ramazan Bashardost , each polled less than 10 percent .
The fraudulent character of the poll is underscored by the Obama administration ’s overt meddling .
Despite having loyally served the US - led occupation , Karzai has faced increasing criticism in the US over his administration ’s corruption and lack of public support .
Karzai ’s own limited criticisms of air strikes have rankled the US military .
Despite Washington ’s claim to neutrality , US ambassador Karl Eikenberry appeared publicly earlier this year alongside two of Karzai ’s leading rivals .
The White House also signaled its displeasure towards Karzai by publicly condemning the return to Afghanistan last Saturday of ethnic Uzbek strongman Abdul Rashid Dostum — one of the brutal warlords in the pre-Taliban period and a key US ally during the 2001 invasion .
Last year , Dostum was pressured to go into voluntary exile in Turkey after he murdered a political opponent .
Having returned at Karzai ’s invitation , Dostum immediately called for a vote for the incumbent president .
The US embassy issued a hypocritical statement declaring that Dostum faced “ questions of his culpability for massive human rights violations . ”
The charge referred not to his war crimes in the 1990s , but to the mass killing of Taliban prisoners captured by his Northern Alliance fighters in Kunduz in 2001 .
No mention was made of the involvement of CIA operatives and US Special Forces in a similar massacre at Mazar - i- Sharif .
( See : “ A cover - up of US massacre at Mazar - i - Sharif ” )
The US and its allies appear to be aiming at preventing Karzai from winning outright in the first round .
The British ambassador in Afghanistan , Mark Sedwell , told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday night that a second round of voting would help “ convince people the process was real . ”
Even if Karzai does win the poll , his position is hardly secure .
David Kilcullen , a leading advisor to US military commanders , described Karzai in the harshest language earlier this month and ominously compared him with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem , whom the Kennedy administration had assassinated in 1963 .
Washington is quietly pushing a plan to strip the president of many of his powers by installing an unelected “ chief executive officer ” to take over the day - to - day operations of the Afghan government .
Among the possible candidates is Ashraf Ghani , who has worked for the foreign policy wing of the Brookings Institute , the World Bank and the United Nations .
Once the election is out of the way , the Obama administration and the Pentagon will push ahead with plans for a major escalation of the war .
Tens of thousands of additional US troops have been put in place , and US commanders are preparing to call for many more to be sent to kill and be killed in this brutal neo-colonial war .

MGM president Louis F. Polk was so worried about the controversy surrounding the film , particularly the threat of an X rating , that he invoked the studio's right to the final cut and ordered Antonioni to eliminate anything that might be potentially controversial .
Thus , the riots , the love-ins , and numerous other scenes and fragments of scenes were removed , leaving only seventy minutes .
The film was deemed unreleasable and written off as a loss but was saved when Polk was replaced by James T. Aubrey , who thought highly of the film and restored ( nearly ) all of the cut scenes .

A few weeks ago , the New York Times ’ Bill Carter and Brian Stelter wrote a piece looking at the possible implications of NBC ’s scheduling Jay Leno at 10 p.m. in the fall .
One of the lines in the story that generated some buzz was this :
NBC ’s move has also caused planning battles inside ABC , whose 10 p.m. hours have been a string of disappointments in recent years .
Although ABC will again fill 10 p.m. with new dramas this fall including “ Eastwick ” and “ The Forgotten , ” one ABC employee acknowledged that “ Nightline , ” the late - night ABC News show , has been talked about as a future 10 p.m. possibility .
I ’m not sure I take the possibility that seriously now .
I mean , I certainly believe the piece that the move has been talked about .
Lots of things get talked about .
And it certainly would be an ironic reversal of fortune for a news show that , a few years ago , ABC considered killing to get David Letterman .
But I suspect that any reactions to NBCs Leno move will be in wait - and - see mode for quite a while — and even then , I ’m skeptical that ABC would go with a news show as its alternative .
Still the talk has stayed sufficiently alive that ABC News ’ David Westin knocked down the buzz on last weekend ’s Reliable Sources .
So it ’s worth asking : would the move be a good idea ?
The advantages would , of course , be similar to those with Jay Leno : it would be far cheaper than airing five dramas a night .
A news program would be counterprogramming not just to CBS ’ dramas ( and cable ’s ) but also to Jay .
( Though CBS might be the big winner there . )
But another reason to try Nightline — or a show like it — is that it could solve the problem both of how to make primetime cheaper and what to do with the flagging evening newscasts .
I and plenty of other critics have speculated in the past that , with 6:30 news audiences aging and shrinking , we might eventually see a primetime newscast instead .
Putting a show like Nightline in primetime could just be a backdoor answer to that issue .
The audiences for evening newscasts continue to shrink — in recent weeks , the combined three drew around 20 million viewers , compared with 25 or 30 million a decade ago or less .
Now , they will argue , rightly , that that ’s much more than the cable channels draw at any particular half hour ( though that argument ignores the fact that cable news is not on only a half hour a day ) .
But the trendline for the newscasts is undeniable .
If you were to try to do news in primetime instead , would it make sense to put the equivalent of today ’s 6:30 newscasts there ?
Granted , those shows have moved away from simply trying to provide all the day ’s headlines , but that still informs much of what they do , and it ’s an increasingly irrelevant service in the Internet and cable era .
If you were to try to rethink news for primetime , why not do away with the headlines , and have each night ’s newscast go in depth on a few issues , or just one ?
Why not have it be more like …
Nightline ?
A primetime news show like that would not have to arrive as a replacement for the evening news .
But someday , if one of the networks decided to give up the 6:30 news , it could replace it by default .
( The stars are not aligned for that right now , because the network with the weakest evening - news ratings , CBS , has far and away the strongest 10 p.m. drama ratings . )
I ’m still not about to lay money on Nightline making it to primetime , ever .
But the more I think about it , the more I suspect that , if we ever see the vaunted primetime network newscast — perhaps as a replacement for the evening news — it would make sense for it to look less like the nightly news and more like Nightline .
Of course , there ’s also the possibility it could look more like To Catch a Predator .
Or Larry King Live .
Or The Biggest Loser .
Maybe we should try to get Nightline at 10 p.m. while we still have a chance .
MONTREAL -
The small arena where Vancouver netminder Roberto Luongo first strapped on his goalie pads now bears his name .
The Canucks ' team captain was on hand Saturday in the east - end Montreal borough of St - Leonard for the inauguration ceremony and to sign autographs for hundreds of fans who lined up to meet the goaltender .
It was a far cry from a fateful Sunday in the early 1990s when an 11 - year - old forward first skated into the net .
Lina Luongo never wanted her son there .
She thought her young Roberto , a poor skater , should sharpen his skills on the ice .
" It made me sad because he loved hockey and could n't skate , " she recalled .
But that day the team goalie never showed and Luongo begged his mother to be allowed in nets .
" I thought : ' What 's one day going to do ? " ' she said .
" That day he had a shutout .
In the end you can't stop destiny .
It was just meant to happen and it did . "
Luongo fondly remembers his early years at the rink _ as a forward .
" Believe it or not I scored a lot of goals in this arena , " he said .
" Now my job is to stop them . "
Luongo's not the only NHL goalie who spent his formative years in the predominantly Italian neighbourhood .
New Jersey Devils ' netminder Martin Brodeur lived a few blocks from the Luongo household and also made his way through St - Leonard 's minor leagues .
In fact , a stone 's throw from the newly - christened Roberto - Luongo Arena stands the community 's second rink : the Martin - Brodeur Arena , renamed in his honour in 2000 .
It 's a demonstration of the fierce pride the area holds for the two elite netminders who grew up close to each other and maintain ties to their old neighbourhood .
" We can say to everybody that we have the two best goalies in the league , " said goalie instructor Angelo Lazzara , who 's worked with Luongo .
" It means a lot to our community .
Italians are known for their soccer and not much for hockey . "
Tony Canuto , who coached Luongo in 1991 and 1992 , says the two arenas set an example for local athletes .
" It 's a way of telling them someone from St - Leonard can make it , " he said .
The Devils ' star , 37 , has Olympic gold for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City and led his team to three Stanley Cup championships in his 15 - year tenure , but Luongo , seven years his junior , says he 's never felt like he lived in his shadow .
" Marty 's accomplished a lot in his career and won some Stanley Cups , so I got a little ways to go , " he said .
Luongo rose through Quebec 's minor leagues before a first round draft to the New York Islanders in 1997 , later playing for the Florida Panthers for six seasons before being traded to the Canucks in 2006 .
Both Luongo and Brodeur are front - runners for the top goalie job on Canada 's Olympic team .
The similarities do n't end with where they 're from .
The pair both played as forwards before switching to goalie , and both made their NHL debuts against the Boston Bruins , Brodeur in 1991 and Luongo in 1999 .
" Martin Brodeur has achieved so many things for such a long time , " said Lina Luongo .
" My son ca n't even compare to his achievements yet . "
We ’ve been using Heroku as a staging environment for our latest project .
One constraint is a read - only filesystem .
The most apparent effect of this is we cannot allow users to upload files to the filesystem .
Fine .
Paperclip has an S3 storage option .
Webrat has a very nice existing convention for interacting with file fields :
When / ^I attach the file at " ( [ ^\ " ] * ) " to " ( [ ^\ " ] * ) " $ / do |path , field| attach_file ( field , path ) end
Unfortunately , if we have an S3 - backed model like this …
has_attached_file :logo , : path => " : attachment/:id/:style.:extension " , : storage => :s3 , :s3_credentials => { :access_key_id => ENV [ ' S3_KEY ' ] , :secret_access_key => ENV [ ' S3_SECRET ' ] } , : bucket => ENV [ ' S3 _BUCKET ' ]
… then we ’re going to be doing a RESTful PUT to S3 during each test run .
Incidentally , those ENV variables are Heroku ’s config vars .
The idea is that you keep that configuration separated from your source control .
You could argue that these PUTs to S3 are a good thing because your Cucumber feature will represent total integration .
While that ’s true , I ’d rather not pay bandwidth costs and I ’m comfortable as long as the correct interface to S3 was called .
So what we ’ve landed on is something like this :
Given I am on the new band page
When I attach a " demo_tape " " mp3 " file to a " band " on S3 And I press " Upload demo tape " Then I should see " Band was successfully created "
The only non-standard Webrat step is our new S3 step .
Let ’s take a look at it :
# features / step_definitions/paperclip_steps.rb
When / ^I attach an ? " ( [ ^\ " ] * ) " " ( [ ^\ " ] * ) " file to an ? " ( [ ^\ " ] * ) " on S3 $ / do | attachment , extension , model | stub_paperclip_s3 ( model , attachment , extension ) attach_file attachment , " features/support/paperclip / #{model.gsub ( " " , " _ " ).underscore}/#{attachment}.#{extension} "
end
The stub_paperclip_s3 method is coming from a custom Shoulda Macro :
# test/shoulda_macros/paperclip.rb module Paperclip module Shoulda def stub_paperclip_s3 ( model , attachment , extension ) definition = model .
gsub ( " " , " _ " ) . classify .
constantize .
attachment_definitions [ attachment .
to_sym ] path = " http://s3.amazonaws.com/:id/
#{ definition [ : path ] } " path .
gsub ! ( /:( [ ^\/\. ]+ ) / ) do | match | " ( [ ^ \/\. ]+ ) " end FakeWeb .
register_uri ( : put , Regexp .
new ( path ) , : body => " OK " ) end def paperclip_fixture ( model , attachment , extension ) stub_paperclip_s3 ( model , attachment , extension ) base_path = File . join ( File . dirname ( __FILE__ ) , " .. " , " .. " , " features " , " support " , " paperclip " )
File .
new ( File . join ( base_path , model , " #{ attachment } .
#{ extension } " ) ) end end end class ActionController : : Integration : : Session include Paperclip :: Shoulda end class Factory include Paperclip :: Shoulda end
We ’re using the Fakeweb gem like we normally use mocking : expect that something happened , and stop it from actually happening .
We ’re also leaning on conventions similar to the actor directory convention we ’re also trying .
In this case , we ’re expecting our features directory to look like this :
features / support / paperclip/band/demo_tape.mp3 features/support/paperclip/band/demo_tape.aac features/support/paperclip/band/demo_tape.ogg features/support/paperclip/band/demo_tape.wav features/support/paperclip/user/avatar.png features/support/paperclip/user/avatar.jpg features/support/paperclip/user/avatar.gif
This allows us to test the expected and unexpected formats by changing this line :
When I attach a " demo_tape " " mp3 " file to a " band " on S3
The reason the stub_paperclip_s3 and paperclip_fixture methods are set up as a custom shoulda macro is so that you can use them in your factory code :
Factory .
define :band_with_demo_tape , : parent => : band do | band | band .
demo_tape { band .
paperclip_fixture ( " band " , " demo_tape " , " png " ) } end
It ’s been quite useful so far for us .
How are you testing Paperclip uploads to S3 ?
Do you see any way to improve this step definition or the convention ?

One of the easiest ways to save money is to stop buying food to throw away .
Food wastage is a huge issue in the US and the UK .
Every year shocking statistics are reported which cause a small buzz and are reported online and in print .
Mountains of perfectly edible food , a lot of it still unopened and within its use - by date , choke landfill sites .
Rivers and lakes of nourishing liquids flow down the drains where they may serve as a nutrient supply to the bacteria and fungii that must thrive down there .
Meanwhile even in these relatively rich and ‘ civilised ’ countries , thousands of children go to bed with empty bellies night after night .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , Americans throw away almost 96 billion pounds of food every year – that is almost a quarter of all the food prepared !
It costs the nation $ 1 billion annually just to dispose of it .
In the UK , the statistics look even worse .
Although the mountain of food wasted may be smaller – 6.7 million tonnes – this represents a third of food bought in the UK and costs each family an average of GBP420 per year .
However , there is more than the family bank balance at stake .
Wasted food equals wasted water
Massive amounts of water are needed to produce the food we eat – or throw away .
According to the US Geological Survey Science for Schools project it takes 120 gallons of water to produce one egg and 150 gallons of water to produce one loaf of bread .
Wasted food equals wasted energy
By the same token , consider the energy required to produce any standard food item ; milk , for example .
Cows need fed , watered and looked after .
They have to be milked and the milk has to be cooled and processed , packed and transported to the supermarket .
There it has to be unpacked and stored in the chilled section .
The food the cows ate , the water that was given to them to drink , the electricity required to run the milking machines and the pasteurization process , the petrol required to run the truck and the energy required to light the supermarket and run the chilled section – all of these resources are wasted when that litre of milk is left to turn sour and is thrown away .
Wasted food equals wasted environment
The vast majority of the food that is thrown away ends up landfill .
While the popular opinion may be that as it is biodegradable , food that is disposed of in landfill is not harmful in fact the opposite is true .
While it is biodegrading , food wastage is emitting methane – a major source of greenhouse gas .
In the US , according to the Environmental Protection Agency , less than 2 % of food wastage does not end up in landfill while in the UK , the pressure group , Love Food Hate Waste , advise that if we stopped wasting the food we buy , it would have the same impact on the environment as taking 20 % of cars of the road .
Main Cause of Food Waste
Peelings , bones and other inedibles make up a very small percentage of the weight of thrown away food .
The majority of it is meat , fish , vegetables , fruit , bread , baked goods , rice and pasta that has either gone past its use - by date or has been cooked and not eaten .
Stop Wasting Food
Here are some things you can do to cut down on the amount of wasted food in your household :
• Plan meals weekly
Make a meal plan that takes into account possible leftovers from the day before .
For example peelings and leftover meat and vegetables from Sunday ’s roast chicken and vegetables can all be used to make a hearty stock on Monday
• Love your leftovers
Before you scrape leftovers into the bin , take a second look at the serving bowls .
Leftover pasta is great for adding substance to soups and many vegetables are delicious mashed with a dab of butter .
• Reduce portions
As good for your wallet as it is for your waistline , if your family are consistently leaving a lot on their plates , then cut down on the amount you are serving them .
• Do n’t buy into bulk buy
Two - for - one deals at the supermarket are only a good deal , if there is enough time left before the use - by date expires for you to reasonably be expected to use the food .
Otherwise by all means buy in bulk , but split the food and the costs with a neighbour .
• Use it or lose it
Supermarkets have that crafty way of putting all the items that are approaching the use - by date right out in front .
Unless you know you are using something within a day or so , dig around at the back of the chill cabinet for those packets with the most distant use - by dates .
• Cupboard control
Unless you frequently check what you have in store , it is possible that by the time you get round to opening that package of pasta on the top shelf it is out of date by a couple of months .
Know what you have on hand and plan your meals accordingly .
By focusing on the problem and involving your children in the process , it is not difficult to reduce your food wastage as a family .
It requires a bit of an attitude adjustment to no longer see leftovers as scraps perhaps , but it is only in recent years that we have had the luxury of doing so .
In past generations , it would have been unthinkable to dispose of any edible food as readily as we do now .
Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - N.C. ) on Wednesday called for President Obama 's " czars , " or appointed high - level advisers , to testify before Congress about their " authority and responsibilities " in the executive branch .
The president 's " czars " have become a point of controversy among his opponents because they do not have to be confirmed by the Senate as cabinet - level officials do .
McHenry wrote to committee chairman Edolphus Towns ( D - N.Y. ) and ranking member Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) asking the appointed officials to testify .
" If the czars have high - level , decision - making authority as their titles would indicate , then it is my concern that their appointment without Senate approval represents a circumvention of our Constitutionally - mandated confirmation process , " McHenry , who is a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said in his letter .
Czars were in the spotlight again after " green jobs " czar Van Jones ' resigned this weekend .
It was revealed that Jones made harsh comments about Republicans and signed a " truther " petition alleging that the government played a role in the 9/11 attacks .
" His ability to slip into a position of power without due Congressional diligence only further underscores the necessity for a confirmation process , " the third - term Republican said of Jones .
However , the actual number of czars in the administration is a disputed matter .
McHenry requests that all of President Obama 's 44 czars testify before Congress .
But other reports put the number at around 30 .
The North Carolina Republican did not provide a list of the 44 czars he wants to testify .
Mr Karroubi urged Tehran to review his evidence in " a calm atmosphere "
One of Iran 's defeated opposition presidential candidates has said some protesters held after June 's disputed poll were tortured to death in prison .
The claim by Mehdi Karroubi comes days after he said a number of prisoners , both male and female , had been raped .
Officials deny the rape claims , but admit that abuses have taken place .
The BBC's Jon Leyne says the opposition is using the issue to keep up political pressure without directly questioning Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's poll victory .
In a post on his website on Thursday , Mr Karroubi alleged that a number of detainees had been tortured to death .
" Some young people are beaten to death just for chanting slogans in [ post - election ] protests , " he wrote .
Mr Karroubi called for the formation of an independent committee to review his evidence in " a calm atmosphere " .
On Sunday , the defeated presidential candidate claimed that both male and female opposition protesters had been raped in detention , with some suffering serious injuries .
Mr Karroubi said the people who had told him about the allegations of sexual assault held " sensitive positions " .
The claim was supported by a number of human rights groups but quickly dismissed as " totally baseless " by the speaker of Iran 's parliament , Ali Larijani .
" Based on parliament 's investigations , detainees have not been raped or sexually abused in Iran 's Kahrizak and Evin prisons , " he said .
Mass protests
The condition under which detained protesters have been held has been controversial , with damaging claims forcing authorities to act .
Will Iran 's Basij stay loyal ?
The Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamanei , closed the notorious Kahrizak detention centre saying it had failed to " preserve the detainees ' rights " .
Police officials have admitted that some of those held since June might have been tortured .
Both the Iranian parliament and judiciary have established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government 's response .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne says the issue of prison abuse is both a real concern in itself and has also become a way of criticising the government of President Ahmadinejad without directly challenging the legitimacy of his re-election .
On Tuesday , Iran 's authorities said 4,000 people had been detained during the mass protests that broke out in the wake of the 12 June presidential poll , which the opposition says was rigged .
The number was much higher than previous figures , although the authorities said 3,700 of them had been released within a few days of arrest .
Opposition leaders say 69 protesters died in the post-election violence - more than double the official figure of about 30 fatalities .
Trials criticised Iran is currently trying more than 100 detainees over their alleged involvement in the protests .
The trials - of leading opposition figures , activists , journalists , lawyers , workers at foreign embassies and two people with foreign nationalities - have been criticised by several foreign powers , opposition groups and human rights campaigners .
But authorities insist their legal proceedings are completely legitimate and conform to international standards of justice .
Official election results awarded incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a sweeping victory in the polls .
He is in the process of selecting a cabinet , which will be submitted to parliamentary approval next week .
Foreign media , including the BBC , have been restricted in their coverage of Iran in the wake of the election protests .

White House orders Dems to ‘ punch back ’ as union organizers attack citizens
WASHINGTON — America ’s third largest party Friday called on Democrats to end what appears to be a budding campaign of union violence targeted at citizens who differ with the White House at town hall meetings across the country .
Libertarians oppose not only the White House ’s plans for government - run medicine , but the use of violence to achieve political or social goals .
A Tampa Bay Tribune story and a video posted to the Drudge Report both report physical assaults on dissenting citizens by union organizers brought to meetings by Democrats .
In Tampa , union organizers blocked citizens who differed with the White House from entering a public town hall with Rep. Kathy Castor ( D - FL , ) and allegedly scuffled with some of them .
A video posted to YouTube appears to show union organizers physically attacking citizens who disagreed with the White House .
‘ The Libertarian Party is founded on one principle .
We do not support the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals , ’ said Donny Ferguson , Libertarian National Committee Communications Director .
‘ Democrats seem to think differently .
When the Obama administration ordered Democrats to ‘ punch back twice as hard ’ against citizens who question them , Democrats responded .
This Chicago - trained White House has brought Chicago - style union violence to small towns across America . ’
‘ The White House told Democrat leaders Thursday to ‘ punch back twice as hard ’ when citizens express disapproval .
That kind of irresponsible rhetoric is never proper when discussing popular dissent .
They also made it clear they will bend Senate rules and force through government - run health care whether or not America supports it .
That is a frightening departure from the traditional American practice of governing though popular will , ’ said Ferguson .
‘ If bringing in union thugs is an attempt by Democrats to scare citizens into not questioning them , it wo n’t work .
Union violence may be how communities are organized in Chicago , but the American people wo n’t stand for people who think violence is the proper response to the fact they no longer have majority support . ’
‘ Americans still believe in the consent of the governed .
Libertarians urge Democrats to listen to the American people , call off their union enforcers and drop their wildly unpopular scheme of government - run medicine , ’ said Ferguson .
For more information on this issue , or to arrange an interview with the Libertarian Party , please call Director of Communications Donny Ferguson at 703-200-3669 , or email DonnyFerguson@gmail.com .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third - largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .

The Libertarian Party proudly stands for smaller government , lower taxes and more freedom .

If you are looking for tailgating ideas and information on the tailgate party lifestyle , you have come to the right place .
We noticed you are new here and encourage you to stay in touch by joining us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for even more tailgating fun .

Beer at a tailgate party is a common sight much like grills , BBQ sauce and long lines for the port - o - let .
Just because beer at a tailgate party is as common as Amy Winehouse at last call does not mean it should not be considered a precious commodity .
That is why you as a seasoned tailgater need to know the eights ways tailgaters ruin the taste of their beers .
Why would you want to intentionally ruin a beer ?
You would n’t .
Knowing the techniques that will turn a beer into a skunky , foul , undrinkable mess can help you keep your beer tasting great and ensure the girls next to you will invite you back next time .
So here are the eight ways tailgaters need to avoid so they do not ruin their beer .
1. The Heat Is On – Heat is the major death blow to the overall taste of beer .
There is a reason many beer companies spend millions in advertising telling you how cold their beer is filtered and packaged .
That ’s because even if your beer is ice cold when you pop the top , if it has gotten too hot sometime during the process it will taste flat out awful .
The ideal temperature to store beer is between 38 and 40 degrees .
So if you are on your way to the tailgate , make sure you take your beer and place it in the cooler with ice directly from the fridge .
That will preserve the taste and also will save you money on buying more ice because your warm beer killed your ice stock .
2. Set It and Forget
It – From the moment you open a beer it starts to go south .
No need to panic and break out the Flabongo just yet .
Your normal drinking speed should be just fine to still enjoy your beer before it goes bad .
However , we know while tailgating people like to move around and socialize .
So if you set down your beer and spend the next 30 minutes in line for the port - a - potty you ’ll come back to a beer that is not only warm but on its way to tasting nasty .
Make sure to keep tabs on your beer and remember where you put it down unless you like the taste of flat beer .
3. Freeze Frame –
We all like beer ice cold but it is possible to have too much of a good thing .
Even though alcohol does not freeze ( high alcohol content is the reason why you can put a bottle of JÃ¤germeister in the freezer and it will still pour like maple syrup ) the alcohol content in beer is not high enough to prevent the rest of it from freezing .
Have you ever had a beer that was frozen and then thawed out ?
It is normally flat as Kansas and all the taste has been killed .
Also , serving beer that cold actually prevents some of the volatile components in the beer from being released .
Keep it cold but not too cold .
4. Let The Light Shine On In – We ’ve already told you about heat being a big enemy of beer .
Meet light , heat ’s evil twin and just as nasty .
Unless you like the smell of skunk , you need to keep your beer shielded from light as much as possible .
Think of your beer bottles as a pair of sunglasses to prevent that skunky flavor .
Brown bottles keep out the harmful UV rays the best while green bottle do little in the line of protection and clear bottles provide no protection .
Beer cans are your best choice for tailgating because they let in zero light and many tailgating parking lots have a strict “ no glass ” policy .
( You can thank Raider Fan for that rule . )
5. Shake Yo Thang – Shaking up a beer does two things to damage it .
The first is obvious that when you open it , 2 / 3rds of it will spray out everywhere making a foamy mess .
The other is that the remaining beer has been overexposed to the pent up carbonation and that ruins the flavor of beer while also making it flat .
Try to avoid bumpy roads , swerving in and out of traffic or sharp turns on your way to go tailgating .
That is unless you prefer a cooler full of beer waiting to explode .
6. Fruit of the Holy Spirit – Many Mexican beers are marketed to the American beer drinking public to encourage putting a lime wedge into your beer .
Maybe this is to mask the skunky taste their clear bottles are prone to allowing ?
The fact remains that adding fruit to your beer will alter its true taste .
It may be a matter of personal preference but no matter what you put in your beer , make sure you are doing it because you like the taste and not because a TV commercial makes you think you should .
7. Fuggedaboutit – Beer is brewed to be the best tasting and freshest when it leaves the brewery .
That ’s why buying that 30 pack of beer for the last game of the season and waiting to drink the remainder at next year ’s season opener is a bad idea .
Time is a killer for a beer so man up and either drink the entire case before heading into the game or give it away to the can man .
You ’ll be thankful you did next season .
8. Forget to Grub –
For years now , wine has been the main adult beverage that is considered to be the perfect compliment to food .
That ’s an old wive ’s tale .
Beer is great paired with food , especially tailgate food .
A big old rack of baby back ribs is best served with a beer or a glass of wine ?
Hoagies piled high with everything ?
Would you rather have a glass of White Zin or a cold beer ?
Yeah , we thought so .
Of course those that are using beer as a vehicle to just get hammered before going into the game in order to avoid the high prices inside wo n’t care about food pairings .
Now that you know the eight ways tailgaters typically ruin their beers you can employ these techniques to avoid the same pitfalls .
Keep in mind that beer is precious and having great tasting beer while tailgating will only enhance the entire experience .
Special thanks to Beer Magazine for providing some inspiration and guidelines for compiling this list .
Hopefully armed with this knowledge you wo n’t just tailgate , you will tailgate better .
I Remembered Basic Rights in My Estate Plans and It Took Less than a Minute

In an interview of Al Jazeera former Speaker of the House , and potential Republican presidential candidate , Newt Gingrich announced his plan to topple the regime in Iran by sabotaging the nation ’s oil refineries to create a gas crisis .
Would n’t it be easier to pass legislation banning the selling of gasoline to Iran ?
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Gingrich said , “ I ’ve called for sabotage not bombing … What I have said is you should use covert operations because they only have one refinery that produces gasoline for the entire country , and they have to import all the rest of their gasoline …
The only purpose of sabotaging them would be to create a gasoline - led crisis to try to replace the regime .
I ’m against using tactics that do n’t have any strategic meaning .
I think we have a vested interest – the world has a vested interest – in a responsible Iranian government . ”
The neo -con point of view is alive and well within the GOP .
It makes no sense to engage in sabotage in Iran , if the same thing , cutting off the supply of gasoline to the nation , could be achieved without engaging in covert activities .
Why would Gingrich want to undercut the domestic movement against the regime in Iran by engaging in such a reckless and foolish plan ?
Newt Gingrich ’s idea is zany and not based in reality .
Believe it or not this is a man who is considered one of the intellectual voices of the GOP .
How many times can the Republicans call for regime change , without recognizing the failure of that policy ?
The Obama approach is working , so why mess with it ?
If the United States did as Gingrich suggested , they would strengthen the regime in Iran , possibly provoke a war , and demolish any homegrown democratic movement .
This is the worst possible policy option to advocate .
I realize that Gingrich is trying to position himself as tough on Iran for 2012 , but his idea would lead to disaster .

August 22 , 2009 -- Socialist Resistance --
Today , the twin drivers of economic recession and the possibility of catastrophic climate change are beginning to push working people towards action .
A series of small - scale but high - profile occupations of threatened factories , not just at Vestas wind turbine plant but also at Visteon car plant , where 600 workers took on the might of Ford and won a greatly enhanced redundancy package , show what is possible .
In the 1970s workers at Britain 's Lucas Aerospace went even further .
We look back at the lessons of Lucas Aerospace .
It is clear that if we are to avert catastrophic climate change by moving rapidly to a low - carbon economy , certain industries will have to be wound down or drastically scaled back , for example , the power generation , aviation and car industries .
However , rather than this leading to a net loss of jobs , efforts must be put into creating new green jobs or ``converting '' old jobs .
Whereas the priorities of global capitalism dictate the closure of the Isle of Wight ’s Vestas wind turbine factory , we ought to be opening or converting hundreds of factories to produce the hardware for harnessing renewable wind and solar energy , and employing tens of thousands of skilled engineers from other industries and training new engineers for the future .
Socially useful production
We had a brief glimpse of how such a transformation might be achieved at Lucas Aerospace in the 1970s , when workers , faced with job losses , drew up their own alternative plan for how they could run the company and turn it over to producing socially useful and environmentally friendly products .
Whilst the Lucas Plan never came to fruition , it has important lessons for future struggles to place the working class and the trades unions at the heart of the fight to save the planet .
The Lucas Aerospace conglomerate was one of Europe ’s largest designers and manufacturers of military aircraft systems and hardware , with more than 18,000 workers and 15 factories across the UK , centred on Birmingham .
Half of its business was in the production of combat aircraft and missile systems for NATO .
Formed in the early 1970s , through a series of takeovers and mergers , it enjoyed government sponsorship to create a strong and efficient aerospace company .
When Lucas management put forward plans to ``rationalise '' the company by sacking up to 20 per cent of the workforce and closing a number of factories , in order to compete on the European market for lucrative NATO contracts , the principal opposition came from the powerful Shop Stewards Combine Committee ( SSCC ) .
The SSCC had grown in importance through the rank and file wage militancy of the early 1970s .
Crucial to its success was its ability to call solidarity actions across the whole of Lucas in support of local disputes , such as in 1972 when a three - month strike over pay by workers at the Burnley plant was supported by workplace collections and stoppages across the combine .
Management capitulated with a greatly increased wage settlement for the Burnley engineers sparking a round of action for increased pay across the whole of Lucas Aerospace .
Beyond militant unionism
The response of the SSCC to the proposed job losses was to go far beyond the norms of militant trades unionism as , in 1976 , it put forward an alternative corporate plan for production across the company .
The plan , which had been drawn up by workers on the shopfloor , argued that Lucas should shift from a concentration on military hardware production to the making of socially useful goods .
It was two years in the making and drew on the technical expertise and detailed knowledge of the production process of the workforce .
Altogether it contained more than 150 ideas with detailed plans , filling more than 1000 pages .
Lucas Aerospace already had a small stake in high - tech medical equipment and the plan sought to develop this as an alternative to weapons systems .
Some of the key elements of the alternative plan in the medical field were :
Expanded production of kidney dialysis machines , which Lucas already built , together with research into more portable models .
Manufacture of a life - support system for use in ambulances , based on a design by a former Lucas engineer turned medical doctor .
Development of a mobility aid for children with Spina Bifida .
The ``Hobcart '' , as it was called , was actually designed and built by Lucas workers and advance orders for several thousand units were received .
Mike Cooley , a senior designer at Lucas Aerospace and local chair of the technical union TASS , wrote :
“ Lucas would not agree to manufacture [ the Hobcart ] because , they said , it was incompatible with their product range …
Mike Parry Evans , its designer , said that it was one of the most enriching experiences of his life when he delivered the Hobcart to a child and saw the pleasure on the child ’s face .
For the first time in his career he saw the person who was going to benefit from the product he had designed , and he was intimately in contact with a social human problem . ” [ 1 ]
While the issue of climate change and environmental degradation did not occupy nearly so importance a place in the popular consciousness as it does today , the problem of oil supply was a live issue ( following the so - called “ oil- crisis ” of 1973 ) and the Lucas workers ' plan focused extensively on the development of alternative , renewable energy .
Plans included :
Efficient wind turbines , drawing on existing expertise in aerodynamics .
Solar cells and heat pumps .
The “ Power Pack ” , which coupled a small internal combustion engine to a stack of batteries to create cars with 80 % less emissions and 50 % greater fuel economy .
An efficient method for small - scale electricity generation for use in the developing world .
A vehicle like a train but with pneumatic tyres allowing it also to travel on roads .
Such a vehicle could navigate inclines of 1 in 6 , compared with 1 in 80 for a conventional train , offering a huge potential saving against the need to build tunnels or make deep cuttings to lay rails .
A prototype was successfully tested on a railway line in East Kent .
Bosses reject needs before profits
However , the importance of the Lucas Plan is not just in the specific technologies and products it proposed but in the questions it raised about production under capitalism and the vision it offered of a new society in which human needs come before the blind pursuit of profit .
Predictably , Lucas Aerospace management opposed the plan .
The new product ranges did not fit with the company 's existing portfolio .
Furthermore , the very idea of the workers collectively articulating their views about company policy in this way , challenging management ’s right to manage at a fundamental level , was anathema to the Lucas ' bosses .
Whilst significant sections of the labour movement paid lip - service to the concept , the Lucas Plan was to remain a dead letter .
The Labour government lauded the plan in public -- indeed , the initial idea for the plan had arisen from a meeting between the Lucas shop stewards and industry minister Tony Benn [ 2 ]
--- but Labour failed to put its money where its mouth was .
It had its own priorities which did not include socially useful production but did require strong military and aerospace industries as part of its fulfilment of NATO obligations .
Long months of negotiations over the plan , meetings with ministers and union officials to win concrete backing for it , gradually sapped the militancy of the Lucas workers .
SSCC leaders became increasingly detached from the workforce and workplace organisation began to wither .
With the plan effectively kicked into the long grass , and the influence of the SSCC on the shopfloor in decline , management was determined to break its influence .
Lucas Aerospace pushed forward with the job cuts , and activists , including many of the most prominent members of the SSCC and those most associated with the alternative plan , were victimised and sacked .
Climate change
Today , the twin drivers of economic recession and the possibility of catastrophic climate change are beginning to push working people towards action .
A series of small - scale but high - profile occupations of threatened factories , not just at Vestas but also at Visteon where 600 workers took on the might of Ford and won a greatly enhanced redundancy package , show what is possible .
It is the role of socialists to participate in these movements , drawing the links between the economic crisis of capitalism and the environmental crisis , and using the lessons of past struggles to offer ideas and leadership to take the struggle forward .

Amusing Paris Review excerpts
Here are some funny moments from Paris Review interviews with writers .
You can actually download most of the interviews before 1990 as PDFs .
BORGES
I describe .
I write .
Now as for the color yellow , there is a physical explanation of that .
When I began to lose my sight , the last color I saw was yellow , because it is the most vivid of colors .
That ’s why you have the Yellow Cab Company in the United States .
At first they thought of making the cars scarlet .
Then somebody found out that at night or when there was a fog that yellow stood out in a more vivid way .
. . .
Now when I began to lose my eyesight , when the world began to fade away from me , there was a time among my friends . . . well , they poked fun at me because I was always wearing yellow neckties .
Then they thought I really liked yellow although it really was too glaring .
I said , “ Yes , to you , but not to me , because it is the only color I can see , practically ! ”
I live in a grey world , rather like the silver screen world .
But yellow stands out .

You regard addiction as an illness , but also a central human fact , a drama ?
WILLIAM BURROUGHS
Both , absolutely .
It ’s as simple as the way in which anyone happens to become an alcoholic .
They start drinking , that ’s all .
They like it , and they drink , and then they become alcoholic .
. . .
Remember that if it can be readily obtained , you will have any number of addicts .
The idea that addiction is somehow a psychological illness is , I think , totally ridiculous .
It ’s as psychological as malaria .
It ’s a matter of exposure .
…
INTERVIEWER
What do you think is the effect of hallucinatory drugs on the creative process ?
ROBERT CREELEY
Terrific !
That ’s at least what I ’d like to say .
I think a lot , and at times I can box myself in with all the rationale of army logistics .
It can get to be a hopeless log jam .
So anyhow the LSD just wiped that out — and fears and tentativenesses and senses of getting lost or of being endlessly separated from the world , all that just went .
I ca n’t claim perhaps so simply that writing was thereby opened but I do know the past year has felt a very active one in consequence .
The thing is , it ’s information — extraordinary and deeply relieving
….
INTERVIEWER
You said that most of the writers you ’ve known have been against the grain .
What did you mean ?
ROBERT LOWELL
When I began writing most of the great writers were quite unpopular .
They had n’t reached the universities yet , and their circulation was small .
Even Eliot was n’t very popular then .
But life seemed to be there .
It seemed to be one of those periods when the lid was still being blown .
The great period of blowing the lid was the time of Schöenberg and Picasso and Joyce and the early Eliot , where a power came into the arts which we perhaps have n’t bad since .
These people were all rather traditional , yet they were stifled by what was being done , and they almost wrecked things to do their great works — even rather minor but very good writers such as Williams or Marianne Moore .
Their kind of protest and queerness has hardly been repeated .
They ’re wonderful writers .
You would n’t see anyone as strange as Marianne Moore again , not for a long while .
…
INTERVIEWER
Did n’t you say somewhere , " I am for obscenity and against pornography " ?
HENRY MILLER
Well , it ’s very simple .
The obscene would be the forthright , and pornography would be the roundabout .
I believe in saying the truth , coming out with it cold , shocking if necessary , not disguising it .
In other words , obscenity is a cleansing process , whereas pornography only adds to the murk .

INTERVIEWER
What was it about the twenties that inspired people like yourself and Broun ?
DOROTHY PARKER
Gertrude Stein did us the most harm when she said , “ You ’re all a lost generation . ”
That got around to certain people and we all said , “ Whee !
We ’re lost . ”
Perhaps it suddenly brought to us the sense of change .
Or irresponsibility .
But do n’t forget that , though the people in the twenties seemed like flops , they were n’t .
Fitzgerald , the rest of them , reckless as they were , drinkers as they were , they worked damn hard and all the time .
INTERVIEWER
Did the “ lost generation ” attitude you speak of have a detrimental effect on your own work ?
PARKER
Silly of me to blame it on dates , but so it happened to be .
Dammit , it was the twenties and we had to be smarty — I wanted to be cute .
That ’s the terrible thing .
I should have had more sense .

Some artists put such an emphasis on their work , on creating something that will last , that they put it before everything else .
That line by Faulkner –“ The ‘ Ode on a Grecian Urn ’ is worth any number of old ladies . ”
WOODY ALLEN
I hate when art becomes a religion .
I feel the opposite .
When you start putting a higher value on works of art than people , you ’re forfeiting your humanity .
There ’s a tendency to feel the artist has special privileges , and that anything ’s okay if it ’s in the service of art .
I tried to get into that in Interiors .
I always feel the artist is much too revered : it ’s not fair and it ’s cruel .
It ’s a nice but fortuitous gift — like a nice voice or being left - handed .
That you can create is a kind of nice accident .
It happens to have high value in society , but it ’s not as noble an attribute as courage .
I find funny and silly the pompous kind of self - important talk about the artist who takes risks .
Artistic risks are like show - business risks — laughable .

Are you worried about the future of the written word ?
WILLIAM STYRON
Not really .
I get moments of alarm .
Not long ago I received in the mail a doctoral thesis entitled : “ Sophie ’s Choice : A Jungian Perspective , ” which I sat down to read .
It was quite a long document .
In the first paragraph it said , “ In this thesis my point of reference throughout will be the Alan J. Pakula movie of Sophie ’s Choice . ”
There was a footnote , which I swear to you said , “ Where the movie is obscure I will refer to William Styron ’s novel for clarification . ”
This idiocy laid a pall over my life for a dark brief time because it brought back all these bugaboos we have about the written word .

INTERVIEWER
Let us move from the sublime to the wonderfully ridiculous .
You once thought to ask in words , I believe , not unlike these : “ What was Madame Bovary like in bed , and should we care ? ” I ’ve always meant to ask you about this .
You were raising other issues , larger issues .
Please talk about that for a minute .
PRICE
I wish I ’d invented that question .
In the seventies Esquire asked me to write an article about new sexual freedoms in fiction .
It was really the time in American fiction when suddenly we began to realize , My God , I can say anything I want to , and even Jesse Helms ca n’t stop me !
I can portray any sexual act .
I can indulge any private peculiarity in prose .
. . . [ Ultimately , ]
I said that Flaubert probably would have benefited had he been able to tell us more about what Emma ’s actual adulterous unions are like for her , because the whole subject of the novel is Emma ’s romantic and romantically poisonous delusions about sexual love .
It was Esquire who gave it the title , “ What Did Madame Bovary Do in Bed ? ” I think I called it something really dull like “ Uses for Freedoms . "
INTERVIEWER
What was she like in bed ?
Boring ?
Selfish ?
REYNOLDS PRICE
Rather stunned and frantic , I would think .
And I do n’t say it to be comic .
I suspect stunned and frantic , breathless and shockingly cold to the touch .

INTERVIEWER
Does it bother you that there are true stories that you ’ll never put down ?
MAVIS GALLANT
It depends on what you call a true story .
A journalism student in Germany once told me she was bothered by the fact that the most plain and simple and ordinary news stories could conceal an important falsehood .
She gave me an example , say , a couple celebrating their seventieth wedding anniversary .
They will sit holding hands for the photographer and they ’ve had their ups and downs over the years , but the marriage has been a happy one .
The reporter can only repeat what they say .
But what if the truth is that they positively hate each other ?
In that case , the whole interview is a lie .
I told her that if she wanted to publish the lie perceived behind the interview , she had to write fiction .
( She became a critic , by the way . )
HOUSTON , July 19 , 2009  -- Houston , we have a problem .
One of the two bathrooms on the International Space Station is broken .
Engineers at the Johnson Space Center are working around the clock to troubleshoot the problem , but it could take days to fix .
Astronaut Hal Getzelman radioed up the bad news to the crew on the space station .
" When you get a second , if you could put an out - of - service note on the WHC [ NASA 's term for a toilet ] and advise the crew members that station crew members will have to use the Russian toilet and shuttle crew members on the shuttle until further notice . "
European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne is the guy tasked with putting his plumbing skills to work on short notice .
He asked if engineers had an estimate on how long it might take to get the toilet back in operation .
" No , we do n't have a good estimate , " Getzelman said .
" What happened , the pre-treat ( chemical ) , we think , flooded the pump separator and we may have got some fluid where we did n't want it and it'll take us a while to work through a procedure to recover . "
There are 13 people on the space station right now – a record .
The crew represents the United States , Russia , Canada , Japan , and Europe .
NASA has spent years getting ready for a crowd in space – adding additional sleeping quarters , learning how to recycle liquid waste into drinking water , and installing a second bathroom last year .
This mission , dubbed STS 127 , is the first real test of those systems .
Mission Control sent up a note to the crew on Sunday warning them to not overuse the new bathroom .
3. WHC USAGE TIME CONSTRAINTS
With the high usage on WHC we would like to remind you about time constraints for WHC usage .
These can be found on 2.301 WHC Cue Card under the block " WHC Time Constraints . " - Recommend 6 min interval between use . -
Three uses in a row ( < 6 - min interval ) requires a 30 - min cool down .
- Maximum continuous use is 30 - min followed by a 20 - min cool down .
Translation :
If someone uses the bathroom the next person to use it needs to wait six minutes , and if three people in a row use it six minutes apart it needs 30 minutes to recover .
While it is certainly inconvenient for the crew to be down to one bathroom – the Russians have a working bathroom and there is a toilet on Endeavour .
Mission Control wants the astronauts to use it as little as possible because they can't dump the waster overboard for fear of contaminating the new addition to the space station .
If all else fails the crew has at its disposal something the astronauts on Apollo 11 carried on their mission 40 years ago : Apollo bags used to collect fecal material .
The Apollo capsules and the lunar modules did n't have bathrooms , so while one of the toilets on the space station is broken , it shows just how far the space program has come in 40 years .

" This year is different , as it has come in two waves , " said Sebastien Chantereau , from the national shellfish producers ' body , the Comité National de la Conchyliculture .
" Although each was less violent than the one that struck last July , together the damage is roughly the same .
If we have one more wave between now and September it will be a total catastrophe , " he told the Daily Telegraph .
I tweeted the title of this blog earlier tonight and it's been retweeted by dozens of people .
That 's because Jon Stewart -- even as he mocks the news -- is actually holding journalists accountable .
And journalists at their very best , hold politicians and society 's institution accountable .
That 's what America lost with the death of Walter Cronkite tonight .
Accountability .
By any measure , Cronkite was a journalist with integrity .
We knew we could trust him to tell us the unbiased truth .
He was n't about entertainment .
( He resented Charles Kuralt 's features which ran at the end of his broadcasts . )
He was a newsman in the tradition of Murrow .
That 's why in the 1970s -- 1974 some said tonight -- Cronkite was named by his fellow citizens in a survey as the most trusted man in America .
With his death , I think perhaps Jon Stewart has taken on that role .
Recession likely to change credit card habits THE ECONOMY IN TURMOIL
For decades , the credit card has symbolized the American way of life , but this recession may force both the symbol and the reality to change .
Spooked by plunging home prices and mounting job losses , consumers have cut back on credit card use , pumping less cash into an economy that depends on their ability and willingness to spend .
Meanwhile , Congress , reacting to complaints about credit card marketing practices , has tightened the rules on penalties and fees - spurring bankers to warn that consumer credit will become more costly and difficult to obtain .
The credit card issue is part of a larger problem of how to ensure that the financial system supplies enough credit to keep the economy moving without providing so much that it overheats and collapses .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Industry critics say soaring debt helped cause this recession , which has now unleashed economic forces that will end the free - spending behavior symbolized by credit cards .
" As a society , we 'll never be able to go back to the way things were , " said Robert Manning , a professor of consumer behavior at Rochester ( N.Y. )
Institute of Technology and author of the anti-debt manifesto , " Credit Card Nation . "
But James Chessen , chief economist for the American Bankers Association , said consumers rely on credit cards to enhance their lifestyles and will want credit available when better times return .
" The fundamental desire to buy things today and pay interest for the privilege will remain part of the culture , " Chessen said .
Daniel Ray , editor in chief of CreditCards.com , said credit cards began as exclusive perks in the 1960s and 1970s but evolved into mass - market products in the 1980s and beyond thanks to the use of credit scoring technologies .
Using credit scores , he said , banks could tailor rates and terms to an individual 's likelihood of making or missing payments .
Cards became easy to obtain , even for people with low scores , because banks could align rates and penalties accordingly .
" They created a multitude of products for a multitude of needs , " Ray said .
Federal Reserve figures chart the expansion of credit card use .
Each month the Fed surveys the total revolving debt carried by consumers , about 90 percent of which is charge card balances .
Fed figures show that in September 1988 , consumers carried $ 177 billion in such revolving debt .
By September 2008 , that figure had risen more than five - fold to $ 977 billion .
Since October , however , the Fed survey shows that revolving debt has dropped for six months in a row .
" This has n't happened for decades , " Ray said .
Will retreat end ?
This credit retreat could prove temporary or permanent .
But Ray said the recent congressional legislation was intended to curb the marketing practices that enabled banks to expand card ownership over the last two decades .
" Issuers developed cards that were cheap up front and expensive on the back end , " he said .
" You could get zero percent for the first year , but after that , if you tripped up , the low introductory rate became very high in a hurry . "
The bill signed by President Obama May 22 will prohibit banks from raising rates on existing balances unless a cardholder falls more than 60 days behind on minimum payments - eliminating so - called hair - trigger delinquencies - and make other changes , including requiring 45 days ' notice before increasing interest rates .
The banking industry , which fought the changes , now warns that the bill will force issuers to restrict access to cards and raise the overall cost of borrowing .
" They affect the ability of credit card issuers to change their prices based on risk , " said Chessen , with the Bankers Association , predicting that the law will mean " less credit extended , particularly to people who may not have perfect credit histories . "
But critics say banks targeted vulnerable consumers and then profited when they missed payments or exceeded credit limits .
" There 's a lot of anger out there ; people have felt so manipulated , " said San Francisco debt expert Erica Sandberg , author of the family finance guide , " Expecting Money . "
But the credit card situation is just a microcosm of the larger wave of debt that has swamped the economy in the past 20 years .
Huge household debt
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently issued a report on total household debt - everything from mortgages to credit cards .
It showed that consumers doubled their debt load over the last two decades .
By 2007 , the average household had $ 1.33 in obligations for every $ 1 in personal disposable income .
" For many U.S. households , current debt levels appear too high , " the report said .
Manning , the credit industry critic , said now that the recession has thrown millions out of work , that burden has become more difficult to sustain .
" We have more debt than at any other time in history and less income to pay it back , " he said .
" That 's really where we are right now . "

Dr Michael Nazir - Ali wants to uphold traditional teachings of the Bible A traditionalist Anglican group has warned the issue of homosexuality could split the Church of England the way the Episcopal Church has done in the US .
The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans will be launched in the UK on Monday .
The group has campaigned against active homosexuality in the Anglican Communion after being established last year .
One supporter , the Bishop of Rochester , the Right Reverend Michael Nazir - Ali , told the Sunday Telegraph homosexuals should " repent and be changed " .
Powerful lobby
The fellowship was set up at a conference of conservative Anglican bishops and leaders in Jerusalem in the wake of the ordination of an openly gay bishop in New Hampshire , and includes a breakaway Anglican Church in the US .
It promotes a traditionalist reading of the Bible which outlaws active homosexuality .
The Bible 's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman
The Right Reverend Michael Nazir - Ali
Bishop of Rochester BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott says the group constitutes a powerful lobby inside the communion to campaign against both the ordination of gay clergy and the blessing of same - sex relationships in church .
The fellowship has already helped to unite traditionalist American congregations who left the Episcopal Church into a small separate Church .
The group has warned that if what they claim is the Church of England 's liberal drift continues it is likely to face a similar split .
The breakaway Church in the US began as traditionalist congregations invited bishops from outside the country to oversee them .
It is a step English traditionalists have warned they might also be prepared to take .
' Sexual nature '
Ahead of the group 's UK launch , Dr Nazir - Ali told the Sunday Telegraph : " We want to uphold the traditional teaching of the Bible .
We believe that God has revealed his purpose about how we are made .
" People who depart from this do n't share the same faith .
They are acting in a way that is not normative according to what God has revealed in the Bible .
" The Bible 's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman .
That is the way to express our sexual nature .
" We welcome homosexuals , we do n't want to exclude people , but we want them to repent and be changed . "

Pastor Jose Elias Moran , 42 , of the Iglesia Profetica Peniel church in Texas , was tasered after ( according to the incident report ) allegedly interfering with a traffic stop in the church parking lot .
The report goes on to say that Moran became agitated , and that Officer Raymond Berryman tried to calm him .
Webster Police Chief Ray Smiley said Pastor Jose Moran supported his officer 's actions .
Regarding Moran , he said :
" The officer told him to back off several times .
In that situation , for the officer , he 's got one gentleman to his left and one to his right .
You never know what 's going to happen , especially with what 's happened in the last week or two . "
Smiley is likely referring to the death of Houston police Officer Henry Canales , who was shot to death during an undercover operation in southwest Houston on June 24 .
At the same time , from the other side of the argument come accusations that officers targeted the church because the congregation is mostly illegal immigrants from Guatemala .
Besides tasering the pastor , police also pepper - sprayed to congregation to disperse them .
They also dispute that Moran pushed the officer .
Moran was arrested for interfering with a public officer ; Moran said he plans to sue Berryman .

while I agree , these are " bush " wars and believe we need to keep that in the public 's mind , let 's not kid ourselves - obama is pickin ' up where he left off .
Yes , just pulling out of the bush disasters was probably not feasible , but maintaining same failed policies should not be an option either .

" Maintaining same failed policies " is a problem for sure .
Where they are * illegal * policies , I 'm happy to be just as hard on the media for failing to cover it .
That said , I see nothing like the type of illegalities of the Bush Admin ( so far ) , and the blood letting still continues from those policies without accountability .
All ensuring , they will happen again .
And worse .

Brad - you are not paying attention .
The current administration is no more transparent than the previous and will not release visitor logs either .
We are still using depleted uranium and God -knows what else in Iraq and Afghanistan - these are clearly violations of international law - war crimes .
As we blog , in your name an even larger assault is going on in Afghanistan than bush conducted in Fallujah .
Those were vicious , illegal attacks on a civilian population - primarily killing innocent women and children .
More than 1 million civilian deaths so far and no sign of letting up .
If claim not to know where the " illegal " policies are , you are not looking .

Administration Asks for Two Month Delay on CIA Torture Report That " holy grail " CIA torture report that is reportedly wil undercut claims that torture provided any useful intelligence , the one that was supposed to have been released yesterday , and a few weeks before that , might be held now until August 31 .
Those that cover up or do not prosecute war crimes are also guilty of them .
International law is clear on this .
Just another example of obama selling out his base and picking up where dur chimpfurher left off ?

Another Joe said : Brad - you are not paying attention .
The current administration is no more transparent than the previous and will not release visitor logs either .
...
If claim not to know where the " illegal " policies are , you are not looking .
Thanks for holding my feet ( and everyone else 's ! ) to the fire AJ .
I assure you , I am most certainly paying attention .
But let me take another run at my previous comments then .
For a start , to say that the Obama administration is " no more transparent than " Bush , is just not true .
They may not be transparent * enough * ( and they certainly are n't , not by a long shot ) , but they are not " no more transparent than " Bush , anymore than " Democrats are just as bad as Republicans " , as I see so often averred .
Dems may suck , but they are sucking in an entirely different league than the Republicans , and to put them in the same league , does an injustice to the conscious evil that is the GOP right now ( versus the consistent failure which is the Democratic Party right now . )
It may seem an overly nuanced difference , but it is n't .
At least as I see it .
The " illegalities " you point out above in re : the Obama administration are in a very different league , as I see it , from Bush 's world o' crime .
While you may consider the war in Afghanistan / Pakistan to be " illegal " ( and it may be ) , it is of a piece of what Obama told everyone in the world he planned to do .
Nothing particularly surprising there , and it's what he ran on , and was elected on ( and among the reasons I did n't vote for him ) .
I disagree with the policy , as I did many of Bush's .
But it was n't policies that I generally criticized even the Bush Administration for .
It was the lying , the deception , the hypocrisy , the failure , etc .
Many years went by in the Bush Admin where I despised his policies , but did n't particularly criticize him ( at least publicly , from platforms such as this ) for them .
We 're into the weeds here , and it's often difficult to detail my particular sense of news judgement ( at least as far as what I find worth publishing on The BRAD BLOG ) , as much goes into that judgement .
And it evolves .
It 's often determined by the question : " Do I have anything to add to what 's already been said and covered ? "
And other times driven by what I find myself emotionally connected to in some way or another , which is not quite as easy to quantify , explain and / or understand ( even for me ) .
So there 's quite a bit of disjointed thoughts for you , too much nuance , and none of it necessarily definitive .
But I thought your critique / thoughts deserved a reply in turn .
Hoping , for now , some of those thoughts offer insight into my particular way of thinking .
For good or bad .
Or anything else .

It is intellectually dishonest to say that obama , with about six months in office , is somehow less secret in withholds less information than chimpy did in 8 years .
The point is - ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS , obama is AT LEAST as secret as chimpy .
And do n't give me any of this crap that somehow THIS lack of transparency is somehow MORE transparent than any one else 's secrecy and obstruction of justice .
The " less pregnant " argument does not apply .
And this is coming from the man that ran on " open government " - a blatant lie .
More Obama Secrecy ---
This Time On Cheney 's Plame Interview Perhaps we should n't be surprised at this point .
But the latest example of the Obama administration mimicking the Bushies in opting for secrecy over openness feels like one of the most infuriating yet .
There are MANY more examples - obama is showing he has very little integrity .

Um , AJ , you are welcome to disagree with me .
You are not welcome to call me " intellectually dishonest " , unless you have evidence to that end .
If you do n't understand the difference between withholding / protecting documents based on ( what you and I believe is ) a misguided , and incorrect principle / policy , versus withholding documents to hide evidence of crimes , I do n't know what to tell you .

Just about every right wing publication is making a hairy deal out of this interview with Helen Thomas , but on the " progressive " side ?
Crickets .
Helen Thomas has been our hero for the last eight years , and she comes out and expresses a very cogent gripe about Obamanian media manipulation , and staged questions from Pitney --- which was obvious to anyone who watched --- and we gots crickets over in " the reality - based community " ?

you said :
If you do n't understand the difference between withholding / protecting documents based on ( what you and I believe is ) a misguided , and incorrect principle / policy , versus withholding documents to hide evidence of crimes , I do n't know what to tell you .
lets apply this standard of understanding differences , to the bush admin and your assertions .
Iraq .
the bush admin cherry picked information to make its case .
it believed , and told congress that this was the case , but it was not like congress was in the dark .
it was not like
every single major intelligence report out there did not clearly state that wmds in iraq was a strong educated guess , but that it was an ASSUMPTION in the absence of actual data .
THIS was poorly covered by the media ( okay , horribly covered ) .
But the information was out there .
Also , the case that two key things had changed by march of '03 was not sufficiently made .
1 ) no UN support ( not to mention the fact that we were arguably in violation of international law , and had certainly rendered the UN process all but moot at our discretion -- a scary concept for Europe to witness , seeing this from the outside ) .
legitimate internationl support , and even UN sanctioning , was imperative in a strategic action such as this ( hearts and minds , appearance of imperialism , etc. ) 2 ) weapons inspectors had gone back into Iraq --- UNDER THE LEGITIMATE THREAT OF FORCE , THE PUBLICLY SPECIFIED REASONS FOR JOHN KERRY'S VOTE GIVEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE --- BUT WHO COVERED THAT ????
IN '04 --- not only gone back , but for the first time in four years , and even more since legitimate weapons inspections had occurred .
and the inspectors were saying " wait .
we do n't see evidence yet to support our assumptions . "
But who made this case in march of ' 03 ?
almost nobody .
and certainly not loud enough .
( no one made it in '04 either , when in some ways it was even more relevant . ) the liberal blogosphere seems to argue that most of America was against the war from the start , because the liberal blogosphere tends to confuse the liberal blogosphere with the rest of the world , and will find or warp some stat to back it up .
the point is , few were making this case ( and fewer , even more foolishly , were making it in 2004 to combat the misrepresentations of both the Bush Campaign , and a rather parroting like media on the whole Iraq war thing . ) and a
Lot of people as a result backed the iraq action at the beginning .
( even some who say now they never did . ) heck , we even got so out of control we george orwell like absurd renamed congressional cafeteria french fries " freedom fries . " (- though this rightly freaked out at least some people . )
There is another aspect to this as well .
This is not to debate whether strategically the war was a good idea or could have been .
( I submitted an Op Ed to the washington Post in february of 2003 arguing against it because it would appear to the world -- and particularly the Mid East -- differently than it really was , and as part of this would unnecessarily aid in al -q cell like recruitment , it would distract resources from Afghanistan and a big portion of al - Q , it would bring al - Q or al - Q mimics into Iraq and possibly create a training ground for terrorism , the state might devolve into warring factions or civil war , and even with limited success the downside risk , soldiers ' lives , huge costs ( costs which should have gone directly to eradicating al - Q , securing fissile materials , international intelligence , and other direct terrorism eradication measures ) , and bad pr were not worth it .
all probably true .
one reason I left out of the piece I submitted for credibility purposes was perhaps the most compelling of all --- the Bush Administration talked a good game , but did n't really know what it was doing .
( Also true , in hindsight , but I was pretty comfortable with the assessment at the time . ) )
But to be openminded about this action requires that one understand that there was a legitimate strategic reason for this action , that DID NOT have to do with oil .
You do n't have to agree with it , you can even think it was terribly misguided , but the lack of recognition that there was one , and the possibility that those who promoted this action actually did believe in it , undermine credibility with all but the liberal blogosphere and some of the remainder of what has become one part of a rather bifurcated Iraq action view , for the most part ; and plays a big part in why a far right cabal had so much influence for so long --- because the notes they were hitting with people WERE NOT EVEN BEING recognized , let alone adequately addressed .
( this continues today , by the way .
but the problem is far greater , actually , with respect to their rhetoric and claims when there is n't really a legimitate side to the story , but why reasonable people are following far right rhetoric ) --- here there was , Iraq was a strategic action --- needs to be identified and understood , not scoffed at , which has been the typical liberal blogosphere response , and was the primary response of active democrats , including the kerry campaign , in ' 04 ; causing ( along with an unchecked media ) democrats to lose an election that a sack of cement should have won .
( and what do Democrats do today , of course , blaming everybody but themselves ?
they blame Kerry . )
The yellowcake slip up was an issue , but at least it was based upon belief ( again , cherry picking , and constantly engaging in asserting things which had some potential substanace to them , as declarative fact --- something the Bush Administration did constantly , and the media , and frankly , most Democrats ( by not framing it correctly and focusing on turning this into THE story ) let them get away with it .
Brad , I have seen your blog on rare occasions , from time to time , and I think you do great work , and commend you here .
But the following statement by you , as much as it is simply taken as " everyone knows this " as seemingly unalterable , incontrovertible fact , ( which makes it fairly safe to assert ) is simply not objective .
on any of the crimes involved with sending us into a war that 's killed over 4,000 Americans , hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , and has otherwise put our national security at dangerous risk for decades to come .
( Technically , and depending upon the definition , there were " crimes " committed arguably , in relation .
The clandestine overruling and set aside of FISA -- even if it was for " good " motive , resulting in warrantless spying , was at the least a direct breach of Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution ( though I do n't see the implicit media supported conflation between that and IRAQ as opposed to eradicating and averting domestic terrorism ) , but of course the media did not cover this corrctly either , because of cockamamie unitary presidency theories , which of course render the basic purpose for our Constitution 's establishmment in the first place null and void .
Etc. )
And , I agree with the general nature of your sentiment , that had the media spent as much time and resources on the Bush administration , its record , its actions , its rhetoric , its processes , yes , we would not be so poorly informed a nation ( nor would the Bush administration been eight years ) , and not nearly as bad off as we are right now .
And frankly , our democracy would be a lot more vibrant .
If you claim it is anyway , consider that amongst the white vote , McCain , let alone with Palin as his running mate , would be our president today :
After a campaign that made the bush campaign in ' 04 look reasonably genuine .
( another media ass kiss job , by the way , but democrats have allowed the far right to frame it once again , and thus the question is whether or not the media " favored Obama , " with either answer --- " yes " or " no " not remotely close to the actual reality of the media 's excessive pandering to McCain in relation to the facts .
even their coverage of Palin was a little skewed --- in relation to the facts .
she came off as extreme to many , because she is incredibly uniformed and exceedingly misleading in her rhetoric , and , dissing the media constantly , the media at least covered her somewhat . )
I guess that 's enough food for thought for now , huh

Budweiser55 - Thanks for your 2 ( actually 10 ) cents on this .
Though I had a very difficult time discerning your point , frankly .
On a couple of them , I 'll quickly respond : Iraq .
the bush admin cherry picked information to make its case .
it believed , and told congress that this was the case , but it was not like congress was in the dark .
It did n't " believe " .
Which is why they had to cherry pick .
If they believed so strongly , they could have made ALL of the evidence available , and also allowed the UN inspectors to have their additional requested 30 days .
But they did n't .
And yes , Congress was left in the dark on much of this .
They were shown only limited info , and only in a very limited way ( come to this location to look at the thousands of pages of docs for X number of hours , no notes may be taken , and the vote will be tomorrow ! for example . ) the kerry campaign , in ' 04 ; causing ( along with an unchecked media ) democrats to lose an election that a sack of cement should have won .
And your evidence that he lost is what exactly ?
The yellowcake slip up was an issue , but at least it was based upon belief A " slip " ?!
It was no slip .
It was very much on purpose .
They do n't " slip " on SOTU speeches , perhaps the most vetted of all Presidential addresses .
That information had been removed time and again from previous speeches .
They were told it was n't valid .
They included it in the SOTU anyway .
It was no slip , and it was not based on a " belief " , when their own Intelligence Director told them it was bogus on several occasions .
As to my " objectivity " on the passage you quoted , I do n't know that I ever claimed it was objective or subjective .
I do , however , stand behind it 's accuracy .
100 % .

Brad , thanks for the response .
It did n't believe " what " ?
a case can be made that the bush administration was worried about the inspections reports , and thus the best time to push forward with the regime change agenda was in march , when the nation ( and the media ) was n't really too focused on the actual details , and was rah rah'ing the action like it was some football game .
I am not asserting or arguing that this was the case , just that is a possibility .
IF the bush administration was well informed and savvy about the situation ( two big " ifs " ) it is a strong possibility ; but I think the likelihood is more likely it was not ( at least with respect to the public players --- aka bush and cheney . ) however , " belief " refers to the idea that the bush administration believed in what it was doing .
that almost all terrorism ( but not all ) was emanating from the middle east , and the belief that some how lack of democracy played a role in this .
the fact that you - who , i emphasize , with all due respect , can have absolutely no idea --- assert as fact that they did not believe , is supportive of what I wrote above .
it is presumptuous .
yet also an extremely widespread view .
your explanation that " if they believed " they would n't have to cherry pick , is also not really accurate .
they believed ( or " not " ) they sold their case , as hard push sellers do .
this administration ( and much of the far right , frankly ) is defined by belief , and belief shaping what facts are derived therein .
they cherry pick to support those beliefs .
THIS is what the bush administration did .
consistently , for eight years .
they stifled dissent , they surrounded themselves with people who thought like they did , often choosing that , and ideology , frankly , over competency .
paul o neill was plenty competent by bush administration standards , and was essentially forced out because he would not toe the line .
colin powell is often put into the bush cheney category , and this is flawed .
powell had a decision to make ; he decided , as did most of our intelligence experts , that iraq had wmd / to back the administration , and he made his best case .
but disagreements beyond that ( and perhaps to some extent even that as well ) , forced powell out .
the fact is powell made a case , it was not credible to the international community .
we pilloried the international community at the time , and now we pillory powell .
both are b.s. your assertion that congress was very much left in the dark , is also , I believe , spin .
where is the hard evidence of that ?
I READ the intelligence reports .
and guess what --- as noted above , all the major ones noted that the speculation with respect to WMDs , which we all assumed , was likely correct , but not a certainty , because we lacked data in the absence of credible inspections , to back it up .
the vote to authorize force was to back up legitimate inspections .
even kerry said [ essentially , but this is pretty close ) " i give this vote for one reason , and one reason only .
to disarm iraq of weapons of mass destruction , if same can not be accomplished through new , joint weapons inspections in joint concert with our allies . " congress knew darn well in march what those weapons inspectors were saying in february , of ' 02 , and how long it had been since legitimate inspections had been undergone ( or certainly should have known ) .
if the administration was behind closed doors really pushing this , saying " we have more info than the CIA. DOD etc. have " and congress bought it , that is to some large degree congress ' culpability .
again , as mentioned above , it was also congress ' culpability not to recognize the enormous PR aspect of this , and how the mission was greatly undermined from the start when it appeared as a rogue nation --- the U.S --- going against UN mandate , for WMDs that weapons inspectors ( to europe ) were saying may not exist after all .
by the way .
kerry also said " in order to have legitimate inspections , you need the legitimate threat of force . " four years prior had been the last weapons inspections .
Iraq , under Hussein , played games therein , and inspectors had not been able to do their jobs .
starting in late fall ' 02 , after the resolution passed , weapons inspectors were able to do their jobs .
and that was the point .
sure , the bush administration pushed congress .
but this idea of " keeping congress in the dark " when our major intelligence agencies were noting that we had no level of certainty in the absence of actual data , and the lack of authentic inspections , for years and years , is misplaced .
even someone who closely followed the news alone ( and yes , both the WP and NYT , although given short shrift , did cover this ) , let alone with congress ' access , had reason to question .
as for yellowcake , you are misconstruing what was meant by the term " slip up " and perhaps it was not the best phrase .
by slip , i meant screw up or half ( quarter ? ) truth .
the facts are these .
the belief was that Iraq had tried to acquire the yellowcake , that there was proof of this , and it was to be included in bush 's address .
prior to the address ( and I wrote about this , far more critically than most were at the time , btw ) intelligence experts related to the president and or his advisors ( I think bush himself was actually told , but cant recall with 100 percent certainty ) that they could not fully back the yellow cake allegation as an assertion of fact , and that it may even be wrong .
therefore , the implication was " since we cant say for sure that this is fact , LEAVE IT OUT . " bush decided to leave it in .
this mislead the American people , as the bush administration did repeatedly .
but it did not make it up .
I know you argue otherwise , but the balance of the evidence still supported the yellowcake assumption ( if one had to guess , arguably , points cut both ways on this ) but the point is , it was still a guess .
( there have been mixed reports , and perhaps you are more up on this than I am , but there have been reports since that indicate that the " guess ' was in fact correct --- but this is not directly relevant to asserting what was speculation , as fact , to the American people , as a major argument for war . ) this was almost as big a slip by the media , as it was by the bush administration .
bush represented something as fact , that was a guess , and we did not yet know as fact .
that was known , yet we ( the American people , the media ) accepted it .
your tendency , and I mean no disrespect here , but democrats and liberals , since they do n't have the ability to spin as does the far right , are not going to win , and get their points across , by simply trying to dis- objectively discredit their opponents .
since the whole idea is that you are grounded in reason , a key initial element is to understand the mindset of those you disagree with , and what drove them .
and , hence how they appeal to so many , and what buttons they touched , and why .
but instead , as good as your journalism is on many occasions , perhaps you slightly fall prey to the same sort of knee jerkish liberal leaning tendency that so many online tend to fall much more to ; which is to simply ascribe motives and beliefs to your political opponents whom it is clear you do n't even begin to understand , let alone some of their core arguments , thought processes , what they are grounded in , and most importantly how and why they are appealing to so many when so repeatedly being wrong ( and misleading ) on so much , I cite this issue here as but one example , because the status quo iraq line ( about an administration which was quite possibly in my opinion among the worst in history ) , simply loses credibility with most who do n't already see it your way to begin with .
and that , frankly , has been the democratic party and online liberal m.o for several years now --- an idea that those active seem to fight tooth and nail , while they continue to allow a relatively tiny far right wing cabal to have an overwhelmingly influence upon our national debate , and upon our easily influenced and accomodative media .
by the way , when you say " the kerry campaign , in ' 04 ; causing ( along with an unchecked media ) democrats to lose an election that a sack of cement should have won .
And your evidence that he lost is what exactly ?
I understand your well felt sentiments about the election , but I think you may be missing the point .
it is also , invariably , and of course without such intent , another classic way that has the effect of averting the reality of what happened in 04 .
I wrote a lot about blackbox , org , etc , and while perhaps overstated , Kennedy 's strong piece in rolling stone , was not completely without merit .
( I am also largely with you on the b.s. that , without independent verification , is electronic voting , btw ) .
but that is besides the point , and whether in what was essentially a toss up horse race ( one way or another ) millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of Americans voted based upon basic misinformation and misperception .
the idea of deflecting any such points with a statement insinuating that Kerry " did n't lose " is another way to miss this central point , and thus the importance of addressing ITs central causes .
those causes were the understanding of the democratic party of with respect to what ( far right ) rhetoric was getting thru AND WHY ; its ( the democratic party 's collective ) communications ; and the media .
you can of course also blame this on the bush campaign misrepresentations , but that is the only part of the equation that democrats did not control or otherwise have a say in other than to simply use to their advantage .
in other words , they could have , instead of whining about how voters were misled by the bush campaign " lies , " learned how to show that to voters , and thus undermine the lies , and undermined the bush campaign 's credibility at the same time .
--- by using those lies , etc. to define the bush administration , which ran on the platform of " trust " to the American people , as a campaign that in fact could NOT be trusted . ) ( as far the media goes , democrats could have stopped allowing the far right to control the media debate and framing , and made the coherent and broad based ( rather than just democrati party appealing ) case for accountability .
making arguments instead , that " kerry did n't really lose " not only misses the big picture , not only keeps it from being properly addressed ( ignorance still runs amuck today , for e.g. ) but keeps us from even recognizing it .
But frankly , without Democrats making effective cases much beyond to those who already agreed , this made it even easier for the media simply to often semi parrot bush campaign talking points and misconstructions .
A lot of the lack of this making of an effective case , since democrats were not going to win with pure spin ( in fact , democrats often concluded or " told " republicans " sold " ) were a constant ascribing of simply evil motives to those with whom they disagreed , and failure to even recognize why so many believe as they did , what reached them , and why they were thinking like they do .
I do n't mean to sound harsh on you .
If I was not impressed with the some of your work , from the bit that I have seen , I would not waste the time .
but since I respect your abilities , I expend the time .
I hope it was not for naught .
By the way , out of respect , I wanted to send this to you solely as a private email , but did not see your address listed on your site .
Also , I 'm sorry I did not give you a twitter lengthy response .
over reliance upon sound bites and our twitter mentality are leading to the continual dumbing down of America ( in my opinion ) frankly .

LONDON , United Kingdom —
Hundreds of students shouting anti-government slogans took to the streets of Tehran and other cities Monday in another sign that Iran 's opposition is still active , despite arrests and allegations of state torture and rape .
These renewed domestic protests add to the international pressure mounting against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The Iranian leader is now coping with both internal and external pressure , as U.S. President Barack Obama joined with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to urge Iran to cease testing missiles and allow international inspections of Iran 's nuclear program .
At the start of the academic year , university students clashed with police in the streets , reportedly prompting Ahmadinejad to cancel his attendance at a Tehran University inauguration ceremony and send Minister of Science Kamran Daneshjoo instead .
Daneshjoo was the head of Ahmadinejad ’s electoral committee in the 2009 elections and strongly supported the incumbent president ’s claim in the post- election fallout that vote - rigging did not occur .
“ The regime has always been fearful of the universities since they are a source of organized uprising , ” said Ali Mohseni , a student protester who fled Iran after being arrested and is currently in exile in Turkey .
“ In the past few days , members of ( presidential candidate Mir- Hossein ) Mousavi ’s youth wing have been arrested because the regime saw that detaining the heads of the movement was not enough so now they ’re going after the grassroots . ”
Another student , who insisted on just being called Ali for fear of retribution was detained before the elections for his activism and who participated in all the summer demonstrations .
His university friends were amazed to see him following the long summer break .
“ They looked at me funny and said : ‘ You ’re alive ?
They did n’t kill you ? ’ ”
Ali said .
“ They ( the government ) are pressuring us excessively by blackmailing us , ” he added .
“ They even use the girlfriends or boyfriends of the politicized ones to threaten them with public or private humiliation before their families should they not give up their activity . ”
Mousavi youth activists were instrumental in organizing demonstrations , publishing allegations of election fraud and prison torture , and publicizing images of several freshly dug graves which they allege contain the bodies of those killed during the demonstrations .
University guards wearing ceremonial sashes over their uniforms stood at the university gates checking the faces of those entering and ensuring they were not wearing any green items of clothing , the color adopted by Iran ’s opposition .
Student activists reported that additional student Basij militiamen had been bussed in from the ideological Imam Sadegh University that is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard .
Fearful that they would be targeted for intimidation , many students simply watched the demonstration or participated with faces covered .
Under Ahmadinejad ’s first presidency , dozens of university professors were fired and student activists expelled .
Ahmadinejad — himself a university professor — introduced a star system that singled out politically - involved school students and banned them from attending class .
Those who amassed the maximum three stars were banned from attending university .
“ Our Supreme Leader is a killer , his state is illegitimate , ” the protesters shouted inside the grounds of the university .
One university professor reached by GlobalPost in Tehran described how her morning class was cancelled by the authorities who told students there would be no classes tomorrow , either .
" It was getting rowdy as of 9 a .m. in front of the university library , " the professor said .
" About 150 student Basijis were swearing at Mousavi when suddenly it became really violent . "
Academics are worried that a new purge of universities is on the way , following Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ’s denouncing in early September of the humanities and social sciences as a corrupting influence that causes students to doubt and question Islamic values .
He called for a revision of what is taught in a reminder of the Cultural Revolution in the early Eighties when the universities were closed for three years and faculties were ideologically purified by revolutionary committees .
Outside Tehran University , security forces beat up passers - by who shouted slogans in support of the students .
Witnesses said that the police broke cellphones and attacked anyone filming or photographing .
Several entrances to building were locked to control the flow of the demonstration and at least three students were arrested in a raid on the dormitories .
For the first time in several months , none of the plainclothes forces that played such a large role in repressing previous protests appeared .
“ They can not use the plainclothes police in broad daylight and at the heart of the university after the experience of the past three months because they know that instead of scaring most of the students they ’re just making them more angry , ” said Mahmood Delkhasteh , a London - based researcher .
“ They also know that clips of fighting can turn these demonstrations into headline news around the world . ”
The conservative Jahan News downplayed the demonstrations , reporting that 150 pro-regime students faced off with “ around 250 ” pro-Mousavi students .
The pro-regime students shouted slogans such as “ Death to the Velvet Dictator ” and “ We do n’t want a Green Card ” in reference to government claims that its violent confrontation with the post-election protesters was in anticipation of a Western - funded Velvet Revolution .
Pro-government media have described the protesters as Western pawns being manipulated in a bid to overthrow the Islamic Republic without seeking recourse to military action .
The Mousavi supporters claim that they have not been in touch with Western pro-democracy groups and their movement is spontaneous .
The pro-Ahmadinejad Raja News reported that pro-Mousavi " militia " disrupted a ceremony by “ swearing at the nation ’s elected President ” .
“ The protests continued until the midday call to prayer when one group departed for the mosque and another to have lunch , ” said the Jahan News article .
Iran ’s revolutionary guard fired more missiles Monday in ongoing war games that began after Tehran ’s surprise declaration of a mystery second enrichment site tunnelled inside a mountain close to the religious city of Qom .
State television reported that the army had tested its medium - range Shahab - 3 and Sajjil missiles which can fly up to 1,200 miles .
“ The regime intentionally tries to heat up the atomic crisis in order to distract attention from the uprising , ” said Delkhasteh .
As Congress debated the bailout bill last September that would authorize the Treasury Department to spend up to $ 700 billion to stem the financial crisis , Representative Mac Thornberry , Republican of Texas , said : “ Seven hundred billion dollars of taxpayer money should not be used as a hopeful experiment . ”
So far , that experiment is more than paying off .
The government has taken profits of about $ 1.4 billion on its investment in Goldman Sachs , $ 1.3 billion on Morgan Stanley and $ 414 million on American Express .
The five other banks that repaid the government 
Northern Trust , Bank of New York Mellon , State Street , U.S. Bancorp and BB&T  each brought in $ 100 million to $ 334 million in profit .
The figure does not include the roughly $ 35 million the government has earned from 14 smaller banks that have paid back their loans .
The government bought shares in these and many other financial companies last fall , when sinking confidence among investors pushed down many bank stocks to just a few dollars a share .
As the banks strengthened and became profitable , the government authorized them to pay back the preferred stock , which had been paying quarterly dividends since October .
But the real profit came as banks were permitted to buy back the so - called warrants , whose low fixed price provided a windfall for the government as the shares of the companies soared .
Despite the early proceeds from the bailout program , a debate remains over whether the government could have done even better with its bank investments .
If private investors had taken a stake in the banks last October on par with the government ’s , they would have had profits three times as large  about $ 12 billion , or 44 percent if tallied on an annual basis , according to Linus Wilson , a finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette , who analyzed the data for The Times .
Why the discrepancy ?
Finance experts say the government overpaid for the bank assets it bought , because its chief priority was to stabilize the teetering financial system , not to maximize profit .
I Want This Temp Controlled Coffee Mug NOW
The thermos concept is n’t really anything new .
You surround a liquid with an insulator of some sort and it either keeps your hot stuff hot or it keeps your cold stuff cold .
German researchers have taken that idea to a whole new level , though , with the ability to keep a beverage , like your morning coffee , at your ideal temperature .
The concept came to Klaus Sedlbauer , head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics , at a Christmas market in Rosenheim .
Sedlbauer said his mulled wine was always either too hot or too cold , and never at that perfect drinking temp .
I have the same problem with Starbucks coffee .
The stuff comes out nuclear , remains that way for a solid 7 - 8 minutes , and then plummets to lukewarm it what seems to be a 30 - second window .
Sedlbauer and his colleague Herbert Sinnesbichler thought to put something called Phase Change Material ( PCM ) to the task .
PCM is a special material capable of absorbing and maintaining heat or cold for extended periods of time .
The substance is wax - like , melting when it warms to retain heat .
As it cools , it turns back into the waxy material .
Applied to a coffee mug , it works just like a thermos , but with the ability to fine tune your results .
Different PCMs retain heat at different levels , so just pick the PCM that corresponds to the temp you want and you ’re all set .
“ Warm drinks , like coffee or tea , are best enjoyed at 58 degrees Celsius ( 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) , ” Sedlbauer explains .
“ In order to reach and maintain this temperature , we fill the mug with a type of PCM that becomes a liquid at exactly 58 degrees Celsius . ”
The liquid then retains that heat until the liquid starts to cool down , at which point the PCM releases its heat to keep your coffee hot .
“ Under ideal circumstances the optimal temperature can be maintained for 20 - 30 minutes , ” according to Sedlbauer .
The two researchers are still looking for a production partner , but expect their mugs to be available as early as the end of the year .
Sounds like production ca n’t be too tough .
Hopefully the price will reflect ease of production .

The back is the most popular area of the body to massage for two obvious reasons , as well as a third less obvious one : 1 ) It ’s got a large amount of the body ’s muscles , and they ’re all intertwined thereby making it the place where you ’re likely to get the most knots and cramps , 2 ) It ’s where people tend to store tension , and the third less known reason is that the lower back itself , which is often given special attention during a massage , is actually a very powerful erogenous
zone which makes the back massage popular with two people who are romantically involved ( or wish to be 😉 ) .
Even peer - reviewed medical research has demonstrated that properly done massage is capable of providing such benefits as reducing blood pressure and heart rate , pain relief , helping with depression , and
reducing anxiety .
There are various theories ( none of which have been conclusively proven ) about how massage goes about doing these things , including improving sleep , blocking nociception , activation of the parasympathetic nervous system which may cause the body to release serotonin and endorphins , stopping fibrosis ( preventing scar tissue from forming ) , and causing the flow of lymph to increase .
This is designed to be a quick and simple primer , not a comprehensive course , such that you can read this and watch the video , all in under 10 minutes , and then give your friend or lover a wonderful and relaxing massage .
Let ’s have a look at the video first , of course I ’m sure the person you ’re massaging wo n’t mind if you have this playing while you ’re ‘ experimenting ’ on them , considering that the ‘ experimentation ’ will certainly feel really good to them !
Here ’s the video , and there ’s a few quick tips afterward :
Quick Tips on Back Massage
Do n’t neglect the neck !
There are so many nerves in the neck that a very simple massage done right can put them on cloud nine .
I personally recommend that you use a pinching motion with your hands starting at the base of the neck and working up –you can probably pinch harder than you think , I ’d try going right up until they tell you it hurts , and then backing off just a bit from that , that ’s the sweet spot where you want to stay .
You can use a surprising amount of pressure : pressure is n’t the problem , just so long as you go SLOW .
The problem is quick and jerky movements , those are what hurt .
You should always avoid working directly on top of the spine , unless you are using extremely gentle strokes .
Work the muscles on either side of the spine instead , those will almost always be in need of attention .
Do n’t forget to use plenty of oil , and right now I ’ll give you one of those valuable tips as far as massage goes that you ’ll ever hear : grape seed oil , and lot ’s of it 😀 .

I 'M ON holiday with family in Europe , and I should be too busy relaxing to care about the health - care debate back in America .
( After all , The Economist gives us quite decent insurance , thanks . )
But " death panels " and " Steven Hawking would be euthanised in Britain " have given me a few thoughts that , since I have n't been obsessively following commentary stateside , I think might be somewhat new .
( I 'm sure I 'm wrong . )
One is to note , as many have done , that famous paranoid strain in American politics .
Why are Americans really willing to believe that Democrats are actually Nazis ready to euthanise the old and the weak , all under the clever guise of expanding ( not eliminating ) health care ?
Europeans , Americans ' closest cultural cousins , do not seem prone to this kind of paranoid thinking .
I 'm tempted to connect it to America 's peculiar form of religiosity .
Americans are not only devout ; quite a few believe that an omnipresent God not only can but does hear every thought , and involves Himself in the most mundane things .
A prayer to do well on a maths test , or that a parking ticket might be thrown out , is always worth a shot .
When God answers , belief in Him is validated , and when He does not , it is also validated .
It 's up to mysterious God to decide when to show His hand .
Belief in a malign conspiracy may well draw on some of the same kind of thinking , once thinking this way is a habit .
The conspiracy is everywhere .
It is all - powerful , yet it can not be seen .
Evidence of its existence is seized eagerly .
Lack of evidence is seized even more eagerly , to show just how powerful the conspiracy is — it can hide its tracks whenever it chooses .
Ca n't find the death panels in the health - care bill ?
That 's just what they want you to think .
Experience of the conspiracy is faith - based and ecstatic ; it grows in crowds , who share the exuberant experience .
But it is also an emotional response to arcane texts .
The bill is the anti-Bible .
Everyone 's heard of it , no one has really read it , it 's far too complicated for the laity to understand anyway , and so trusted authorities will tell you what to think about it .
As Tocqueville , who inspired this blog 's name , noted , America 's religiosity has given it much of its strength .
But I think it may also predispose many to believe the literally unbelievable .
The Pirate Party has now spread its sails in the UK , with a mandate to cut back surveillance , increase freedom of speech and reform copyright and patent laws .
The Pirate Party has officially registered with the Electoral Commission , and is now a real British political party .
New leader Andrew Robinson wrote in a blog post : " I 'm no longer the leader of group of people interested in forming a party , I 'm now the leader of a real , official , all done - according - to - the - book political party . "
The now - official Pirate Party is accepting membership and intends to run candidates in the next election - set to happen by spring at the latest .
The party already exists in Sweden , which has a Pirate MEP , and Germany , which has a member of the Pirate Party in its parliament .
In Sweden , its popularity jumped after the verdict in the Pirate Bay case .
The party 's mandate includes the legalisation of " non-commerical filesharing " , cutting copyright from life plus 70 years , and removing patents from drugs .
Robinson said in a statement : " The Pirate Party offers an alternative to the last century 's struggles between political left and political right . "
" When a government plans to brand seven million British filesharers as criminals , to profile every citizen , to track our movements , register every email we send and every website we visit , and to carry on allowing big business to lock up life saving drugs and environmentally beneficial technologies under an ever - growing mountain of patents , Britain desperately needs a party that fights back , " he added .

Advertisement Zambian former President Frederick Chiluba has been cleared of corruption charges after a long - running trial .
He was accused of embezzling $ 500,000 during his 10 - year presidency , but a judge ruled the funds could not be traced to government money .
The Lusaka court delivered its verdict following a six - year trial prolonged by the 63 - year - old 's health problems .
Mr Chiluba has famously extravagant tastes - spending millions on designer clothes from Europe .
He has a huge collection of shoes , all of which have two - inch high heels built - in to disguise his diminutive stature .
' Harassment and shame '
After 10 years in power , Mr Chiluba handpicked his successor , Levy Mwanawasa .
But Mr Mwanwasa almost immediately stripped his predecessor of immunity from prosecution and launched an anti-corruption drive , which targeted the former president .
AT THE SCENE Jo Fidgen , BBC News , Lusaka
As it became clear that he was going to be acquitted , Frederick Chiluba - a deeply religious man - looked up and whispered a prayer .
His many supporters crammed into the court whooped and clapped as the magistrate delivered six not guilty verdicts .
Elation turned into chaos as the diminutive former president , in his trademark high heels , left for home where he gave an impromptu news conference .
The devil had been defeated , he declared , and he criticised foreign countries for meddling in Zambian affairs .
Thanking God , his wife and well - wishers , he closed proceedings with a rousing hymn .
The culmination of that process was the verdict read out by Judge Jones Chinyama in a six - hour hearing .
" We are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused stole funds , " he told the court .
Mr Chiluba - who was president of the impoverished southern African nation from 1991 to 2001 - had argued that he was targeted in a political witch - hunt by the British , Zambia 's former colonial rulers .
In a separate case two years ago , the High Court in London ruled that Mr Chiluba had defrauded the Zambian government of £ 23 m using London - based bank accounts .
After his acquittal on Monday , Mr Chiluba lashed out at the Zambian government for putting him " at the hands of a foreign land and imperialists " .
" For seven years I 've been subjected to harassment and shame and embarrassment , " he said .
His wife , Regina Chiluba , was jailed in March for receiving stolen funds while her husband was in office .
She is appealing against the sentence .
Two businessmen , on trial with Mr Chiluba , were convicted of embezzlement .

Ian Astbury believes iTunes kas killed the album .
And all the people who download single tracks are proving him right .
But is it too soon to say RIP to the LP ?
This summer has seen the loss of many greats : the King of Pop , the king of psyche - garage - pop ( Sky Saxon ) and arguably the finest of British rock journalists , Steven Wells .
I can surely be forgiven for failing to realise that the album died at the same time .
" Albums are dead , " declared the Cult 's Ian Astbury , no less , to the El Paso Times last month .
" The format is dead .
ITunes destroyed albums – the whole idea of the album .
Nobody buys albums , it 's been proven . "
Astbury went on to tell journalist Doug Pullen of his admiration for Radiohead : " I find their albums highly listenable .
I get lost in a body of work . "
But in the main , his point seemed to be that we may as well just leave the LP to draw its last breath .
The most recognisable part of Beethoven 's Ninth is the Scherzo .
Perhaps it does n't suit our flighty 21st - century existence to drop out for more than an hour to listen to the full symphony .
Why bother wasting time on the whole of Dark Side of the Moon when Money alone will do ?
The album proper , some say , began in 1956 with Peggy Lee 's Black Coffee , for which the songs were carefully chosen and ordered rather than thrown together .
The Beatles ' Rubber Soul and the Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds marked the dawn of the golden era , and rock groups were divided by critics into " singles " and " albums " bands .
The most versatile and successful acts swung both ways , but for some , only a 20 - minute , vinyl - side excursion into the centre of the mind would suffice .
The album was a trip , and you had to do the whole thing .
The album was dealt its first blow by Dire Straits .
Forgive them , for they know not what they did .
In 1985 , their digitally recorded full - length release Brothers in Arms was the first to sell a million copies on CD .
And , for the first time , UK album - buyers were able to easily flick their way past tracks that bored them , without having to move the stylus by hand and avoid losing the Blu - tacked coin that weighted it down .
These new optical - disc consumers could also ignore the rest of Brothers in Arms , if they desired , and stick the 8.26 - minute - long hit Money for Nothing on repeat ad infinitum ( if you had the vinyl version , it was shortened to 7.04 ) .
The speed with which pundits have been kissing the album goodnight has only grown since the mass adoption of the MP3 as music format of choice .
Last November , the rock writer Chuck Klosterman claimed Guns N' Roses ' Chinese Democracy would be " the last album that will be marketed as a collection of autonomous - but - connected songs , the last album that will be absorbed as a static manifestion of who the band supposedly is , and the last album that will matter more as a physical object than as an internet sound file .
This is the end of that . "
I 'm not sure Klosterman has been proven right just yet .
The recent excitement over the Mercury prize shortlist shows that an award that celebrates the album , rather than just a few tracks by an artist , continues to be relevant .
However , many reviews now recommend just a few songs to download , leaving the others – the so - called filler tracks , many of which improve with time – to languish in obscurity .
Surely now is the time for a counter - revolution .
Failing a neo-Luddite crusade to destroy the shuffle and track - skip capabilities of every MP3 player in the world , we must promote the virtues of the album as a whole .
The single - track counter - revolution begins here : we do n't just want the chocolate fancies in the window , we want the whole bloody bakery !
The Rise of A Postmodern Racist Movement ?
A Friday email cited by Ta-Nehisi Coates , at the Atlantic ...
Yesterday evening I was to attend to the Health Care summit with ( D ) Rep Betty Reed and ( D ) Rep Kathy Castor , I'm a Precinct Captain ( 203 ) in Tampa and we received our talking points to rebut any NEGATIVE GOP talking points on healthcare .
I never made it in the building .
I 've never in my life really experience outright racism in a public place .
Signs of Obama hung in effigy , racial slurs on signs , people chanting negative words ( too many to list ) and outright screaming at Obama supporters .
The hatred was in their eyes and they actually scared me for a moment .
At first I was shocked , then a little scared and then I got outright mad in the span of 1 minute ..............
I actually left ( the " hood " would have come out ) .
I was totally blown away it was a mad house .
I 'm kinda mad at my self now , because I left .
I 'm still shaking my head in awe .................... I 'm still cold inside .
There seems little question that something odd is going on with the healthcare debate .
Foremost is the ridiculous extent to which the debate has been entirely commandeered by flagrant , outright lies -- things about euthanasia , and death panels , and the like , abject propaganda peddled directly from House and Senate offices .
We have had lying in our discourse since the beginning of that discourse , but it has been a long while since the fabrications have been so blatant , so absolutely without even the smallest grain of truth .
To take a Republican - sponsored healthcare provision that rather innocently and uncontroversially extends insurance coverage to those that want to create their own living wills and turn it into a declaration that the government will decide every five years whether or not you should be euthanized is something out of the Protocols , or out of Saddam 's Iraq , or a mimicry of the worst and most stupid and most absurd of North Korean propaganda towards their own citizens .
Likewise , the explicit instruction to protestors not to debate , but to aggressively attempt to shut down the meetings entirely -- not normal .
It is perhaps the best possible approach for insurance lobbyists to take , if their goal is to protect the profits of their industry -- but it is still not normal .
We have always had the fringes of such speech , but I cannot recall a time it has been so celebrated as the formal solution to political debate .
Certainly not by a major political party , coupled with the majority of their most popular pundits and talking heads , coupled again to lobbyist groups with long histories of corporate astroturfing .
And the proud shuffling just - up - to - the - line - of - violence , right in the very faces of their own representatives of Congress , requiring police protection in order to escort those elected representatives safely from the meetings -- that part is new .
That part is not normal .
It is more than a little troubling that each of the recent , most explicitly aggressive and loud and factless " movements " to appear on the scene since our first black American president took office appear to be , in large part , made up of the same people .
Categorizing them informally there are the birthers , people who do not believe President Barack Obama is truly an American .
There are the teabaggers ( our name for them , cough , not theirs ) , a group that suddenly came to the conclusion that a tax structure that was begrudgingly tolerable in 2008 , under Bush , is now the highest form of tyranny a mere handful of months later .
There are the deathers , those that seem to quite firmly believe the propaganda of eugenics and euthanasia being cheerfully peddled to them by national leaders , and who take the conspiracy theory to absolute heart as being the nearly unavoidable result of any attempt to reform the straining , hyperexpensive and increasingly incompetent American healthcare system .
But these are not three disparate movements with three different practitioners , three different conspiracy theories that simply happen to share the same summertime stage .
In practice and organization they are one movement , a single collection of the same set of animated citizens and televised leaders , and their signs decrying fascism , Naziism , communism , taxes , euthanasia and outrage over 1960 's - era Hawaiian government paperwork mingle freely at every protest .
If you find a newly minted tax protestor , you are as likely as not to find a birther and a deather as well , all tucked neatly inside the same polo shirt .
They are nearly exclusively white , predominantly middle aged and elderly , and unambiguously conservative .
Many of those shouting against their government are already participants in the same " socialized medicine " they decry , but to a person will not consider their Medicare to be of that evil ilk .
It is , in short , a movement made up of the enfranchised and enabled ; people who have gained every benefit from the politics of America and yet who feel in their very bones that they are the oppressed ones , the ones who have nothing left to lose , so rapidly is America falling away from them .
It is rare to run across any movement so deeply angry -- or more to the point , a movement which explicitly celebrates anger as the primary mission of their activism .
They are not willing to listen to any factual evidence that contradicts their own beliefs in whatever dark conspiracies have been peddled to them ; they have in fact made it their publicly proclaimed mission to block any such explanations from even being attempted .
That seems the operative element of discourse , of late .
It is angry beyond any objective rationale .
It is actively hostile to fact .
It finds the mere premise of debating a political argument to be deeply offensive .
And as a movement , it is large .
Pondering the email he was sent , Coates writes :
One thing to keep in mind is that race , and racism , have rarely ever acted alone .
One of the best points that Phillip Dray makes in his classic history of lynching is that epidemics of lynching often coincided , not just with an expansion of black rights , but with increased labor mobility among white women .
So fear of white women , and their independence , as well as fear of sexual competition , all worked in concert .
It was n't simply " I hate niggers " -- it never is .
It was " I do n't much like black people , and prices are going up , and I have to let my wife work , so I can survive , and I 'm scared she wo n't stay with me if she 's not dependent on me and I 'd die if she left me for a black guy . "
Or some such .
Ditto for the Civil Rights Movement .
It was n't just racism -- it was class also .
In the South you had this black middle class that always had to be deferential to the most poorest white person in the world .
The prospect of losing that deference , of already being lower than the white aristocracy and now also being lower than a class of blacks too , wreaked havoc .
It seems at first a bizarre thought , a mere freeform hiccup of the brain , but between a half - dozen different commentators I am apparently already far from the first to have it : it seems to me like the last time we saw public discourse be as intentionally devolved as it is today was during , of all things , American desegregation .
That was the last time you had deeply conservative southern governors and states yelling about secession because the federal government was forcing things on them that they could n't tolerate , and making belligerent anti-federalism statements over the slightest little thing .
That was the last time America so prominently saw , on television , shouting white mobs and the threats against lawmakers , all explicitly intended not at debate , but as efforts of pure intimidation in order to stop the debate from ever taking place .
That was when you had phalanxes of very dumb but very loud people weeping in front of the cameras that the fabric of America was being destroyed , though they could n't begin to actually tell you why or how , only that it involved black people rising above their place in the world and the subsequent corruption of their government .
That was when you had men with fervent political beliefs walking into " too - liberal " churches and murdering in cold blood those who they disagreed with .
Why on earth would a southern governor choose to raise the specter of secession over something as asinine as a policy dispute over nuances of a financial stimulus package ?
Is that all it takes , is that the end - all issue of issues , over these last long decades , the final thing that brings the rallying cry of " too much ! " from the head of state of , well , a state ?
And we are to believe that the American public , which wants a public option in heath insurance by margins ranging from sixty to eighty percent or so , in various polls , is at the same time is so enraged that the government would dare offer such a thing that they want nothing to do with even holding meetings on the subject ?
And we are to believe in government - mandated Death Panels , now , if government dares assure you that your health insurance will optionally cover living wills , if you desire to have one ?
Now , how it is that a healthcare reform debate has managed to raise a viciously angry , assertively fact - hostile and debate - hostile political climate that brings back national memories of American desegregation seems outright baffling .
Except that many of the paranoid healthcare protestors are " teabaggers " as well , and many of those " teabaggers " are " birthers " besides , and the whole parcel is , from polling , clearly a fringe movement based most substantially in the southern states , the only remaining stronghold of the party that contains them .
And -- there is no way around it -- America has just now elected the first black president .
The very first , after two centuries and then some , and even though I am in the terribly liberal , very nearly socialist hellhole of California I can still go no more than a few miles from my home and see the confederate battle flag hanging from a living room window , or stuck to the bumper of a worn and battered truck .
Before we ever had healthcare town halls , the teabaggers - now - eugenics - protestors were purportedly all about taxes : they had large , conservative - promoted protests about how unfair the entire affair was , and Obama held prominence as the be-all , end - all cause of it all .
Now , their taxes under Obama were actually going down , not up , but that major , presumably all - deflating fact did n't make so much as a dent in the movement .
It simply did n't matter : they still insisted that under Obama , taxes were suddenly at socialist comma fascist comma Europe - like levels .
The same people , all denizens of far - right conservatism , did n't have fits about their taxes under Bush -- it only came up as prominent , so - called " popular " movement at the exact moment Obama became president .
Likewise with the birther movement .
There is no documentation that can deflate it ; there is no final number of reporters from the right , the left and the center who have , can or could go see the original certificate and report back that all is in order ; there is no number of public birth announcements or assertions from the officials of the state of Hawaii that can dim the candle of their beliefs .
Some of the them hold up signs with the President 's name misspelled , Barrak , or with swastikas or sickles or other emblems of past tyrannies : they seem to be less than serious in their grounded explorations of the man 's origins .
We did n't have a nationwide epidemic of people buying up weapons and ammunition under that terrible menace to the nation , Bill Clinton , though those years saw far more substantial gun legislation than anything any Democrat has proposed this decade .
But when Barack Obama was elected , it started immediately , and continues to run full speed .
The last poll this site commissioned was startling .
From a prominent and credible pollster , it showed beyond question how very explicitly racial the birther movement is , and it can not help but raise questions of motive .
Maybe this fight is a postmodern segregationist one after all , postmodern because it is not even about the thing it is purportedly about , but fought through weird three - times - removed proxy issues that even the participants themselves do n't really grasp and heaven knows have no actual information on .
The mere continued presence of ingrained racism is nothing surprising .
We had strong rattles of the old segregationists during the Reagan years , and over and over in every " immigration " debate from then until these last summer days , where people like Pat Buchanan moan about how we 're becoming a not - white nation , thereby destroying their own visions of America , and where Lou Dobbs pivots seemingly effortlessly from virulent anti-immigration rhetoric to being one of the few talking heads to give televised credence to allegations of suspicious foreign - ness against a mixed - race President .
That may be the difference ; this time we 've got a black president , the first one ever , and one that received not a bare minimum of votes but delivered a true political spanking to the conservatives that rallied against him , and maybe that one small fact turns out to be the only thing it takes to turn the usual muttering about federal meddling and states ' rights and incipient brownness - slash - socialism into full - on talk of secession and eugenics and organized intimidation explicitly plotted to discredit even the concept of discussing national issues .
Because it seems to be the same people -- white , ultra - conservative , mostly from the south and from rural areas -- and the same general arguments , and the same climate of aggressively irrational , proudly uninformed , thoroughly paranoid fury .
There is not a conservative politician or talking head in the country that would not deny it up and down , of course , and be red - faced that anyone would even suggest it .
But the current climate is the current climate , and has been documented on every television screen .
We 've got governors yelling about secession , and major politicians peddling stories of imminent threats to your family and your children by the very government they are supposedly a part of , and every day the town hall footage just seems to look more and more like a modernized version of the mob attacks against citizens and legislators during old anti-desegregation rallies , and we do n't need to say " sooner or later someone will be shot " because it has already happened , and multiple times , and in truth it never really left us , these last fifty years .
As of yet it is only an idle , troubled thought , good for nothing .
But as Coates says , even during racism it was n't about racism , it was always about a nebulous something else .
Given how readily every lie is latched on to , and how furiously everything to the contrary is shouted down , one wonders if even the protestors truly know what they are protesting against .
Megrahi is the only person to be convicted over the bombing
Read Brian Taylor 's blog US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has reiterated her opposition to the possible release of the Lockerbie bomber from prison in Scotland .
She said it would be " absolutely wrong " for the Scottish Government to release Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi or transfer him to jail in his homeland of Libya .
Megrahi , dying from terminal prostate cancer aged 57 , dropped his second appeal against conviction on Tuesday .
Some 189 Americans were among the 270 people killed in the airliner bombing .
" I knew a lot of these families .
I talked with them about what a horror they experienced , " Mrs Clinton said .

" I just think it is absolutely wrong to release someone who has been imprisoned based on the evidence about his involvement in such a horrendous crime . "
The BBC's Daniel Sandford in Washington called it " uncharacteristically undiplomatic language " from Mrs Clinton .
" The intense pressure on the Scottish justice secretary went up a further notch with this intervention from Hillary Clinton , " he said .
Last week , Mrs Clinton personally expressed to Kenny MacAskill her view that the bomber should serve out his sentence in Scotland .
Scotland 's Finance Secretary John Swinney said the justice secretary had gone to " significant lengths " to listen to everybody 's opinion on the case .
He told BBC Radio Scotland : " He 's obviously met with Mr Megrahi and he 's listened to a whole range of different representations .

" That 's the right and the proper thing to do .
" Kenny MacAskill is now considering the details of all of those representations and the reports which he is required to take . "
Mr MacAskill is due to decide within the next two weeks on an application for Megrahi 's release on compassionate grounds , as well as a Libyan government request for a transfer to allow him to serve out his sentence in his homeland .
Earlier this week , a letter from seven US senators including Edward Kennedy and John Kerry urged Mr MacAskill to keep Megrahi behind bars .
Condition ' grave '
On Tuesday , judges at the High Court in Edinburgh who accepted Megrahi 's application to drop his appeal were told Megrahi 's health had recently worsened very considerably .
By dropping his appeal , Megrahi has removed one potential obstacle to his transfer to a jail in his homeland .
However , a Crown appeal against the length of his sentence is still ongoing .
Scotland 's top prosecutor , Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini , will now have to consider whether that should also be dropped .
Megrahi is serving a life sentence of at least 27 years following his 2001 conviction for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 .

Yeah you are right that one day the earth will be fully occupied .
And I also think that many wars will be fought between many countries for resources such as water , land , etc. as earth moves forward with it 's population .
And also many more forests may be cut down to provide land for people to live .
This disturbs the balance of the eco system and will even have consequences like global warming , green house effect etc .
So due to all reasons , one day sooner than later , the earth will be no more .
In order to prevent this groups of population can should leave the earth .
But where will they leave to ?
That will depend on the technology then .
If we have the technology for humans to survive in Mars , then this planet is the best option for storing human population .
I do n't think that the your 100th floor theory will work out , because it 's not just shelter we need .
We need many other commodities in the same way that everyone else does .
The problem is if we can find enough of these raw commodities for each and everyone when even today one - third of the world population is in poverty .
Hope this response gets rated positive !
Happy mylotting !
New Zealand is running out of space for its burgeoning prison population and has decided to start using shipping containers to house its inmates .
The Rimutaka prison near Wellington will be the first jail in New Zealand to confine prisoners to shipping containers .
A shipping container unit with 60 beds is being set up on a field in the prison grounds .
It will house high to medium security inmates and will be staffed by up to 25 guards .
The New Zealand Corrections Minister , Judith Collins , says 12 years ago there were 5,000 prisoners , now there are nearly 8,500 .
She says shipping containers are cheap and effective .
" The container cells being evaluated are modern , clean , but hardly Club Med .
Our prisons should be places that people do n't want to return to . "
It is estimated that in 10 years time , New Zealand will need 5,000 more prison beds .
The Republican Party has a huge problem on their hands .
They are quickly being taken over by the most extreme , paranoid , fringe elements in our society and this case is just another glaring example of the path they are on :
BOISE , Idaho —
An Idaho Republican Party leader who helped oust the state GOP chairman in 2008 faces charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after an altercation escalated while he photographed a home with a delinquent mortgage .
Challis McAffee , 33 , the GOP chairman from the Boise suburb of Garden City and one of 231 voting members of the Idaho Republican Central Committee , was in Ada County jail after being accused of pointing a gun at the homeowner .
McAffee , a backer of libertarian - leaning former GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul and an activist in this year 's anti-big - government " Tea Party " protests , helped organize Paul backers who aligned at last June 's Idaho State Republican Convention in Sandpoint with other foes of then - state GOP Chairman Kirk Sullivan .
Sullivan was voted from office in favor of Norm Semanko .
According to police in the Boise suburb of Meridian , resident Robert Lutes called officers just before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday to report McAffee had pointed a .357 Magnum handgun at him during a verbal confrontation .
McAffee acknowledged he pointed the gun at Lutes , according to the police account .
" I 'm unarmed , I 'm an old man , " Lutes , 51 , told The Associated Press on Thursday .
" I 'm trying to find out why he 's taking pictures of my house .
I said , ' Knock on my door , let me know what you want . '
Then , I think he 's reaching for his business card and he pulls out a concealed weapon and I think he 's going to blow my head off . "
Read on ...
A group calling itself Idahoans for Liberty is trying to raise bond money for McAffee , but their version does n't line up with the police account .
The Pirate Party UK has been all but swamped by interest shown since they registered as an official political party last month , its leader claimed this week .
Andrew Peter Robinson , party leader , told The Register : " It has exceeded all expectations .
Put it this way , donations have been coming in so fast that PayPal were concerned we were a fraudulent site . "
Robinson said it was hard to keep up with interest but about 100 people an hour were joining the party .
Robinson said : " The party was born of the feeling at the last European elections that there was no one to vote for and a group of us were jealous of people in Sweden who could vote for the Pirate Party . "
There is no organisational link , or funding , between the two groups although they do talk through the Pirate Party International site .
The group is now registered with the Electoral Commission and has four elected officials .
This costs £ 150 , along with £ 35 to register for data protection .
Robinson is realistic about the party 's chances of sweeping to power : " We 're not going to win any seats but we can get these issues discussed . "
The party will look to contest as many seats as funds allow and may even stand at a by - election if there is one before the general election .
Michael Martin's seat in Glasgow may be contested in the autumn , for example .
Standing in every constituency would cost £ 325,000 just for deposits , with nothing spent on posters and publicity .
The pirates , apart from wanting to legalise non-commercial file sharing and ending excessive surveillance , call for reform of copyright laws which they believe are excessively long and fail to benefit artists .
Robinson said : " The system as it is does n't reward artists .
Typical record contracts now grant 95 per cent of revenues to the record label , not the band .
Reorganising that would help make up for a lot of the shortfall from cutting the length of copyright . " ®

The Plasma Team The Plasma Team
Last week , the third Plasma developers meeting was held in the Swiss Alps. 15 developers from 3 continents came to Randa , Canton Wallis to work on Plasma 's code , design new ideas and concepts and to strengthen their bonds as a sub-community within KDE .
Topics of this third Plasma sprint , which is named after a plasma fusion reactor , included but were not limited to Plasma on mobile devices , network - enabled Plasma widgets and a richer user interface thanks to a new animation framework .
Furthermore deeper integration of web services in the Plasma shell , semantic awareness of Plasma components , secure privilege elevation and polishing of the existing functionality , among many other things , were on the agenda .
The results of Tokamak III are , with all due modesty , nothing short of mind - blowing and display the health and swift pace of development of the whole KDE community .
Plasma lead developer Aaron Seigo wraps up " It 's been one of the longest KDE sprints ever , and after a week , we 're all quite exhausted .
Looking back at the results , however , the we have shown impressive progress all over the KDE desktop shell .
We 're reaching out to new use cases , new developers , new devices .
Meanwhile the social aspects within the Plasma team continue to impress me .
The Plasma team has grown into a small community , a group of friends that have set out to revolutionize the desktop .
With the previous KDE releases , we mainly focused on providing and improving existing technology , now we 're pushing the boundaries of the Free Desktop .
Looking at the results that have materialized over the past week , this is the Plasma promise coming true .
And we 've only just begun ... "
Remote Controlling KDE
Dutch Plasma hacker Rob Scheepmaker presented the results of his work on sharing and controlling Plasma applets and KDE applications over the network .
He presented how the user can easily share locally installed widgets over the network .
As an example , he showed how to share the " Now Playing " Plasmoid with other machines and users on the local network .
The " Now Playing " Plasmoid can now be used to control the media player running on another computer , all using KDE 's Plasma technology .
Under the hood , a number of technologies for communicating , orchestrating and announcing local services is used .
For announcing the availability of an applet on the network , the Zeroconf protocol is used .
The orchestration and transferring of applets , data and control commands happens using the JOLIE and QtJolie technology .
The remote widget support is another long - planned feature for Plasma which will become available in the 4.4 release , as Scheepmakers worked hard to ready the API and polish the user interfaces to meet KDE 's standards for inclusion in a main module .
" The remote control of a media player on another computer is only the tip of the iceberg of what we make available across the network .
Prepare for some completely new and truly innovative collaboration and interaction features coming up using this unique new technology " , Scheepmaker lets us know .
Plasmate Development Update
The Plasmate Development Tool The Plasmate Development Tool
Plasmate is the working name for a new Plasma - addon development application .
It provides a workflow - oriented tool to make it easy to create Plasma components such as widgets .
By providing this kind of tool on top of scripting languages that can be used to create Plasma components , the plasma team aims to open development of Plasma add - ons to a much wider audience .
Plasmate specifically targets programmers and designers that are currently focusing on web technologies .
This way , JavaScript ( or rather its ISO - standardized version ECMA ) becomes a first - class citizen to develop Plasma components that can be shared across the network , for example using the new remote widget support or web services such as Get Hot New Stuff , the application - store functionality integrated into many KDE applications .
New System Tray Standard Matures
Plasma core developer Marco Martin a.k.a. notmart has readied the implementation of the new System Tray standard for inclusion into kdelibs and merged it as part of KDE 's core UI framework .
The new system tray standard provide a D - Bus based interface , providing a strong separation of system tray needs and their visualisation .
The goal is to make the system tray more accessible , more consistent in its interaction model and more flexible with respect to displaying its contents .
The idea is that applications register with the systray and provide icons , titles and tooltip information to display .
Those systray gizmos have a status ( " passive " , " active " and " needs attention " ) .
The application ( " client " of the systray ) receives event from the systray , those events are for example " requesting context menu at position x , y " , wheel up / down event , or " activated " .
Systray " clients " have categories .
The categories " System Service " , " Application Status " , " Communication " and " Hardware " are available for application developers to choose from .
A package update notification for example would be in the category " System Services " .
When it 's checking for updates , it would change its status from " passive " to " active " , when new packages or updates are available it would go into " need attention " and ask the user if she wants to install the updates .
The Plasma team has designed the new standard during the previous meeting , Tokamak II .
A first experimental version has been released with KDE 4.3.0 , the Plasma developers around Marco Martin have now merged this work as stable into KDE 's trunk , 6 months after starting the design work on it .
The new specification is being discussed on Freedesktop.org 's xdg - devel list for adoption as Freedesktop - wide standard .
KAuth Provides Secure Privilege Elevation
Secure authorization based on PolicyKit Secure authorization based on PolicyKit
KDE developer Dario Freddi presented the work of his GSoC student Nicola Gigante during Tokamak III .
The project 's aim was to provide fine - grained user privilege elevation using the FreeDesktop.org Policy Kit technology .
Policy Kit provides a D - Bus interface offering control for actions that can be run in a different user context , for example by running certain commands as root .
Freddi readied the KAuth library for inclusion into kdelibs and integrated it with various elements of the user interface , such as the Date and Time configuration module in KDE 's System Settings .
He also added a specialized version of a KPushButton for application developers that can be attached to a certain action to be run with elevated privileges .
This makes it almost trivial to provide direct manipulation of system administration tasks in a secure way , well integrated in the user interface and the set of policies the underlying operating system provides .
" KAuth currently works on Linux and Mac systems , support for the Windows platform will be added soon " , Freddi explains .
More work on integrating KAuth into System Settings and other parts of KDE is needed , but the work up until now surely paves the way to a more secure and at the same time more user - friendly integration of KDE 's desktop and applications with the underlying OS .
New Widgets Exporer
The new widget explorer with the option

The new widget explorer with the optionto publish Plasmoids on the network
Plasma designer Ana Cecília Martins Barbosa presented the work she did within this year 's Summer of Code to her fellow Plasma developers .
The new widget explorer has been developed using a design - driven development approach .
Based on the research results AnnieC gained within the first part of her SoC project , she subsequently implemented a completely new way of adding widgets to the Plasma shell .
During Tokamak III , she implemented additional feedback from fellow developers and was able to merge her work into KDE 's trunk development tree , meaning that it will be available as part of KDE 4.4 in January .
The new widget explorer provides a more beautiful and usable interface for adding Plasma widgets to the desktop or netbook shell and integrates better with other Plasma components such as the Panel controller which is used to manipulate visual and layout aspects of panels in Plasma .
While some more polishing is still needed , the whole team is happy to see yet another Summer of Code project come to fruition .
Plasma Netbook Shell to be Released in January
Plasma developers Marco Martin and Artur Souza demonstrated the new Plasma Netbook project , a user interface specialized to be used on netbook devices .
The Plasma netbook shell has moved to the kdebase module , making it part of KDE 4.4 .
The netbook shell is built around constrains on these kinds of devices , in terms of screen space but also optimized for use - cases around the web .
The Newspaper page of the Plasma netbook shell provides direct access to information from the web that is important to the user , such as news on interesting websites and weather information .
These are only the first step of deep integration of the web into KDE applications and Plasma , more steps towards this direction will become apparent in the next months .
New Anchorlayouts Enhance Canvas - Based Interfaces
Plasma netbook 's application launcher page leverages KRunner plugins to provide all kinds of functionality in a full - screen view .
Application switching , access to the file index , Wikipedia search , a quick calculator -- you name it , the new application launcher provides it in an appealing way , optimized for portable devices .
INdT and Plasma developer Artur Souza presented a project , his team and the Qt developers in Oslo have been working on over the last months .
The new Anchorlayouts provide a way to position user interface elements relative to each other filling a gap Plasma developers have been experiencing when experimenting with new ways of layouting UI elements on the Plasma canvas .
KDE and Plasma on ARM
The Plasma developers worked on running KDE on a so - called " mystery device " , a working name for a class of relatively low - performance devices based on the ARM architecture .
As a reference device , the developers used a 800 Mhz ARM CPU with 512MB of RAM .
During the sprint , KDE 4.2's Plasma was presented running on the device .
The overall performance was quite good , although it showed room for improvement .
Even without having an accelerated graphics driver available at this point , the developers were quite happy with the performance so far as Souza a.k. a
Morpheuz reports on his weblog .
Using Qt 4.6 on the device gave another boost in speed .
" Even with the short time available to make Plasma run on the device , and without having a proper graphics driver available , we can now be sure that running Plasma on this class of devices is absolutely feasible .
I 'm sure that , with a bit more integration work , Plasma will offer a premium choice for UI technology on this new class of devices . " concludes Souza .
Plasma Team Provides Input and Feedback to Qt Developers
Alexis Menard from the Qt team presented the innovations in the new version of the Qt framework .
KDE , and especially Plasma will be able to benefit from vast performance improvements in the QGraphics View canvas .
The addition of Qt Kinetic enables Plasma to easily animate various parts of the UI , using this standard framework .
The addition of Qt Kinetic marks a milestone is what can only be described as a successful collaboration between Qt Development Frameworks and Nokia .
During the first Tokamak meeting in Milan , Italy , Qt engineer Andreas Aardal Hanssen had presented the plans for a standardized and shared animation framework in Qt , oriented , amongst others , towards the need of rich , canvas - based user interfaces .
Subsequently , the Plasma developers have provided use - cases , feedback and API reviews to make sure that Kinetic meets its users ' needs and provides the tools necessary to enhance UIs built on top of Qt with smooth and natural animations while being easy to program .
During the second Tokamak meeting in February 2009 , Qt and Plasma developers Menard presented an example of the Plasma picture frame using kinetic to animate transitions between images in a slidehow .
Qt Kinetic will be part of Qt 4.6 which has recently entered feature freeze and will be released in late 2009 .
The Plasma developers have taken the first steps to be able to use Kinetic in KDE 's upcoming release , 4.4 which will be released in January 2010 .
In the course of the week , a Google Summer of Code project to integrate Kinetic into libplasma has entered review stage , and will probably be merged into KDE 's upcoming release branch in the next weeks .
Menard also talked about vast performance improvements in QGraphicsView and how these were achieved .
For selected use - cases , the performance in handling items on the GraphicsView canvas has been improved by orders of magnitude .
Those changes will automatically become available to KDE by using Qt 4.6 .

Another new piece of technology the Qt team is working on is QML , the Qt markup language .
Menard gave an update of the progress in this field , after Plasma developers had provided an initial round of feedback earlier this year .
QML is an implementation of the declarative UI technology that will make it easier for designers to build rich user interfaces on top of Qt.
The Plasma developers are looking forward to use QML in order to make it easy to build Plasma components in a visual way , much like Qt designer does for traditional widgets .
An important aspect of this kind of developer sprints is the team building and bonding aspect .
Getting away from their keyboards every now and then , the team had a daily nature walk .
With the terrific surrounding of the Oberwallis , the scenery provided a unique opportunity to re-charge the batteries and talk about various things off - line for a while .
Experience with this kind of focused developer meetings has shown that personal interaction is an essential ingredient for good collaboration online .
Activities off the keyboards included hiking in the surrounding Swiss Alps , building a dam in a mountain creek and going up onto the " Kleines Matterhorn " , one of the mountains surrounding the valley at a height of approximately 3800 meters .
The atmosphere in Chalet Nachtigall , ( the " Plasmaniac Mansion " ) was very family - like with the daily lunches and dinners , where everybody sat around a table .
In terms of productivity , the results of this meeting are nothing short of impressive .
Other Achievements
Over the course of the week , the team welcomed a number of visitors , both local and regional .
The local newspaper " Walliser Bote " had published an article and interview with Mario Fux , the organizer and host of Tokamak III , which drew the attention of people from Randa who dropped by to take a peek at how the new breed of technology enthusiasts collaborates .
The team also welcomed Mark " markey " Kretschmann and Myrian " Mamarok " Schweingruber from the Amarok team during the sprint , and a number of local visitors dropped by to find out about the world of Free Software .
Most were attracted by an article in the local newspaper " Walliser Bote " .
The performance of the job viewer in the new Plasma system tray has seen some major performance optimizations .
Davide Bettio has overhauled the structure of Plasma 's configuration dialogs in an effort to reflect the mental model of the user closer , rather than the technological structure of these components .
Sebastian Kügler presented his work on a new , netbook - friendly Plasma network management applet and a work on integrating information from the Akonadi PIM storage framework into Plasma .
Chani Armitage has further polished the work on mouse plugins for Plasma she conducted as part of her Summer of Code project .
Artur Souza has separated the back - and front - end of the Plasma pastebin widget .
This widget now consists of a Plasma applet and a dataengine , making it easier to share this web service between applets .
Ivan Cukic has worked on Plasma 's context , a service using the Nepomuk semantical framework as provider of context information .
In the future , this will be used to adapt applications and the Plasma shell what the user is doing , where he is and other environmental constrains .
Cukic , who is the main developer of Lancelot , an innovative application launcher for Plasma and an alternative to the KDE " start menu " Kickoff , integrated KRunner plugins into KDE 's default application launcher .
While Kickoff is in theory a competitor , or rather a replacement for Lancelot , Cukic showed great team spirit by implementing this substantial improvement into KDE 's default setup .
KRunner plugins are used to provide matches for the search bar which can be found in Plasma 's application launcher , making this technology more accessible to everyday users .
Martin Grässlin , developer of KWin ( pronounced : " Quinn " ) , KDE 's window and compositing manager joined the Plasma sprint to provide feedback about deeper integration between KWin and Plasma , and to implement new border snapping features of KWin , much like the new mechanism Windows 7 provides .
This , and the support for tiling and tabbing , which Grässlin told us will be included in KDE 4.4 , complements nicely the leaps Plasma is making in this release cycle .
Tokamak III Concludes
With all the work on new features , Plasma developers surely did not forget to further stabilize the current set of features .
During the sprint , every day saw annoying bugs being squashed and the less intrusive fixes among them being backported to the 4.3 branch .
A more stable set of features will be made available to the users with the upcoming monthly bugfix and translation updates the KDE team provides -- a number of the improvements made , such as the performance optimizations for the job viewer , are scheduled to become available as soon as KDE 4.3.2 comes out next month .
The Plasma team thanks the KDE e.V. for providing funding to the team , which made it possible to bring people from all over the world together in one place to collaborate on KDE 's primary user interface .
Special thanks go out to host Mario Fux , who not only provided the unique premises of Chalet Nachtigall in Randa , but also took care of all the needs of the developers .
Fux already showed interest in organizing another sprint in the beautiful Randa , if your team is interested , get in contact with him .
Tokamak III was certainly a very unique experience and enabled the developers to fully concentrate on work while gaining new inspiration and ideas .
Without the KDE e.V.'s financial support and the friendly support of Mario Fux , this would not have been possible .
Harry Potter star Ruper Grint has come down with swine flu .
Grint , who plays Harry 's sidekick Ron Weasly , is said to be recovering well .
The young star was ordered off filming “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , ” amid fears that he could infect the cast and crew .
Grint will rejoin the cast , including Irish actress Evanna Lynch who plays Luna Lovegood , for the premiers of “ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ” which opens in New York on July 15 .
Grint was the hit of the Belfast festival last year with his performance as Northern Irish teenager Malachy in the indie hit " Cherrybomb . "
The film centered on Malachy 's battle with another friend for the affections of a girl who drives the friends to dangerous extremes .
Meanwhile , Emma Watson , who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter franchise is expected to move to New York in the fall to attend Columbia University .
Watson says she needs some time away from the Harry Potter circus once " Deathly Hallows " is filmed .
" I ’m so excited .
Living in London , it ’s hard to be anonymous , ” she said .
“ But hopefully , on a campus somewhere , I ’ll fade into the background a bit . ”
“ My whole life has been about Harry Potter and then all of that will shut down and I do n’t know what it will be like , ” she said .
SAN FRANCISCO 
To get an idea of how the atmosphere has changed in the Giants ’ clubhouse over the last two years , consider the scenery .
Long gone is the black leather recliner that monopolized Barry Bonds ’s corner of the room , the area that came with its own climate  chilly .
Into that vacuum Pablo Sandoval zoomed Thursday , hijacking his injured teammate Emmanuel Burriss ’s bright blue electric scooter and racing around the expansive room .
A dervish with a devilish grin , Sandoval weaved around pillars , laundry carts and some objects that were less inanimate ( teammates ) than others ( reporters ) .
Sandoval ’s joy ride was another sign that after the joyless exercise that was the final years of the Bonds era , the Giants are having fun on and off the field .
San Francisco , which has not had a winning record since 2004 and has not reached the postseason since 2003 , sits in an unlikely position  tied with Colorado at the head of the National League wild - card chase .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s administration strongly denied a British report on Thursday that images of apparent rape and sexual abuse of Iraqi prisoners are among photographs that it is trying to prevent being made public .

In unusually forceful terms , the Pentagon attacked the report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper while the White House went so far as to cast doubt on the accuracy of the British press in general .
The Telegraph quoted retired U.S. Army Major General Antonio Taguba as saying the pictures showed “ torture , abuse , rape and every indecency . ”
Taguba conducted an investigation in 2004 into abuse at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Telegraph had shown “ an inability to get the facts right . ”
“ That news organization has completely mischaracterized the images , ” he told reporters .
“ None of the photos in question depict the images that are described in that article . ”
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs went further .
“ I think if you do an even moderate Google search you ’re not going to find many of these newspapers and truth within , say , 25 words of each other , ” he said .
“ Let ’s just say if I wanted to read a write - up today of how Manchester United fared last night in the Champions League Cup , I might open up a British newspaper .
If I was looking for something that bordered on truthful news , I ’m not entirely sure it ’d be the first stack of clips I picked up , ” Gibbs said .
The Obama administration has been on the defensive over its refusal to release the pictures , which were gathered as part of U.S. military investigations into prisoner abuse .
The administration at first agreed to release the pictures , which the American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to obtain through legal action , but then reversed course , citing a likely backlash that would put U.S. troops abroad at greater risk .
ABUSE ALLEGATIONS
The Telegraph said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee .
Others were said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon , wire and a phosphorescent tube .
The Pentagon ’s Whitman said he did not know if the Telegraph had quoted Taguba accurately .
Whitman said he was not aware that any such photographs had been uncovered as part of the investigation into Abu Ghraib or abuses at other prisons .
In an interview with the New Yorker magazine published in 2007 , Taguba was quoted as saying that he saw a video of a male American soldier in uniform sodomizing a female detainee .
Photographs of abuse at the prison outside Baghdad were published in 2004 and caused deep resentment in the Muslim world , damaging the image of the United States as it fought against insurgents in Iraq .
Whitman said the Telegraph had also wrongly reported earlier this month that some of the images whose release Obama wants to block had previously been aired on Australian television .
“ I would caution you whenever you see a subsequent story on photos in this particular publication , ” he told reporters .
“ They now have , at least on two occasions , demonstrated an inability to get the facts right . ”
Taguba , who retired in January 2007 , included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report .
He was quoted in the Telegraph as saying he supported Obama ’s decision not to release the pictures .
“ I am not sure what purpose their release would serve other than a legal one , ” he said .
“ The sequence would be to imperil our troops , the only protectors of our foreign policy , when we most need them , and British troops who are trying to build security in Afghanistan . ”
He added : “ The mere depiction of these pictures is horrendous enough , take my word for it . ”
Council hires hoodie spies to rummage through bins and see what is being thrown away
Worried residents thought their rubbish was being stolen when council ' spies ' dressed in hoodies started rifling through their bins .
Concerned neighbours saw mysterious men emptying their bins into black sacks and loading them into an unmarked white van .
When homeowners questioned the official binmen an hour later they learned their council was conducting a survey of what was being thrown away .
Sneaky : A council snooper takes rubbish from a wheelie bin in this photograph taken by a resident .
Homeowners thought their rubbish was being stolen
The ' spies ' were part of a week - long waste analysis study by the Northamptonshire Waste Partnership , a collaboration of eight local authorities working to reduce rubbish going to landfill .
An external contractor was told to go through the bins of residents .
One thousand houses were targeted as part of the survey , including 780 in Northamptonshire .
But none of the inhabitants of Cedar Close , Irchester , near Wellingborough , Northants , had received any notice from their council about what was going on .
Resident Gillian Barnett , 61 , said the snoopers made her feel ' very uncomfortable ' .
She said : ' Three young men parked outside my house and just started going through my bins - I thought they were pinching my rubbish .
It was very suspicious .
' We have n't had a leaftlet or a letter , all my neighbours were going round asking each other what was happening .
' If they 'd had " County Council " marked on their van it would have been less concerning but as it was nobody knew what was going on .
' It made me worry about what I had put in the bin - I did n't know I was going to be fined or what .
' I heard this was happening in nearby streets like Pine Close too . '
Another resident , who asked to remain anonymous , slammed the council for using ' Big Brother ' tactics .
Worried : Residents of this street in Irchester , Northamptonshire , had received no notice about the council 's plans to sift through their rubbish
She said : ' I 'm cross they 're doing this without our knowledge or permission and I 'm concerned about their motives .
' The people doing this did n't even look official , they were just teenage - looking lads in hoodies .
' It 's such an underhand " Big Brother " thing to do , spying on local people like this .
It 's alarming .
' It puts your back up and makes you feel vulnerable ; we did n't know if we'd get a fine or if they were just looking at what was being thrown away . '
Another resident who asked to be anonymous said she was ' furious ' about the council rifling through her rubbish .
' This sneaky behaviour on the part of the council is underhand and alarming .
' Taxpayers are sick and tired of being spied on by their councils , it is an infringement of both their dignity and personal space '
She said : ' How is this information going to be used ?
You just do n't know .
We were n't told anything .
' I 'm still annoyed .
It feels like an invasion of our privacy . '
Corby , Kettering and Wellingborough Borough Councils have authorised waste experts Resource Futures to go through the bins of people living in their boroughs as part of this survey .
This was to provide Project Reduce - a £ 138 million government - funded enterprise headed by Northamptonshire County Council and Milton Keynes Council - with information about what was being sent to landfills .
Matthew Elliott , chief executive at the TaxPayers ' Alliance , condemned Northampton County Council for what he described as an ' aggressive ' campaign .
He said : ' This sneaky behaviour on the part of the council is underhand and alarming .
' Taxpayers are sick and tired of being spied on by their councils , it is an infringement of both their dignity and personal space .
' People are doing all they can to recycle , if they are throwing something away it 's because they have to .
' This approach is unnecessarily aggressive and a waste of taxpayers ' money and precious resources . '
But a Northampton County Council spokeswoman insisted the survey was purely for informative purposes .
She said : ' This is not a punitive measure and all data gathered will be kept strictly confidential .
' We just want to gather more information about what people are throwing away so we can target our resources to better meet their needs . '
A Wellingborough Borough Council spokesman added that the study was to help improve waste disposal efficiency .
He said : ' The council has been assisting with a study to provide information about the composition of waste we currently send to landfill .
' The information will be used to help find a more efficient way of disposing of household waste that cannot be recycled . '
Corby Council lead member for the environment Cllr Peter McEwan said : ' Landfill charges are currently in excess of £ 60 per tonne and rising .
' It is vital that we continue to search for cleaner , greener ways to treat and dispose of our rubbish . '
A Kettering Council spokesman said the work was completed in their borough last week , adding that the study was being carried out alongside household recycling and composting initiatives .
Bob Neill , Shadow Local Government Minister , said : ' There is growing public concern about town halls ' powers to snoop on people 's homes .
' Laws passed by Labour Ministers have created powers of entry for bin inspectors to enter homes and gardens .
These must be scrapped .'
Entering the final round at Hazeltine National , Tiger Woods held a two - shot lead over Y.E. Yang :
When the final book on Tiger Woods is written , these two names will need to be highlighted : Ed Fiori , Y.E. Yang .
Not Sergio Garcia .
Not Phil Mickelson .
Not Ernie Els .
At least not yet .
Fiori came from behind to beat Woods on the final day at the 1996 Quad City Classic , and Yang did the unthinkable Sunday , overtaking Woods in the final round of a major , the PGA Championship .
Advertisement
Wearing all white , the ghost - like figure shot a two - under - par 70 to become the first player from Asia to win a men ’s major and the first to beat Woods after he had a 54 - hole lead in a major .
Woods had been 14 for 14 as a closer in majors .
Consider this :
Yang started the day as a 20 - 1 underdog , according to an online sports wagering site .
Woods was a 2 - 9 favorite , roughly the same as Secretariat in his prime against your pet cocker spaniel .
“ You never know in life , ” Yang said through his interpreter , Ryan Park .
No , you do n’t .
Woods led or was tied atop the leaderboard until the 14th hole , a drivable par four of 301 yards .
Yang knocked in his eagle chip from some 80 feet to take the lead .
Advertisement
He never relinquished it .
Woods put himself in position to make birdies at Hazeltine National but could n’t buy one on the greens .
He spent much of the round muttering to himself in frustration .
He had only three one - putts .
“ I made absolutely nothing , ” he said .
“ I had a terrible day on the greens .
. . .
I hit the ball great off the tee , hit my irons well .
I did everything I needed to do except get the ball in the hole . ”
In shooting a three - over 75 , Woods made just two birdies .
He did n’t really crack a smile until he graciously congratulated Yang on the 18th green .
Advertisement
“ Y.E. hit it great all day , ” Woods said .
“ It was a fun battle . ”
The tournament was still in doubt until Yang ’s three - hybrid approach on 18 .
With 210 yards to the pin from the first cut of rough , he fired at the flag , and his ball settled eight feet from the cup .
Woods , trailing by one , could have chipped in for a birdie that would have forced Yang to make his putt .
Advertisement
Yang , the 37 - year - old native of South Korea , does n’t speak much English .
But despite a limited vocabulary , his politeness comes across .
Asked in English to describe his emotions at that moment , he replied : “ I think : ‘ Tiger , miss the chip - in , please . ’ ”
Maybe even pretty please .
Woods did miss , and Yang knocked home the birdie for an eventual three - shot victory .
Advertisement
“ He ’s a world - class player and he had nothing to lose , ” said his caddie , A.J. Montecinos .
“ He said : ‘ I ’m not nervous . ’ ”
Montecinos , 35 , who played for Jackson State and first caddied for Yang at Q - school in 2007 , said his boss is a delight .
“ He ’s very low - key and easy to get to know , ” Montecinos said .
“ When the general public gets to know him , they will fall in love with him .
He ’s got a heart as big as this place . ”
Yang did n’t take up the game in earnest until he was 19 .
Since 2002 , he has won in Korea , Japan and China , and claimed his first PGA Tour title in March at the Honda Classic in Florida .
Advertisement
And now , the man who entered the PGA Championship ranked 110th in the world is a major winner .
“ It just means the world right now , ” Yang said through his interpreter .
“ It has n’t really sunk in , but I do know the significance of it . ”

By Don Fitz
August 14 , 2009 -- St. Louis --
Did you hear about the town hall meeting in St. Louis on August 6 , where union thugs attacked a black conservative and sent him to the hospital with multiple injuries ?
Well , it did n’t happen exactly like that .
In fact , events were the opposite of what talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly broadcast and what the corporate media relayed across the US .
The right - wing Tea Party group announced to the world that their supporter Kenneth Gladney was assaulted by Elston McCowan , who is an organiser for the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) .
Earlier this year I worked closely with McCowan , a black minister , when he ran for mayor of St. Louis on the Green Party ticket .
Since nothing that I heard fit the McCowan I know , I interviewed him about the August 6 incident .
“ I was one of six or seven SEIU members and staff who went to the meeting on ageing that [ US House of Representative member ] Russ Carnahan ( Democrat , St. Louis ) held ” , McCowan told me .
“ When the forum started , the Tea Party people started yelling that they wanted to talk about Obama ’s healthcare proposal .
So we told them to stop shouting because we could all ask questions after the speakers .
“ Then the Carnahan folks then said that you could only ask a question if you had written it on one of their forms .
But they had n’t given any of the forms to either Tea Party or SEIU .
So both groups left the meeting in a bad mood . ”
Walking outside , McCowan saw Gladney selling buttons of Obama in blackface and Obama smoking weed .
Feeling insulted , McCowan asked why a black man would be hawking material denigrating the first black president as he pointed to one of the buttons .
“ When I pointed at the button , Gladney slapped my hand .
So I told him not to hit me and pointed at it again and repeated my question .
He smacked my hand even harder , hit me several times and pushed me down .
As I went down , I grabbed him by reflex to break my fall .
I hit my shoulder and something popped .
I lost consciousness for a moment but soon realised that Gladney continued to hit me .
“ Another SEIU guy , Perry Molens , came over and told Gladney , ‘ He ’s a minister and wo n’t fight back .
He ca n’t see out of one eye .
Stop hitting him !’.
When Gladney kept on , Perry tried to get him off of me and threw a punch in the process .
“ I do n’t know why Gladney had an attorney on hand , but his attorney came over yelling ‘ You two attacked him !’.
Gladney went off to find cops and told them to arrest us .
The cops would n’t listen to us and did what the Tea Party people told them to do .
They arrested me , Perry , a newspaper reporter and three supporters of healthcare reform . ”
Media echoes right wing
The account you just read did not appear in St. Louis media or national reports that picked up the story and certainly was not addressed on right - wing talk shows or web sites .
They all presented Kenneth Gladney ’s story that he was peacefully selling buttons when a half dozen union thugs jumped him .
They claimed that he had to be taken to St. John ’s Mercy Center for “ injuries to his knee , back , elbow , shoulder and face . ”
Close examination hardly backs up this bizarre criminalisation of the victim .
A frame by frame analysis of the You Tube video seen across the country which is available at http://stlactivisthub.blogspot.com/2009/08/questioning-right-wing-story-on-last.html shows a large black man , who is McCowan , on the ground .
Gladney claimed that four people attacked him , but the video shows only one person ( McCowan ) grabbing him as he was falling .
It shows Gladney getting up unobstructed , which contradicts his claim of being attacked .
It is especially hard to believe that McCowan hit him while McCowan lay on the ground .
In one interview , Gladney claimed that McCowan hit him in the face .
Yet , the video has Gladney asking McCowan , “ Why did you hit my hands ? ” .
That ’s an unbelievably odd question for someone struck in the face .
Another video clip shows a person in an SEIU shirt standing over McCowan to protect him , which also is not consistent with Gladney ’s story .
The video records Gladney saying “ I ’m gonna beat the shit outta him ” , and shows a Tea Party person holding him back as his fists are clenched .
Despite evidence that Gladney was doing fine , he had an ambulance take him to the hospital .
Tea Party transformed Gladney into a brutalised hero as they picketed SEIU headquarters two days later .
The front page of the August 9 St. Louis Post - Dispatch carried a photo of Gladney in a wheelchair surrounded by adoring Tea Party supporters in front of the SEIU office .
The photo is interesting because the only hint of any injury is a bandage on Gladney ’s knee .
Whatever damage he suffered to his face and elbows was miraculously healed in less than 48 hours .
It is also interesting that a person being pushed around in a wheelchair is the same person who appears on You Tube throwing punches , jumping up and getting cops to arrest union members .
Elston McCowan ’s injuries are real .
His shoulder was dislocated and his shoulder bone is chipped .
He is perfectly willing to make his hospital records of August 6 made public .
Would Kenneth Gladney also be willing to make his hospital records public so we could all verify the severity of injuries he sustained to his face , elbows and back ?
Or were they just a publicity gimmick to get on the Rush Limbaugh show ?
Real Issue : healthcare reform
Of course , it ’s the issue behind the issue that ’s most important .
Why is there such intense hostility to healthcare reform ?
And why now ?
Why do hundreds of people contort their faces into pure hatred at the idea of medical care for those with low and moderate income ?
On the surface , it seems like a hatred for socialism or for a government providing anything for its people .
Disdain for government programs ca n’t be the only reason , since half of Tea Party supporters at some meetings receive Medicare [ http://zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/22263, Paul Krugman , `` The Town Hall Mob ’’ , August 10 , 2009 ] .
A lot of it is simmering hatred of having a black president , with white racists lying in wait for what they perceive as a trigger to let them fire .
The St. Louis episode shows that there is nothing that white racists love more than a black person doing their dirty work for them .
Part of the hate certainly stems from the fantastic stories being spread that the Obama healthcare plan would give free healthcare to immigrants with brown skin and euthanasia to elderly whites .
Many are oblivious to the fact that the plan would actually do very little except prop up the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
Health insurance industry
Nevertheless , the insurance industry is behind the hate campaign .
If you have never heard Bob Dylan sing “ Only a Pawn in Their Game ” please Google it and ponder the lyrics .
Insurance companies are terrified that this could be the beginning of the end for their leeching profits from a sick healthcare system .
So they feed every rumour and oppose every possible change , even if that change would do nothing to threaten them [ counterpunch.com/mokhiber08102009.html , Russell Mokhiber , ``In Defense of Disruption ’’ , August 10 , 2009 ] .
The health insurance industry glues the other sources of hostility together .
Several themes run through the frenzy of anti-healthcare reform across the US .
These themes are all too familiar in our history :
Business ( in this case the health insurance industry ) stirs up hysteria over mythical disasters that could unfold if there is reform ;
Business interests prey upon underlying ethnic hostility ( such as resentment over a black man in the White House ) ;
Obsessing over the horrors of change , right wingers seek to shut out discussion by progressives ;
The right projects their own violent urges onto the left , physically assaults them , and then denies , minimises and / or rationalises their own violence ;
The right relies on the police and / or military to support them ;
The corporate press extols the virtue of the police in defending the public order ;
Supposed progressive politicians cave into the right ( i.e. , after the August 6 attack , the “ liberal ” University City neighbour of St. Louis cancelled a town hall meeting ) ;
Like a dog chasing someone running from it , the right wing is emboldened as politicians cave in .
This cluster of events surrounding the Tea Party upsurge is reminiscent of anti-labour mobilisations throughout the history of union organising .
St. Louis
activists know how parallel the scenario was on a far grander scale following the great general strike of 1877 .
The civil rights movement was , and still is , characterised by an amazingly similar set of tactics used against it .
In recent decades , the right wing has trotted out the same script for attacking environmental movements .
Most memorably for St. Louisans , when anti-genetic engineering activists mobilised for a 2003 conference , Monsanto persuaded the police to arrest protesters and shut down entire areas of downtown [ see http://www.greens.org/s-r/32/32-02.html].
When under the gun , it ’s tempting to say , “ Maybe we should n’t ask for so much ? ” .
But backing down only encourages them .
After the fray in St. Louis , Democrat Russ Carnahan placed equal blame on “ both sides ” , indicating he has no intention of holding Tea Party accountable for Gladney ’s actions .
Part of the reason that Tea Party is so brazen is that the highest leaders of the Democratic Party will have doctors and nurses arrested for daring to speak on behalf of meaningful health reform .
DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds , or even thousands , of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution , authorities say .
A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients .
Kristen Diane Parker , who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver , has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients , investigators say .
She had hepatitis C , which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008 , authorities say .
She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009 .
Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker .
According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration , Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C .
She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients .
Parker quit after she was found in an operating room where she was not allowed to be .
She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl .
Hospital officials then contacted the DEA .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Hepatitis C
Parker is in federal custody facing three drug - related charges .
If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient , she could face up to 20 years in prison .
If a patient dies due to her actions , she could face life in prison .
In a statement to police , Parker said , " I can't take back what I did , but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life , and so does everyone else . "
Her attorney could not be reached Friday .
Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there .
However , hospital officials do not believe that that many patients were exposed .
" We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period , " a statement on the hospital 's Web site states .
" It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C. "
Another 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4 , 2009 , and July 1 , 2009 , when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs .
Audubon is also contacting patients .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer .
All About Illegal Drugs
This week the Magazine posed 10 awkward questions children ask their parents .
Here are suggestions , from readers and experts , on how to answer these stumpers .
Where do bees go in winter ?
Do n't know the answer ?
You 're not the only one .
According to a new survey , four out of five UK parents have been stumped by something their children have asked .
So we posed our own question - what difficult things have children asked you ?
We then threw 10 of the best back to the readers , asking for kid - level answers you would offer .
Here 's a selection of the best - along with suggested answers from a philosopher and from experts from the Science :
So what ?
So everything campaign .
1 . WHY DON'T ALL FISH DIE WHEN LIGHTNING HITS THE SEA ?
What about the fish ?
" The lightning spreads out through the whole of the sea , so there 's only enough electricity to give each fish a tiny electric shock , so small that it would n't even notice . "
Matt , Winchester " Think of it like this :
If you poured a drop of Ribena into a teaspoon , you would see that is was a very dark purple colour .
Now , if you poured that into a bath full of water , it would spread out and soon disappear completely .
Lightning is just like that - when it hits the water , it spreads out straight away and becomes harmless to all but those at the very point where it entered the sea ( lightning moves a lot more quickly than Ribena , but does n't taste as nice ) . "
Darryl , Cardiff Expert 's answer from the Institute of Physics : " Fortunately , only very unlucky fish ever get killed by lightning .
Air is an electrical insulator , which means that electricity cannot normally flow through it .
During a lightning storm , the very large voltage between the cloud and the ground causes the air in between to break down along a very narrow path , and all the electricity passes down this path ( called the lightning streak ) .
When someone is killed by lightning , he or she has unluckily become part of the path and the enormous current that passes through the body kills him or her .
Sea water , on the other hand , conducts electricity so as soon as the current enters it , it spreads out in all directions and any fish in the way would probably only experience a small current passing through it , so sparing it from death .
Only fish very near the water 's surface would be killed .
A fish as little as a foot below the surface would probably be quite safe . "
2 . HOW MUCH DOES THE SKY WEIGH ?
The sky can be measured in elephants .
Lots of elephants " About the same as 10 million million elephants . "
Stu , West Bromwich
" The sky weighs 14 pounds for every square inch on the earth 's surface .
That ends up being more than 11 billion billion pounds . "
Kop , Salt Lake City , Utah , US " More than you think , kid .
The Earth has a surface area of 197 million square miles .
Multiply that by four billion to give you the number of square inches .
With atmospheric pressure being an average 14.7 lbs ( 6.6kg ) per square inch , this means that the sky weighs roughly 5.2 million billion metric tons .
Now go to bed . "
Boris , West Midlands Expert answer from the Science and Technology Facilities Council 's Space Science and Technology Department : " If you want the total weight then it 's about one millionth of the mass of the Earth , which is the equivalent of 570,000,000,000,000 adult Indian elephants . "
3 . WHY CAN'T PEOPLE LEAVE OTHER PEOPLE ALONE ?
" Most of us like having other people around , and enjoy helping others .
But if we feel unhappy , it 's hard to do this .
People who annoy other people are n't happy , but they need friends .
It 's good to be brave and show friendship to them , but it does n't always work . "
Alison Blenkinsop , Aldershot , UK " If people left other people alone , they'd get very lonely very fast , and no one likes being lonely .
If everyone in class kept themselves to themselves , how many friends would you have ? "
Ewa S-R , London Philospher Mark Vernon suggests this approach .
" Human beings are social animals , like ants ; we thrive when we live well together , in families and communities .
But unlike ants who just get on , humans make friends and enemies .
It 's then that we can't let others be .
" Or , a really short answer :
As we make friends , so we make enemies . "
4 . WHY AREN'T BIRDS ELECTROCUTED ON WIRES ?
Is this bird in trouble ?
" Because the wires are only dangerous when there is a way to touch the ground .
If the birds had one foot on the wire and one on the ground , they would be electrocuted . "
Tony Hengeveld , Stevenage , UK " It 's like touching your tongue to just one end of a battery - then your tongue does n't go tingly , but if you touch both ends at the same time , it does .
Electricity has to flow between a positive and a negative , and birds only touch one wire at a time . "
Aidan Reilly , Cambridge Expert answer from the Space Science and Technology Dept : " Being electrocuted involves a current passing through you .
For a bird to be electrocuted it would need to touch two wires at different voltages , or one wire and the grounded structure of the pylon , at the same time .
If they did this there would be a current flow and the bird would be likely to be electrocuted .
However this is very unlikely to happen and electricity authorities also give considerable thought to the design of their pylons to minimise the chance of birds being electrocuted . "
5 . WHAT IS TIME ?
" It 's a big shoelace of beads stretching into the distance and each bead is a little moment where we have done something that we remember - either fun , or bad , or sad . "
Elizabeth Whyman , Crawley , West Sussex
" Time is an idea thought up by people , to organise their lives and make sure everyone knows when things are meant to happen .
So that when Mr A plans a meeting with Mr B they both arrive at the same time on the same day in the same year .
It is a system that counts in years , seasons , months , weeks , days , hours , minutes and seconds . "
Gita , London " Everything is always getting older - the grass is getting older , the cheese in the fridge is getting older , the table in this room is getting older , and people and animals are always getting older , too .
Time is a way of measuring things getting older , a way of helping us to see exactly how much older anything is getting . "
Adam Budd , Edinburgh Expert answer from the Space Science and Technology Dept : " This is a difficult question to answer .
Some scientists may call time the flow of cause and effect .
A more detailed explanation could be , according to the Theory of General Relativity , that time is the path which an object will take through a four dimensional universe when left to itself .
In such a universe , the four dimensions are indistinguishablefrom one another : they are not three dimensions of space and one of time .
Such an approach can be used to explain the time dilation of special relativity - that time slows down as one approaches the speed of light in a vacuum - but this is not an argument that is accepted by all scientists . "
6 . WHY IS THE MOON SOMETIMES OUT IN THE DAY , TOO ?
The moon - out before dark " The moon is actually in the sky for a lot more time than you can see it , but the Sun 's so bright that it outshines it .
It 's like streetlights - if a streetlight is on during the day , you can't see it from further down the street because there 's too much sunlight , but at night you can see the same streetlight from a long way away because everything else is darker . "
Graham Bartlett , Cambridge , UK " Its school is on holiday . "
Freddie , Durham Expert answer from the Institute of Physics : " When the Moon revolves round the Earth , half of the time it is on the same side of the Earth as the Sun , and the rest of the time , they are on opposite sides .
When the Moon and Sun are on the same side , the Moon is ' up ' during the day .
When they are on the opposite sides , the Moon is ' up ' during the night .
So surprise , surprise , the Moon is up during the day as often as it is up at night . "
7 . WHY DID GOD LET MY KITTEN DIE ?
R.I.P. Puss - puss
" If all kittens lived forever , there would be no room in the world for new baby kittens .
Perhaps your kitten died because somewhere in an animal shelter there is a very lonely young kitten who needs the loving home you could provide for him or her . "
Carol Poster , Toronto , Canada " Sometimes , pets get very sick .
Vets try to make the animal better , but they can't always because sometimes the pet is too ill .
It is kinder to let the animal die than to make it live longer but in pain . "
Mark Booth , Stockton on Tees Mark Vernon 's answer : " No - one knows for sure , though many people have tried to find an answer .
What we do know is that when people and pets die , we care for them all the more , which says a lot about why compassion is so important . "
Or , a really short answer : " No - one knows , but you know you care . "
8 . WHY DO I LIKE PINK ?
Because you like flamingoes and flamingoes are pink ?
" Most people have a favourite colour .
It 's their favourite because seeing it makes them feel good .
You like pink now , but when you are older , you may like a different colour . "
John Woodgate , Rayleigh , England " Because it is a beautiful , happy colour associated with lots of lovely things including flowers , food and rosy cheeks . "
Ros , Cambridge " Girls have been conditioned to like pink .
Society has decided that pink is a girl 's colour and manufacturers have pandered to this stereotype and produced virtually all girls ' toys and most clothes pink .
This means that girls are always surrounded by pink and their favourite toys are pink . "
Daniel Meadowcroft , Stockport Mark Vernon says : " Favourite colours unconsciously remind us of things that we find pleasurable or valuable .
Pink is often associated with fun , like pink sweets ; or the feminine , like pink clothes .
Sweets are pleasant ; the feminine is valuable . "
His really short answer ?
" Pink reminds you of other things you like . "
And psychologist Dr Stephen Briers , of the Science : So what ?
So everything campaign , says : " Traditionally it is thought girls like pink more than boys do .
Scientists have found there may be a biological basis for why girls prefer pink , or at least more reddish colours than boys .
Research has found that although more people prefer blue , women tend to prefer pinker shades .
Some biologists say that this is because in Stone Age times a woman 's role was to pick out reddish - coloured fruit , so they became more sensitive to reddish colours .
Another scientist has suggested females may also prefer reddish colours because they need to be more able to spot when their children are ill with a fever ( and therefore have a more reddish tone to their faces ) , or because changes in skin colour can let you know what a person is feeling and help females to read emotions better . "
9 . WHY IS WATER WET ?
Not too hot and not too cold " Water is wet because it 's not too hot and not too cold .
If it 's too cold , water turns to ice .
Ice is n't wet at all , it 's solid and dry .
It has to warm up to melt back into water .
If water is too hot , it turns to steam .
Steam is n't wet either , it 's more like air .
It has to touch something cool - like the bathroom mirror - then it becomes water again .
It 's lucky for us that water is wet when it 's not too cold and not too hot .
Just right for bubble baths . "
Mark McAndrew , Manchester , UK Expert answer from Stephanie Bell , of the National Physical Laboratory : " There are two answers to this question :
One answer is about what makes liquids stick to surfaces and ' wet ' them - which is to do with forces between molecules .
Water molecules are ' polar ' - the arrangement of electrons means that electrical charge is n't evenly spread - and this makes water particularly attracted ( electrically ) to many surfaces .
It also causes water to have lots of other interesting properties .
" But why does water feel wet ?
This is for a completely different reason .
When you have water on your clothes or skin , it normally evaporates into the surrounding air .
Evaporation produces cooling , because it takes energy .
The feeling of wetness is actually coldness .
You can test this by comparing water with another liquid - cooking oil - which does n't evaporate so freely .
Fill two small cups ( egg - cups are ideal ) - one with water , and the other with cooking oil .
( Young children should ask an adult to help . )
Let both liquids come to room temperature for a day , or overnight .
Dip one index finger in each liquid , lift them out , and then observe for a few minutes . "
10 . WHY DOES MY BEST FRIEND HAVE TWO DADS ?
" Because that 's how things turn out sometimes .
Real love comes in lots of different packages , but the packaging does n't matter - it is what is inside the package that matters .
Your friend has parents who love and care for him just like we love you .
Being loved is the most important thing . "
John , London " There is more than one job to being a Dad .
There 's helping to make the baby you , and then there 's looking after you and helping you to grow up .
Sometimes one person does all the jobs and you have one Dad , sometimes the jobs are done by different people and you then can have two Dads . "
Gill , Sutton Surrey " A child always starts with one mum and one dad .
When the child is born , the mum and dad are usually best friends .
But just like children , adults can change their best friends .
Sometimes , the mum or the dad finds a new best friend .
When adults find a new best friend , they are often called ' step - mum ' or ' step - dad ' because they are a ' step ' away from their first mum or dad .
When we say someone has ' two dads ' , it might mean their mum was best friends with one of the dads when you were born , then became best friends with another man afterwards . "
Mark Booth , Stockton on Tees Mark Vernon says : " People meet and fall in love .
It 's an old story .
Ideally , their love grows , and they may raise children , as an expression of that love .
Usually , a man and a woman fall in love and have kids .
But it can be two women , or men . "
And his really short answer : " Two men , and two women , can fall in love too . "

EDIT : New Location for post and the blog .
From the main site , which can be found here .
Zen-Sources is a collaborative effort of kernel hackers and enthusiasts to provide the best Linux kernel possible .
We include code that is not yet found in the mainline kernel in an attempt to support the latest hardware , new features , security fixes , optimizations , etc .
Now , on to the important stuff :
Installation Guide for Gentoo Linux . ( here ) .
I recommend following the hand based git setup .
( here ) .
Arch Linux Install Guide ( here ) .
Ubuntu Guide . ( here ) .
For other distros , see the git mentioned in 1 .
( or check the repos and forums forums for your distro )
As you might have guessed from my recommendation , I have been using the git based setup on my Gentoo Linux install as my primary kernel .
It has worked for me most of the time ( there have been instances where the use of a kernel in rc stages has induced a bug or two – but this has seldom been the case and there is always the possibility to switch back to the stable release of zen sources ) .
There is a long list of projects that are included in zen sources ( see the full list here ) but the major advantages that I would think worth mentioning are :
Zen Tune
Brain Fuck Scheduler ( do n’t judge on the name )
BFQ
No problem with suspend / hibernate ( and this is without TuxOnIce )
I would definitely suggest everyone to have a go at this .

We already know that Facebook can be an incredible tool for building and strengthening friendships and relationships .
We also know that it can be a relationship buster .
And now , a recent study makes the claim that " increased Facebook use significantly predicts Facebook - related jealousy " in romantic relationships .
The study , published in the CyberPsychology & Behavior Journal , analyzed the effect of Facebook use on the romantic relationships of college students .
The report concludes that there is a " significant association between time spent on Facebook and jealousy - related feelings and behaviors experienced on Facebook . "
Is Facebook destroying our relationships ?
An Overview of the Study
The research , conducted as part of a larger study on Facebook use by college students , identified items that could contribute to romantic jealousy .
308 respondents ( skewed female , 231 to be exact ) were then surveyed on if any of those factors were present .
These include gems like " How likely are you to monitor your partner 's activities on Facebook ?
and " How likely are you to become jealous after your partner has added an unknown member of the opposite sex ? "
The result ?
Specific factors make Facebook a breeding ground for relationship jealousy .
The researchers identified four themes that contributed to jealousy on Facebook .
They are as follows :
- Accessibility of information : Increased info about the interactions of significant others lead to increased monitoring and jealousy for 19.1 % of participants - Relationship jealousy : 16.2 % of respondents were explicitly linked to Facebook use contributing to jealousy - Facebook as an addiction : 10.3 % of participants had major difficulty limiting the amount of time he or she looked at his or her partner 's Facebook profile .
- Lack of context : 7.4 % of respondents referenced how Facebook can be ambiguous and that , without context , jealousy can be spurred over misunderstandings .
If you 're interested to learn more about the study , we 've included the entire CyberPsychology & Behavior article below :
What 's to Blame : The Technology , or the Personality ?
The sample size and the gender skew do n't make this a concrete and irrefutable study , despite regression analysis being used to address the gender skew .
Still , the conclusions do make sense .
With more information at a partner 's fingertips , he or she has more events ( i.e. the friending of the opposite sex ) that can spur jealous feelings .
In the end , it 's more about the personality type than the technology .
Certain personalities have a tougher time trusting significant others .
The technology is simply an enabler of his or her personality issues .
Obsessive types will still check someone 's phone or accuse others of cheating .
The entire issue 's thorny .
That 's why we agree with the study 's final conclusion :
This study provides evidence of a relationship between Facebook use and the experience of jealousy in that context , though further research is needed to better understand this feedback loop because the nature of our data could not fully explain this process .
Future research must directly examine the effects of various triggers on the experience of jealousy and on the time individuals spend on Facebook .
We'd be interested in studying this issue further .
In the meantime , what do you think ?
Is Facebook the cause of increased jealousy , or is it more about the personality ?
