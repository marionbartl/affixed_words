ROME ( Reuters ) -
When in Capri , do n’t wander off the beach in a bikini .
If you go to the sea in Eraclea , near Venice , remember that building sandcastles is forbidden .
And do n’t even think about mowing your lawn at the weekend in Forte dei Marmi .
Emboldened by a nationwide crackdown on crime and a government decree giving them extra law - and - order powers , Italian mayors have issued a string of often bizarre by - laws to enhance “ public decorum . ”
Public displays of affection in a car can earn you a fine of up to 500 euros ( $ 745 ) in Eboli , feeding pigeons is off - limits in the centre of Lucca while in Novara groups of more than two people are forbidden from lounging around in parks at night .
Italian newspapers have dubbed this year ’s holiday season “ the summer of bans . ”
But this week one town hall was forced to acknowledge things may have gone too far .
Rodrigo Piccoli , 33 , called national radio to protest after he was fined 50 euros for lying down in a park in the northern city of Vicenza to read a book .
The mayor has since promised to drop the ban .
Acclaimed Internet security researcher Dan Kaminsky detailed a flaw in the current architecture of the Internet today , firing the starting gun for a race between hackers who can now take advantage of the vulnerability and the big companies who have yet to patch their systems .
Speaking to hundreds of technology security professionals and enthusiasts at the annual Black Hat conference in Las Vegas , Kaminsky said that a majority of the Fortune 500 have protected their machines with a series of fixes developed in secret since March .
Kaminsky coordinated an industry - wide effort that brought out patches from Microsoft , Cisco , Sun Microsystems and other major technology vendors , and customers began applying them after he issued a public warning a month ago .
The hole lies in the Domain Name System , which steers Internet users seeking a site by title , such as www.google.com, to a numerical address .
Kaminsky showed today how hackers could corrupt the process , taking users to an imitation site that could install malicious programs .
He called the problem the worst discovered since 1997 .
The standing - room only crowd gave Kaminsky two ovations , in part for the technical significance of the find and in part for his handling of the crisis .
Microsoft , Google , Yahoo , Facebook , MySpace , EBay and many Internet service providers have secured their machines .
" We got lucky with this bug , " Kaminsky said in his talk , saying other profound flaws are lurking that will be just as hard to resolve .
" We have to have disaster - recovery planning .
The 90 - days - to - fix - it thing is n't going to fly . "
Kaminsky also showed how the flaw could be used to attack places that some professionals had believed immune .
The Secure Sockets Layer , signified by " https : // " at the beginning of a website address , could be circumvented , as one example .
Impostors could fool the authentication companies , such as Verisign , and so get an approved digital certificate shown to site visitors , though Kaminsky said those companies have revamped their procedures .
A large number of firms simply sign their own certificates , which an impostor could do , without dissuading consumers from continuing .
" Everywhere you look , SSL shoots itself in the face , " Kaminsky said .
Corporate firewalls can likewise be thwarted through computers connecting to outside partners , such as payment processors .
Other scary scenarios include intercepted and manipulated e-mail coming from trusted parties and the fact that automatic software updates , which are a key way to get security fixes installed automatically , can easily be hijacked .
There are so many different ways for malicious actors to try to use the flaw that Kaminsky said it marked the start of a new era of hacking .
" DNS is the Achilles ' heel of the Internet , " agreed Joris Evers , a spokesman for security company McAfee Inc .
" There 's a lot of attention that 's been focused on this -- and that 's good . "
In an interview , Kaminsky said that more than 120 million home broadband users have already been protected , and that workplace systems might be more at risk .
Some attacks have already occurred , and Kaminsky said he was most worried about the tens of millions of sites that have a link to click on if users forget their passwords .
A hacker could pretend to be specific users and get the passwords sent to them .
Ordinary computer users can't do much to patch their own machines , though they can prod their employers or Internet service providers to act .
They can check to see if patches have been applied by visiting www.doxpara.com and clicking on " Check my DNS . "

McCain's Olympic buy
McCain -- seeking to keep his new buzz parity with Obama and using his successful fundraising -- has placed an even bigger buy than Obama for Olympic television ads , Ad Age reports .
McCain will spend $ 6 million to Obama 's $ 5 million advertising during the Games .
He 's also up with a new spot , " Broken , " his first in a while that is n't about Obama , but touts McCain as " the original maverick . "
UPDATE : Jeanne Cummings points out that McCain -- unlike Obama -- has to spend down all his money before the convention , when he switches over to public financing .

Code - commenting is so basic and so universal that every programmer , regardless of the language that they practise , thinks that they know all there is to know and that their way is the only sensible approach ( I am no different in this respect ) .
I guess that ’s why there are so many blog postings offering advice on commenting ( you can add this one to the list ) .
Even the elite of programmer bloggers are having their say .
Steve Yegge covered it and , more recently , so did Jeff Attwood .
Jeff ’s basic advice , that you would n’t need so many comments if you wrote the code to be more self - explanatory , is sound but the idea that we should be aiming for some kind of perfect code that has no need for any comments is dangerous .
It ’s not a sensible goal for beginners and inexperienced developers .
Tell them that they should write good code without any comments and they will deliver on the second part but struggle with the first .
Even among experienced developers , assuming for a moment that it is possible to write perfect code that does n’t require comments , there will be far fewer who are capable of this than there are who think that they are .
The other arguments against commenting are even weaker in my opinion .
Yes , poor comments are … well … poor .
So do n’t write poor comments , write good ones .
And yes , if comments become out - of - sync with the code then they are not helpful .
So do n’t let the comments become out - of - sync , they are part of your code and should be maintained / refactored along with the code itself .
I do n’t believe that I ’ve read a piece of code and thought “ wow , this has far too many comments ” .
Unfortunately , I ’ve had the opposite reaction all too often .
I do n’t for one moment believe that it is possible to write quality code without any comments .
Take Jeff ’s own example :
Here ’s some code with no comments whatsoever : r = n / 2 ; while ( abs ( r - ( n/r ) ) > t ) { r = 0.5 * ( r + ( n/r ) ) ; } System .
out .
println ( " r = " + r ) ;
Any idea what that bit of code does ?
It ’s perfectly readable , but what the heck does it do ?
Let ’s add a comment .
// square root of n with Newton - Raphson approximation r = n / 2 ; while ( abs ( r - ( n/r ) ) > t ) { r = 0.5 * ( r + ( n/r ) ) ; } System .
out .
println ( " r = " + r ) ;
That must be what I was getting at , right ?
Some sort of pleasant , middle - of - the - road compromise between the two polar extremes of no comments whatsoever and carefully formatted epic poems every second line of code ?
Not exactly .
Rather than add a comment , I ’d refactor to this : private double SquareRootApproximation ( n ) { r = n / 2 ; while ( abs ( r - ( n/r ) ) > t ) { r = 0.5 * ( r + ( n/r ) ) ; } return r ; } System . out .
println ( " r = " + SquareRootApproximation ( r ) ) ;
I have n’t added a single comment , and yet this mysterious bit of code is now perfectly understandable .
Sorry Jeff , but that ’s not “ perfectly understandable ” .
I agree with extracting the square root code into a separate method with an appropriate name , but your second version ( the one with the comment ) was more informative since it mentioned which algorithm you were using ( in your version , the maintainer is going to have to figure that out for themselves ) .
Also , we ’re still left with at least two poorly - named variables .
We can forgive the use of n for the parameter since that ’s kind of a convention but what the hell are r and t ?
In my opinion , this is better :
/** * Approximate the square root of n , to within the specified tolerance , * using the Newton - Raphson method .
*/ private double approximateSquareRoot ( double n , double tolerance ) { double root = n / 2 ; while ( abs ( root - ( n / root ) ) > tolerance ) { root = 0.5 * ( root + ( n / root ) ) ; } return root ; }
Alternatively , if you do n’t like the verbose comment at the top , you could either rename the method to something like newtonRaphsonSquareRoot ( if you are happy for the method name to be tied to the implementation ) or put an inline comment in the body explaining that this is the Newton - Raphson method .
Any of the three variations will communicate useful extra information to the maintenance programmer , who can then Google “ Newton - Raphson ” if they want to find out more about it .
Remember that code is written only once but read many times .
It should be tailored for the reader rather than the writer .
This is all very well , but we ’re still lacking some information .
Why the hell is Jeff calculating square roots in this way ?
Why is he not using the library function ?
Is it because he does n’t like the answers it gives him ?
Is it for performance ?
Who knows ?
Well - written code will often answer the “ what ? ” and “ how ? ” questions with few or no comments , but you often also need to answer the “ why ? ” question too .
Avi Pilosof covers this in his response to Jeff ’s post .
Avi argues that rather than comment the code , you should comment the business justification for writing the code that way .
This may mean inserting reference to particular requirements or issue reports .
So yes , favour code that is self - explanatory , but I do n’t believe that you can always achieve the necessary clarity without a few well - placed comments to aid understanding .
Code that is obvious to the author today is rarely obvious to the maintainer next year ( or even to the author next month ) .
And if you still really believe that your code does not need any comments , then I hope I never have to maintain your code .
Back in January we pointed out that research was underway in Phoenix to create a surgery - practice application using the Wiimote .
They 've finished the project .
That 's the device at the left , and the researchers have found that for a fraction of the cost of a high - tech simulator , they 've improved residents ' skills in certain procedures by 50 percent .
" One of the problems we 've had over the years is we had no method to teach surgeons surgical skills without going into surgery , " said Dr. Mark Smith , a co-developer and a gynecological surgeon at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix .
" We now have simulators that help them develop those skills .
The problem is they are incredibly expensive - like a flight simulator for a pilot .
This gives us a much less costly way to train these fine motor skills that the surgeons employ during surgery . "
WABC - TV in New York did a story on the Wii simulator , which includes video .
News8 Austin , a Time - Warner cable news channel , also features a Q&A with Dr. Smith on its site ( where we got the pic ) .

Georgian soldiers gather during the opening ceremony of “ Immediate Response 2008 ” at the Vaziani military base , outside Tbilisi , Georgia , on Tuesday .
U.S. - Georgia training begins amid Russia strain
Officials : Exercises unrelated to friction between Moscow , ex-Soviet state
MSNBC | Jul 15 , 2008
VAZIANI , Georgia – One thousand U.S. troops began a military training exercise in Georgia on Tuesday against a backdrop of growing friction between Georgia and neighboring Russia .
Officials said the exercise , called “ Immediate Response 2008 , ” had been planned for months and was not linked to a stand - off between Moscow and Tbilisi over two Russian - backed separatists regions of Georgia .
The United States is an ally of Georgia and has irritated Russia by backing Tbilisi ’s bid to join the NATO military alliance .
“ The main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between U.S. and Georgian forces , ” Brig .
Gen. William B. Garrett , commander of the U.S. military ’s Southern European Task Force , told reporters .
The war games involve 600 Georgian troops and smaller numbers from ex-Soviet Armenia , Azerbaijan and Ukraine .
The two - week exercise was taking place at the Vaziani military base near the capital Tbilisi , which was a Russian air force base until Russian forces withdrew at the start of this decade under a European arms reduction agreement .
Close cooperation
Georgia and the Pentagon cooperate closely .
Georgia has a 2,000 - strong contingent supporting the U.S. - led coalition in Iraq , and Washington provides training and equipment to the Georgian military .
Georgia last week recalled its ambassador in Moscow in protest at Russia sending fighter jets into Georgian airspace .
Tbilisi urged the West to condemn Russia ’s actions .
Russia said the flights were to prevent Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili from launching a military operation against the separatist South Ossetia region .
Moscow accuses Saakashvili of preparing to restore Tbilisi ’s control over South Ossetia and the second breakaway region of Abkhazia by force .
Tbilisi says that is a pretext for Russia to effectively annex large chunks of Georgian territory .
Many people will tell you the best way to launch a product is to do so early and iterate constantly .
I ’ve said the same thing , and generally agree with that sentiment .
You do n’t want to spend a year building a product without any serious customer feedback , without putting your feet to the fire in the wilds of the marketplace .
But one of the downfalls of iterating and releasing constantly is that you lose the opportunity to package a launch into a more full - blown marketing and press campaign .
Releasing new features every few weeks does n’t necessarily allow for the time and energy to be put into marketing and selling those features effectively .
That does n’t mean you should abandon the iterative process and the “ release often ” mantra , but think about building towards more major releases while doing so :
Quick product launch to start Iterate & release Iterate & release Iterate & release Release Version 2
So while you ’re iterating and releasing updates , patches , fixes and new features , think about how you can package all of that and additional things into a new version of your product .
This gives you the chance to align marketing , PR and business development initiatives simultaneously .
Standout Jobs launched in late January .
Since then we ’ve released a bunch of new features , fixed a bunch of issues and overall improved the system .
For awhile we were releasing every 2 days to fine tune a bunch of things , and once things “ calmed down ” we got into a weekly or bi-weekly release schedule .
But at the same time , we ’ve been working towards “ version two ” of the product .
It ’s taking the combined effort of what we ’ve done to - date , adding significant new functionality into the mix ( based a great deal on customer and marketplace feedback ) , and giving us the chance to reset the marker for moving forward .
In some ways it will be the “ going out of Beta ” stage for us … which many software companies experience .
With that in mind , I wanted to share a few things we ’re learning and preparing as we move towards a new version of our product ( and here ’s where the “ Big Bang Theory ” comes in , although it ’s hardly a theory , more a string of ideas mashed together … )
Do n’t Get Lost in Development :
It ’s not about disappearing for 6 months and suddenly releasing a completely new product .
We ’re doing more than adding a couple of enhancements , but the development cycle is n’t more than a few months .
So keep the development cycle as short as possible , even when contemplating a “ big new release . ”
Align Your Brand :
Now ’s the time to get your brand message and corporate brand in order .
Take a look at your website .
Take a look at the messaging you use to sell / promote your product .
Is it all aligned and making sense with what you ’ll be releasing in the next version ?
If you are going to change those things – i.e. the design of your website , or the brand messaging – then it ’s the perfect time to do it , because you can release all of that simultaneously with the new product version .
Fine Tune Your Business Model : Many companies release quickly ( often with a free product ) and look to implement a business model after the fact .
Iterative releases are n’t ideal for launching business models , because the sum total of the changes made may not be enough to justify charging people .
But when you release a “ new version ” and package it properly , you give yourself the chance to also introduce a good business model that layers on top of the previous success you ’ve had with your free product .
Prep the Marketing and Public Relations Machines :
If you ’re launching a new version of your product , launch it big , and make as much noise as possible .
That ’s my take .
When you ’re iterating and releasing constantly , you ’re building momentum , you ’re maintaining touch points with customers , prospects , etc .
But when you ’re launching a new version , it ’s time to bring out the trumpets and blast ’em .
So have a marketing plan and PR campaign ready to go .
You want plenty of news going out about the release , you want lots of chatter and then you want to maintain that momentum going forward .
Build Momentum Before Launching : Ideally , you ’re making a ton of noise and building up lots of momentum right before you launch the new version of your product .
There ’s no reason for the launch to come out of left field and surprise people .
Get people talking about it .
Let clients know what ’s coming .
Generate as much buzz as you can , to improve your chances of a successful launch .
Do n’t Forget Your Customers :
Your existing customers ( whether using a free version of your product or not ) are your best friends .
Treat them well during the launch process .
Get some of them up and running beforehand as beta testers .
Leverage your happy customers for testimonials and case studies that you can use to promote the launch .
Try Something New :
As crazy as things are in your preparation towards the big launch , now is the time to try things out in a different way .
Or maybe you ’ve had some things you wanted to do for awhile and never got around to in the process of constant iteration .
I ’ve had a few “ backburner ideas ” sitting around that I ’ll try to implement in conjunction with our new release .
It ’s good timing to package those things up , and experiment a little .
Clear Your Schedule :
Do n’t overload yourself immediately after a big product launch .
You ’ll be in crazy - iterative - fix - it mode for awhile , so leave plenty of time for that .
And make sure you have of development plan ready to go once you can see past the trees , so you ’re not caught asleep at the wheel .
Timing is Everything :
The biggest challenge with a “ big launch ” is timing .
You ’ve got developers coding like mad , business people implementing new plans , marketers and PR folks greasing the wheels and everything has to happen at the same time in perfect synchronicity .
Guess what ?
It ’s damn hard to do , and chances are some things will go wrong .
As long as nothing catastrophic happens , any minor slip - ups will go unnoticed by most people .
So do n’t panic .
Mitigate your risk as much as possible with great planning .
Do n’t overstep your abilities .
It ’s better to have a smaller , successful launch than having it all explode in your face .
I ’m a big fan of iterative development and releasing often .
But there ’s also a place for the “ big bang ” release , which I feel is often overlooked by many startups .
You should consider big product launches as a way of drawing a new line in the sand for business and moving forward .

Some people feel philanthropy is only about foundations donating lots of money , but that ’s only one part .
Philanthropy is about people giving their time , help and care to causes they support , making the world a better place to live in .
Philanthropic activities come in many forms , some people choose to contribute a huge sum of money to charity or create a park for the community .
Some like to create facilities for recreation or provide scholarships for needy students .
People love to hate rich people because they are often unaware of how the rich quite often use their fame and fortune for philanthropic purposes .
The following is a list of 25 such outrageously rich people that understand the phrase “ with great power comes great responsibility . ”
In no particular order :
1 ) Warren Buffett

Soros has donated over $ 6 billion , out of which $ 742 million has been directed to projects within the U.S .
20 ) Johns Hopkins
A wealthy entrepreneur and abolitionist from 19th century Baltimore , Hopkins is famous for the philanthropic creation of institutions that carry his name .
Johns Hopkins died on Christmas Eve of 1873 leaving no heirs and $ 7 million , most of it in Baltimore & Ohio Railroad stock to setup his institutions .
At the time this was the biggest single contribution made to educational institutions ever .
As per his request , the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum was setup first in 1895 followed by Johns Hopkins University , the Johns Hopkins Press ( longest running American academic press ) , Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889 , and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1893 .
21 ) Paul Newman
In a career spanning 45 years , Newman ’s face can be instantly recognized , due to his motion pictures and his natural foods brand .
He has become a successful businessman like his father , having established his own food company along with writer friend A. E. Hotchner .
Newman turned into a champion race car driver and is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest person in history to win the Rolex 24 - hour endurance race .
Over the last several years he has donated over $ 90 million to charity turning himself into a generous philanthropist .
22 ) Andrew Carnegie
Born in a poor Scottish family that immigrated to the U.S. , Carnegie became an influential and leading businessman in the American steel industry .
His is a real “ rags to riches ” story .
He is remembered today as an industrialist , millionaire , and philanthropist .
Carnegie believed that the wealthy have a compulsion to return to society , so he gave away most of his fortune to causes like peace and education .
He retired in 1901 at age 66 as the world ’s richest man .
In 1902 he setup the Carnegie Institution to sponsor scientific research and pension fund for teachers by donating $ 10 million .
He also donated $ 125 million to a foundation called the Carnegie Corporation to help colleges and schools .
23 ) Percy Ross
Born to poor immigrants from Latvia and Russia , Ross made a fortune producing plastic film and trash bags .
After giving away over 1,000 bicycles at a children ’s holiday party at the Minneapolis Convention Center in the late 1970s , Ross came up with the idea of doling out cash to his syndicated column readers .
$ 30 million and 17 years later , he closed his wallet saying he felt richer than before having achieved his goal and given it all away .
Through his column he raised money for organ transplants , helped pay for recreational centers and gave away dollars with his simple wisdom .
24 ) Larry Stewart
A millionaire , Stewart became known as Secret Santa for roaming the streets come December and giving money to people .
Stewart , who gave $ 1.3 million over 26 years was in the spotlight when he exposed himself as Secret Santa a few months before he succumbed to esophageal cancer , hoping to inspire others .
His giving commenced in 1979 when he was at a drive - in restaurant feeling sorry for himself for being fired from his job just before Christmas , the second time in a row .
It was cold and he felt sorry for the carhop who did n’t have a warm enough jacket , making just nickels and dimes .
After that he often handed out $ 100 bills .
He also contributed to community causes in Kansas City and hometown Bruce .

He was a guiding member of the Baylor College of Medicine Board of Trustees for 20 years .
And Finally : Bill and Melinda Gates
Having already covered philanthropist colleagues Warren Buffet , Michael Dell , and Paul Allen , how could we forget Bill Gates ?
Though he is still widely known as a ruthless businessman and a technology industry visionary , his legacy will be a very different one .
Much like Rockefeller before him , Bill Gates has all but retired from the life that brought him fame and fortune and has decided to dedicate his life along with his wife , to helping the billions of less fortunate people .
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the world ’s largest transparently operated private foundation in the world and has an endowment of almost $ 40 billion .
MSPaint is actually a very powerful image editor .
Here 's all the things about MSPaint you probably did n't know .
Chapter 1 - Brush Scaling
This is pretty much the most basic thing here .
You may think that the standard brush sizes in MSPaint only come in the three sizes , right ?
Wrong .
Open up a new document in paint , select the paintbrush tool , hold Ctrl and press the + button on the numpad .
The brush size will grow as big as you need !
Amazing , huh ?
This technique also works with the line tool , the spraypaint tool , and the eraser tool .
Chapter 2 - Custom Brushes
This is the one that NOBODY knows -
You can make your own custom brushes in paint !
Select the pencil tool and draw yourself a small textured brush in X color .
Here 's what I did :
Now , select that little image , turn transparency on , hold shift , and drag it around !
Cool , huh ?
You can draw ANYTHING and do this .
Here 's another one I did .
Chapter 2 1/2 - The ' Stamp ' Tool
This is something I improvised .
It 's the ' Stamp ' tool .
I did n't put it in its own chapter because technically it 's part of chapter 2 , but moreso different .
So , I have this image of an old lady :
And I want to put these leaves in her hair .
Now , I could copy and paste all day , but there is an easy way around this .
Select the leaf , turn transparency on , and drag the leaf to wherever you want it .
Whenever it 's there , while it 's still selected , hold shift , click once , release shift , and drag the image away .
:O! It stamped !
Repeat as necessary ( I rotated too . )
Chapter 3 - Image Scaling
So say you scanned something and the image is WAY too big and you want it smaller .
How do you go about that ?
Well , open up paint and paste your image in .
I did n't have anything massive to scan so I used this picture of a Dr Pepper .
Now , say you want it smaller .
You probably try to highlight it and scale it , right ?
It ends up looking compressed and improportioned .
Well , there 's an easier way .
All it takes is a single keystroke !
Ctrl + Plus( Numpad ) to make it larger or Ctrl + Minus ( Numpad ) to make it smaller .
This is especially useful for scaling sprites , as it keeps their pixels proportional .
Chapter 4 - Color Replacement
Say you have drawn something with an absolutely crazy pixel border , and all of a sudden you do n't like the border color .
Like this box I drew .
Now , I want to re-color the border yellow but I have absolutely 0 time and 0 energy .
What do I do ?
I use the COLOR REPLACEMENT FUNCTION !
Select the eraser tool .
In the primary color box , select the color that you do n't like that you want to erase .
In the secondary color box , select the color you want to replace said exiled color with .
Then hold right click and sweep with the eraser tool over the ugly color .
If your drawing is large , scale the eraser brush as needed .
Ta-da !
Chapter 5 - The Grid
Say that you 're trying to edit a piece of pixel art that you drew , and , even though you 're zoomed in all the way , you 're having trouble fine tuning - you 're having trouble positioning the crusor where you want .
This is where the grid comes in .
MSPaint comes with a built - in grid feature , accessable by hotkeys .
To view the grid , simply zoom in to either 6 x or 8x , and hit Ctrl+G .
Chapter 6 - Other Things
Another feature of paint that is more commonly known about is the ' quick undo ' feature .
It does n't really have that much use , and , more often than not , is accidentally toggled by the user .
This ends up in frustration .
So let 's say that you 're drawing a smiley face , and you get the eyes down good .
So then you move onto the mouth , you start drawing , and it 's going good .
But just then , suddenly , you launch into an epileptic seizure .
Your body flails around wildly , and , unfortunately , your hand is not an exception to the flailing .
That seizure just done gone and [ messed ] up your artwork !
But , for whatever reason , your finger is still pressed down on the mouse .
This means that you will be saved the effort of having to reach ALL THE WAY UP to Edit -> Undo .
Quite simply , if you mess up , and your mouse is still pressed , you can hit the opposite mouse button to undo what you have drawn so far .
In our case , a simple right click will revert our smiley back to his no -mouth state .
This feature may not appear to be useful at first , but if you 're drawing small lines and squiggles such as fur or something , this tool is a godsend and may save you some medical bills for repetitive strain injury for hitting Ctrl + Z so much .
Another feature , that was brought to my attention by Hazard Rush Studios is one that is nameless in nature and appears to be completely useless , and may possible have no practical function at all .
It does however require a scroll wheel .
Select the paintbrush tool and start drawing something .
I chose to draw a chicken .
Mid-line , scroll your scroll wheel .
Look what happens !
Your line displaced itself , and then reverted back to its original co-ordinates .
I 'm not sure about you , but this feature appears to be pretty useless ...
... Unless you want to draw an extruded 3D chicken .
And that 's pretty much all I have to teach .
Happy MSPainting !
I 'd love to see any artwork you do in paint , or hear any comments or suggestions - Messenjah 's Profile Page .
Sometimes we feel it necessary to remind our readers that we really love cars .
Honest , we do .
We love cars that are fun to drive , and we especially love cars that offer unencumbered performance with a minimal geopolitical and environmental impact .
Throw in some groundbreaking technological advance and we 're checking our bank accounts to see if we have enough money for a deposit .
Needless to say , the entire Autopia staff is planning on getting on the waiting list for the first consumer - ready Lotus product with an Omnivore engine .
Recession be damned !
Any car you can run on Southern Comfort is worth it !
The Omnivore is a direct injection two - stroke engine with a variable compression ratio system , which means it wo n't waste fuel and it'll run on just about everything but puppy smiles and children 's dreams .
" The engine design is expected to significantly increase fuel efficiency for sustainable bio alcohol fuels , " Lotus Engineering 's Mike Kimberleysaid , which means you should prepare to see rappers filling their 2011 Exiges with Cristal and Courvosier .
A recent " tri-fuel " concept Exige drove like a bat out of Hethel , delivering 270 horsepower and hitting 60 mph from a standstill in 3.88 seconds .
That beats the current gas - only Exige S by 52 horsepower and 22 hundredths of a second , all while minimizing tailpipe emissions and dependence on fossil fuels .
When the " tri-fuel " concept was unveiled in May , Lotus made it clear we 've got plenty of time to save up , because it 's at least four to five years from production .
Of course , there are some drawbacks .
First , we all know biofuels are n't perfect .
There 's that little issue of the long tailpipe , with several studies suggesting biofuels result in more net emissions than fossil fuels .
Lotus counters this argument with a promise of synthetic fuels and lightweight fuel - sipping cars , which might be commercially viable around the time that Lotus is merely a supplier to Tesla .
Another issue is long - term reliability .
Some early direct injection two - strokes had issues with lubrication .
To alleviate that problem , most modern two - cycle engines ( the ones not marked Craftsman ) rely on sophisticated electronic engine management systems .
While the ghost of Joseph Lucas was exorcised from British cars some time ago , we can't help but be wary of an entirely new kind of car engine created by Lotus Engineering , Jaguar and Queen 's University Belfast .
Even if the Omnivore becomes a footnote in the history of alt - fuel supercars , it 's great to see Lotus continue to combine innovation , conservation and exhilaration .
Plus , a one - cylinder two - stroke screaming away from a stoplight is still going to sound a heck of a lot better than any electric car .

Before leaving office George W. Bush will issue a mass pardon , the largest collection of presidential pardons in American history .
Bush will pardon himself , Vice President Cheney , and a long list of officials involved in torture , eavesdropping , destruction of evidence , the CIA leak case and a range of potential crimes .
As George Bush signs the pardons and boards the helicopter to depart Washington as his presidency finally ends , even then , he and those pardoned will worry about the statute of limitations .
There is an important point to this , often not recognized in official Washington during the Bush years , where the unthinkable becomes a way of life , and acts have been done that have never been done by an American president or administration .
Torture violates international law , domestic law , statutory law , customary law , American law , European law — the list goes on .
Eavesdropping without court order violates a statute , FISA , that includes severe criminal penalties .
If the courts ultimately conclude that these laws were broken , as I predict they ultimately will , considering the number of individual violations , and the penalties for each violation , the potential sentencing liability for anyone convicted would be huge .
On the destruction of evidence , disappearing e-mails , claims of executive privilege that I predict will be clearly rejected by the Supreme Court after Bush has departed , arguably false testimony to Congress , attempts to cover up actions that violate the law , the list , again , goes on .
There will be a huge legal debate about the ability of a president to issue pardons so sweeping in their language that they cover all these potential areas of legal liability , and very possibly , it can not be done .
As we approach the election , leaks will increase as they did prior to the 2006 election , from within the administration , about these matters and others .
Legal scholars will debate the legality of a mass pardon .
Congress should pursue every pending and possible legal challenge to claims of executive privilege so completely untenable under the law that even some conservative Supreme Court justices will refuse to uphold them , as conservative justices joined liberals ruling against Richard M. Nixon .
I predict a series of historic Supreme Court cases that will defeat most of the Bush executive privilege claims and permanently end attempts for royalist interpretations of the law that the Bush years embody .
The fact that Bush attempted to seize power in ways that negate the legislative and judicial branches of government , and the fact that Congress was not heroic in defending its rightful place in the separation of powers , do not change the fact that what is illegal is illegal .
This is not merely a liberal issue .
There are many authentic conservatives , true Barry Goldwater Republicans , genuine libertarians , honorable strict constructionist conservative jurists and legal scholars who agree entirely that on occasions George Bush has attempted and at times executed seizures of executive power that violate the American Constitution and American statutes .
Get ready for mass pardons .
Get ready for the long - held precedents of American law to be ultimately if belatedly upheld as spurious claims of executive privilege , to be be rejected even by some conservative justices of the Supreme Court .
Get ready for a long - overdue debate that has barely begun and will be triggered by the mass pardons that will be the last sorry act of the presidency of George W. Bush .
Because it will be legally almost impossible to issue mass pardons so sweeping and universal they would cover every possible offense , get ready for the words " statute of limitations " to enter our public dialogue by January of 2009 as a new president assumes office and the Bush years , finally , are over .

Income splitting is the transfer of income from a person in a higher income tax bracket to a family member in a lower income tax bracket .
Because of the marginal tax rate in Canada , tax rates increase as your income rises .﻿﻿
However , by " transferring " some of your income to a family member whose income is lower than yours , you can pay significantly lower income tax .
And while regulations have tightened in this area in recent years , businesses still have income - splitting strategies available to them that can create considerable tax savings .
There are essentially two ways you can split your business income :
By paying some of it to family members as salary or wages
By transferring some of your income to family members through dividends
Income Splitting Through Paying Salary or Wages
As a Canadian business owner , you can decrease your actual income by hiring your spouse or children as employees and passing along some of your business income to them in the form of salary or wages .
Suppose , for instance , your business 's net income is $ 75,000 .
But your spouse has been working in the business all that year , and you paid them a salary of $ 30,000 .
Your net income drops to $ 45,000 , a considerable tax savings for you .
And , because your spouse 's income of $ 30,000 is taxed at an even lower income tax rate , you get , in effect , a double tax savings .﻿﻿
And Canadian income tax savings are not the only benefits to this tax strategy .
Because your spouse now has an income , they will be contributing to the Canada Pension Plan and able to contribute to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan , helping you both build a more comfortable retirement .
The Rules on Income Splitting by Hiring Family
There are two major rules that govern how Canadian businesses can use this strategy .
Your spouse or child has to actually work for the business .
That means they have to have designated duties in the business , just like any other employee .
And as the employer , you have to keep and maintain the requisite employee records .
Just saying that your spouse worked for you last year and picking a number you like out of the air is not enough .
That means they have to have designated duties in the business , just like any other employee .
And as the employer , you have to keep and maintain the requisite employee records .
Just saying that your spouse worked for you last year and picking a number you like out of the air is not enough .
You have to pay them a reasonable salary or wage .
In other words , the wage should be commensurate with the salary or wage you would pay anyone else to do the same job .
You can't pay them $ 70,000 to do basic office tasks , such as filing and answering the phones , for example .
If your spouse is working for you as an office assistant , you need to pay them a rate equal to what other office assistants make .
Keeping employee records and paying your spouse an appropriate wage or salary is a small price to pay , however , for such powerful Canadian income tax benefits .
If your spouse or child is n't already an employee of yours , maybe it 's time to think seriously about what they could do for your business .
Income Splitting by Dividends
If your business is incorporated , another method of income splitting is to pay dividends to your spouse and children .
The great thing about this tax strategy is its flexibility — the amount of dividends and their recipients can vary from year to year depending on how much income you want to distribute to lower your tax bracket .
To split your income using dividends , you must set up your corporation so that your spouse and children are shareholders ; then you can distribute dividends between family members to reduce your tax burden .
Note that , since dividends are paid to shareholders , the family members do not have to be employees of the business to receive dividends ( although they can also be employees of the business and receive a salary as well as shareholder dividends ) .﻿﻿
Your corporation can be structured so that there are additional nonvoting share classes for family members .
This is especially useful for children , as nonvoting shareholders can receive dividends but do not have the right to participate in decisions relating to company policy .
Rules for Paying Dividends to Family
The rules on split income received through dividends changed as of the 2018 tax year .
Simply put , the current tax on split income , which applies the highest marginal tax rate to split income received by certain family members under the age of 18 , is being expanded to cover some family members over age 18 , thus eliminating the advantage of split income in some cases .
So the key to using this method of income splitting now is to ensure that the dividends are not going to lower - income family members that will be affected by the tax on split income .
You 'll need to pay extra attention to the exclusions in order to ensure those family members are following the rules .
For instance , if the family member receiving the dividend is 18 years old or older , the dividend will not be affected by the tax on split Income if it comes from an " excluded business , " defined by the CRA as :
" ...a Related Business where the individual was actively engaged on a regular , continuous , and substantial basis ... in the activities of the business in the taxation year or in any five prior taxation years of the individual .
" An individual will be deemed to be Actively Engaged if the individual works in the business at least an average of 20 hours per week during the portion of the taxation year of the individual that the business operates , or meets that requirement for any five prior years .
The five taxation years need not be consecutive .
In any other case , whether an individual is Actively Engaged will depend on the facts and circumstances of that case . " ﻿ ﻿
If your business is seasonal , the family member only needs to have worked 20 hours per week during the part of the year your business operated .
There are a number of other exceptions to the new rules surrounding dividends , with very specific criteria .
Before you make any assumptions about what you can or can't do with split income , review the CRA 's guidelines and talk to your accountant about how to put the power of income splitting to work for you .
In what has become an annual summer operation , an army of inspectors turned up unannounced to almost 10,000 venues around France last month .
By July 31 - the first of a two - month " operation holiday food " - they had turned up their noses at 27 per cent of the inspected sites , which they found breached food quality and hygiene norms .
Sponges are very primitive animals .
They do n't have nerves cells ( nor muscles nor eyes nor a lot of other things we commonly associate with animals ) .
So scientists figured sponges split from the tree of life before nerves evolved .
A new study has surprised researchers , however .
" We are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other , that nerves started to form , " said Bernie Degnan of the University of Queensland .
" What we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves , something we never expected to find . "
In humans and other animals , nerves deliver messages to and from the brain and all the parts of a body .
Degnan and colleagues studied a sea sponge called Amphimedon queenslandica .
" What we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves , or what may be called the nerve 's ancestor the proto - neuron , " Degnan said .
They found sets of these genes in sponges .
" But what was really cool , " he said , " is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frogs and flies and the sponge gene became functional — the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals .
The research , announced this month , was published in the journal Current Biology .
Top US admiral says strike on Iran means turmoil
WASHINGTON , July 20 ( Reuters ) - White House military adviser Adm. Mike Mullen said on Sunday he was concerned that any U.S. or Israeli strike on Iran carried a notable risk of more turmoil in the Middle East .
" I think it would be significant .
I worry about it a lot , " Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the " Fox News Sunday " television program .
U.S. officials have played down fears of a military strike against Iran over its nuclear program , which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes .
But Israel fears Iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , and speculation it would bomb Iranian nuclear installations has grown since a big Israeli air drill last month .
" I worry about the instability in that part of the world and ... the possible unintended consequences of a strike like that , " Mullen said .
He said it would be difficult to predict the impact throughout the region or what actions the United States would have to take to contain it .
" Right now I 'm fighting two wars , and I do n't need a third one , " Mullen said , speaking of U.S. military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But he quickly added the U.S. military would be capable of handling another front .
Alternately , he added , the risk of doing nothing is also big .
" It 's a very , very tough problem , " Mullen said .
" But that 's where I think this international community -- and the pressure has got to continue to be brought specifically on Iran to not proceed in this regard . "
Iran faces tougher sanctions after talks on reining in its nuclear program ended in a stalemate on Saturday despite unprecedented U.S. participation .
Mullen said he believed the Iranians are intent on building nuclear weapons .
" We need to figure out a way to ensure that that does n't happen , " he said .
Even as East - West relations have deteriorated to their lowest since the Cold War in the past two years , the United States and the European Union have been at pains to describe Moscow as a valued partner .
Every criticism that Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , has directed towards the Kremlin , has been prefaced by a reminder that Russia is " not the Soviet Union " .
Complex networking using Linux on Power blades
Learn to plan for and create highly available networks within a blade chassis
Blade - based operational models are of tremendous value in the wired and wireless telecommunications domain for several reasons :
Small footprints mean cost - effective use of data center space .
Deployment meets NEBS requirements for distributed deployments .
( NEBS , or Network Equipment Building System , is a set of criteria that networked equipment must meet to qualify for compatibility . )
Cost - effective massive horizontal scalability lowers deployment costs for the telecommunications service provider .
Centralized management support provides better OAM&P support for in - network deployment in service provider networks .
( OAM&P stands for " operations , administration , maintenance , and provisioning . "
The term describes this collection of disciplines and specific software used to track it . )
Built - in support for continuous - availability - based operational models — including upgrades and maintenance activities — avoids service downtime from a subscriber perspective .
These additional considerations are key in a telecommunications service provider environment , especially one with complex configurations :
Multiple VLANs .
These are used for CDN ( Customer Data Network ) and Management ( OAM&P ) traffic .
Considering them separately ensures that subscriber QoS ( Quality of Service ) is effectively maintained across multiple LPARs ( logical partitions ) .
Micro-partitioning and virtualization .
These strategies help maximize the capacity utilization and TCO ( Total Cost Of Ownership ) .
Existing network complexities .
Existing networks can have a higher degree of load variability , requiring resource load balancing among multiple client LPARs .
In this article , we describe an implementation of a multiple VLAN configuration of a blade chassis using Cisco switches paired in an active / passive configuration .
In our example , we configured networks to connect multiple VLANs on a BladeCenter® JS22 using Linux® on Power .
The architecture consists of six Cisco catalyst switch modules with fourteen internal ports and four external 1GB ports each .
To properly leverage all six switches in the chassis , the blade requires six Ethernet interfaces .
Ethernet interface ent0 on the blade maps to the first switch on the blade chassis ; each consecutive Ethernet interface maps to the next available switch .
This mapping creates a limitation , because it does not allow administrators to map the physical adapter on the blade to the switch they choose to map them to .
When creating network architecture for your blades , you must have one physical interface for each Cisco switch you want to use on the chassis .
If some blades do not have the same number of adapters as the chassis , the switches that do not have a physical adapter associated with them on the blade cannot be used by the blade .
It is important to understand how to pair the Ethernet interfaces on the blade and the switches within the chassis .
The first switch in the chassis is normally located in the upper left of the blade chassis , just below the power plug .
It would map to ent0 on the blade since it is the first interface on the blade .
Figure 1 shows the numbering of the switches in our configuration .
Figure 1 . Physical adapter switches in the configuring we 're using
Determining switch pairing is extremely important for high availability .
In a typical configuration , one power distribution unit ( PDU ) supplies power to the top half of the blade chassis while another PDU provides power to the bottom half of the chassis .
If you are creating a redundant solution , it 's important to split the primary and secondary switch between the upper half and lower half of the chassis .
In our case , we created a solution with the following switch pairs : ( 1 , 9 ) ( 2 , 3 ) ( 4 , 7 ) .
Because adapter pairs ( ent0 , ent1 ) , ( ent2 , ent3 ) , and ( ent4 , ent5 ) are on the same physical I/O card , we also needed to make sure that the network traffic for our target VLANs did not travel across the same I /O card .
Our configuration splits traffic across multiple PDUs and across multiple interfaces .
Even though the pairing of the adapters and switches may seem simple , there are multiple steps to configure the IVM ( Integrated Virtualization Manager ) , switches , and LPARs to take advantage of this architecture .
Figure 2 represents the setup of one of our blades with the associated switch , trunking , and VLAN tagging .
This configuration allows multiple VLANs to communicate over the same physical adapters to multiple switches .
Figure 2 .
One of the blades with the associated switch , trunking , and VLAN tagging
In this example , each LPAR has two Ethernet adapters that connect to one Virtual Ethernet Adapter ( VEA ) on the IVM .
Notice that the VEA on the IVM has multiple VLANs associated with it .
Traffic for each VLAN is separated on the LPARs by their adapters .
The VEA trunks the VLANs together and sends them over the Shared Ethernet Adapter ( SEA ) through a Link Aggregation Device and out to the network via one of the chassis switches .
The switches route the VLAN traffic to the appropriate network through the use of VLAN tagging .
Five steps to configuring VLANs
There are five main steps ( and one optional step ) for configuring VLANs for client LPARs on the IVM :
Configure Cisco switches .
( An optional step at this point may be to create a link aggregation device , commonly referred to as the LNAGG device . )
Create 802.1q IEEE VLAN - aware interfaces on the IVM to support the VLANs you want to use on each interface .
It is very important to design the VLANs prior to any work because it is not possible to modify the created VLAN - aware interfaces afterwards .
You would need to delete them and re-add them , which means a big waste of time .
Assign the Virtual Ethernet Adapter to the physical adapter ( LNAGG ) in the Virtual Ethernet Menu on the IVM .
Modify the LPARs properties to map the new virtual adapters to LPAR adapters .
Make sure the LPARs are inactive before performing changes to the network device properties .
Boot each LPAR and configure the new interfaces .
The example in this article is intended for a fresh install of a blade .
Step 1 : Configure the Cisco switches
You may choose to skip this step if the switches are already properly configured with the VLANs that you want to use .
The example does not demonstrate how to configure spanning trees and switch priority for spanning trees that may be required .
If you want to follow the example , then you should configure your switches to match the configuration that follows .
Log in to the switch
Type the following commands in this order :
enable
config
interface GigabitEthernet0/
1
description blade1
switchport trunk native vlan 383
switchport trunk allowed vlan 373,383
switchport mode trunk
The commands configure port 1 on the switch for trunking .
If traffic comes in from the blade to the switch or from the external ports of the blades to the switch and they are not tagged with a VLAN , the switch will tag them with VLAN 383 .
The switchport ( external ports ) will allow only traffic from 373 and 383 , in this case , to route through to and from the IVM's VEAs .
To change which VLANs need to access the port from the IVM , simply change the trunk - allowed VLANs numbers .
Splitting the traffic
Once the traffic is trunked and sent to the switch , the switch will determine which external port routes the VLAN traffic .
In the example , we are sending external VLAN 373 traffic across port 17 , and VLAN 383 over port 20 .
To configure VLAN 373 traffic over port 17 , type the following commands on the Cisco switch :
interface GigabitEthernet0/17
description extern1
switchport access vlan 373
switchport mode access
To configure VLAN 383 traffic over port 20 , type the following commands on the Cisco switch :
interface GigabitEthernet0/20
description extern4
switchport access vlan 383
switchport mode access
After setting the external port configuration , type exit twice to back out of the configuration mode of the command line .
Then run the show run command to see your configuration .
The show run command displays the actively running switch configuration .
The configuration has not been written to memory in the switch , but you can see the changes that are currently running on the switch .
If you look in the configuration , you can see changes we made in the steps above .
Look for the Ethernet port for blade 1 as we configured it :
Listing 1 . Displaying the configuration of switch port 1
interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description blade1 switchport trunk native vlan 383 switchport trunk allowed vlan 373,383 switchport mode trunk
If you issue a show config command , you will see the previous configuration of the interface , not the one we just configured .
If the switch is rebooted in this state , the current configuration will be lost .
To write it to memory , type write on the command line of the switch .
If you run a show config again , the configuration stored on the switch for our interfaces will match the running configuration .
Step optional : Create a Link Aggregation Adapter
A link aggregation device can be used to connect two physical adapters together to look like one adapter .
This is useful for creating an active / passive configuration for failover .
In our example , we wanted to create an active / passive configuration on the blade linking adapter ent0 and ent5 together .
Issue the following command to create link aggregation device ( LNAGG ) with a backup adapter on ent5 from the IVM 's command line :
$ mkvdev - lnagg ent0 - attr backup_adapter=ent5
Use the lsdev command to verify the creation of the LNAGG device .
Listing 2 . Verifying the creation of the LNAGG device
$ lsdev |grep ^ent ent0 Available Logical Host Ethernet Port ( lp - hea ) ent1 Available Logical Host Ethernet Port ( lp - hea ) ent2 Available Gigabit Ethernet - SX Adapter ( e414a816 ) ent3 Available Gigabit Ethernet - SX Adapter ( e414a816 ) ent4 Available Gigabit Ethernet - SX PCI -X Adapter ( 14106703 ) ent5 Available Gigabit Ethernet - SX PCI -X Adapter ( 14106703 ) ent6 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent7 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent8 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent9 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent10 Available EtherChannel / IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation ent11 Available EtherChannel / IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation ent12 Available EtherChannel / IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation ent13 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent14 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent15 Available Virtual I/O Ethernet Adapter ( l - lan ) ent16 Available Shared Ethernet Adapter ent17 Available Shared Ethernet Adapter ent18 Available Shared Ethernet Adapter
In the output from our lsdev command , you can see that the link aggregation device ( ent10 - ent12 ) looks like a physical adapter .
This allows you to map the link aggregation device to a virtual device ( ent13 - ent15 ) via a Shared Ethernet Adapter ( ent16 - ent18 ) .
The SEA treats the link aggregation device ( LNAGG ) as though it is a physical adapter .
The Virtual Ethernet Adapters ( VEA ) ent6 - ent9 are created by default and are not VLAN - aware devices , nor can you modify them to become VLAN aware .
ent0 through ent5 are the physical adapters on the blade server .
Use the attr flag on the lsdev command to see how the LNAGG device maps to its physical adapters : $ lsdev - dev ent10 - attr will produce mapping as shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 . LNAGG to PA mapping with $ lsdev - dev ent10 - attr

Step 2 : Create virtual adapters on the IVM
In this example , we 're going to configure network traffic to flow through the Virtual Ethernet Adapter for VLANs 373 and 383 .
The first step in configuring the solution is to create the virtual adapter on the IVM that is needed to transport traffic to and from the client LPARs .
Let 's create a virtual adapter with a primary port of 373 and a secondary port of 383 .
To create the VLAN - aware interface on the IVM :
Use your favorite ( putty ) telnet program , open a window to the IVM , and log in as padmin ( the default password is " passw0rd " with a " 0 " instead of an " O " ) .
Use the shwres -r virtualio -- rsubtype eth -- level lpar command to list the Ethernet resources : Listing 3 .
Listing the Ethernet resources $ lshwres -r virtualio -- rsubtype eth -- level lpar lpar_name=IVM_01 , lpar_id=1,slot_num=3,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=1 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B503 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=4,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=2 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B504 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=5,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=3 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B505 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=6,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=4 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B506
Use the chhwres command to create a virtual adapter on the IVM that supports IEEE VLAN awareness and the additional VLANs you want on that interface .
To do this , issue the following command from the command line of the IVM :
$ chhwres -p IVM_01 -o a -r virtualio -- rsubtype eth -s 15 - a\ '" ieee_virtual_eth=1 " , " port_vlan_id=373 " , " addl_vlan_ids=383 " , " is_trunk=1 " , \
" trunk_priority=1 " '
The chhwres command tells the IVM how to construct a new VLAN - aware Virtual Ethernet Adapter .
There are some important features of the command that you need to know to create multiple virtual adapters on the IVM : -p partition :
In the command , we are telling the chhwres that there is a change to the IVM partition by issuing the -p command .
: In the command , we are telling the that there is a change to the IVM partition by issuing the command .
-s nn :
This tells the IVM that we are going to use a particular slot number .
If this parameter is not specified , the IVM will use the next available slot .
The slot number is required when a device is removed from the IVM .
: This tells the IVM that we are going to use a particular slot number .
If this parameter is not specified , the IVM will use the next available slot .
The slot number is required when a device is removed from the IVM .
ieee_virtual_eth :
A value of 1 informs the IVM that this adapter supports IEEE 802.1Q .
This needs to be set to 1 if there are additional VLANs that are required .
: A value of 1 informs the IVM that this adapter supports IEEE 802.1Q .
This needs to be set to 1 if there are additional VLANs that are required .
port_vlan_id :
This is the primary VLAN for the virtual adapter .
: This is the primary VLAN for the virtual adapter .
add_vlan_ids :
If trunking is enabled , then this parameter accepts the additional VLANs .
: If trunking is enabled , then this parameter accepts the additional VLANs .
is_trunk :
This attribute must also be set to 1 if you are passing multiple VLANs .
: This attribute must also be set to 1 if you are passing multiple VLANs .
trunk_priority :
When trunking , the priority of the adapter must be set between 1 - 15 .
Ensure the creation is complete by re-running the lshwres command and look for the new devices .
Listing 4 . Displaying the new devices $ lshwres -r virtualio -- rsubtype eth -- level lpar lpar_name=IVM_01 , lpar_id=1,slot_num=3,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=1 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B503 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=4,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=2 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B504 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=5,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=3 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B505 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=6,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=0,port_vlan_id=4 , addl_vlan_ids=none,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B506 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=15,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=1,port_vlan_id=383 , addl_vlan_ids=378,is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B50 F lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=16,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=1,port_vlan_id=6 , " addl_vlan_ids=22,23 " , is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B510 lpar_name=IVM_01,lpar_id=1,slot_num=17,state=1,ieee_virtual_eth=1,port_vlan_id=7 , " addl_vlan_ids=565,566,567,568 " , is_trunk=1,trunk_priority=1,is_required=0 , mac_addr=463337C4B511
Step 3 : Assign the virtual Ethernet ID to a physical adapter
Once the link aggregation device has been created , it needs to be mapped to a virtual adapter .
This is easily accomplished via the IVM GUI as shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 .
Mapping the LNAGG to the virtual adapter via the IVM GUI
After logging into the GUI , select the " View / Modify Virtual Ethernet " from the left - side navigation , then choose the " Virtual Ethernet Bridge " tab .
From this menu you can see the virtual Ethernet adapter we created previously with the 383 primary VLAN and the 373 additional VLAN .
From the drop - down box , you can select the link aggregation device we created in the previous step .
Once the new device has been chosen , click Apply .
This creates a Shared Ethernet Adapter ( SEA ) within the IVM .
Step 4 : Modify the LPAR 's properties
Once a physical adapter or LNAGG device has been mapped to a Virtual Ethernet ID on the IVM , then the virtual adapter needs to be created for each logical partition .
The first step is to log into the GUI on the IVM ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 . Creating the virtual adapter for each LPAR
After logging in , select View / Modify Partition in the upper left corner .
Once the page refreshes , choose the LPAR you are going to modify .
Select the client LPAR in the menu and be sure that your browser supports pop-up menus .
On the pop -up menu , select the " Ethernet " tab ( Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 . Remember to power - off LPAR to modify properties
In Figure 5 , you can see that Virtual Ethernet pull - downs are grayed out ; that is because the LPAR was running when the screenshot was taken .
Make sure the client LPAR is powered off or inactive before modifying the properties .
Use the pull - downs to map the VLAN - aware VEAs to the client LPAR 's adapter on this screen .
Notice that the virtual adapter is associated with one VLAN — this allows the IVM to attach VLAN tags to the traffic as it comes in from the operating systems and sends it out the appropriate LNAGG device .
If more adapters are needed , click Create Adapter as needed .
Step 5 : Configure Linux to use the VLAN - aware interfaces
Once the IVM and Cisco switches have been configured , you may need to do one additional step if the configuration requires static IP addresses for your Linux partitions .
From the IVM GUI , activate the LPAR .
Log in to the box and change your user to root .
Type the following : cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts .
If you perform an ifconfig command , you will see that the virtual adapter individual VLAN mapped to the LPAR .
With your favorite editor , change the interfaces parameters to meet your configuration requirements .
The following is an example of an interface , ifcfg - eth0 , with a static IP address :
Listing 5 .
An interface with a static IP address
DEVICE=eth0 BOOTPROTO=static BROADCAST=192.168.1.31 HWADDR=00:1A:64:8C:B2:32 IPADDR=192.168.1.44 NETMASK=255.255.255.0 ONBOOT=yes TYPE=Ethernet GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
Restart the interfaces using / etc / init.d / network restart .
Conclusion
As with any deployment , planning is crucial to success .
To avoid costly rework , it 's important to lay out your network design before implementing a complex network within the blade chassis .
From our experience , we can tell you that reconfiguring a complex IVM - supported network requires considerable effort ; in fact , the administrator usually must remove the previous configuration before reconfiguring .
Planning is also critical to the install because you cannot add new VLANs to the virtual adapters on the fly in the IVM .
Since you can only have one IVM in the JS22 , you cannot use SEA failover as you can in a traditional VIOS installation .
Link aggregation provides a mechanism for routing traffic across multiple switches in the case of a network failure of a switch .
When considering redundancy in the blade , remember that the top half of the blade is powered by one PDU , while the bottom half is powered by the other PDU .
All these considerations add up to a relatively complex network implementation , so our best advice is to plan before you act .

The draft Democratic Party platform that was sent out last week puts health care reform front and center .
“ If one thing came through in the platform hearings , ” says the document , “ it was that Democrats are united around a commitment to provide every American access to affordable , comprehensive health care . ”
Can Democrats deliver on that commitment ?
In principle , it should be easy .
In practice , supporters of health care reform , myself included , will be hanging on by their fingernails until legislation is actually passed .
What ’s easy about guaranteed health care for all ?
For one thing , we know that it ’s economically feasible : every wealthy country except the United States already has some form of guaranteed health care .
The hazards Americans treat as facts of life  the risk of losing your insurance , the risk that you wo n’t be able to afford necessary care , the chance that you ’ll be financially ruined by medical costs  would be considered unthinkable in any other advanced nation .
The politics of guaranteed care are also easy , at least in one sense : if the Democrats do manage to establish a system of universal coverage , the nation will love it .
Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , — or MRSA , —is a mutant variant of the common staph infection found in hospitals and nursing homes .
What sets it apart from common staph is its resistance to a wide range of commonly used antibiotics .
In the late 1990s , it began to appear in people who had n't been anywhere near a health - care institution .
They were struck with what scientists have taken to calling Community - Associated MRSA .
The disease appears in places where daily , close contact is the norm : schools , day - care centers , and prisons , for example .
If caught early , before it gets into the bloodstream , it is usually treatable with low - grade antibiotics , and its spread can be controlled .
It may even be remedied without antibiotics by draining the lesions it raises on the skin .
Once it passes that early stage , however , it can become a much more difficult infection to eradicate .
MRSA is an important warning sign because doctors are frequently having to use the strongest antibiotics to treat it .
We know this to be an effect of antibiotic overuse .
The end result is a breed of bacteria against which we have little , if any recourse for a cure .
" The challenge that we 'll face is that a growing number of bacterial infections will be more and more difficult to treat .
The reports are rare , but we 're already seeing [ cases ] of bacteria ... where there are no effective antibiotics to treat the infection , " says Dr. Srinivasan .
Right now , these cases are appearing only in hospitals and only in the most immunocompromised patients , but that was once the case for drug - resistant staph , too .
The only real , immediate course of action is education and vigilance about proper antibiotic use , because , as Dr. Srinivasan notes , " our ability to develop new drugs has already been surpassed by the speed with which bacteria are developing resistance . "
Several institutions have undertaken awareness campaigns , like the CDC's " Get Smart " program and the Infectious Diseases Society of America 's " Bad Bugs , No Drugs , " both of which have had good success educating both patients and health - care workers .

State employee wo n't lower flags for Helms
The Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008

RALEIGH , N.C. --
A longtime North Carolina state employee has chosen to retire instead of lowering flags to honor former Republican Sen. Jesse Helms .
U.S. and state flags have been flying at half - staff since Gov. Mike Easley ordered them lowered after Helms died Friday .
L.F. Eason III told his staff at the state Standards Laboratory to ignore the directive .
The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that Eason sent workers an e-mail saying he did n't think it was appropriate to lower the flags because of Helms ' " doctrine of negativity , hate , and prejudice . "
Eason is calling it quits after 29 years with the Department of Agriculture after superiors told the 51 - year - old to lower the flags or retire immediately .
Flags at the lab have since been lowered to half - staff .
We ’ve warned you about them before on our website — but now they ’re on a much more aggressive march all across America .
No longer are they just staying in their classrooms or writing books and articles in the comfort of their offices .
They are “ the new atheists , ” and they are aggressively going after your children , your liberties , and your faith !
According to the print media and websites , the new atheists say “ evangelism is a moral imperative ” to spread their “ good news ” in “ persuading people of the virtues of atheism . ”
They are “ drawing on evolution , ” and are vocally “ hostile to religions , ” especially “ fundamentalist Christianity and Islam . ”
They are “ feeling a real need to convert people , ” and preaching an “ un - gospel . ”
In one media report , it was stated that “ at some point there is going to be enough pressure that it is just going to be too embarrassing to believe in God . ”
One of the most outspoken of this new breed of atheists is the vehement anti-creationist Dr. Richard Dawkins of Oxford University in England ; another is philosopher , Sam Harris .
The Washington Post wrote a major article about Harris and stated : “ How exactly the faithful [ Christians ] will transition to a godless , Good Book - less cosmology is not exactly clear … but he is heartened by countries such as Sweden , where he claims 80 % of the populace do not believe in God . ”
These atheists are not just publicity seekers .
They are very serious about their mission .
Dawkins , from England , was recently crusading across America to proclaim his atheism to newspapers , websites , and at public meetings .
Some people might say to me , “ But there ’s no way Americans will go for atheism .
Most people believe in God , even if they do n’t take the Bible seriously as AiG does . ”
Think back to the 1950s .
What if someone back then said to you , “ Beware , the homosexual movement is on the march — if we do n’t do something , ‘ gay ’ marriages will be legalized across the country . ”
Almost all of us at that time would have said that there ’s no way Americans would ever accept this .
Most people believe that marriage is one man for one woman , so , no , this will never happen in America .
But as you know , it has happened — and continues to happen !
Interestingly , these new atheists liken their growing movement to that of the gay activists .
One stated : “ We ’re in the same position the gay movement was in a few decades ago .
There was need for people to come out .
The more people who came out , the more people had the courage to come out .
“ That ’s the case with atheists .
They are more numerous than anybody realizes . ”
If you think this observation is an exaggeration , just consider the popularity of two recent books associated with these new atheists : The God Delusion by Dawkins and Letter to a Christian Nation by Harris .
Both books bitterly attack Christianity .
Dawkins is more than just angry , though .
He has a purpose , says a reviewer : “ the whole book is meant to change people ’s minds . ”
The God Delusion was # 8 on the New York Times bestseller list , # 10 on Publishers Weekly , and # 2 on the Amazon best - seller rankings in November 2006 .
At the same time , Letter was # 6 on the Times list , and # 8 in the Amazon rankings .
Meanwhile , an increasing number of atheists are attacking our Christian faith in several major newspapers and websites — with their evolutionary beliefs often presented .
It prompts me to ask : “ Why are atheists now getting so much publicity and gaining ground ?
What ’s happened in the culture to allow this ? ”
As we ’ve been saying for years , there ’s been a change in this culture — at a foundation level .
Generations have been indoctrinated by the secular education system and media to build their thinking on human reason , not the Word of God .
And at the base of this is the creation / evolution issue .
Evolutionary indoctrination has produced generations ( even in the church ) who doubt the Bible .
Barna Research discovered that of teenagers today who call themselves born - again Christians , only 9 % believe there is such a thing as absolute truth .
These young people are ripe for “ secular evangelists ” like Dawkins and Harris .
Consider what else the media is saying about this “ evangelistic ” movement :
“ There is clearly an evolutionary explanation for the tools we have cognitively . ”
“ Dawkins is openly agreeing with the most stubborn fundamentalists that evolution must lead to atheism . ”
Atheists “ derive their own worldview from the theory of evolution . ”
Let me shock you further and illustrate how some of these God-haters think .
Quoting Harris , a source reported : “ If I could wave a magic wand and get rid of either rape or religion , ” Harris explains , “ I would not hesitate to get rid of religion . ”
Dawkins insists that Christians have no right to indoctrinate their children in religious “ nonsense . ”
He continues , saying that children being brought up in Christian homes are being exposed to an “ infection ” — and Christianity is the most “ dangerous thing in the world . ”
One of Dawkins ’ recent “ evangelistic ” talks was actually given in a packed church ( the First Parish church in Cambridge , Massachusetts ) !
What times we live in !
A news report stated : “ At first his [ Dawkins ] words are greeted with laughter , and then with resounding applause . . . . ”
The words he preached were from his book :
The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction : jealous and proud of it ; a petty , unjust , unforgiving control - freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; a misogynistic , homophobic , racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal , sadomasochistic , capriciously malevolent bully .
Friend , all I can say is that I praise the Lord that He has raised up ministries like AiG to engage the culture and the church to return to the authority of God ’s Word .
With these militant atheists more and more on the march , you can be assured that AiG needs your prayer support more than ever .
In fact , with the opening of the Creation Museum this year , the attacks on AiG will probably escalate .
I believe many of you agree that the creation / gospel message is vital today .
God is using it at the frontlines of the foundational battle in the lives of countless souls , like this one :
If it was n’t for your website , I do n’t know if I would be a Christian .
I was really depressed last year because there were tons of questions I had about the world that no one could give me answers to .
I started to think that if evolution was true as they taught me in school , why should I believe in God ?
You showed me that the Bible can be trusted .
— C. T. , Michigan
And that ’s why AiG and the website are here : to present the life - changing gospel .
As we begin this new year , I ask you to consider what you might do to partner with us .
The website and future museum are wonderful ways we can counter the atheists ’ message of meaninglessness and hopelessness — and offer the precious gospel instead .
We ’re making great progress , but still need funding to make this happen .
If our website has blessed you , I ask for your prayerful consideration of a gift to help us finish the museum this spring .
The atheists and evolutionists are more aggressive than ever .
Indeed , we need your prayers and support to counter their message .
Will you stand with us ?
Will you pray for us ?
As you ’ve seen , the new breed of atheists is attacking the foundations of our faith as never before !
Please partner with us now to proclaim the gospel — and combat the hopeless message of the evolutionists .

The cowardly suicide attack on the Danish Embassy in Islamabad which has led at least eight people dead is not just an attack on a foreign embassy in Pakistan , it is an attack on Pakistan .
There is and there can be no excuse for this dastardly action , and to make excuses is to become part of the apparatus of validating the terror itself .
There are those who will make misplaced claims about this being an act of ghairat ( honor ) .
Let us be very clear , this is a bay - ghairat ( dishonorable ) act , no matter what the concocted excuse or justification might be .
The Associated Press pictures above ( and below ) tell the story of hate and destruction ; here are the details , from The News :
The death toll in a huge blast near Danish embassy in F - 6 II area in the Red Zone of the federal capital Islamabad on Monday has reached to eight , while seven wounded said to be in a critical condition .
The car blast near the Denmark embassy damaged a boundary wall of the building , while nearby UNDP office premises were also damaged in the blast .
According to sources 10 to 15 kilogram explosives were used in the blast , which also shattered the vehicles parked in the area .
Huge clouds of smoke were seen over the area .
The blast created four feet deep crater sources said .
Police have cordoned off the area to collect evidence about the incident .
Relief operations were underway and the wounded being transferred to hospitals .
While leaders in Pakistan as well as Denmark have condemned the dastardly act , we the people of Pakistan also need to condemn and be outraged at this .
These acts of venom and hate are being done in our name .
And no matter what the cause we need to stand up and say that this cannot , must not , be allowed to happen in our name .
This is just the latest in a string of hate blasts across Pakistan , including in Islamabad .
We at ATP have been worried and have been warning against this culture of violence that has been festering in Pakistan .
ATP commentator Deeda - i-Beena has provided some thoughtful ideas of steps that can be taken to begin addressing this cancer .
It is time we think of them seriously .

JERUSALEM , July 20 ( UPI ) --
An unnamed Israeli security official claims U.S. President George Bush will attack Iran late this year if talks on the Mideast nation 's nuclear program falter .
The Israeli Web site DEBKAfile.com , quoting Israel National Radio , reported Sunday that a " highly placed security - political " official said Bush would order the attack between Nov. 4 , the date of the U.S. presidential election , and his last day in office in January 2009 should Iran not agree to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium .

DEBKAfile.com said the official made the statement shortly after Saturday 's talks between Western powers and Iran in Geneva ended in a deadlock .
Carbon Farming Being Tested As a Way to Store CO2 in Soil
August 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Farms are places of food and commodity production almost by definition .
But that definition is changing with carbon farming .
This new style of farming , which produces soils that store carbon dioxide , is currently being explored by scientists at the US Geological Survey and UC Davis in the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta .
The scientists aim to rebuild lost wetlands in the area .
These wetlands will include rich peat soils that store CO2 .
And the research teams are n’t working on guesswork alone — a test study on an island called Twitchell in the western Delta showed that the experimental process could bury up to 25 metric tons of CO2 each year and eliminate CO2 emissions from current farming practices .
But there are problems with this method of carbon sequestration .
The USGS believes that the rebuilt wetlands could release nitrous oxide and methane , greenhouse gases that are more dangerous than CO2 .
If it turns out that emissions of these gases are high , that could be enough to make the project ’s drawbacks outweigh its benefits .
Scientists also admit the possibility that the wetlands could produce methylmercury , a neurotoxin that is toxic to mammals .
Unfortunately , the dangerousness of these potential risks will be unknown until further study is performed .
We should just make sure that we do n’t create a bevy of new problems by literally burying an old one .

Former Ohio official Blackwell appears in anti-Obama ad
WASHINGTON  Ohio's former secretary of state is featured in an ad that began airing this week in criticism of presumed Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
The ad from the conservative group Citizens United is on Fox News promoting a video documentary of Obama .
It features former Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell decrying Obama 's policies and his coverage by the news media .
Blackwell is a controversial figure in U.S. election history .
Under his oversight in Ohio , many allege the African - American community was largely disenfranchised , unable to cast their votes in the 2004 general election .
Also featured in the ad are Republican strategist the Rev. Joe Watkins and political analysts Tucker Carlson and Dick Morris .
The group airing the ad is organized under IRS rules that permits it to keep donors anonymous .
Obama would be the country 's first black president if elected in November .
Blackwell , a Republican , also has served as Ohio 's treasurer .
He is now a conservative columnist and commentator .
With wire services .
As promised back in June , Internet Explorer 8 beta 2 has been released .
Beta 1 showed promise , but true to its billing as a developer - only release , had a lot of rough edges and was painful to use for any prolonged period .
This new beta is meant for everyone , and should be usable day - to - day .
As well as a host of security , stability , and privacy features , the new IE has a raft of new features and user interface improvements that should make using the browser much more enjoyable .
Suggestions and accelerators
Launching IE8 for the first time after the ( sadly ) obligatory reboot , the browser asks the usual questions about default browsers , default search providers , and so on .
As well as these typical questions , a couple of more unusual ones are asked .
First of all , you 're asked if you want to enable Suggested Sites , one of IE8 's new features .
This off - by - default option lets you discover sites that are similar to the ones you 've already visited , based on which sites other people look at .
The list of suggested sites is shown in a little popup using IE8's Web Slices technology
The other new feature IE8 asks you about the first time it runs is " Accelerators . "
In beta 1 these were called " Activities " ; along with the new name is a wider selection of third - party accelerators in five categories : blog , define , map , send / e- mail , and translate .
The way these work is the same as in beta 1 ; translation , mapping , and definitions are shown in situ in little balloons allowing quick and unobtrusive access to the Accelerator features .
Tabs
IE7's major addition to the Internet Explorer browsing experience was to finally add tabs , years after competing browsers supported tabbed browsing .
IE8 lets you quickly reopen the last few tabs that you closed , which , given the number of times I 've closed the wrong tab by accident , is a godsend .
Similarly , you can reopen every tab that was open when you last quit the browser .
Neither of these features is unique to IE8 , of course , but that does n't make them any less welcome .
One refinement I 'd like to see is the option to automatically reopen the previous session 's tabs as my " home page . "
What is new is IE8 's new tab grouping feature .
Whenever you open a link on a page in a new tab ( whether by middle clicking , ctrl clicking , or right click , open in new tab ) the current tab and the new tab both become colored to indicate that they are now part of a group .
Any further tabs spawned from the group take on the same color .
The grouped tabs can then be closed in a single action .
Tabs can be dragged between groups to regroup them , or ungrouped completely .
I can certainly see myself using this to clear up after epic Wikipedia sessions , although I would like to see a few more tab group features ; for example , though you can close every tab in a group in one action , you can't close every tab except those in the current group .
Redmond , start your photocopiers
IE8 plays catch - up in other areas , too .
The Address Bar replicates Firefox 3's Awesome Bar ; no longer used just for typing in addresses , it searches your history and RSS feeds to provide alternative results .
I like the presentation of results , but having gotten a taste of the feature , I want it to do more ; I want it to show actual web search results ( as it does in Google ) and to also show me anything found in my system ( much like the Vista Start Menu does ) .
Searching for text within a web page highlights all matches simultaneously , which makes scanning pages for the word you 're looking for much easier .
There 's also a new " Caret mode " for keyboard - based browsing .
When Caret Mode is enabled , a caret ( the blinking indicator to show where the keyboard cursor is ) appears in the page and can be moved with the cursor and page navigation keys .
This option may assist screen - readers used by the visually impaired , as the caret position is typically used by such software to determine which bit of the screen gets read .
It 's also far more convenient than using tab to jump between links .
The execution is n't flawless , however ; sometimes the caret gets stuck or jumps around randomly , I suspect as a result of the page 's underlying HTML structure .
The new InPrivate Browsing mode is another feature found in other browsers .
Each InPrivate window has a clear indicator in the address bar , and the feature appears to work very much as advertised .
Any activity performed within the InPrivate session is forgotten as soon as the window is closed .
Standards
As covered in the beta 1 review , a key feature of IE8 is its improved standards compliance .
To recap , IE8 will use " quirks mode " for pages that are missing proper HTML version information , and will default to its new " standards " mode for pages that include the information .
One of Microsoft's ( not entirely unreasonable ) concerns was that this would break many websites ; many sites that enabled standards mode would actually break , because they were expecting standards mode to be nonstandard , as it was in IE7 .
In recognition of this problem , Microsoft has provided the ability to switch between IE8's true standards mode and IE7's fake standards mode .
Beta 1 used an ugly button that we were assured was temporary , and indeed beta 2 no longer includes that button .
Instead , whenever IE8 shows a page that 's using IE8 's true standards mode , an extra " broken page " button appears in the address bar .
If a page appears broken using IE8 mode , clicking the broken page button switches to IE7 mode , which will often be sufficient to fix the page .
IE8 also allows you to default to IE7 mode in three ways : you can add sites to a blacklist , you can use IE7 mode for all intranet sites , and as a last resort , you can revert to IE7 mode for all sites .
I think this range of options is a pretty good compromise .
More disappointing ( although not IE8 's fault as such ) is just how broken many of Microsoft 's own websites are when forced to use IE8 mode .
Windows Live Mail , for example , is quite unusable in IE8 mode :
I have n't obfuscated this picture to hide private information ; that 's how it actually appears .
The Windows Live sites are due to be updated soon , so perhaps these issues will be fixed .
Nonetheless , it would be nice if Microsoft would take a lead here ; it will be difficult to convince third parties to update their sites for IE8 if the company cannot itself be bothered to do the same .
Conclusion
IE8 has me surprised .
Internet Explorer has fallen a long way behind Safari , Opera , and Firefox .
IE7 brought the much - needed tabs , but was still a long way behind the competing browsers .
And honestly , even IE8 has n't caught up with the competition .
But it 's a great deal closer than I thought it would be .
The standards compliance is certainly still a big issue , and the reality is that IE8 still wo n't be nearly as good on that front as the other three major browsers .
Nonetheless , as an overall package , IE8 is a far better product than its predecessor .
A lot of its features have been copied , sure .
But they 're good features .
They 're worth copying , and I 'm glad they 've been copied , because they make IE8 much more usable .
There are IE8 - unique features too , and though I think they still need polish , I think that the tab groups and accelerators , in particular , are compelling additions to the browser experience .
Beta 2 still has bugs ; in my brief usage so far I 've seen a number of pages that have appeared with pieces missing ( though each time refreshing has restored the missing parts ) , and on a couple of occasions the browser froze for several seconds , but it 's a beta ; I would n't expect it to be bug - free .
After using beta 2 , I am now confident that Microsoft actually cares about creating a good web browser , and I have n't felt that way since the days of the browser war .
My only worry now is that MS will once again lose interest in its browser ; I hope not .

Russia says it has fulfilled a pledge to withdraw its combat troops from Georgia in line with a ceasefire deal .
But Moscow says it intends to maintain a peacekeeping presence of 2,600 troops in " buffer zones " around the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The Georgian government has denounced the move as unacceptable .
The White House said checkpoints and buffer zones were " definitely not part of the agreement " , and called for an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops .
The " buffer zones " extend far beyond any pre-existing security zones , and the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says Western diplomats fear that Moscow is determined to define the parameters of the interim security arrangements in its own terms .
While Georgia insists that Russian troops must leave its territory , a senior Russian general said the situation remained unstable , accusing Georgia of planning further military operations .
' Snail 's pace '
Following a statement by the Russian defence ministy that the withdrawal was complete , US President George W Bush and his French counterpart , Nicolas Sarkozy , expressed their disatisfaction .
They agreed in a telephone call that " Russia is not in compliance " with the ceasefire pact and it should comply immediately , US officials said .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about security in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Crisis day - by - day Who started the conflict ?
Eyewitness : Russian withdrawal
In pictures : Troops on the move
" [ The Russians ] have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations .
Establishing checkpoints , buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement , " the White House said .
Earlier , the deputy chief of the Russian General Staff , Gen Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said that nearly 2,600 " peacekeeping " troops with armoured cars and helicopters would remain inside Georgia for the foreseeable future .
Gen Nogovitsyn said Russian troops were setting up checkpoints on the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia with Georgia .
But the so - called " zone of responsibility " also includes Georgia 's main airbase at Senaki , some 40 km ( 25 miles ) from the boundary with Abkhazia , which sits astride vital road and rail links to the Black Sea port of Poti .
BBC correspondents on the ground say they have seen what appears to be a significant Russian troop movement out of Georgia .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Igoeti - just 35 km ( 21 miles ) from the capital , Tbilisi - says he saw Russian troops leave the town , joining a column of hundreds of armoured vehicles on the road towards South Ossetia .
Our correspondent says buses of Georgian police are arriving in Igoeti to take control after Russian troops removed their roadblocks and pulled out .
But another correspondent in the nearby town of Korvaleti says Georgian police vehicles there are still being blocked at checkpoints .
Desperate need
Russia 's four - day war with Georgia began after Tbilisi tried to retake the Moscow - backed breakaway province of South Ossetia on 7 August , following days of clashes with separatists .
Thousands of civilians are reported to be in urgent need of relief supplies
The commander of US forces in Europe , Gen John Craddock , said earlier that Russia was taking too long to withdraw , and added " if they are moving , it is at a snail 's pace " .
Meanwhile , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , Antonio Guterres , who has been visiting South Ossetia , said he was deeply moved by the humanitarian problem there and called for the early voluntary return of all refugees .
The UN estimates that nearly 160,000 people have been displaced across the whole of Georgia since the conflict began .
The Georgian government is seeking $ 1 - 2 bn ( £ 0.5 - 1 bn ) in aid to repair and develop infrastructure following the conflict with Russia , the head of the US government aid agency , USAid , said .
The World Bank has also announced that it is sending a team of experts to the country to assess its reconstruction needs .
' War with Nato '
Diplomatic efforts at the UN have reached deadlock over rival resolutions on the crisis from France and Russia .
Russia has reiterated its opposition to a rival French text , which reaffirms Georgia 's territorial integrity .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili told the BBC he would never accept what he called Russia 's " annexation of its territory " .
He warned that Russia 's involvement in South Ossetia , Abkhazia and Georgia was intended to send a strong message to the West , and he called for " a united response " from Nato .
" It 's all about reconsidering the role of Nato , the role of international law and borders in this part of the world .
This is no longer about Georgia anymore , " he said .
" Russia decided to win war with Nato without firing a single shot at it . "
A Nato spokeswoman says Russia 's defence ministry has decided to halt all military co-operation with the bloc to protest at what Moscow calls the alliance 's biased , pro-Georgian view of the conflict .
The move by Moscow followed a Nato statement that there would be no " business as usual " with Moscow unless its troops pulled out of Georgia .

Senator Hillary Clinton - August 26 , 2008
Remarks as Prepared for Delivery
Denver , Colorado
I am honored to be here tonight .
A proud mother .
A proud Democrat .
A proud American .
And a proud supporter of Barack Obama .
My friends , it is time to take back the country we love .
Whether you voted for me , or voted for Barack , the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose .
We are on the same team , and none of us can sit on the sidelines .
This is a fight for the future .
And it 's a fight we must win .
I have n't spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children , campaigning for universal health care , helping parents balance work and family , and fighting for women 's rights at home and around the world . . . to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people .
And you have n't worked so hard over the last 18 months , or endured the last eight years , to suffer through more failed leadership .
No way .
No how .
No McCain .
Barack Obama is my candidate .
And he must be our President .
Tonight we need to remember what a Presidential election is really about .
When the polls have closed , and the ads are finally off the air , it comes down to you -- the American people , your lives , and your children 's futures .
For me , it 's been a privilege to meet you in your homes , your workplaces , and your communities .
Your stories reminded me everyday that America 's greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people -- your hard work , your devotion to duty , your love for your children , and your determination to keep going , often in the face of enormous obstacles .
You taught me so much , you made me laugh , and . . . you even made me cry .
You allowed me to become part of your lives .
And you became part of mine .
I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism , did n't have health insurance and discovered she had cancer .
But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care .
I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t- shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me : " Take care of my buddies ; a lot of them are still over there .... and then will you please help take care of me ? "
I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours .
He said he just did n't know what his family was going to do .
I will always be grateful to everyone from all fifty states , Puerto Rico and the territories , who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush Administrtation .
To my supporters , my champions -- my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart :
Thank you .
You never gave in .
You never gave up .
And together we made history .
Along the way , America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight .
One of our finest young leaders , Arkansas Democratic Party Chair , Bill Gwatney , who believed with all his heart that America and the South could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom .
And Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones , a dear friend to many of us , a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter , stronger and better .
Steadfast in her beliefs , a fighter of uncommon grace , she was an inspiration to me and to us all .
Our heart goes out to Stephanie 's son , Mervyn , Jr , and Bill 's wife , Rebecca , who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention .
Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush , people are hurting at home , and our standing has eroded around the world .
We have a lot of work ahead .
Jobs lost , houses gone , falling wages , rising prices .
The Supreme Court in a right - wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock .
The biggest deficit in our nation 's history .
Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis .
Putin and Georgia , Iraq and Iran .
I ran for President to renew the promise of America .
To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American Dream , to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded , to save for college , a home and retirement , to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month .
To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs .
To create a health care system that is universal , high quality , and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance .
To create a world class education system and make college affordable again .
To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labor rights , from women 's rights to gay rights , from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is : caring for our families .
To help every child live up to his or her God - given potential .
To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws .
To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good , not of private plunder .
To restore America 's standing in the world , to end the war in Iraq , bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans .
And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges , from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming .
Most of all , I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years .
Those are the reasons I ran for President .
Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama .
And those are the reasons you should too .
I want you to ask yourselves :
Were you in this campaign just for me ?
Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him ?
Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids ?
Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage ?
Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible ?
We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges .
Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity , creativity , and innovative spirit , there are no limits to what is possible in America .
This wo n't be easy .
Progress never is .
But it will be impossible if we do n't fight to put a Democrat in the White House .
We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a President who understands that America can't compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators , while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas .
We need a President who understands that we can't solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy .
We need a President who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class .
Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy .
He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up , not the top down .
He knows government must be about " We the people " not " We the favored few . "
And when Barack Obama is in the White House , he 'll revitalize our economy , defend the working people of America , and meet the global challenges of our time .
Democrats know how to do this .
As I recall , President Clinton and the Democrats did it before .
And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again .
He 'll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new , clean energy future .
He 'll make sure that middle class families get the tax relief they deserve .
And I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single American .
Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home - a first step to repairing our alliances around the world .
And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama .
Anyone who saw Michelle 's speech last night knows she will be a great First Lady for America .
Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama 's side .
He is a strong leader and a good man .
He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad .
He is pragmatic , tough , and wise .
And , of course , Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife , Jill .
They will be a great team for our country .
Now , John McCain is my colleague and my friend .
He has served our country with honor and courage .
But we do n't need four more years . . . of the last eight years .
More economic stagnation ... and less affordable health care .
More high gas prices ... and less alternative energy .
More jobs getting shipped overseas ... and fewer jobs created here .
More skyrocketing debt ... home foreclosures ... and mounting bills that are crushing our middle class families .
More war . . . less diplomacy .
More of a government where the privileged come first ... and everyone else comes last .
John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound .
John McCain does n't think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis .
John McCain wants to privatize Social Security .
And in 2008 , he still thinks it 's okay when women do n't earn equal pay for equal work .
With an agenda like that , it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities .
Because these days they 're awfully hard to tell apart .
America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time , changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good .
And I know what that can mean for every man , woman , and child in America .
I'm a United States Senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls , New York , many traveling for days and nights , to participate in the first convention on women 's rights in our history .
And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years , handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter - and a few sons and grandsons along the way .
These women and men looked into their daughters ' eyes , imagined a fairer and freer world , and found the strength to fight .
To rally and picket .
To endure ridicule and harassment .
To brave violence and jail .
And after so many decades - 88 years ago on this very day - the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution .
My mother was born before women could vote .
But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for President .
This is the story of America .
Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up .
How do we give this country back to them ?
By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad .
And on that path to freedom , Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice .
If you hear the dogs , keep going .
If you see the torches in the woods , keep going .
If they 're shouting after you , keep going .
Do n't ever stop .
Keep going .
If you want a taste of freedom , keep going .
Even in the darkest of moments , ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going .
I 've seen it in you .
I 've seen it in our teachers and firefighters , nurses and police officers , small business owners and union workers , the men and women of our military - you always keep going .
We are Americans .
We 're not big on quitting .
But remember , before we can keep going , we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president .
We do n't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare .
Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance .
I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day .
And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation .
We 've got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us , and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope .
That is our duty , to build that bright future , and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep , no barrier too great - and no ceiling too high - for all who work hard , never back down , always keep going , have faith in God , in our country , and in each other .
Thank you so much .
God bless America and Godspeed to you all .
A tipster has sent us five photos of brand new works by semi-secret superfamous street artist Banksy .
All five were just put up in New Orleans , to commemorate the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on August 29 .
Some of the pieces relate directly the hurricane and its disastrous aftermath ; others are targeted at the legacy of Fred Radtke , an infamous N.O. anti-graffiti crusader known as the " Gray Ghost " for his practice of painting over graffiti in gray paint — regardless of the color of the underlying wall .
They 're all pretty great .
Five [ UPDATE : Now six !] pieces , after the jump :

If my mother could only see me now , she would be proud that her daughter has mastered at least one recipe .
Anyhow , I thought it would be good to post it in this blog as well so anyone interested can use it as well .
Here goes : Lumpia wrappers ( Use TYJ Spring Roll Pastry - 2 packs of the biggest size 25 pcs each ) 1 pound ground meat ( I use turkey but you can use any kind of meat .
If you use beef , suggest to mix it with any of the white meats because beef is hard when it is fried . ) 2 fist size carrots ( I use baby carrots ) 1 fist size garlic1 fist size onion ( any color but red onion is strongest ) 2 eggs ( beaten ) 3/4 - 1 cup soy sauce ( use Silver Swan brand .
1 - 2 tsp sugar1 tbsp flour1 / 3 cup watercooking oil ( for frying ) Sweet and Sour Sauceeither by leaving it outside the ref for about 30 minutes or in the microwave for a few seconds .
You can separate the wrappers individually even before you start wrapping .
Just make sure that you cover it with damp cloth / napkin to keep it moist .
Otherwise , you can just separate them as you go through " D " below .
1 .
Chop the carrots , garlic and onion .
( I typically use food processor . )
Add the soy sauce and sugar , stir .
Taste and adjust , if necessary .
2 . Add ground meat and egg .
Mix thoroughly .
by mixing 1 tbsp flour in 1/3 cup water .
( I picked up this faster method from Charmaine .
( Thanks , Charmaine ! )
It was 3 x faster than what I used to be doing which was the fine and fancy way . :)
So , it was a no - brainer for me to adopt the faster way .
) 1. place about 2 tbsp mixture parallel to any of the edges .
Distribute mixture from end to end so that it is about 1 cm thick .
2. roll the wrapper over the meat and continue to roll until about only 1 inch is left .
3. apply the flour / water sealant and complete the roll .
by wrapping 1 - 3 pieces first .
1 . Cut the lumpia into 3 pieces .
2 . Fry and taste .
( You can deep fry but I usually just shallow fry . ) 3 .
Adjust mixture , if necessary .
4 . Proceed to wrap the rest of the meat mixture .
Remember , for every 1 lumpia , you can cut them into 3 pieces .
Typically , if eaten with rice and the sweet and sour sauce , I can eat 10 pieces .
You can then just thaw , cut and fry later .
1 .
Store the lumpia in separate freezer bags so that you can use just what you need at a time .
2 .
You can thaw the raw lumpia before frying .
Or you can dunk it in straight ( but be careful of oil splatters ! ) 3 .
Cut the raw lumpia into 3 or your desired size .
That 's it !
Have fun making the lumpia .
For me , I usually eat the lumpia with rice , cucumber and the sweet and sour sauce .
Yummy !!!
And remember to ...
REST is the web , nothing more
I 'm wrong .
REST , as originally described , has nothing to do with POST PUT DELETE .
If you look at the original paper ( chapter 5 ) , REST is simply a description of the web as it actually work as a distributed hypermedia browser platform .
The paper talks alot about all the things required to send media to the clients , but almost nothing about sending data from the client to the server .
There is nothing about verbs , RPC , POST vs. PUT , idempotency , or posting resources back to the same URI from which they were gotten .
I was blasting the dogma around those things but was wrong to call it REST , I was under the misconception that REST is also about those things .
Lots of writing about REST seem to have this misconception as well .
Why is n't REST about these things ?
Because REST is a description of the web and those things do n't really exist on the web .
Not in any standardized way .
When people start talking about something being RESTful , do they mean its how the web actually works , or how we wish it worked ?
In the real world , there is a remarkable effort to ensure that a wide range of browsers can find , retrieve and understand media and content from web servers .
DNS , URIs , HTTP , firewalls , proxies , caches , media types , etc are what makes the web work and that 's what REST describes , but in more generic terms .
On the other hand , pretty much any time a browser POSTs a message , only one server in the whole world is supposed to understand what it means , there is no broad standardization of sending data and content to servers and how the servers are supposed to interpret it .
Each server is free to implement its own interface , and they generally do .
While there has been efforts to make the web into a standardized read / write platform , nothing has caught on in a big way .
So is POST as RPC RESTful ?
The practice of roll - your - own POST format is alive and well and successful on the web , and therefore , by definition , RESTful .
As long as you are not abstracting HTTP away ( and ignoring what HTTP gives you for free ) , your are probably using it RESTfully .
Glad we cleared that up .

Ahmadinejad said the US people would not allow Bush to strike Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has played down the threat of an armed conflict between his country and the United States or Israel .
" I assure you ... there wo n't be any war in the future , " he said in Malaysia .
Earlier , an aide to Iran 's supreme leader said Tehran would strike Israel or the US navy in the Gulf if it was attacked over its nuclear programme .
The comments come amid reports of possible Israeli or US plans to strike Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Tehran denies Western claims that it is seeking to build a nuclear weapon .
It has repeatedly rejected demands to halt enriching uranium , which can be used as fuel for power plants - and as material for weapons if refined to a greater degree .
The European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran in June .
But it has offered a package of incentives to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran has said it is prepared to negotiate with major world powers , but insisted the talks had to address Iran 's nuclear rights .
' Greatest threat '
President Ahmadinejad was speaking through an interpreter at the end of a summit of the D8 Islamic developing nations in Malaysia 's capital , Kuala Lumpur .
The Iranian nation will never accept bullying ...
No army in the world can confront it
Ali Shirazi
Aide to Iran 's supreme leader
He said he believed that people in America would not let President George W Bush authorise an attack on Iran because it would be " political suicide " .
" The economic , political and military situation will not let Mr Bush do that , " he said .
But Mr Ahmadinejad warned that Iran was ready to defend itself , saying that " the greatest threat in the Middle East and the whole world ... is the United States ' intervention in other countries " .
He also suggested that Iran would not launch any attack on Israel - America 's ally in the Middle East .
" There is no need for any measures by the Iranian people " to bring about the end of the " Zionist regime " in Israel , Mr Ahmadinejad said .
And asked if he objected to the government of Israel or Jewish people , he said that " creating an objection against the Zionists does n't mean that there are objections against the Jewish " .
He added that Jews lived in Iran and were represented in the country 's parliament .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments came after he was asked to clarify the statement that he wanted to " destroy " Israel .
' Jihad and martyrdom '
On Monday , a senior Iranian official warned that Tehran would retaliate if attacked by the US or Israel over its nuclear programme .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes " The first US shot on Iran would set the United States ' vital interests in the world on fire , " Ali Shirazi , an aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , was quoted as saying by Iranian news agencies .
" Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire , " he said .
" The Zionist regime is pressuring White House officials to attack Iran .
If they commit such a stupidity , Tel Aviv and US shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran 's first targets and they will be burned in Iran 's crushing response .
" The Iranian nation will never accept bullying .
The Iranian nation is a nation of believers which believes in jihad and martyrdom .
No army in the world can confront it , " Mr Shirazi said .
Last week , the top US military officer said opening up a new front in the Middle East - after Iraq and Afghanistan - would be " extremely stressful " for US forces .
Adm Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was commenting on the likelihood of US or Israeli military action over Iran 's nuclear programme .
President Bush has maintained that all options are on the table but that military action against Iran will not be his first choice .

What are these ?
The Toyota Prius is a car even Stevie Wonder could identify at 50 yards .
Its distinctive jellybean shape all but screams , " I care about the environment ! , " which is one reason there are a million of them on the road .
There 's an old rule about not messing with success or fixing what ain't broke , and Toyota has taken it to heart with the next - gen Prius we 'll see next year at the Detroit auto show .
Spy shots of the 2010 Prius have surfaced over at Next Auto , and they show a car that 's a little longer , a little wider and a little more aggressive at the front end .
Passengers get more room to stretch their legs and owners get more room for all the groceries from Whole Foods .
The 2010 Prius gets fancier headlights and a little more bling inside and out but its profile looks about the same , and for good reason – with a drag coefficient of 0.26 , there is n't much Toyota could do to make it any sleeker .
There are rumors a Prius wagon and even a convertible , which has been done before and does n't look half bad , are in the works , but so far they 're just rumors .
Speculation aside , the biggest changes to the Prius are under the skin .
Toyota plans to give the super - efficient Prius a little more oomph .
Car & Driver says the next - gen Prius will get a 1.6 - liter gasoline engine , a slight bump from the 1.5 currently under the hood .
That 'll make the car a little more powerful but it also will get a few more mpg than the 48 city / 45 highway the current model offers .
But * Motor Trend * reports that Toyota 's giving the car a 1.8 - liter engine producing 100 horsepower .
Added with the output of the electric motor , total power rises from 110 hp to 150 between now and 2010 , according to MT , but the 2010 will retain the same fuel economy as the current model .
There 's some debate about the batteries , with some bloggers and motojournos saying the car will get lithium - ion batteries but others saying Toyota will stick with its tried - and - true nickel metal hydride units .
That seems more likely , given Toyota and Matsushita are spending $ 192 million building another NiMH battery factory .
If the Prius gets lithium - ion , look for it to happen after Toyota 's put a few hundred thousand miles on the forthcoming Prius plug - in hybrids that will use lithium batteries .
One thing 's for sure – the next - gen Prius will be as American as apple pie .
It 'll be built at a plant Toyota 's building in Mississippi to help meet surging demand for a car so hot they 're not just holding their value , they 're appreciating .
See all the spy shots over at Next Auto .
Systems built by unsupervised intermediate developers are going to fail for completely different reasons than systems built by juniors .
A junior will build a big pile of algorithms that sort of work .
A good intermediate will build pages out of “ Design Patterns ” and “ Domain Driven Design ” .
While those are great books for learning how to build large OO systems , direct application of this sort of theory results in over engineered systems that are flexible in ways that do n’t matter , and inflexible in ones that do matter -- ( c ) Matt Briggs
Denver to hunt protesters with maps , bicycles , football helmets John Byrne
Published : Thursday August 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Almost everyone can be a potential violent protester at the Democratic National Convention , according to a new bulletin issued by the Denver Police Department and leaked to the ACLU .
The bulletin lists myriad items police should watch out for , including " caches of supplies that could be used by violent demonstrators . "
The publication intended for commissioned police officers was provided to RAW STORY Thursday .
On the list ?
Plastic shields , football helmets , gas masks , baseball catch protectors , cases of nails , hand held radios , maps , bicycles , and protest sign handles ( " perfect for swinging at first responders " ) .
The police say they 're also worried about people with large numbers of city maps or " camping information . "
" Football , baseball , motorcycle and bicycle helmets are all used by violent protesters , " the bulletin warns .
" Bicycles are used to blockade sidewalks , streets and can be used to slow down responding emergency vehicles . "
Camping information is a threat , too , such as " information concerning the camping , boarding or housing of potential violent protesters that have rented campaign spaces , rented farms or land for the time period around the DNC . "
Maps are worrisome because they 're " frequently used by violent protester [ sic ] to plan direct actions against conventioneers . "
" Baseball / softball catcher protectors " are also of concern , police warn .
ACLU spokesmen will hold a press conference Thursday afternoon .
The nonprofit criticized the document in a press release , saying many of the items are " innocuous . "
" Although the bricks were acquired for masonry repairs , Denver police accused the activist of ' stockpiling ' the bricks for the DNC , " the press release reads .
The activist will speak at Thursday 's press conference , but ACLU officials did not release a name Wednesday .
The document follows .
( CNN ) -- Courtland Cox stood on a podium with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and listened to a dreamer .
Sen. Barack Obama accepts the Democratic Party 's nomination for president .
On Thursday night , exactly 45 years later , Cox watched Sen. Barack Obama become something else -- a fighter .
" He was both intellectual and emotional , " said Cox , a business consultant in Washington , D.C.
" He understands that you do n't bring a pillow to a gunfight . "
Cox is one of a group of people who are living bookends to two transformative moments in U.S. history .
They personally watched King deliver his iconic " I Have a Dream " speech .
And they watched Obama deliver his acceptance speech after becoming the first African - American major - party presidential nominee in the nation 's history .
The notion that their lives could encompass both historic events left some of them inspired and baffled .
" I 've been in search for the right words , and the closest thing that I can come up with is ' surreal , ' " Peter Williams III said .
He was 10 years old when his family took him to the 1963 March on Washington .
iReport.com : Missed King 's speech , glad to watch Obama's
Although each witness touched on the symbolism of Obama 's link with King , they kept returning to a more earthbound theme .
They said they had never heard Obama sound so tough and assured .
During his 50 - minute speech , the culmination of the Democratic Party 's four - day national convention in Denver , Obama went right after his Republican opponent John McCain .
He said McCain was out of touch and wrong on the Iraq War , energy policy , health care and the environment .
" He showed some muscle , " said Williams III , an IBM salesman in Marietta , Georgia , who watched the speech from his home .
" He squared off and went toe - to - toe . "
The Rev. Albert Cecil Williams -- no relation to Williams III -- also attended the March on Washington in 1963 .
He said he had to get up and shout in his San Francisco , California , living room when he heard Obama speak .
It 's the same reaction he had when he heard King shout " Free at last ! " to the cheering crowd at the Lincoln Memorial 45 years ago , he said .
Williams is the founding pastor of Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco .
He said he and his family slipped into the call - and - response ritual of the black church as Obama spoke .
They began to shout " Yes !
Come on !
Make it work ! " at the TV screen .
iReport.com : Varied reactions to Obama 's speech
They were fired up because they had never seen Obama so fired up , he said .
" He stood tall , " Williams said .
" I had not seen him convey that kind of commitment .
He seemed to be operating from a place of strength . "
Williams III , the salesman in Georgia , said Obama could do today what King could n't do in 1963 -- show some righteous anger .
" Back then , you would be viewed differently if you showed anger , " he said .
" You could be angry but you had to show that you were not dangerous , especially if you were a black man . "
Hearing the dream in person
As these witnesses to history talked about Obama , they also reflected on that humid afternoon in August when they heard King give his " I Have a Dream " speech .
They said they could n't have imagined seeing a black man poised to enter the White House on that day in 1963 .
" For a black person to say back then that ' I 'm going to run for president ' would be like someone saying ' I 'm going to walk to Mars , ' " Cox , one of the organizers of the March on Washington , said .
Cox said marchers were n't thinking about history in 1963 .
They were concerned with staying alive .
The sunny newsreels showing the festive atmosphere of the March on Washington do n't reveal the escalating danger that so many people in the movement felt at the time , he said .
By the summer of the 1963 , the civil rights movement was reaching a critical point .
There were at least 900 demonstrations in 100 cities , with more than 20,000 arrests .
Cox , who was a leader with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , a group of frontline civil rights activists who worked in the rural South , said his group tried to arouse the interest of The New York Times in the murders in Mississippi of at least 30 black people that year .
" We got maybe got two lines in the paper , " he said .
" Nobody cared .
We were invisible . "
Witness recalls realization dawning that King 's speech was extraordinary
The march was designed to change that .
Cox says he still recalls debating the merits of the march that morning with the Malcolm X , then a black separatist .
He told Cox that the march was a charade and a clown show .
As he stood on the podium listening to King , Cox said he realized that Malcolm X was wrong .
He could sense something special was about to happen when he heard the renowned gospel singer Mahalia Jackson say out loud on the podium , " Ah Lord , " as King departed from the planned closing of his speech and began to improvise his " I Have a Dream " ending .
Jackson , a powerful singer , urged King on as he launched into the famous climax of his speech .
" I knew then that this was going to be something , " Cox said .
" It started getting good .
Mahalia Jackson started rocking and rolling with him .
It got inspired . "
Christine King Farris , King 's oldest sister , watched the speech from her parents ' home in Atlanta , Georgia .
She said she did n't anticipate he would be making history .
It did n't take her long to realize that he had .
" As soon as he finished , our phone started ringing , " she said .
" People started calling from everywhere .
They thought it was great . "
The expectations for Obama 's speech this week were high as well .
Many of Obama 's critics and supporters agree on at least one point -- he 's a powerful public speaker .
The timing of Obama 's speech invited inevitable comparisons to King , but the Illinois senator comes from a different place , said Drew Hansen , author of " The Dream , " a book that analyzes King 's speech .
" King is the son of the segregated South ; Obama is the son of integrated Hawaii , " Hansen said .
" King is a preacher and Obama is a law professor .
No one would think of comparing the two if they were n't both black . "
But both faced a similar challenge when they gave their speeches .
King was a national figure in 1963 , but many people either did n't know him or did n't think he was patriotic enough , Hansen said .
" They both faced the task of introducing themselves to a potentially skeptical audience , " he said .
King converted many critics and so will Obama , King 's sister Farris said .
She does n't immediately think of the " I Have a Dream " speech when she thinks of Obama 's relation to her brother .
She thinks of her brother 's final sermon in Memphis , Tennessee , where he vowed that " We as a people " would get to the Promised Land .
" I never thought in my lifetime that I would see one of us aspiring to be the head of our nation , " she said .
" Mr. Obama leading us toward the presidency is like the Promised Land for us . "
All About Martin Luther King Jr. • John McCain • Barack Obama
Before their Denver extravaganza last week , Democrats feared their nominating convention might dissolve into a gruesome riot of intramural conflict .
The primary season wounds between the Clinton and Obama camps had not fully healed and some feared open fighting between the factions would overshadow Barack Obama 's coronation .
But after a somewhat unsure start , they averted disaster .
Bill and Hillary Clinton both rallied their supporters to Obama 's side with full - throated endorsements .
And then came Obama 's stirring acceptance speech , with which virtually no dazzled Democrats could find fault .
For the Democrats , it was mission accomplished .
In truth , the talk of division was overblown .
As Time magazine 's Amy Sullivan recently noted , today 's Democratic party is as unified as it has been in a generation .
The long - running feud between the party 's moderate and liberal wings is dormant , with the liberals holding sway .
Consensus reigns on nearly every key policy question , from leaving Iraq to ending George W Bush 's high - income tax cuts to putting brakes on unfettered free trade .
But look who 's divided now : the Republicans .
As John McCain heads for St Paul this weekend - with his photogenic but almost comically inexperienced running mate , Sarah Palin , in tow - it is the GOP that struggles to find real unity .
John McCain now leads a party saddled with fierce internecine disputes about everything from civil liberties to budget policy to America 's role in the world .
While these Republicans may lack a soap opera akin to the Clinton - Obama psychodrama , their ideological stitching has come dangerously loose .
It is McCain 's challenge to ensure that the seams do n't burst open before election day .
How times have changed .
During the first half of the Bush era , the Republican party brooked about as much dissent as the North Korean Communist party .
But nothing breeds division like failure and the collapse of Bush Republicanism has a long list of party factions pointing the finger at one another .
Take social policy .
The apex of Republican power earlier in this decade was made possible by the enthusiasm of Christian conservative voters reacting , in part , to the alleged moral decay of the Clinton presidency .
But once - reliable white evangelical voters are growing more disaffected with the Republicans .
They have not been rewarded , after all , with a federal ban on gay marriage or real progress towards outlawing abortion .
Nor do they have much trust in McCain , who has never prioritised social issues in his career and has clashed with the religious right .
Earlier this year , influential Christian leader Dr James Dobson vowed that : ' I cannot and I will not vote for John McCain . '
McCain 's stunning choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin , merely two years into her first term and reportedly a visitor to just one foreign country ( Ireland ) before 2007 , was a step towards calming evangelicals : Palin might be unqualified for the job , but she has a solid record of social conservatism , particularly on abortion .
( Senior party leaders , including Karl Rove , had to plead with McCain not to choose a pro-abortion rights running mate , such as Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman or former Pennsylvania senator Tom Ridge , lest open warfare result . )
But a dangerous breach remains .
Socially moderate Republicans are seeking to assert themselves .
The GOP's Wall Street financial base has little interest in banning abortion or gay marriage and , indeed , sees those crusades as a path to electoral exile .
Hence , evangelicals in St Paul will be subjected to a Tuesday night keynote speech by the former New York mayor and presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani , who urges his party to be more accepting of abortion .
Listen for the boos - their volume will hint at whether religious conservatives understand that to prevail in November McCain needs to appeal beyond the Republican party 's shrinking base , or whether they will insist on self - destructive displays of radicalism .
Foreign policy ?
The realist wing of the GOP wants to beat back the influence of the neoconservatives such as William Kristol who led the 2002 - 2003 charge into Iraq .
This battle has played out in editorial pages , at Washington think - tanks and reportedly among factions within McCain 's advisory circle .
So far , the neocons seem to be winning out , as McCain rattles his sabre at Iran and Russia and puts a heavy emphasis on democracy promotion .
But McCain 's tough talk does not come without a cost , as evidenced by the warm words for Obama from leading foreign policy moderates such as Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel .
Some GOP leaders even fear that former Secretary of State Colin Powell , aghast at neocon foreign policy influence , might not endorse McCain - and could possibly even proclaim his support for Obama in a public relations disaster for the Republican nominee .
Meanwhile , those on the party 's growing neo-isolationist fringe can rally around the libertarian hero Ron Paul , whose failed presidential primary campaign was largely premised on his opposition to the Iraq War and which drew support from many traditional conservatives .
Unwelcome inside the Xcel Centre , Paul will stage a rally across the river in next - door Minneapolis .
By comparison , anti-war protesters were a negligible force in Denver .
McCain 's message in St Paul will also be muddied by the presence of another libertarian , Bob Barr , a former Republican congressman now running a third - party candidacy .
A quirky character memorable for having been tricked by Sacha Baron Cohen 's Borat into believing he had eaten breast - milk cheese , Barr is reinventing himself as the champion of principles that he says the Republican party has betrayed .
Barr emphasises the erosion of civil liberties through such measures as expanded government eavesdropping powers , which McCain supports , and says the Republican party has been corrupted by lobbyists .
Many analysts agree that his candidacy will draw conservatives from McCain 's base .
Barr may cause his pro-Republican home state of Georgia to become competitive , a nightmare for McCain .
McCain can still win in November - barely .
But in a poisonously anti-GOP political climate , he cannot allow votes to leak from his party 's conservative base .
For now , none of these fissures threatens to tear the Republican party apart completely .
But from Obama 's perspective , they do n't need to .
All they have to do is leave Republican voters uninspired on election day .
Consider the contrast in how last week ended .
Obama spoke before 80,000 , while McCain struggled to round up 10,000 voters for his vice - presidential announcement rally in Ohio .
This is a stark illustration of the ' enthusiasm gap ' which threatens to doom McCain in November , should Democrats turn out in droves while Republicans stay at home .
For McCain , there really is no good solution to this dilemma .
Republican factions will have to hash out their differences over time .
Thus , Republicans will feel pressure to cast the spotlight on to Obama .
They will seek to rally their balkanised party around a menacing vision of Obama as dangerously inexperienced , willing to put his ambition ahead of the national interest and an elitist with disdain for ordinary Americans .
( Should that last part come with an ugly implication that Obama himself is foreign and un-American , well , so be it . )
If you find yourself hearing quite a lot about what 's wrong with Obama next week , it will be because the divided Republicans of 2008 can't agree on what 's right about themselves .

The real words were : " We crossed the water , we are sailing through the night
We are the beggars of the sea We 've got a task , a plan , a duty to fulfill Something to conquer , you will see . "
Quite cleverly rhyming " sea " with " see " , there ( ! )
" We 've reached the land and all brave men get off the boats
It is our voyage to Den Brille " , which is a place in Holland , not in Dutchland !
" We know no fear , or something silly of that kind All men inside , and stay we will !
Open the gate ! "
Mark : I 'm gonna give you a point from charity 's sake .
The band Vortex were formed after the breakup of Werewolf and Thunderfox .
We do n't know a lot about Werewolf and Thunderfox , although with names like that , they probably have shagged Ulrika Jonsson .

( After failing to guess " Fame " by Irene Cara correctly in the Intros round ) Graham : Can I just say , this is so scary , I 'm gonna have my gay card taken away for not knowing that !
I 'm gonna be disqualified !
Gay bars will go " No , you got that wrong on Never Mind the Buzzcocks !
Get out of town ! "
Mark :
How many points have you got on it on the moment ?
" Three more and you 're out . "
Graham : I know , exactly .
Mark :
You 'll have to shag girls !
What 's the exam like when you get your card ?
Graham :
It 's very tough .
Mark :
Is it an oral ?

( After Toyah Wilcox & Phill Jupitus did Let 's Stick Together by Bryan Ferry for the intros round )
Mark :
To be fair to you , while they were doing that I could hear the bloke who sang this turn in his grave , and he 's not even dead !
Series 4 [ edit ]
4x02 [ edit ]
Mark : ( Opening the show after a very poor performance from Chris Moyles the previous week and the ensuing week - long public feud between the two ) Hello , I'm Mark Lamarr and welcome to Never Mind the Buzzcocks , the pop quiz that likes to say " we 're sorry " .
As you may have read in some of the papers recently we 've been accused of being less than welcoming to one of our guests .
To give our side of the story we 've never actually had a model on the show before , so all of us were a little uneasy .
And while I do n't think we were actually rude , heaven forfend , I would point out that life on a quiz show may be slightly different to what you 're used to on the catwalk .
( an unflattering picture of Moyles appears on the screens behind Mark ) Never Mind the Buzzcocks , the show that says sorry seems to be the hardest word , whereas " DIE YOU OILY PIG IN A DUNCE HAT ! " rolls off the tongue quite nicely !
( later on , during Intros , Mark puts on an apron and serves tea and Ferrero Rochers to the teams )
Phill : Everyone 's so helpful - and nice - on this show !
Mark : ( shakes his fist ) Moyles !
Phill : ( as Blaikie from On The Buses ) I 'ate yew , Moyles !
Mark : Let 's do the Scooby - Doo ending .
And it would 've worked too if it were n't for that pesky fat cunt Moyles !

Phill 's Team :
Sean 's Team :
Mark : ( introducing Keith Chegwin )
Cheggers says the worst advice he 's ever been given was " Go on , have a drink . "
The second worst was " Go on ... television . "
( during Word Up , Phil 's team have to define the phrase " Bootie Call " from an All Saints song . )
Phil : Sunday afternoon , lot of cars in a field selling gear out the back .
Emmy - Kate : Incorrect .
That 's a car boot sale .
What a booty call is , is we 're all very aware about pregnancy in pop recently , and here we have an example , not this lady ( points to the screen ) , but the other one , Mel .
She 's pregnant .
Mark : Yes .
Emmy - Kate :
She has needs , other needs .
She has to make these needs known .
She has to phone Mothercare and order baby clothes , little booties ...
Mark : I got where you 're coming from .
No .
Tom :
It 's actually something that pirates do , like " Jim , lad , we 've found the treasure ! "
Mark : Tom Robinson and his " pieces of eight " material , ladies and gentlemen .
Phil :
It 's an 0898 number for pirates .
( as a pirate ) " Arr , looking to call a pirate ?
Want to talk to other pirates ?
Call 0898 ... "
( later , Sean 's team have " Sussudio " from the Phil Collins song of the same name . )
Sean :
Um , I wish " Sussudio " was Phil Collins ' dying words .
. . .
Keith : I think it's of some reference to masturbation .
Seriously , there 's a bit ...
Mark :
What , cause he did that ( imitates Phil Collins playing air slap bass ) in the middle ?
What a show off .
Keith :
Goes like that in the middle and then goes to the microphone , does n't he ?
Sean :
You do that when you 're wanking ?
Keith : Sometimes .
Sean : ( imitating Keith )
Pass the microphone .
What are you on about ?
Mark : Keith , I think all of us , apart from maybe
Tom grew up as kids watching you on television , do n't want to know about you masturbating .
There are only so many mental pictures I can file away , and that ain't gonna be one of them .
Phil :
No wonder you were so perky on " Saturday Superstore " !
Keith :
You could n't get me off .
Phill : " Cheggers GOES Pop " !
Let 's leave and come back !
We turned up in the studio , there was some load of old wank about pirates , and then Cheggers started talking about walloping , it was a nightmare !
What a nightmare night out !
Sean :
You call it " walloping " ?
Phill : I call it " walloping " , yeah !
Tom :
Have you never heard of " bashing the bishop " ?
Sean : Yes ...
Tom : Walloping .
Sean :
Not in front of Neil , his dad is a bishop !
Neil : I bashed him furiously !
( In Phill 's Intros round , Tom is stumped on the first song . )
Tom :
Is this something I 'd have heard on the radio in the last ten years ?
Phill : Possibly , Tom .
What station do you listen to ?
Tom : Radio 4 .
Phill : You listen to Radio 4 .
Possibly a little unlikely .
( Phill and Emmy - Kate start the intro again ) Tom : Yeah , of course .
It 's " If The Kids Are United " by Sham 69 .
Phill :
It 's not " If The Kids Are United " .
And he listens to Radio 4 ...
Mark :
When did they play that ?
Phill :
In a bit of a sticky wicket , are n't we ?
Mark : " Gonna be a borstal breakout !...
And now , the shipping . " . . .
Tom : " These Boots Are Made For Walking " .
Phill : No. Mark :
Does it go like that ?
Then no !
We 're looking for a song that has that as the introduction !
Sean , you 've seen the show before , I can excuse it in Tom.
Sean : ( as a pirate ) Well , Tom , you listen to the song and you get the tune .
( winks ) '
Mark : ( as a pirate ) You 're watching " Never Mind Mutiny On The Bounty " .
I 've been Mark Lamarr , ( winks ) goodnight .
( normal voice )
Alright , let 's play it in , let 's see what it actually was .
( The song , " Holiday " by Madonna , starts playing as Phill and Emmy - Kate huddle for the next intro. ) . . .
Tom :
It was on " The World At One " today , she 's sending her daughter to Cheltenham Ladies ' College .
Mark :
Yeah , but this thing is where they do the intro and you have guess it .
. . .
( As Phill and Emmy - Kate start the next intro ) Emmy - Kate :
This gives it away a bit , right .
( They both imitate cameras clicking for a few seconds , then break into the next intro . )
Tom : " If The Kids Are United " ...
Phill : ( angrily ) IT 'S NOT SHAM 69 !
( Breaks into the theme from " The Archers " ) Tom : Duran Duran , " Girls On Film " .
Mark :
It is Duran Duran , " Girls On Film " .
( wild applause ) Phill : ( angrily ) NO !
It was " The Archers " theme !
( In Sean 's Intros round , Sean makes a hissing noise . )
Phill :
Is it my mum 's radio ?
Keith : Oi , oi !
I did n't butt in when you were doing yours !
( some audience members go " Ooooh ! " )
Phill : Cheggers Plays Tough !
Mark : I 've never seen you this aggressive !
What 's happened to you tonight ?
Keith : I just love game shows , I can't tell you !
I get so involved .
Phill :
There 's no prizes , Keith !
Keith : I know , but it 's the pleasure of being on .
Phill :
On the way in , he saw an Austin Montego in the car park and he went ( as Keith ) " That could be it !
That could be it !
I could be walking away with it at the end of the night ! "
Keith :
And then I found out it was yours !
Anyway ... ( audience start oooh - ing again and applauding )
Oh no , I did n't mean that !
I did n't mean that !
I apologise !
Sean : Welcome to Cheggers Has A Pop !
Mark : I do n't think he 's gonna get it , in a minute Sean 's going to have to explain the ... ( makes the hissing noise Sean made ) ... noise he 's been making for quite some time .
Sean : Sure , no problem .
Mark : I 'm gonna pass it over .
( to Phill )
Do you know what it is ?
Phill :
It is " Cigarettes & Alcohol by Oh- ars - is .
Mark :
It is " Cigarettes & Alcohol " by Oasis , let 's hear that ...
( the intro to " Cigarettes & Alcohol " is played in .
A tambourine comes in during the intro . )
Mark :
You were being a tambourine ?
Sean : Yeah !
Phill : A tambourine !?
Mark : Every other week Sean does a movement or says a word or something .
This week he went ... ( makes the hissing sound ) ... thinking " they 'll all know that 's a tambourine ! "
Sean : ' Cos that 's what Liam does before he starts singing every song .
Mark :
What ?
Sean : ( makes the hissing sound )
Phill : The Salvation Army would n't sell many copies of War Cry if they walk into a pub , they forgot their tambourines and went ... ( hisses ) " War Cry , sir ? " ( hisses again )
Mark :
At one gig Noel Gallagher spotted Chris Evans in the audience and said rather cleverly " Alright , Ginger Bollocks !
Oi , Twatty Face !
Shut it , you Ginger Bastard ! "
Quick as a flash , Chris said " Get me Danny Baker on the phone , I need a witty reply . "
4x04 [ edit ]
Mark :
In July 1974 Mama Cass died while staying in a London flat after choking on a pork pie .
Strangely , Keith Moon of The Who died in the same flat a few years later .
He tripped over her body and banged his head on the sink .
( Mark almost cracks up a few seconds later ! )
Mama Cass ' vocal range increased dramatically after she was hit over the head with a lead pipe in 1965 .
I feel it 's our duty to see if the same technique will work with Aqua .
In fact , it 's my personal mission .
And if , by any chance , they 're on tour with Celine Dion , the more the merrier .
I 'll find you , Aqua !
I 'll find you if I have to knock on every door in Stockholm fresh from the plumber 's merchants , ( stands up and points at the camera ) and if it does n't work first time I 'll try and try again !
I 'll make of you singers yet , you Euro - pop ponces if it takes a Joe Pesci - size beating !
And Celine Dion , your heart wo n't go on but there 'll be plenty of beating believe me , you maple leaf hag !
YOU'RE NEXT IN LINE !

Sean 's Team : Faye Tozer ( Steps ) & Junior Simpson
( In Identity Parade , Sean 's team are asked to pick out Edwin Starr .
Number three is a black bald man with glasses , by the name of Athelston Williams , who stares straight ahead without flinching . )
Mark : So Sean 's team , can you detect which is the real Edwin , and which are the Droods ?
Is it number one , Six Day War ?
Number two , Hundred Years ' War ?
Number three , Evelyn War ?
Number four , what is it good for ?
Or number five , HUH , absolutely nothin ' ?
Junior : Okay , before I go any further , I 'm not gonna take the mick too much because I could be related to any one of these guys , so erm ...
Mark :
You mean because you 're black as well ?
Junior :
No , I 'm sure my dad used to cut some of their hair .
Mark :
Number three probably was n't a regular , was he ?
Sean : I 'm a little worried about number three , he 's just looking at a light , transfixed .
Junior : ( in an elderly man 's voice )
This is the first time I 've come out in a long time !
Is this a studio , yes ?
This is lovely !
Sean :
Are you okay , number three ?
He just does n't know !
Well four of them are obviously English and Edwin 's flown over from America , so who looks jetlagged ?
Three !
( audience laughter )
He had a near crash , he 's traumatised !
Junior : Nah , any Americans here ?
Because normally they go , any Americans would go " WHOOO ! "
Erm , I reckon it 's number four .
Sean :
Without any doubt , but I think we should let Faye choose .
Faye :
Well I like number four too because he 's got that ...
Sean :
Not who you like !
( audience laughter )
Mark :
We try and make it a fun show , but we 've gotta have rules !
Faye :
It 's definitely number four , he 's got that star quality ...
Mark :
You 're actually in the lead , so you can just pick a favourite if you want .
Sean :
Well , my favourite 's number three , obviously !
( number three - Athelston - still does n't flinch !
Audience laughter )
Mark :
He does n't seem so fond of you !
Sean : ( to Mark ) I know ! ( to the lineup ) Three , I love you , you 're coming home with me , we 're living together ...
Mark :
Is n't number three a very passionate man ?
( Beat .
Audience laughs even more )
Sean : I 'm worried about the fella !
Mark :
When they all walk off , and he 's still there !
( imitates Athelston 's stare at the lights )
Sean : I know !
He 's the most professional , I bet they say to him " Now do n't move , just stare straight ahead " , and he goes " I gotcha ! " ( imitates Athelston 's stare )
He 's the best !
He should get time - and - a - half !
The rest have been fidgeting , moving about , all sudden movements ...
HE'S A MANNEQUIN !
Mark :
The question being , which one do you think might be Edwin Starr ?
Junior : Number ...
Faye : Four .
Mark : Let 's find out .
Will the real Edwin Starr please step forward ?
( the real Edwin Starr - number four - steps forward .
Audience cheers and applause )
And , er , just to set my mind at ease , would number three please step forward ?
( audience and Edwin laugh , Athelston almost cracks , Sean and Junior start beckoning him to step forward , and finally he does so , to the absolute joy of Mark , the panel , the line - up and the studio audience .
Edwin embraces Athelston )
It 's like the parable of the bald man that could walk !

Phill 's Team : Leeroy Thornhill & Frank Skinner
Sean 's Team : Rick Wakeman & Paul Godfrey ( Morcheeba )
( In the Connections round , Sean 's team are asked for the link between Annie Lennox and Jarvis Cocker .
Stills from Love is a Stranger by Eurythmics and Party Hard by Pulp appear on the screen behind Mark . )
Rick : Actually Mark , the connection is Bilko .
Sergeant Bilko , because he 's saluting like the Americans did , like that Private Doberman did , and she looks like she 's got a Doberman in her privates .
Sean :
You 've got a twelve - year - old son , have n't you ?
Rick : Yeah .
Sean :
They 're gonna be so proud watching this tonight , are n't they ?
Rick :
They love the programme ...
Sean : " Dad 's done the fucking Doberman joke !
School 's gonna be a blast tomorrow , I 'm already wearing the capes ! "
( Later in the Connections round , Phill 's team are asked for the link between Cyndi Lauper and Jimmy Savile .
Stills of Cyndi Lauper and the Jim'll Fix
It title sequence appear on the screen behind Mark . )
Frank : I bet he 's a goer though , he 's very fit , is n't he , Jimmy .
I bet he could go for hours !
I bet if you have sex with Jimmy Savile , afterwards you get a Mars bar and a Bacofoil cloak !
( huge laughter from the audience , Mark and the teams )
Leeroy : I think there 's some porn going on there , ' cos all that jewellery , that 's gotta come to a fair bit .
Both of them are caked in gold .
There 's gotta be a bit of porn involved , ' cos it 's far too expensive to have all that on .
Mark :
So you think the richest people in the world are those that star in porn films ?
Phill :
You could n't have Jimmy Savile in a porn film , you 'd never be able to concentrate !
( as Savile ) " Now , you 're a lovely lady , and I 'm a plum - ber , and I 've come to fix yer ...
How 's about me repairing your plum - bing ? "
Mark :
Now then , now then , now then , what 's that then ?
Phill :
And then when he 's actually having sex ... ( as Savile ) Eh-uh - uh ... ( goes into Savile 's yodel ) Frank :
The orgasm !
Mark : I 'm guessing there might be other areas we could explore .
Frank :
If it was Gloria Estefan , we could 've done a " Clunk Click , Every Trip " joke .
( audience groans )
Oh , come on !
Apparently her last two had sold so well her spine went platinum .
Is it true that his hairdresser was so famous they wrote an opera about him ?
( turns to camera )
And that 's this week 's viewer 's question , so what would that opera be called ?
( Mark laughs ) Jimmy Savile 's hairdresser , they wrote an opera about him .
Call , and the prize is my dressing room key here at the BBC , ladies and gentlemen .
( picks up and shows his key )
Any offers ?
Mark :
No entrance .
Male audience member : The Barber of Savile !
Frank : The Barber of Savile !
Well done !
Mark : ( laughing and pointing at the audience member )
He was pleased with himself !
( During Sean 's team 's Intros round , Rick has to grab his crotch to reach high notes )
Sean :
You 've got a twelve - year - old kid !
The only reason to do that is if you 're playing football and someone 's taking a free kick ! . . .
Frank :
Is Danny Kaye about to come in and go " Me , a swan ? " ( Mark laughs and claps .
Some audience members also clap . )
Mark :
No , do n't clap just ' cos I did !
Make your own minds up !
That 's what I 'm trying to say , be individual !
Frank :
Yeah , but you 're a leader of men !
Mark : ... Of one bloke , there .
( points to an audience member ) Frank : Well Hitler probably started with one bloke .
Hitler was probably in a pub and said " we should invade Poland " and one bloke went ... ( Claps ) ... And ten years later ...
Mark :
So , I 've got a cult and it 's just me and him ?
( Frank nods to the audience member ) I 'm gonna ...
I 'm gonna top meself in a minute !
Frank : See ?
That Hitler thing 's started already !
He killed the Alsatian first , I think is the normal the way round ...
Mark : What , Eva ?
Frank : Ohhh !
Mark :
What ?
I 'm slagging off Eva Braun , and you 're going " That 's unfair !
Do n't slag off Eva , she was a lovely woman , apart from shagging , like , maybe the most evil man the world 's ever seen , apart from that she was alright ... "
Sean : She shagged Chris Evans !?
( After Phill 's team 's Intros round )
Mark : Smokey Robinson started a trend amongst pop stars when he named his daughter Tamla after his record company .
Courtney Love 's father calls her Rough Trade , while George Michael 's dad now calls him Strange Fruit .
...
Mark : Attractions bass player Bruce Thomas cut himself while demonstrating the safest way to smash a bottle in a fight .
Kurt Cobain suffered a similar mishap while demonstrating the safest way to blow your head off with a gun .
... Frank : Was Kurt Cobain 's dad on Stiff Records ?
( long period of laughter from the audience and Mark .
A female audience member laughs hysterically . )
That 's a seagull trapped in the skylight !
Mark :
Turn the extractor fan off , let it out will you ?
( the audience member laughs even harder . )
She 's having a lovely time .
Frank : I do n't know , she might be having a bloody heart attack and we 're ignoring it , or an asthma attack ...
Mark : I guess she 's having a stroke every now and again .
Series 9 [ edit ]
9x07 [ edit ]
Phill 's Team : Rebecca Hunter ( allSTARS *) & Ricky Tomlinson
Sean 's Team : David Van Day ( Guys ' n ' Dolls & Dollar ) & Jenni Falconer
Mark : ( introducing David )
Since leaving Dollar , David 's career has gone on the up .
He now runs a number of stalls in Brighton selling burgers and flowers .
So if you fancy some carnations stinking of beef and Calor gas , there 's your man .
Mark : Missy Elliott is famous for her expensive jewellery , her love of flashy cars and for owning more than 4,000 pairs of trainers .
Which sounds impressive until you hear David owns 200 - weight of diced onions and a loft full of gherkins !
David :
They 've been good to me , those sausages , you know !
Mark :
You keep that for your autobiography , sunbeam !
And , I 'll be the judge of that , cheeky - chops !
David : I might not be here without those .
Sean : Yeah , he 's got his van parked outside .
Mark :
So what do you want us to do ?
Thank sausages you 're here ?
David :
Give them all vouchers ( gestures to the audience ) when they 're leaving , buy a sausage !
Mark : Vouchers so they can buy a sausage ?
People can buy sausages anyway .
David :
Not outside here !
Mark :
They do n't need a voucher , it 's not Poland !
David : Mine are special .
Mark :
You 've got special sausages ?
David : Yeah .
The proof is in the pudding .
Mark :
You sell pudding as well ?
( During Sean 's team 's Freeze Frame , involving a clip of " Love 's Great Adventure " by Ultravox )
Sean :
Can we have a look at the newspaper headline ?
( cut to still from the video showing the front page of the Daily Mail - the headline reads " MILLIONAIRESS LOST IN JUNGLE - $ 100,000 REWARD " )
Sean :
Well it 's the Daily Mail so no doubt at the bottom it'll say like " millions of Ethiopians are dying , they 'll probably move next door to you tomorrow ! "
Mark :
Well it would be good if they moved next door to him ( points to David ) he could feed them , ca n't he ?
Sean :
They do n't all like sausages though , they 're used to rice and stuff .
( to David )
Do you do rice ?
David : W... Sean :
No , no , it 's alright .
This was the same time that Guys n' Dolls were about , yeah ?
David :
No it was a bit later , actually ... ( an ice - cream van 's chimes play " Oh Dear !
What Can the Matter Be ? " )
Mark :
Ooh , your van 's here !
David : I 've gotta go !
( gets up ) Gotta make some money !
( sits back down again )
You 're gonna let me go as well , are n't you ?
Mark : I was n't gonna cry for you to come back !
You must feel very at home with the team captains - a 99 and a Flake !
Sean : I 'm a little bit peckish , I do n't know why !
( the chimes play again ) Mummy , the onion ring man is here !
Ricky : Oooh sausages !
Sausages !
Mark : Special magic sausages !
Sean :
Did you put " Van " in your name after you got the van , or is that just a coincidence ?
Jenni : I do n't think it 's a music video at all ...
Sean :
It 's Ally McCoist and he comes out and shags Midge and goes , " You 're Scottish , you 'll do ! " Mark : Midge & McCoist .
Urgh , what a bad porn film that would make !
You 'd never buy a porn film with " Midge " in the title , would you ?
Sean :
Not again anyway , that 's for sure !
Mark :
Although I would buy one called " The Magic Sausage " , which is one of my favourite operas .
Jenni : I really do n't think it 's a music video , I think it 's a soap powder commercial , a really long - winded one .
" Do you want to know how to get rid of dirt ?
Grime ?
Grass stains ?
Snake venom ?
Midge Ure? Use new Daz ! "
That might be it .
Mark :
Also to be in the jungle and do the Challenge , that would be pretty cruel , would n't it ?
" Is this better than your normal soap powder ? "
" We have n't got a normal soap powder , we have n't got anything to eat !
Although hold on , what 's that noise ? " ( the chimes ring again and Ricky puts his hand up )
Mark : Midge Ure 's ex-wife Annabel Giles recently referred to herself as a B - list celebrity .
Good news , Britain , that means we 're all A - list celebrities !
Including the pigeons !
( As Sean and David prepare to start their intros round )
David :
Can you do it in my ear ?
Sean :
Do what in your ear ?
( shouts in David 's ear ) Burger , large chips ...
Mark :
It 's the only language he understands !
Sean : Mushy peas and a bit of curry !
( David spins around while doing their first intro )
Sean : Come back !
You must be shit in that van !
" What do you want love ? " ( spins around ) " Oh there you are !
What was it ? "
( For the second intro , David starts whistling )
David : ( laughing )
Can we have some reverb ?
Mark :
Can we have some off ?
David : ( starts whistling into his microphone with a bit of reverb ) Sean :
Are you calling for a dog ?
Mark :
It 's the eerie burger man !
That would be a great advert to keep kids off fried food - him !
Jenni :
Is it recent or is it quite old ?
Sean :
No it 's old .
David :
It 's oooollld .
Mark :
Have you ever had electric shock treatment ?
David : I burnt myself on a cooker once !
( During the third intro )
Sean : Okay I 'm ready .
I 'm having a bit of a breakdown !
In two years time I 'm gonna be working with him in Brighton - " Burger ? "
( Sean stares into space , hands the burger over and whistles )
David : ( Provides a decent backing for Sean ) Sean : A - bum - tish , a - bum - tish , a - bum - tish , shish kebab !
Shish kebab !
Shish kebab !
You 're obsessed man !
( David collapses in hysterics )
( Sean 's team try to identify Ewald Pflager of Opus )
David :
They probably are still working , this group .
I 'm still working so they must still be working .
Mark :
But you 're working in a burger van !
David : I do the odd date .
Mark :
In what band do you play with now ?
Bucks Fizz ?
David : Dollar , Bucks Fizz , you name it .
Guys n' Dolls ...
Mark : Alright , Pink Floyd ?
David : Could do a tribute to Pink Floyd .
Mark : Really ?
What , and not play for a long time ?
( Next Lines )
Mark : Okay , Sean 's team you need six to win , your time starts now .
" I believe in miracles ... "
Sean : Hence David's on the show !
Mark : " Where you from , you sexy thing " , Hot Chocolate .
" You do n't have to say you love me , just be close at hand ...
Sean : Salt and vinegar ?
David : " You do n't have to stay forever , I will understand . "
Number five for Guys n' Dolls in 1975 .
Mark : Yep .
" And the only way to get rid of this great big onion ... "
Sean : Sorry , we 're closed half - day Tuesday .
Mark :
It 's unbelievably The Onion Song by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell .
The next line - " is to plant love seeds until it dies . "
" Mirror mirror mon amour ... "
David : " Mirror mirror mon amour , send me what I 'm waiting for ... "
Mark :
That 's right , yeah .
Dollar .
" I was so upset that I cried all the way to the chip shop ... "
David : Is it Elvis Presley ... boy lives down the ... chip shop ... and he thinks he 's Elvis Presley ...
Sean :
Have you just had a stroke ?
' Cos that 's " There 's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He 's Elvis " ( Time up ! )
Mark :
It was actually " and when I came out , there was Gordon standing at the bus stop " from Jilted John by Jilted John .
Do you know what ?
It comes as a great shock to me that you have n't won !
( Closing lines )
Mark :
This has been Never Mind the Buzzcocks , I 've been Mark Lamarr ...
( The chimes play one more time ) ( to David ) I think you 've got to go back to the mothership !

Phill :
There 's a bit at the end that kind of disturbed me a little - yeah .
Licking his finger going up to her armpit , does he have , like , got deodorant saliva ?
And he 's offering her ...
Mike :
She shaved everything but one hair and it 's driving him mad .
" You got one ... " * poink * you know ... that 's the noise it sounds when you pull one hair out ... " poink . "
Sean : " Poink " ?
Mark : " Poink " 's probably right yeah ... onomatopoeically .
Fairbrass : Onomatopoeically , hello ?
Phill :
Was he just turned on by a big word then ?
Never do Countdown , never ever ... ( as Fairbrass ) Oooh , oh conundrum , hello !
Fairbrass : I do not speak like that !
Phill :
You just did !
Fairbrass : ( laughing ) I do not !
I do not !
Phill : Let 's have a look then at the Billy Bragg thing .
( a still from Sexuality by Billy Bragg is shown - Billy is seen holding a sign saying " Uality " next to a road sign saying " Essex " )
He 's at the side of the A13 if we can have a look at that ...
Kiki :
You think he actually got to " Uality " in the end ?
Sean : Richard 's just gone " what 's ' ualty ' ? "
We 're gonna win tonight ( ! )
Fairbrass : I thought maybe it was a town !
Sean :
That you got banned from !
( Again in Connections , Sean 's team have to find the connection between Victoria Beckham and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit .
Stills of Not Such an Innocent Girl by Victoria Beckham and My Way by Limp Bizkit appear on the screen behind Mark )
Sean : ( referring to Durst )
He 's just really eager hitching is n't he ?
" My way or highway ! "
Mark :
Well it 's very very hard to get to Uality these days .
Fairbrass : I think he looks a bit like David Beckham in a funny fairground mirror at the end .
David Beckham went up to one of those mirrors that 's what he would look like .
Sean :
And that 's the connection ?
Mark : Quite importantly can I just say looking at Victoria Beckham ...
Fairbrass :
Is it gonna be funny what you 're gonna say ?
Mark : I 'd imagine so , or I would n't be saying it ...
Fairbrass : Press on then .
Sean : ( as Fairbrass )
Oooh , press on , Mark !
Press on !
Mark : Looking at the Victoria Beckham thing , it 's very important this time of year , a timely reminder to kids , never ever return to the lit firework once it 's been ...
Sean : Let 's press on ...
Phil :
It must be something to do with the fact that actually , she only eats a biscuit for lunch or something like that ... ( we see a flash of bright lights and hear a clap of thunder ) Mark : ( in a deeply electronically processed voice )
The voice of rock !
Phil : I see I 'm the fall guy in this equation , but okay .
( Phill laughs ) ( to Fairbrass )
Do you think he 's stereotyping us at all ?
Richard , shall we swap roles ?
Maybe I 'll do the camp bits and ...
Mark :
Oh yeah , you 're gonna be editor of Kerrang !
for a long time if you 're doing the camp bits !
Phil :
What are you saying ?
Mark :
At least it might mean that some of your readers can have sex !
( thunder and lightning )
It 's worked for you , Fairbrass !
Fairbrass :
It is true to say I that have been a player of the pink oboe .
And I can raise a real tune on it occasionally ...
Mark : Really ?
Fairbrass : ... but not for some time .
Phill : ( laughs )
It 's the idea of him in bed with someone and , just the duvet , and underneath the duvet ... ( hums PEnnsylvania 6-5000 ) Fairbrass :
If you know the holes to put your finger on you can play a tune ! ( to Mark )
You 're always like this when I 'm on the show !
Mark : I know ...
Fairbrass :
We should just go out , kiss and get it over with .
Mark :
Let 's kiss now .
Let 's do the gay Buzzcocks kiss .
( a female audience member shouts " Ugh ! " .
Fairbrass laughs and points at the audience member , while Mark and the audience laugh . )
I think they meant " Ooh , he 's gonna to kiss Mark ! "
Fairbrass : I like flushing your mouth .
Mark :
That 's the last thing you 'll get , a kiss maybe .
You 're not flushing me out I 'll tell you that !
You can see why it 's been six series before we 've had him back !
Fairbrass : I 've moved house , you lost my address or something .
( During Phill 's Intros round , Mike is stuck on a song )
Mike :
You can do it again if you want , but I have no fucking clue , you could do it backwards .
Mark : I think we might have to do it again without you going " I have no fucking clue " in the middle .
Mike : I have n't a fricking clue .
Mark :
Well , you can say " fricking " .
Mike : I have no fricking clue , cunt !
( During Sean 's Intros round )
Mark : Can I just ...
Have we got Fairbrass because another pop quiz in another country 's had like an exchange student affair ?
Is that why you went ... ( Fairbrass thrusts his pelvis ) ... do n't ever !
Not on my watch , soldier !
Fairbrass : I did it to a Hamburger once .
Mark :
You shagged a hamburger ?
' Cos it said you can have it with or without a gherkin ?
Sean :
Did you sing to it before hand ?
" Hello ... Sean & Fairbrass :
Is it me you 're looking for ? "
Fairbrass : ( thrusts his pelvis ) Bosh !
( Sean mimes having sex with a burger ) Mark : ( pointing at Sean ) It 's Hamburglar !

Mark : According to his publicity you can recognise Omar by his trademark hair which tails above his head .
To be honest I 'm not sure I 'd recognise Omar even if he had a badge which said " I'm Omar " , and a passport , a full set of dental records , a breakdown of DNA and both parents pointing at him saying " That 's our son , Omar , the pop singer ! "
Until I see a Blockbuster card I trust no -one !
12x11 [ edit ]
( Bill 's guest for Identity Parade - Omar )
Mark :
A few weeks ago on this show I made this joke about him ... ( replay of the Omar joke from 12x03 ) ... so , er , God bless him for coming on and ... let 's see if you can recognise him .
( camera shot changes to the lineup - Omar is clearly number 3 ! )
I know you know him anyway , Pete , but it 's obviously number three !
Pete , do you know Omar ?
Pete Tong : No !
Mark :
Is number one Omar ?
Or is it number two , Mullah Omar ?
Or is it number three , Omar , he 's making eyes at me ?
Or is it number four , Omar mia , here I go again ?
Or is it number five , Omar boomerang wo n't come back ?
I feel really guilty now making the joke I would n't recognise him .
I have n't seen him for ten years , he 's the most recognisable person in the world !
Dave Johns : I think number three looks like he's one of those guards outside Buckingham Palace and it's been a really windy day and his bearskin ... it 's rained on his bearskin and it 's just blown off .
I do n't know ...
Mark :
You do know , it 's number three , I 've told you four times !
Even if you 've never seen Omar in your life you 'd go " well it can't be one , two , four or five , because that 's not Omar !
Omar looks like number three ! "
Dave :
Well who 's number one ?
Mark :
He 's not Omar , that does n't matter !
Let 's find out , would Omar please make himself known ?
( Omar - number 3 - steps forward and pulls out a Blockbuster card from his pocket ! )
It is him !
Currently working on his sixth album and recording with various artists including Stevie Wonder - which really does piss on my strawberries , does n't it ?
- a big round of applause for , and thank you very much for coming on , Omar , ladies and gentlemen !

[ Telling a story about the S Club Juniors ] Simon :
So uh , one of the girls , I do n't know which one .
It would probably be wrong to name them , maybe it 's wrong to say it at all .
Should I stop ?
No , OK .
Um , she had her first , you know , " becoming a woman " experience in our studio .
Mark :
And you filmed it !
Simon :
No , we did n't film it !
No .
It happened in one of the dressing rooms .
We 've since redecorated , it was fine ... So anyway , they came back and we were all very sensitive about it .
We introduced them as our favourite band in the world ... period .
Mark :
Nice to see you taking notes there , Bill Bill : I just like to be , uh , apposite of the facts .
Mark :
No you do n't , you like to say cheese and weasels then go " urrh " .
Bill : Or Cheesels as I like to call them .
A weaselly snack with a cheese finish .
Romeo : I thought you was down with Westwood , man .
Mark : I 'm not down with Westwood !
Romeo : No ?
I thought you was down with that , the bitches and the hoes and wh- [ Romeo starts laughing ]
Mark :
Oh I understand the phrase bitches and hoes .
Disrespectful terms for ladies .
Bill : I thought you said ditches and hose .
Like a landscape gardening thing .
" I 'll be down with my ditches , and my hose .
Later on I 'll be building a water feature ! "
Series 15 [ edit ]
15x04 [ edit ]
Mark :
When Carlos Santana first met his future wife Deborah , he said " She smelled like something I wanted to wake up next to for the rest of my life " .
It 's beautiful , is n't it ?
Finding a woman who smells like a bacon sandwich and a can of Irn Bru ?
[ Pretending to cry ]
You 're a lucky man , Carlos !
Mark : " Anything you can do , I can do better ...? "
Larry Hibbitt : I can do anything better than you .

Mark : " She may be the beauty or the beast ... " ?
Bill , I think you 'll know this one .
Isaac Hanson :
Well , he 's definitely the beast , right ?
We 've established that .
Bill : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , Beardy !
Mark :
You can't really call someone Beardy if you 've got a beard , Bill .
Bill : Why Mark , this is not a beard .
It 's a small South American mammal ... that I 've trained to crouch very still .
16x09 [ edit ]
Kenzie : Am I being awkward ?
Mark Lamarr :
No , you 're not being awkward ...
I think it 's pronounced " retarded " .
16x11 [ edit ]
Bradley Walsh : I 've got no idea , give us a clue , for God 's sake .
Mark : Do n't Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult , what more clue can I give you without giving it away ?

You 're talking too quickly !!
How can I understand that ?!
Mark :
Well , I 'm sorry if I was of no help ...

[ Talking about Elton John 's lookalike ] David Grant :
Is he about the same height as Elton John ?
Mark Lamarr :
No , he 's 87 times the size .
They have to film him from miles away !
17x09 [ edit ]
Mark Lamarr : Wet Wet
Wet eventually got so sick of " Love Is All Around " that they wrote to their record company , demanding the song be taken off the market .
And since I found that fact out , I 've spent six months trying to forge James Blunt 's signature : " Dear James Blunt 's record company .
It 's me , James Blunt .
My records are rubbish .
Please stop putting them out .
Thanks .
Bluntie .
PS : You can stab me in the eye as well if you want . "

Simon : Hello there and welcome to Never Mind The Buzzcocks .
I 'm Simon Amstell .
And if you think I 'm a poor booking , let 's meet tonight 's guests !
[ Being asked how he made Britney Spears cry ] Simon : I just suggested that she might have gone a bit nuts recently ... and she took that personally ...
[ Bill 's team is coming up with nonsense answers to the question ]
Simon : I can see now why Mark gets angry all the time .
Simon : I quite like you , Nick .
My mum actually says she quite fancies you .
Nick :
Is that right ?
Simon :
She says ' " He 's got a lovely big face " .
Simon : Britney Spears ' CD's are used by German farmers to keep wild boars from eating their crops .
Meanwhile , Tina Turner 's Greatest Hits are used at Gloucestershire airport to scare birds from the runway .
They originally tried Ronan Keating 's album , but the birds kept hurling themselves into jet engines .
[ In Connected , Phill 's team have to work out the connection between Ian Brown and Wet Wet Wet ] Kenzie :
This is the same Wet Wet Wet as " Love Is All Around " Wet Wet Wet ?
Phill : Yeah .
Seventeen weeks at number one , a third of the year .
Kenzie :
Well , fucking hell !
( Audience laughter ) Phill : Ah , the wisdom of youth ( ! )
Simon : ( to Kenzie )
How young are you ?
Kenzie : I 've just turned twenty .
Simon : Okay .
Kenzie is sweet , is n't he ?
Is n't Kenzie sweet ?
( Some audience members say " yes " )
Why do n't you tell the nice BBC viewers what your song " Flip Reverse It " was all about ?
Kenzie : Um...women ...
Russell : Women ?!
It was about anal in a truck !
( Audience laughter )
Offended by seventeen weeks !
But the idea of bumming a lady in a Mazda ?
Fine .
Kenzie : I 've got a girl friend at the moment , whats she going to think about this ?
Phill : I dunno ... can she sit ?
Kenzie :
We 're going by our human names to be taken more seriously .
Simon : Your human names ?!
Well , I think that 's worked , Kenzie .
[ About Blazin ' Squad ] Kenzie : Four are starting Blazin ' Squad up again , one 's going solo ... and two have gone out and got jobs .
[ In the Intros round , after hearing an intro ]
Nick : Ah , I see it now .
Simon :
You see it now ?
Shall I give you a point for seeing it now ?
Nick : Would help .
' Cause they just got a point .
So we could equalize by my recognizing it afterwards .
[ To Bill ]
This could work very well for us .
Simon : Hang on , hang on .
I 've lost control of the whole thing .
I feel like I 'm the supply teacher and you 're ... you 're just not respecting me as you should .
Nick :
Play the track and I 'll see if I can guess which one of them is going to take the lead and which one 's going to do the - Simon :
How about you be quiet , and stop throwing chalk , Knowles !
Hmmm ?
It 's your own time you 're wasting !
Nick : I just thought I might get one of these .
You know what I mean ?
You sit at home and watch the program and think , " I could do that " .
And you sort of shout at the screen .
And ... now I feel like a tit .
Nick : Forget I spoke .
Simon : Okay .
Always do .
[ Being teased by Simon ] Nick : Er.. bovvered ?
Face ?
Bill : Wide .
Russell : I imagine when Kenzie started singing then , the ears of the other members of the Squad just pricked up .
Like funky meercats ... " Kenzie 's in trouble , put that mouse down ! "
Kenzie : [ After refusing to sing his song " Flip reverse it " ]
I can't sing ... I rap .
Simon :
You rap ?
Kenzie : Uh , no ...
Russell : When did you meet Meatloaf ?
Kenzie :
We were doing Party in the Park in 2002 with the Squad and he , um ... walked past us .
Simon : Wow .
I would have saved that story for Parky , personally .
Simon :
We also heard ' Straight Up ' by Paula Abdul .
During the last series of American Idol , there were ... there were ...
Kenzie : " Scurrilous " .
Simon : " Scurrilous " , thank you very much .
Kenzie : Just trying to help .
Simon : Ooh , I can read !
Phill :
One of 'em had to .
Simon :
This has been Never Mind the Buzzcocks , I 've been Simon Amstell .
And before I go back to youth television ... " Bollocks " !

Ricky Wilson :
And tonight I am contractually obliged to say " I predict a laugh riot ! " … I feel so dirty !
Ryan Jarman :
If there 's any legal implications involved in this , then , like , I invented Live 8 , you see .
This is not actually a lie .
We were in the recording studio recording our album .
I found Bob Geldof 's mobile phone number while we were in the recording studio so I sent him a text message just saying " Three words , mate - Live Aid 2 " .
Lo and behold six months later Live 8 comes out .
It 's just nice to know that you 've made a little bit of difference , that 's all .
It really is .
Bill Bailey : [ to Ricky ]
Last time I saw you was at Heathrow Airport , was n't it ?
And you were shitfaced .
You came up to me and said " [ slurring ] " I 'm Ricky Wilson from the Kaiser Chiefs !
Ricky Wilson : [ drunkenly ]
I love you !
Bill Bailey : [ drunkenly ]
Love you , Bill !
Ricky Wilson : I thought you were Hulk Hogan .

I have a recurring nightmare that I 'm stuck in the middle of a baying crowd watching Deacon Blue .
[ Ricky Ross from Deacon Blue smiles ]
Simon :
Only joking , I 've never heard of you .
[ To Anthea ] Simon :
With this new show , " Perfect Housewife " , did they say to you , " Look , we 'd love you to have your own show , you just need a skill " .
And you went away for five years and you said " I 'm really good at tidying !
I can fold !
Towels !
I can put a toothbrush in a cup ! " .
[ To Ricky Ross ] Simon : Ricky , has anything like that ever happened to you in your career like that ?

It 's Girls Aloud !
Simon : [ About Ricky Ross ]

Personal hygiene !
Bill : A grip on reality !

One or the other ...
Simon : ... Old ...
[ Simon has been making fun of Vanessa ] Simon :
After the show , we 're gonna make love .

Will Smith : I think it is by that early boy band that all looked like car thieves that shagged on bins ... E17 .

Bill Oddie :
She 's been cleaned up very quickly , as they do with the guillemots , and the cormorants and all that sort of thing - Simon : Bill , Bill , I had a feeling you would rather talk about birds this evening , so I prepared your own game .
Here you go , are you ready ?
What 's this ?
[ He plays the sound of a bird ] Bill Oddie :
It 's a robin eating a Crunchie bar .
Simon :
That 's not what I 've got on the card .
Simon :
You 're right , we pixelated some onions ... not a kitten ... being chopped to death by Shakira ...
[ Bill Oddie is talking nonsense ] Stewart Lee :
You 're in charge of this ....
Simon : I am in charge of this !
Stewart 's right !
Shoosh , Oddie !!

[ Holds up a picture of a bird ] Bill Oddie :
That 's an eyebrowed thrush .
Simon : Correct .
Do you know the latin name for it ?
Bill Oddie : No !
Turdus something or other .
Ooh , that 's funny , turdus .
I know where you 're going , I know where you 're going .
Simon :
He 's caught us out .
They 're all slightly rude .
It was the turdus obscurus .
Bill Oddie : Yeah , I know , it 's funny .
Means the invisible shit !
Simon : I thought you knew about birds !
Bill Oddie :
Well , it 's a foreign one .

Bill Oddie :
We do n't mention Lily Allen .
Simon :
We do n't mention her ?
What did she do to you ?
Bill Bailey :
She put super - glue on your bird table .
Simon :
What 's your final answer ?
Tony : Medication .

Phill : " Here is a man in a suit .
I 've got lots of brown so here 's his hair ! "
Simon :
That 's what I was going for ...
Bill Oddie : " Hair or Blair ? "
Simon :
What 's that ?
Bill Oddie : " Hair or Blair ? "
I 'm trying to think up new rounds !
Simon : Very good , " Hair or Blair ? " .
What about [ simultaneously with other panellists ]
" Bill or Kill ? " ?
Stewart Lee :
Well , three has a dance music face ... if there can be such a thing .
Four has a guest dance vocal musicalist hair .
If you put that hair and that face together , it would definitely be that one ... but unfortunately they exist in separate bodies .
Perhaps something could be done about that ...
Simon :
There he is , blaspheming again .
Against God 's work .
[ Thunder is heard ]
Simon : God is not happy with you , Stewart Lee .
[ After trying to guess one of Phil and Jason 's intros , and Simon is wearing a hat ]
Stewart Lee :
You know what it 's like , you 're trying to guess a song , and you end up looking at a hat .
Simon :
You would say that ... because you hate the baby Jesus .
[ Studio audience and panelists laugh ]
Simon :
How dare you come on here with that Pagan - Marxist agenda , this is God 's Pop Quiz .
Bill Oddie : Stay friends with the editor , that 's my advice .

Simon :
That 's not the GMTV way !
Penny :
It would be if I had my way , I 'd say that hair is fantastic !
Amy : Oh , yeah it 's all mine ...' cause I bought it .
Simon : Did you see Pennie smash up the instruments on GMTV ?
Penny : I did , and I was in the studio when he did it ...
Simon :
You must have wanted to smash up the GMTV set though , a couple of times ... or at least Fiona Phillips ' patronizing witch - face .
[ After being badgered by Simon to talk about her love life ]
Penny : Okay , I might do silent humming like I do when something really awful is happening .

This is a weird show , man ... I 've only ever seen it on T.V , and it 's just not like this .
It 's not usually hectoring of day - time T.V presenters .
She 's humming to herself !
Look , she 's been around the block , she 's knocked off a few dudes in her time !!
Simon :
But we want to know , we want to know about Penny 's love life , do n't we ?
Penny : No , I do n't think we want to know ...
Simon :
Tell us about going out Paul McKenna , that 's exciting .
Maxwell : Whoa !
Did you go out with Paul McKenna !?!
Simon : [ About Amy meeting with Pete Doherty ]
Do n't go near him !
Do something with Katie Melua .
There you are .
Amy : I 'd rather have cat - AIDS , thank you .
Simon : [ To Amy ]
It 's lovely to have you here .
Part of the BBC 's new remit : More Jews , less carbon emissions .
Simon : What about John Stapleton , what about him ?
He 's a bit creepy though , is n't he ?
Penny : Oh , will you stop it with your nonsense .
Simon :
Has he ever tried anything on ?
" The time is seven o'clock .
The place is : my lap . "
Simon : You and Stapleton !
" The time is nine pm ... The place : my Travelodge .
Come with me , Penny .
Ride me !
For I am Stapleton . "
Phill : I bet Stapleton , after shagging all night , not a hair out of place .
Maxwell : I bet he does it with a shower cap on .
Simon :
What 's the " push push " ?
Amy : I do n't know , it 's my new thing .
Simon : Is it ?
I thought it was crack .
Amy : Do I look like Russell Brand ?
Simon : Uh , yes .
Amy : [ In unison with Simon ] Yes .
Maxwell :
This feels like a really dysfunctional Christmas day .
[ About Ben Elton ]
Amy : I do n't think there 's such thing as integrity or being a sell out , I just think he 's a wanker .
Simon : Did n't you used to do a fashion column for the Daily Mail ?
Penny : Funnily enough , I did .
I 've done many strange things in my time .
Simon :
What does one wear to a lynching ?
[ Amy complains to Simon about what he said about the participants in the identity line - up ]
Simon :
Oh , they get paid and they know what 's going to happen .
Maxwell :
Oh god , you sound like a pimp !
( In East End Voice )
They gets paid their money , they know whats gonna happen .
As you close the container lorry and set sail for western Europe .
Simon :
This is not a football match .
You come here , full of ... crack ... spitting all over things .
Amy : Let it die , please .
Let it die .
Simon :
The addiction I 'd like to die ... this is n't even a pop quiz anymore , it 's an intervention , Amy .
Penny : Spitting ... that would never happen on GMTV .
Simon : Nothing happens on GMTV .
Simon : [ Reading an intro ]
" They tried to make me go to rehab ... " ?
Amy : " I said no , no , no " .
Simon : Is correct .
In hindsight ... I think maybe " yes " , maybe ...
Simon : [ Reading an intro ]
" They told him do n't you ever come around here ... " ?
Bill : Uh ... because you 're a registered sex offender .
Simon : [ Reading an intro ] " I 've got something to put in you ... " ?
Amy : Thanks darling !
19x05 [ edit ]
[ About Sugababes ] Bill : Ungodly ?
Is there anything specific about that ?
Simon : I think it was just a lot of wiggling of vaginas ... that sort of thing .
Barrowman : Hold on , hold on ... does a vagina wiggle ?!
Not that I 've ever seen one but ; so please inform me .
Simon :
Well , I 'm not an expert ...
Phill :
There 's nothing quite like the riveting T.V stylings of two homosexuals discussing fannies , is there ?
Simon : [ About Liberty X ' X ' ]
People wo n't remember this , as people barely remember Liberty X ...
Simon :
You look like you have n't aged in 15 years .
Barrowman :
That 's what the TARDIS does to you .
Simon : ... You sure it is n't the botox ?
[ Discussing strategies to stay young ]
Bill :
The marrowbone from goats , that 's good as well , is n't it .
Simon : Have you ...
Barrowman : Have I sucked marrowbone from a goat ?
No .
Phill :
But I bet you could .
Simon : Poverty should have been history by now , lazy Cotton !
[ Kelli feels Barrowman 's arse ]
Phill :
You realize the Daily Mail 's going to be in uproar about that bit of the show .
" Black lady touches homosexual on television ! " Barrowman : " With white man in the middle ! "
Simon :
You cheated there , Bill Bailey !
Barrowman : I did n't cheat !
Simon : Not you , Barrowman !
Barrowman : Right .
Simon : Always about you , is n't it ?
" I 'll be on Maria !
I 'll be in Torchwood , I 'll be on any bloody show that 'll have me !
Even Buzzcocks " .
I saw you on Loose Women .
Barrowman : Yeah .
Simon :
They 're awful , are n't they ?
Simon :
You cheated !
Bill : Yeah , I cheated .
And what of it ?
You ai n't the boss of me .
I ain't never gonna be your bitch !
Barrowman :
Talk to the hand ' cause the wrist is pissed .
Simon :
You 've out - gayed me , Barrowman !
Barrowman : [ Exaggerated accent ]
Let 's have a gay - off !
Ready ?
Lips pursed , hands on the table , and go !
Simon : ... I have n't even told my mum yet .
Simon : Kurt Cobain is now the top earning dead celebrity .
So not Bruce Forsyth .
If you 're watching that on a repeat ... and he is dead ... that is inaccurate .
[ Trying to guess an answer with John Barrowman raising his hand ]
Robin : I do n't even think you are gay , Barrowman !
I think .
I 've seen all this pretending that " Oh , do n't worry girls , I 'm just gay , now I 'm going to kiss you and fondle my stuff , " it 's disgusting !
The oldest trick in the book !
What would Barrowman know ?
Oh , Lulu !
It 's Lulu then !
Simon : Robin , John will not be able to help you with this one because tonight he 's playing the part of a stereotype .
Simon :
We 've had a gay man guessing Kylie , a black lady guessing Bob Marley .
We are doing nothing to subvert expectations !
Simon : [ About a gorilla coat ]
I should say that that coat is not made out of gorilla .
Bill : Is it not ?
Simon :
It 's made out of Desert Orchid .
Simon :
Were you ever in the Sugababes ?
Kelli : I was n't in the Sugababes , no .
Simon :
My sister 's going to be in the Sugababes for her gap year .
Simon : Gays ... come here ... take our men ...
Barrowman : [ Singing ]
Oh , high on a hill with a great big dildo !

And Phill , he 's loaded and ready to go !
Lets go !
I 'm coming over with my sex men !
Bill : I have the ears of death !
Simon :
And I have a penis !
What have you got Phill ?
Phill : I 've got 300 pounds that you probably wo n't be able to get from underneath .
So it 's not a shag , it 's more a fight for survival !
Simon : Javine was one of the most boring people I 've ever interviewed .
And I 've interviewed Ronan Keating .
Simon :
Do it again , Jamelia , do the sexy moves .
Bill : And I 'll provide the eye candy .
Jamelia : I love Lily , I think she 's wicked , but I did ask for an edited version of Lily 's album for my daughter , and Lily said she hopes she 's not paying for it .
Lily : No , I just said ... [ laughter ]
Not being funny , Jamelia , but I did n't make my album for your child .

You know what you need ?
Lily : No , Simon !
Just move on , no !
Simon : Come with me ... [ He pulls her up ]
You need a hug .
Yeah , yeah .
I know - I know that - [ She starts to pull away but he pulls her back ] stay in it - I know you feel you have issues with intimacy .
You feel that you 're not loved .
You have a hundred thousand friends on MySpace but are they really friends that you can touch , no , I 'm touching you now .
Okay ?
Everyone loves you here , you do n't need points , you can just be you .
Lily : Okay .
[ They sit .

He loves that child .
He just wanted the people to see !
And if he drops it ... so ?
The fans need something !
Simon : David , you must have met Grace Jones .
Or married her ?
David : So far , Michael Jackson ... should we keep going ?

David :

Simon : I have no regrets , he deserved it .
Bill Bailey : Merry Christmas everybody !
David : I have no clue what you 've been playing .
Phill : Drum .
Simon Amstell : I forgot to tell you we 've had a letter in the Daily Express !
I 'm very proud of this : " Why are so many BBC comedies unwatchable ?

What are you saying Davies , the questions are too easy !?
Alan : Yes .
Simon :
This show is n't so highbrow , but we like to say " Ohh , Robbie Williams is a tit ! "

Oh , oh , you lose a point !

Simon :
Do you just want to pick number two ?
Phill : No .
We picked number four ... but I 'm watching number two .

Simon : Hello there and welcome to Never Mind the Buzzcocks .
Well , the world is still at war with itself .

[ About The Kooks ]
Noel :
They said that they were Boosh fans to us .
And they wanted some T - shirts .
They were going to wear them on Top Of The Pops .
And we did n't have any T - shirts , so I hand painted some ... and I was supposed to meet their tour manager at , like , three in the morning in Camden .
So I 'm standing there on my own with hand painted T - shirts ... and he did n't turn up !
He just fell asleep !
So , they did n't get any T - shirts - Alfie :
How long were you there for ?
Noel : Oh ... four minutes .

[ Makes strange gesture ]
Simon : : [ Does the gesture ]
And now I 'm cool ...
Donny :
You know you'd be quite happy at home on the streets Bill : Yeah ...
Donny :
Though not that many people 'd take pity on you ...' cause you 're pretty ugly .
Bill : Oooh !
Simon : [ To Donny ]
I should explain : Bill is a professional comedian ... [ Pause as Simon tries to contain his amusement at Donny 's stupidity ] you wo n't win !
[ Donny tells a bad joke and the audience groans ]
Donny :
Oh for fuck 's sake ... not very sharp are you ?
Simon : Yeah , it was definitely their fault .
[ After watching a video of Donny shouting ]
Phillip : I like the way that you had all that aggression , and then at the end you just sat down and crossed your legs ...
Simon : I do n't understand .
Did he suggest that you could n't dick on the Sex Pistols ?
I think , I think you can dick on them .
Donny : Well , I 've got a dick ... I 'm here ...
Simon :
He has got a dick and he 's here ... I think that 's the best we can hope for tonight .
Simon : [ to Philip ]
By the way , I watched that Hollyoaks :
In the City last night , and it was incredible !
Imagine Hollyoaks ... but EVEN WORSE !
You were the best actor in it though ...

Simon : I watched it last night , and I thought " no problem , you 're on the show " I 'll watch it , half an hour , fine ...
LASTS AN HOUR !
I 'm sat there , I 'll never get that time back again !
Simon :
Have you got an answer ?
Phill :
You know what , I 'm gonna take his answer .
I do n't know what it 'll be , but none of us do !
Donny : I can't even remember the question .
Phill :
Why did Prince end up in court over some purple paint ?
Your best guess , now !
Donny : .... Because his helmet turned blue ?
Phill : Because , Simon ... his helmet turned blue .
Bring in the points , bitch !
In the bag .
Simon :
His helmet turned blue .
[ turns to camera , deliberately ]
You 're wrong .
Donny :
The only reason I 'm on the show is ' cause you told everyone you fancied me , dude !
Simon :
It 's not , it 's ' cause we have difficulty booking people .
Donny Tourette : [ gripping his groin ]
This is what I think of you !
Simon : Really ?
You think me ... a small penis ?
Well I never !
[ Simon is showing Philip 's calendar full of risqué shots ]
Simon :
Are you at all upset , you know , when you saw the calendar ... it was just pictures and none of your teachings ?
Simon : Donny just called me ' Anstis ' .

Donny : I thought your name was Anstis ?

Simon : Yes !
Donny : I like beer .
Simon : And I like you ...

He 's been given dungarees and a perm .
Bill : The international symbol of inbreeding .
Simon :
How dare you !
Donny :
My shades !
Simon :
When he goes , you can have them back .
Is that all right , do you want them back now ?

You 're about as punk as Enya !

Ed : I love that you called him " Snoop Doggy Dogg " ...
It 's Snoop Dogg .
Simon : Getting advice from the middle aged man in a hoodie ...
Ed :
The only person who'd call him Snoop Doggy Dogg is his mother and then only when he 's in trouble ... " Snoop Doggy Dogg !
Clean these hoes out of your bedroom ! "
Simon :
So what connects the two ?
Phill :
What connects the two ?
What does n't ?
Prosperous , black , rappers , drugs , firearms ...
Simon :
You 're quite right , there are a lot of things that connects them .
Really , the game should be called " What is written on my piece of paper ? "
Simon : I 've been listening to your album , it 's very impressive .
Preston : Good , thank you .
Simon : All tracks written by Preston ... except 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 - Preston : I wrote them with my guitarist !

Ed If I can't sleep at night , phone me up and tell me that story !
Simon : I will phone you ... on my Mowbli .
[ Ed is a spokesman for Carphone Warehouse , which uses Mowbli as a mascot ]
Simon : I feel reluctant to say anything about Britney because this show does n't go out for a couple of weeks and her story in the tabloids changes so often ... maybe we should cover ourselves .
I can't believe that picture of her with that cake up her bottom !
Bill : Blimey , maybe we should do something about Britney and that rare ... bird ...egg ... Simon : Unbelievably , she 's the new voice of Carphone Warehouse !
She 's got her life back together and is now recording a new album ?!
Just in case ...
Simon : So , Fyfe , your band is famous for using odd inst -... I say famous ... are known ...
[ Speaking about Fyfe 's band mate ] Simon : I read in your bumph that she found the perfect bass note to give a lady an orgasm .

Simon : I never thought I 'd be on T.V trying to give Madge an orgasm .
[ Ed correctly guesses the song in the Intros round ]
Preston : Correct !!... Am I allowed to say that ?

Let 's hear how it should have sounded .
[ Plays the song ]
In the future , I would like to break the news ...
[ Quoting from Chantelle Houghton 's book ]
Simon : " The Paris Hilton work was a low point for me .
It was n't what I wanted to be doing , and on top of that it caused me some real problems with my hair " .
[ Puts book down .

What ?
It 's a good ...
Have n't you read it ?
I do n't want to spoil the ending for you !

Simon : Preston , we 're having fun !
Preston : I ain't .
[ He storms off stage ] Simon : Come on , Preston !
Oh no , we can't lose Preston ...

Simon : I mean , I only read his girlfriend 's book .
[ An audience member yells out " It 's his wife ! " ]
Simon : I only read his wife 's book ...
Bill :
What 's wrong with that ?
Simon : I can't believe that upset him ... I mean ... I do n't know if he 's read it .

[ Opening the show , with a reference to Preston walking out in the previous show and some of the comments Preston made to the press about his treatment on the show ]
Simon : Hello , and welcome to " budget , late - night indie - show " Never Mind the Buzzcocks .
I'm " bitter , snotty - faced little public schoolboy " Simon Amstell , and I 'd like to begin with an apology .
On last week 's show I upset Preston from Preston and Chantelle .
I realise now they are better than me .
Preston is a wonderful singer and Chantelle invented the popular saying " Oh my God ! " I was unfair in my representation of Chantelle 's book .
It 's not bad , there are some really interesting bits .
( Pulls out Chantelle 's book and starts to read from it ) " Suddenly ... "
Okay !
( Puts book down again ) I hope we can all move on now !
Simon : Oooohhh , Vienna !
And being Scottish it really does mean nothing to me !
Phil 's first guest is legendary Band Aid co-creator and former Ultravox frontman Midge Ure .
Midge is also known for being the best mate of Sir Bob Geldof ... and for his cheeky catchphrase " Where 's my sodding knighthood ? "
[ Following from last show where Preston walked out ]
Simon : I mean , I do n't want to go on about it ... but if people start turning their backs on comedy and walking off panel shows ... then the terrorists have won .
[ About a Billy Idol video ]
Bill :
There 's a fantastic shot of a toaster that seems , uh ... it's actually , it 's the very rare , the genie of the toaster .
It 's uh , rub it three times : " I am the genie of the toaster !
You have three wishes ... providing they are of a ... toast ... based ... nature ... " ...
Bill : Can I just ask ... They get a serious question about politics , we get " Who pissed themselves ? " .
" Who wee'd ? " , " Who weed , Bill .
You simpleton from the woods .
With your simple friends that you collected in a glade out in the woods " ... They get , " Oh , who lobbied the government blah blah " , a serious question for the proper people who 've done charity and are all proper , but the monkey boys over here get " Who weed ! " .
You snotty nosed , public school boy ...
Simon :
All right , what do you think we should do about nuclear waste ?
Bill : I dunno , I do n't care .
Simon :
When I was younger , we did n't have to have drugs ..
Russell : You had Ferrero Rocher did n't you ?
[ About Simon ] Russell : [ In a posh voice ]
Hey lads , take your snuff , let 's stay up till nine .
You should ride to the studio on a swan next week .
Simon : I bloody would if the asylum seekers had n't eaten them all .
Simon : Bob Geldof , I understand , has lobbied the government about nuclear waste , Midge .
Midge : Has he ?
Sir Bob Geldof ?
Simon : Sir Bib Geldof , yes .
What do you think we should do about the environment , Midge ?
Midge : Give me a bloody knighthood and I 'll tell you !
Simon : I do n't think it works that way round , Midge !
The Magic Numbers [ Points to Romeo ] were not on Live 8 , Band 20 ...
What was it called ?
Midge : Oh , the record ?
Simon :
Why was this ?
Midge : I 've got no idea !
Simon :
You were there !
Did n't you produce the song ?
Midge :
No I was the executive producer which meant that I let someone else do all the work and I took all the credit !
Simon : Did n't Bob take all the credit ?
Midge : Bob is ... Bob is like a death eater from Harry Potter .
" It 's mine ! "
Simon :
That 's what tonight is all about ... having a wonderful time .
Bill : Yeah , let 's not be negative .
Simon : I like everything ... Do ... D'you know everything ?
Well , I like it ... You know all books ?
I like them all !
[ About Bill and Romeo ] Russell :
That was lovely .
That was like two really jolly farmers singing at me ...

[ Following Preston storming off last episode ] [ Talking about Sade ] Simon :
In 1995 , Sade performed at Live Aid , and said that afterward , she did n't get to meet any of the stars ... she just sat in the green room with Midge Ure .
[ Midge looks pissed off ]
Simon : Stay where you are , Midge !
Midge : Wanker .
Simon : Yeah ... good point .
[ Trying to help Nick guess a band ]
Midge :
It 's a youthful combo .
Nick : Youthful Combo ..?
Simon : From Liverpool .
[ Nick looks blank ]
Midge : With a saxophone .
[ Silence ] Phill : Called The Zutons .
Simon : How old are you , Nick ?
Nick : Seventeen .
Simon : Seventeen , wow .
You 're really ruining my " I 'm the young guy " thing here .
Normally I get away with being the young person , being under thirty - five and able to name the Sugababes .
Tonight I feel that Phill has seen what a real young person is and is going to stop loving me ... I feel like Rudy from the Cosby show when she got old and grew a mustache .
[ Following Preston storming off last episode ]
Simon : I do not want you to worry about this , Nicholas Hoult .
This does not affect anything in your life .
We are just having fun .
Nick : I just want to go home ...
Simon : Do n't you move !
[ Reminiscing about being a child ]
Russell : Doing that and writing " boobless " on your calculator ... great days Bill : Yeah , saving your scabs in a little matchbox ... ah , posting them to your pen pal ...
Russell : Ha !
Pasting them to your pen pal ... " Dear , dear Gunther ... I thought you 'd enjoy these ! "
Bill : " Ici , mon scabs ! " Russell : [ Putting on a drawling accent ]
" Dear Bill , thank you for your scabs ... next time a pube or two ... Yours , Renoir...mmmmmmmmmmmm . "
Bill : " Chèr Renoir , I am terminating this correspondence ... it 's gone a bit weird . "
[ Talking about the line - ups costume ]
Phill :
Why 's it like sunglasses , skiing , sunglasses , sunglasses , the MOON !
Phill :
You see , this is the seat that Preston left , this is the seat that Lemmy left the show , admittedly at the re-takes ... we should just call it the ' Ejector seat ' Simon : [ Thoughtfully ]
We should maybe get some sort of seatbelt ...
[ Talking about Midge 's daughter 's band , after getting at Midge because Bob Geldof got all the credit ] Simon : The Faders were a female Busted .
Very good , I interviewed them , I enjoyed them very much .
Did n't do too well , shame .
Midge :
There 's something about you and interviewing .
Simon : Meanwhile , Peaches Geldof ... pretty big news ...

Jonas :
They only way you could injure yourself with peanut butter is if you were wanking with it .
Phill : Yeah , but only if you use crunchy ....
Jonas : I 've tried both and believe me , it happens with both .
Simon :
What are you talking about , Robin Hood ?
Phill : I actually like it with jam ... peanut butter , not wanking .
Jonas :
Out in the forest we did n't have peanut butter so we used , like , rabbit skin ...
Phill :
Is this a more adult Robin Hood ?
Bill : Robin of Hollyoaks ... after dark .
Simon : " Where 's Friar Tuck ? " , " He 's screwing a tree . "
[ Guessing a song ] Jonas : Is it Northern ?
Phill : ooh ?
Jonas :
It is ... Stone Roses , " Sally Cinnamon " Nick : Ahh ... Jonas : " Shes a Waterfall " !!
Waterfall , Waterfall !
Simon : Jonas , I would have given you a point ... but you were a bit smug about it .

Simon : I can not give you this point , Jonas .
Joans :

[ After Rik Waller from the line up swaps places with Phill ] Nick :
There 's no answer anymore ...
Simon :
To be honest - Nick :
What shall I do ?
What shall I do ?
Simon : I 'm very confused .
There is no doubt about it that that [ He looks at Rik sitting in Phill 's place ] is Rik Waller ...
Yet we have a line up of people ...
Phill :
When you say will he step forward , he can't ' cause he 's not here .
It 's a conundrum , Simon .
Simon :
Why did n't I spend more time at presenting school ?!
What are we going to do ... quick , Sinitta , stand on a ball !!
Simon :
How does you theme go ?
Jonas :
It has n't got lyrics ...
Phill : " He 's the bitch of Sherwood forest !

Simon : [ Reading an intro ]

[ After watching a video ] Simon : That was Babyshambles with " Fuck Forever " .
I find that suggestion obscene and impractical .
[ About Pete Doherty ] Mel C : Have you seen his fingernails ?
Would you ever let those fingernails anywhere near you ?
They 're dirty .
Simon :
But you could clean his fingernails and then use them ...
[ About his experience with drugs ]
Adam : Mushrooms , jesus , yeah , I did some mushrooms , can I just tell you ?
' Cause , uh , no one told me what kind of dose you 're supposed to take .
You know , because I fell into the bad crowd at university .
Do n't go to university , kids .
It 's a disaster .
And uh , they said , like , " Let 's do some mushies ! " .
I said , " I do n't want to do too many , because drugs frighten me .
I do n't want to get off my head completely , I just want to get a bit giggly " .
They said " All right , just want to get a bit giggly ... take a hundred " .
So I had a hundred fucking mushrooms ... and so , went to Mars , you know .
And that was the night that my scrotum shriveled up to the size of a pea .
I had to spend the rest of the week just , like , looking at photographs of myself , my friends and family to try and remember who I fucking was .

Simon : Good message there from the BBC .
Bonnie : How many Nellies does it take to change a nightbulb ?

Bonnie : Two .
One from the team , the one from the ...uh... the guy who goes to fetch the other one in red ...

Series 21 [ edit ]
21x01 [ edit ]
Simon : I do n't really think that Girls Aloud are boring .
Or The Kooks are n't that good .
Or that Westlife are a tired and vile disease who prey on mentally ill Woolworths shoppers , who found it acceptable to cover a Michael Buble song from two years ago , and should be subjected to a marathon punching and gouging session before being stabbed in the legs , burnt alive , and then stuffed and hung in the British Museum under a sign that reads " Dead Old Shit " .
It 's just a fun pop quiz !
Simon : Are we supposed to like Kate Nash ?
I have n't done this show for so long , I 've forgotten who we 're supposed to hate ...
I like her ... is she on Facebook ?
Joel :
She must be .

Bill : Are you on Myspace ?
Are you Myspaced up ?
Lethal : Yeah I 'm on Myface .
Bill : My ... Myface ?
Lethal : Myspace Phill : Is Kate Nash on your face or not ?
I need to know ?
Bill : I hate that , people who ... like , nick your herbs out of your trolley .
You 're planning a really nice casserole , you got all the herbs , and somebody nicks the herbs out of your trolley .
It 's not theft , technically , cause you have n't paid for it .
Phill : Bill 's next song ... ooh , took my chives , took my chives , took my chives !
Ooh took my chives !
Simon : Nash said that one of her one hundred and nine thousand friends on Myspace said he wanted to put a bomb up my cunt .

I bet they do .
Simon :
There 's a nice area in front of the desk ...
Jessica :
Do you want to wrestle ?
Simon :
Have a bit of a wrestle .
Jessica : Okay , come on .
[ They begin to hesitantly wrestle .
Simon grabs Jessica 's waist and tries to lift her over his shoulder , Jessica pushes him on the floor and grabs his foot before pinning him down .

Simon :
What that was good for was like a ' best of ' package .
[ Jessica guesses an intro correctly ]
Simon :
She 's so smug is n't she Kimberly ?
Very smug .
What a bitch .
What a bitch that Jessica Hynes is ... comes here , with her career .
Simon : George Bush claims that he has ' My Sharona ' on his iPod , but mainly to drown out the screams of thousands of dead Iraqi children .
[ Simon put up a picture of a field of flowers with kittens as a way of claiming that the show is only a quiz and should n't be taken seriously ]
Phill :
You 're gonna need a bigger kitten .
Simon :
All there silly jokes that we doing about , oh , you should get a job , I mean ... why should you have a job !
It 's ridiculous !
Kimberly : Oh , stupid me , getting a job !
Simon : I mean , what do they want you to do ?
Kimberly : I do n't know !
Simon : Achieve something ?!?
Bastards !
Kimberly :
It 's just so stupid !
Simon :
Not everyone can do what you do .
You have a , eh , individual talent ... when did you first realize that you had what it took to be Rod Stewart 's daughter ?
[ About the line up ] Jessica : [ not taking her eyes off him ]
Number four ... uh , I 'm concerned for ... because he has a haunted look that ... is chilling me to the bone ...
Simon :
And after all that ... oh , it 's a tie , rendering this whole thing completely pointless !
21x02 [ edit ]
Simon :
By the way , David Cross is a big American star .
( to David )
We were worried you would n't know what the hell anyone is talking about , I 've written out some pop facts for you ( hands David some cards ) just so you can use them and if you need them at any point , then they 're there .
David : Okay ... ( reading from a card ) " Mis -Teeq 's Sabrina has the middle name Frederica ! " ( to the audience ) It 's true !
It 's really true !
David :
You know what ?
This is kind of weird ... ( reading from a card ) " Kavarna thinks that Italy is the most romantic country in the world , and he would love to live there one day ! "
People are weird .
Simon : ( whispers to David ) Kavana .
David : Kavana is what ... ( audience laughter and applause ) Kavana is what he refers to himself ... in public ... but those who truly know him , like myself ...
( After Noel 's team 's Intros round , where Ryan has failed to get either Intro correct ) Simon : Do n't worry , Ryan , it 's alright .
You look a bit upset .
Do n't worry about it .
David :
Here , read that to yourself .
( hands Ryan one of his cards ) Ryan : ( reading from the card ) " Sinéad from B * Witched says the most nervewracking thing she 's ever done is sit a piano exam . "
Simon :
Do you feel better now ?
Ryan : ... I do actually .
( During Phill 's team 's Intros round ) Katy : I 'm just bracing myself .
Phill :
You comfy ?
Katy : Yep .
Phill : Strap in .
Katy : I 'm strapped in .
Take me to musical heaven , Phill Jupitus !

Oh my God , I can't believe I 've just said that !
Phill : Musical heaven I can't do , but I do know a Travelodge on the A127 ...

May 4th , 2008 ( Updated January 30 , 2009 )
The iPhone Dev Team announces the availability of “ XPwn ” , a fast Linux cross - platform command - line pwnage utility that is a preview of a cross- platform pwnage library currently finishing development .
XPwn includes the core functionality of the Mac PwnageTool in a flexible command - line utility for Linux hackers , enabling you to pwn your iPhone on more platforms than ever before .
However , the main significance of XPwn is the underlying library , which is a cross- platform implementation of many of the proprietary Apple containers and formats that are present in iPhone / iPod touch firmware packages .
These include : Img2 , 8900 , complzss and iBootIm .
Also included is a library that is capable of extracting , altering , and creating Apple .dmg files ( an undocumented format ) and HFS +/ HFSX ( the native filesystem of Mac OS X and the iPhone ) without the aid of hdiutil or other Mac - only utilities .
The dmg / hfs+ XPwn libraries have already been incorporated into the recently released WinPwn beta 2 ( an independent work by cmw ) .
The Dev Team hopes that these libraries will be helpful to the development community in exploiting pwnage .
UPDATE ( 5/17 ) :
The library is not fully polished yet , but early sources are available here : http://github.com/planetbeing/xpwn
The Linux and Windows binaries below are automatically generated every night from the latest source revision .
The Mac version will lag behind unless somebody wants to donate space on a OS X machine that can run a cron job every night .
Linux binaries : http://iphwn.org/xpwn/xpwn-linux-x86-nightly.tar.bz2 ( x86 ) , http://iphwn.org/xpwn/xpwn-linux-x64-nightly.tar.bz2 ( x64 )
Mac binaries : http://iphwn.org/xpwn/xpwn-mac.zip
Windows binaries : http://iphwn.org/xpwn/xpwn-windows-nightly.zip
( for the ramdisk utility , libusb - win32 - filter is required .
Vitally important note for Vista users )
Happy hacking !

To Defeat Famine :
Kill the WTO by Marcia Merry Baker
February 2008
The World Trade Organization the agency and the thinking behind it must be killed .
We are at the point of famine today , because only 13 years ago , in January 1995 , the WTO was allowed to come into existence , resulting from ten years of UN GATT talks ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) , 1984 - 94 , on reforming  world agriculture for free trade .
This culminated a process of drastic takedown of world food production potential , from its prior build - up during the FDR period and after World War II .
The inevitable result was todays worldwide food crisis .
The WTO was evil from the start .
Nations were bullied and threatened into going along with it .
Tolerating it today is committing evil .
The following is an accounting of the crimes of the WTO - era , and of actions by agencies and figures leading up to it .
What is evident , is that the conditions for the vulnerability of millions of people to hunger and now famine , were masterminded by networks with the intent to subvert nations and cause depopulation .
The capstone of the whole downgrading process was the biofuels craze , with Al Gore as the top biofool , campaigning to save the planet . 
Not his own man , Gore is just the pathetic puppet of the neo-British Empire crowd , intent on subverting the system of nation - states itself , now that the financial system is crumbling .
The WTO crime record can be best understood by looking back to the decades and locations where policies to promote agro-industrial production once were in effect from the 1930s anti-Depression farm programs in the United States , to the food self - sufficiency programs of India , undertaken after its independence from the British Empire in 1947 .
But then , over the decades , a series of policy downshifts undercut the goal and the gains made , and decreased the volume of available food .
Former high - productivity farm regions were dep
opulated , from the High Plains of North America , to Europe , Australia , and South America .
Now one - seventh of the worlds population lacks enough to eat .
Against this backdrop , the story of the WTO is one of crimes against humanity , and not an academic economics debate .
How to stop the WTO ?
Nullify it .
Withdraw membership .
Suspend its codicils , and also those of its multilateral clones , such as NAFTA , CAFTA , and all the rest .
There is no way to make any of this so - called free ( rigged ) trade fair or useful .
In the face of todays food emergency , recall what the core WTO liturgy is : Nations must not keep food reserves , because this would be trade - distorting .
Nations must not attempt to be food self - sufficient , because this would deny their citizens the right to access the world market . 
Nations must not support their own farmers , because this harms farmers elsewhere .
Nations must not use tariffs , because this denies right - of - access to your citizens by foreign producers .
And so on and on .
The consequences of this are genocidal , so dont debate it .
Cancel it .
We first look at the scope and recent history of todays food crisis , and then at the criminal nature of the WTO .
The Food Isnt There !
Figure 1 shows that world per-capita output of grains of all kinds ( rice , wheat , corn , and others ) has been falling for 20 years .
Whereas in 1986 it was 338 kilograms per person , it went down to 303 by 2006 .
This decline in no way has been made up for by increasing amounts of other staple foodstuffs tubers , legumes , or oilcrops , which likewise are in insufficient supply .
Figure 1
Figure 2 shows that in 12 of the last 20 years , less grain has been produced than utilized that year ( for all purposes direct human consumption , livestock feed , industrial and energy uses , and reserves ) .
Accordingly , the amount of carryover stocks of grain from year to year has been declining to extreme danger levels .
The diversion of food crops into biofuels is the nail in the coffin .
Figure 2
The latest estimate is that worldwide stockpiles of cereal crops of all kinds are expected to fall to a 25 - year low of 405 million tons in 2008 .
That is down 21 million tons , or 5 % , from their already reduced level in 2007 .
Translated into how many days of consumption  the diminishing grain supplies represent , the drop is down to less than two months as of 2007 , as shown in Figure 3 .
Since this is a generalization , it signifies that in many locations , millions have barely anything or nothing at all to eat .
Figure 3
Thus , behind the hyper - speculation of recent weeks on the agro-commodity exchanges , there is no product now to meet the needs of real usersnations , bakers , brewers , consumers .
The markets are non-functional .
Another way to put it , is that prices of grains have gone vertical .
Prices for paper bushels  have no relation to real bushels , and you may not find supplies at any price .
For example , the Philippines on April 17 held a rice tender to secure contracts for 500,000 metric tons of rice from international bidders , but only 325,750 mt was offered .
The prices ranged from $ 872.50 to $ 1,220 per mt , and the Philippines National Food Authority had budgetted a maximum of $ 900 a metric ton .
But they are now short .
As of April , many of the top grain - exporting nations have restricted their product from the world markets in order to protect domestic consumption .
Bans on rice exports are in place in Vietnam , China , and India .
Wheat exports have been limited from Russia and Kazakstan .
Governments are seeking nation - to - nation deals to secure food flows just for the near future .
The Philippines has pledges from Vietnam and the U.S.A .
But many more of the poorest nations are simply left without .
Food riots are sweeping the globe , from Haiti and Central America , to Africa and Bangladesh .
Those in London who have acted to enforce the world markets  system in recent years , are now screaming the loudest to denounce governments for trying to withhold grain from trade , and for making government - to - government deals outside the markets .
Typical is an April 15 report by the British bank HSBC ,  The Food Price Scare ,  which in 45 pages fulminates against government price , export , and shipment controls .
Singling out rice pledges between Vietnam and the Philippines , the HSBC said such measures have perverse impacts  and will merely prolong the adjustment process  required to bring inflation down .
The Economist of London derides government - to - government grain deals as  Cereal Offenders . 
But in contrast to these jackals , the scientific and moral reaction to the fact that world food markets have crashed , and nations are reverting to national - interest impulses , is to shut down the WTO .
Especially since the 1999  Seattle Round ,  which was peremptorily shut down amidst tear - gas , rioting , and a lock - down of the city , the WTO has rightly been viewed as a zombie agency the walking dead .
But no one has had the guts to counter the Brutish Empire powers behind it , and bury it .
Commitment to Food for All , 1940 - 60s
Over the first post - World War II decades , a commitment prevailed to build up the economic activity worldwide to end hunger .
This is reflected in even the crudest data measuring the annual production of grains per capita , as shown in Figure 1 .
From 250 kilograms per person in 1950 , it rose to the range of 337 by 1978 .
In some parts of the world , this effort was built on the productive foundations laid many decades previously , such as in the United States and Canada , Argentina , and elsewhere .
European agriculture was rebuilt .
In the United States over the 1800s , especially after the Lincoln Presidency , the farmbelt was extended over larger and larger land areas , with higher organization and productivity per unit area , because of the newly built networks of railroads , mechanized farming , water management , and putting scientific advances into practice from animal husbandry to chemicals .
Over the 1950s and 60s , U.S. yields per acre continued to increase .
For other parts of the world , particularly India , and throughout Africa , the effort to increase food production had to be made over this same period , to make up for the colonial legacy of the lack of infrastructure and farm inputs .
It was President Roosevelts explicit mission to commit the United States to collaborate with this international post - war drive to see newly freed nations prosper .
There were institutional initiatives to further the mobilization for ending world hunger .
In 1945 in Quebec City , Canada , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) was founded , later moved to Rome .
Its defined mission : to end hunger .
In December 1953 , the Atoms for Peace program was announced by President Dwight Eisenhower in a speech to the UN General Assembly .
The program had specific technological proposals for advancing agriculture , including nuclear - powered desalination to supply irrigation , and nuclear - powered canal blasting .
The guiding concept was that plentiful nuclear power could transform the landscape and create a new man - made natural resource base , especially water , for infrastructure and agro-industrial advance .
There were new centers for crop R&D established to breed high - yield seed varieties on a crash basis .
Fabulous gains called the Green Revolution were made for wheat and corn by the Mexico City - based CIMMYT ( International Center for Wheat and Corn Research ) .
Although officially dedicated in 1966 , its work started during wartime in 1942 , at the instigation of FDRs Vice President , Henry Wallace , a crop geneticist from Iowa .
In Fall 1941 , he drove through the countryside of Mexico , the homeland of corn , finding extemely low plant yields .
Knowing there would be no wartime funding , Wallace enlisted Rockefeller financing , and corn and wheat research began right away .
In 1960 , the International Rice Research Institute was established in the Philippines , and similar public - good R&D centers were set up in Africa , Asia and the Americas , with specialties including potatoes , beans , and wheat .
There were visions and hopes for the entire globe , even the most extreme climates .
FDR himself spoke of making the Sahara Desert bloom .
There were plans for even the circumpolar region .
In 1944 , after a trip across the Bering Strait at the behest of President Franklin Roosevelt , Vice President Wallace called for an  Agricultural Council of the Far North ,  to bring together leaders from Scandinavia , the Soviet Union , Canada , and Alaska , to work on expanding farm output in the subpolar regions after the war , to make way for vast new settlements and population .
Despite entrenched networks opposing such a positive worldview centered in the Anglo - Dutch crowd that had covertly backed European fascism to begin with there were significant successes and agricultural firsts  over the post - war decades .
One way to appreciate this , is to consider the many national achievements in food self - sufficiency and even abundance .
Mexico .
By the early 1950s , CIMMYT developed new seeds which had an inherently 20 - 40 % higher yield than seeds available in 1940 had .
With this success , combined with other rural programs , Mexico was a net food exporter in the 1960s .
Large water management programs were on the drawing boards to make maximum use of the plentiful Sierra Madre Mountains  run-off , and to launch nuclear power plant development .
India , in 1974 , became food self - sufficient , ending the famine legacy from the days of the British East India Company and the Empire .
This achievement , reflecting the commitment of government , science , and farm leaders , was built on the country - to - country collaboration with Mexico from the 1960s .
As of 1964 , Indian and Pakistani farm scientists , trained in Mexico , began field tests with the new CIMMYT Green Revolution wheat seeds on the Indian Subcontinent .
worldfoodprize.org
In 1966 , Siri C. Dr. Subramanian , Indian Minister of Food and Agriculture , made the historic decision to import the new high - yield wheat seed developed in Mexico .
Going against all critics , who worried about risk , 240,000 hectares were sown .
It did spectacularly .
India became self - sufficient in cereals by 1974 .
Shown are the Mexican seed shipments in 1966 , with Dr. Norman Borlaug ( center ) , of CIMMYT , who collaborated with Subramaniam , and is considered the father of the Green Revolution .
Sudan , the largest nation in Africa , has an arable land base of 200 million acres that could easily be cultivated equivalent to half the cultivated farmland area of the United States .
But as of 1954 , at the time of its independence from Britain , the challenge was to overcome the colonial legacy of very restricted cotton - growing ; barely 7 % of Sudans area was cultivated , with little irrigation .
Ambitious plans were laid , in collaboration with Egypt , to create vast improvements in land use and controlled water supply .
The keystone project was to channel the flow of the White Nile , part of the Upper Nile system , with the 360 - kilometer Jonglei canal .
Requiring a long lead time , construction did start in 1980 , and was two - thirds complete in three years .
( By the mid-1980s , it was thwarted by the Gorey networks described below . )
In the United States during these immediate post - war years , improvements in agricultural productivity were achieved .
For example , corn yields : Whereas in 1931 , the U.S. average corn per acre harvest was 24 bushels the same as at the time of the Civil War , by 1941 , this rose to 31 bushels .
By 1980 , the U.S. average was 100 bushels an acre , from hybrid seeds , mineral fertilizers , and other advances .
PIB
Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ( 1917 - 84 ) , during a visit to the state of Jammu and Kashmir .
In 1966 Gandhi , to show her support for the controversial introduction of high - yield wheat seeds , planted some in the front flowerbeds of her Ministerial house .
One key principle to this agricultural development process was most explicitly implemented as law in the United States , beginning during the Roosevelt Administration in the 1930s , through the wartime food mobilization drive , and then for a time after the war : the concept that it is in the national interest for there to be a stable , family - scale farm sector .
To achieve this , the government could mandate the price levels that private buyers of farmers  commodities would have to pay , in order for the farm family to receive an income on a par with their costs of production ( including a decent profit , with which to plough back into the household and farm operation ) .
This was known as a parity pricing program .
In the case where the government wanted to induce more output , whether wheat , honey , milk , or many other commodities , a parity price over 100 % would be set for a relevant time period .
If there appeared to be overproduction , a parity price of less than 100 % , would obtain for a specified time .
The last explicit law of this type in the United States was that of 1949 , following on 1933 and 1938 parity pricing acts .
Enemies of the right and responsibility of nations to see to their own food supply , bitterly attacked the parity pricing concept with epithets such as communist ,  and outmoded . 
In time , they succeeded in forcing out the parity pricing principle altogether , in favor of the market forces  pricing concept , the euphemism for privatizing and globalization .
Assault on Nations , 1970s
By the 1970s , the opponents of the principle of a world of thriving nations , had regrouped to conduct multiple assaults on the attempts at national agro-industrial development .
One of the most destructive was the 1971 removal of the U.S. dollar from the gold reserve standard , and the launch of a floating - exchange - rate currency system .
Nations with trade relations involving farm and other commodities , including agriculture inputs , were thrown into uncertainty .
They were hit with terrible terms of trade , in which they had to try to obtain expensive dollars to cover essential imports of machinery or chemicals , and yet sell what they had to export at destructively low prices .
Then came more chaos , in the form of the 1973 Oil Crisis , setting the conditions for price spikes , and spot market speculation .
This was orchestrated out of London , with the connivance of Henry Kissinger , then U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor , who boasted at Chatham House in 1982 , that he was proud to be an agent of Britain !
The same kind of orchestrated chaos ensued after the 1972  Great Grain Robbery . 
In this episode , sizable Russian purchases were made on U.S. grain markets through the usual world grain cartel companies .
Then , during the ensuing period of price spikes , U.S. farmers were subjected to heavy propaganda that they could best succeed on  free markets .
Kissinger struck a new cartel - serving shipping treaty , that opened U.S. ports to foreign carriers for future free trade .
All the while , a network of supranational commodity cartel companies , interconnected with Anglo - Dutch financial circles , was tightening its grip on world food flows , from farm to table .
The lineage of the leading firms traces back about 250 years , to patterns of control over grain flows in Russia , Europe , North Africa , and related .
The major names are legendary , including André , Louis - Dreyfus , Bunge , Continental / Fribourg , and Cargill .
Later , ADM plus in Europe , Nestlé , Unilever , Castle & Cook , and more .
Along with Big Oil , these Big Grain firms extended their control over the most basic necessities .
Merchants of Grain was the name of the 1979 exposé book by Dan Morgan , then and still at the Washington Post , which covered much of the history and mid-century doings of these transnationals .
Carefully omitted were the political / financial connections , referred to as synarchist ,  by U.S. intelligence during World War II .

A Schiller Institute rally in Washington , DC in 1985 paired a program for feeding Africa , with a technology - driver for the United States and Soviet Union ; cooperation on the Strategic Defense Initiative .
The case of Argentina shows the typical way these companies moved for control .
In the immediate post - World War II years , efforts to develop Argentina , by investing the foreign sales of its grain , back into agro-industrial capacity , were undertaken by the Juan Perón government .
In 1948 , Perón established the Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Trade ( IAPI ) , institutionalizing the right of the government to control the cereals trade for its goals of raising finances for industrialization .
This policy came under fierce attack from the grain cartel companies .
With the connivance of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Averell Harriman , the IAPI was ended , as soon as Perón was ousted in 1955 .
The grain - control operations of the cartel firm Bunge y Born soon re-established control , becoming known as  The Octopus ,  for its far - reaching domination of commodities in Argentina and Brazil , from paint to food .
A few facts from the Cargill story are exemplary of the cartel process globally .
Cargill Co. , the worlds largest grain company , is privately owned and based in the Minneapolis , Minnesota suburb of Minnetonka .
It was founded by Scotsman William Cargill , in Conover , Iowa in 1865 , and has been run , since the 1920s , by the billionaire MacMillan family .
The Cargill operations arose through strategic acquisitions of grain - handling , storage , and transportation infrastructure , in the flow of the output of the U.S. grainbelt to domestic processing centers , and to ports for foreign shipment .
The Cargills and MacMillans had a chokehold on the Mississippi Basin grainshed at Minneapolis - St. Paul and other points .
Their widely diversified holdings ranged from steel and shipbuilding , to salt , fertilizer , and orange juice .
During World War II , when the Old World commodity powers moved extensively into North America , Cargill expanded its control over commodity flows .
In 1947 , it opened big grain facilities in Puerto Rico ; in 1948 it built big grain elevators in São Paulo and Paraná , Brazil .
In North America , it built a huge , ice - free port on the mouth of the St. Lawrence River at Baie - Comeau .
Cargills domination came not only from physical positioning , but from political clout , mostly by stealth and menace .
Indicative is that in 1956 , Cargill set up its world office in Geneva , Switzerland , called Tradax , Inc .
One veteran Cargill officer involved was Pearsall Helms , whose brother Richard , later became director of the CIA .
Cargills Africa operations are run out of Europe .
 Farms and People Pollute 
The clincher to all this economic warfare against nations , was the post - 1968 culture of pessimism , epitomized by the founding of Earth Day in 1970 .
The theme was that the Earths resources were depleting , and population must be curbed .
In 1968 , Paul Ehrlichs book Population Bomb was released .
William Paddock , unofficial State Department advisor ( 1975 - 80 ) , wrote Famine 1975 , saying that famine was inevitable .
In 1972 , the Club of Rome was founded , releasing the book Limits to Growth , to assert , by computer simulation , that the worlds limits to growth had been reached , and zero growth must be enforced .
A slew of media operations and new agencies were mobilized to pound on this message .
With the rock - drug counterculture under way as part of the campaign , the degradation operation proceeded .
In 1974 , several key events in agriculture policy occurred .
A World Food Conference was convened in Rome , to address how to defeat hunger .
However , Secretary of State Kissinger was sent at the last minute to represent the United States , after an orchestrated scandal cancelled the trip of Agriculture Secretary Earl Butzan old school farm advocate .
Instead of addressing the need to rev up agriculture capacity , Kissingers theme was that nations should try to help the needy with a little food aid .
Meantime , in December , he signed a secret National Security Study Memorandum ( NSSM 200 ) , calling for the deliberate suppression of 13 strategically important nations , so that they would not be using up resources that the United States and its allies want .
The nations were India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Nigeria , Egypt , Mexico , Indonesia , Brazil , the Philippines , Thailand , Turkey , Ethiopia , and Colombia .
Along with these specific and other government actions , a set of non-governmental agencies was created , to proliferate propaganda that the Earths resources are limited , technology is dangerous and cant overcome scarcity , etc .
In 1974 , the Worldwatch Institute was established in Washington , D.C. ( see Appendix ) .
In 1982 the World Resources Institute was founded , headed by Gus Spaeth , to issue pseudo - scientific tracts saying that expanding the food supply and population destroys the environment .
Al Gore is on their board today .

Mexican President José López Portillo ( 1920 -2004 ) launched a national food - sufficiency policy and called for the construction of 20 nuclear power plants in Mexico .
His aspirations were blocked by London and Wall Street .
Over the 1970s , there were intense operations by the World Wildlife Fund ( founded in 1961 ) , run in tandem with the Conservation Foundation ( a U.S. continuation of a pre-World War II Europe - based , eugenicist nature society ) .
In 1991 , the two merged , and subsequently became known as the Worldwide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) .
Their assault on food and agriculture was profound .
They mounted a campaign to force governments to remove land from agricultural production , in the name of conserving  scarce resources .
In the United States , an entirely new program was established , the Conservation Reserve Program ( CRP ) .
As of today , it has over 30 million acres locked up , out of a crop base of 365 million acres .
The  Wetlands Reserve is taking still more land out of production .
Lyndon LaRouche led a pitched battle over the 1970s against these networks , operations , and especially the science fakery .
As a Presidential candidate in 1976 , he was on the ballot in 26 states , under the U.S. Labor Party banner .
The symbol of his agro- industrial campaign was a high - tech tractor .
Over 1979 - 80 , local tractor protests occurred ; and a huge tractorcade of farmers streamed into Washington , D.C. to protest the takedown of the U.S. farm sector .
Their immediate burden came from a crushing debt load caused by underpayment for their commodities , and double - digit borrowing costs .
Other statesmen continued the fight .
On March 18 , 1980 , Mexican President José López Portillo called for a national food self - sufficiency policy , called the Mexican Food System .
He called for building 20 nuclear power plants .
On food , he said ,  The objective of the Mexican Food System is to reach self - sufficiency in each of the key subsystems of national nutrition : grains , edible oils , fruits , vegetables , meat , fish , milk , and eggs ....
It wasnt to be .
Mad Cow Loosed , 1980s
Over the 1980s , an even greater onslaught came against national agriculture , industry , and energy programs , led by the  Mad Cow in office in Britain , Margaret Thatcher , Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990 .
Her government was the world model for radical privatization schemes , deregulation of government functions , and privateering free - trade practices .
For the record : Even her epithet ,  Mad Cow ,  came about , due to Londons ideological free - trade practices .
The BSE brain - wasting disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy , called Mad Cow broke out for the first time ever , in Britain , around 1986 , and was widely exported .
Veterinarians attribute the occurrence directly to the Thatcher governments malfeasance .
Soon after she was elected , a national livestock sanitation board asked the government to intervene to prevent any tainted sheep matter from being cycled elsewhere into the livestock feed chain , because there was at the time in the U.K. , a widespread outbreak of sheep scrapie , TSE ( transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ) .
Thatcher and Agriculture Minister Lord Peter Walker refused , on the grounds that the animal feed sector should regulate itself . 
Within six years , after tainted matter continued to be blended into animal feed , the species jump from sheep to cows occurred .
Internationally , private cartels expanded their chokehold all along the food chain over the 1980s , under the pressure by the International Monetary Fund , World Bank , and other institutions , to follow the Thatcher model of non-regulation and privatization .
The World Bank began phasing out any of its limited , effective loans for infrastructure for low - income nations to build up agriculture potential .
Instead , the World Bank began funding privatization schemes , including the Felix Rohatyn - type ,  public - private partnerships . 
The Schiller Institute in 1989 exposed the set - aside programs , which paid U.S. farmers not to produce food .
Part of the pseudo - science cover for this was that , small and local is better , and more sustainable .
For example , an October 1984 report of the World Bank ,  Toward the Sustainable Development of Sub-Saharan Africa ,  called for large - scale water projects to be re - examined  meaning cancelled given the extreme shortage of resources . 
Year after year , more farmland was being removed from food production , due to erosion , salination , or to insane set - aside programs , all the while that cartel companies were pushing nations to agree to cash crops for foreign markets .
Less and less food was being produced per capita internationally .
In October 1982 , the U.S. Congress granted the Commodity Credit Corp. of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) discretion to convert government grain stocks to gasohol fuel , and kicked off the ethanol promotion program , giving Cargill and ADM multi-billions for government - subsidized ethanol .
The next year , an unprecedented U.S. food output reduction program was enacted , called  Payment - in - Kind ,  in which farmers were given claim chits for government - controlled surplus corn stocks , in exchange for idling 30 - 50 % of their corn acreage .
Then , during the very same 1983 crop season , a 50 - year drought hit , and that entire years corn harvest fell by 50 % from its recent previous levels .
LaRouche warned of the consequences of continuing this insanity .
Addressing the underlying question of science , he released a book in 1983 , There Are No Limits to Growth .
He conferred on the crisis in Argentina in 1984 , with scientists and political leaders , and with other world leaders .
During the U.S. Presidential race , he released two national half - hour TV shows on the crisis .
One was titled ,  The Food Shock of 1984 . 
But the same year , the GATT was used as the venue for an all - out attempt at a one - world trade treaty , to make it even easier for the private , neo -British - East - India - Company networks to subvert nation - serving agriculture .
An opening round of trade talks began at Punta del Este , Uruguay , aimed at reforming  agriculture trade , by coercing nations to remove tariffs , export controls , and national regulations .
Over the next ten years , a drawn - out sequence of conferences were held in Montreal and elsewhere , attended not only by national government officials , but by Cargill , ADM , major banks , and non-governmental agencies .
Finally , nations succumbed , and the date was set for January 1995 , for the World Trade Organization to start up .
In Fall 1988 , after another devastating drought in the U.S. corn belt , the Schiller Institutes  Food for Peace effort was initiated , to fight internationally against the GATT / WTO drive , and for national development .
( Documents from this work are available at www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/ffp_main_page.html.)
LaRouche spoke in October in West Berlin , and at a Food for Peace conference in Chicago in December , pointing to the prospect of the split - up of the Soviet bloc , and calling for international collaboration to re-commit to restoring agro-industrial capacity .
( See EIR , April 18 , 2008 . )
EIRNS / Philip Ulanowsky
Lyndon LaRouche addresses a Food for Peace conference in Chicago , Dec. 20 , 1988 .
Two months earlier , he appeared in a half - hour national TV broadcast , “ The Winter of Our Discontent , ” which highlighted the food crisis worldwide , and proposed East - West cooperation to deal with it .
The degree to which nations  food security was being undercut , was apparent by how much they were being coerced to become food import - dependent .
EIR did a study of the food - sufficiency status of the 13 nations named in 1974 by Kissinger and the British , to be hit by the food weapon .
Two points in time were compared 1963 and 1990 for how self - sufficient each nation was for certain food staples .
A few representatives examples :
The Americas : Mexico was 100 % self - sufficient in cereals in 1963 , and down to 79 % in 1990 ; 104 % self - sufficient in beans in 1963 , and down to 85 % in 1990 ; in oils , 110 % self - sufficient in 1963 , and down to 57 % in 1990 .
Africa : Egypt was 84 % self - sufficient in cereals in 1963 , and down to 62 % in 1990 ; 112 % self - sufficient in beans in 1963 , and down to 88 % in 1990 ; in oils , 103 % in 1963 , and down to 90 % in 1990 .
Indian Subcontinent : India continued its self - sufficiency following 1974 , and even conducted selective food exports .
But Pakistan saw declines .
Bangladesh went from 106 % self - sufficiency in 1963 down to 87 % in 1990 ; in beans , from 100 % down to 88 % ; in oils , it increased from 71 % self - sufficient to 83 % .
( See article on the Bangladesh crisis today , p. 17 . )
Southeast Asia : The Philippines declined in cereals self - sufficiency from 83 % in 1963 , down to 80 % in 1990 ; in beans , from 97 % down to 47 % ; and oils , from 266 % down to 101 % .
China achieved self - sufficiency over the 1960s to 1990 period , with intent to make even more improvements to upgrade nutrition levels , for which the nation has been singled out for attack as overusing scarce resources .
However , the loss of farmland to aridity and residential sprawl , began to present a threat to future food output gains .
The area of Chinas arable / permanent cropland base declined from 101.6 million hectares in 1970 , down to 95.67 million ha in 1990 .
This loss came from erosion , dryness , sprawl , and other factors .
Toward Famine , 1990s
Thus , the decade of the 1990s should have been the time to restore and redouble nation - serving agro- industrial measures , given the increasing hunger and food shortages in Africa and elsewhere , and also the urgent need to continue the successes of India and China , home to 2 billion people .
However , the very opposite came to pass .
A sequence of free - trade pacts accelerated the degradation of agricultural potential and lack of food self - sufficiency .
In 1989 , the Canadian - U.S. Free Trade Pact went into effect , followed in 1994 by the North American Free Trade Act ( NAFTA ) .
In January 1995 came the WTO .
Later there would be the Caribbean Free Trade Act ( CAFTA ) , and others in Europe and Africa .
In 1991 , Europe saw the largest farmer demonstrations against low prices and free trade in history , focussed against the GATT / WTO plans , in Paris , Luebeck , Strasbourg , Rome , and many other locations .
In Spring 1993 , the largest farmer demonstrations ever took place in Argentina .
But the lock on public policy by the globalizers remained in place .
One of the ugliest manifestations of the cartel free - trade , food - control system , was the increasing global sourcing of food to feed the United States and Europe .
In the process , farmers were ground under in both the importing and exporting regions .
In the United States by 1995 , fully 13 % of food consumption was imported , way up from 9 % in 1980 .
Some categories have soared for example , fish and shell - fish .
In the early 1980s , 51 % of U.S. consumption of these foods was imported ; today , 78 % .
Dramatic rises also occurred for fruits , juices , and nuts .
In the early 1980s , 21 % of U.S. consumption of these foods was imported ( much of it being tropical , such as bananas ) , but today , this has risen to 31 % overall , and includes huge quantities of non-tropical products , such as apple juice .
Today , approximately 50 % of U.S. apple juice comes from China , and other fruit juices from Turkey , South Africa , and Asia .
The food flows from Africa to Europe have grown similarly .
Besides the tropical cocoa and coffee , there are large shipments of mid- latitude European products , including green beans and flowers from East Africa , as well as fruits and vegetables from South Africa .
Figure 4
On a world scale , the major processor cartels moved to impose gigantic monoculture regions , for their domination of key oil and grain crops and products .
Figure 4 shows the huge area turned over to soybeans in Argentina and Brazil by 2004 .
By 2008 , over 45 % of all arable land in Argentina is in soy cultivation .
This is the analog of the British East India Companys practices of decreeing where and how cash crops would be grownindigo , cotton , jute , and whatever else the Empire desired .
The present - day monoculture is abetted by the unprecedented changes in patent law , giving sweeping rights to agro-cartel companies for introduction of seeds and methods of genetic bioengineering : Cargill / Monsanto , Dupont / Pioneer , and others ( see Appendix ) .
As for the leading participants in WTO free trade , the degree of concentration is also a dramatic irony .
Cargill and ADM are two of the top firms dominating over 65 % of all soy trade .
They are also among the top three dominating over 80 % of U.S. corn exports .
Cargill , ADM , and only two others control 60 % of the terminal grain - handling facilities in the United States .
The misery and want connected to this vast WTO - era degradation of agriculture is manifest in the death rate in Africa , including HIV / AIDS , and suffering among some 900 million people in 70 countries .
Given the rage at the perpetrators of this harm , it is no wonder that in 1999 the  Seattle Round of the WTO talks , ended in a bust .
The conference was disbanded with no results , as various developing nations refused to go along with the free - trade dictates .
This outcome was in order .
Nevertheless , the WTO continues to stalk the world .
In November 2001 , in Qatar , the current WTO Doha Round was begun .
Its continuing goal is to yet further lower national barriers to borderless trade , on behalf of the Brutish Empire .
At subsequent Doha Round talks in Cancun , Hong Kong , and Geneva , stand - offs among nations have continued .
Biofuels and Genocide , 2000s
As of the turn of the century , the lack of adequate food and necessities for millions of people was at desperation levels .
Yet far from taking even minimal measures , major governments and UN institutions stood by as even the level of tonnage of annual food aid dropped .
( Figure 5 ) .
Then came the genocide program : biofuels .
Figure 5
An evil axis of neo -conservatives and neo -greens combined to bumrush governments into passing laws setting national mandates for how much biofuel must be blended into gasoline and diesel fuel in coming years .
The Energy Law of 2005 in the United States sets these goals .
The same year France passed such a law , and now dozens of nations have followed suit .
Gigantic neo-plantations for gasohol have been concentrated in the Americas across the corn belt in the U.S.A. , and the cane belt in Brazil .
The big players are the usual cartels and financial circles behind globalization , including Cargill , ADM , Bunge , George Soros , and Bill Gates .
Al Gore is acting as head cheerleader in the biofools parade , in lock - step with neo-cons such as George Shultz and James Woolsey , who use energy independence ,  instead of the Gorey  save - the - planet pitch , to promote the bio-energy fraud .
( See article , page 19 . )
There are even proposals for two dedicated biofuels pipelines : a 1,700 - mile ethanol pipeline from Iowa to New York Harbor ; and in Brazil , an 800 - mile pipeline from the inland state of Goias , through Minas Gerais , to the port at Paulinia / São Paolo .
These proposals dont represent agricultural infrastructure any more than Nazi workcamps represented factories .
Fully 24 % of the U.S. corn crop this year ( September 2007 to 2008 ) is expected to go into corn ethanol , according to the USDA .
The previous year it was 18 % .
The volume of U.S. corn used for ethanol now exceeds the amount of U.S. corn going for export to the world human food chain ( Figure 6 . )
Figure 6
A newspaper website from Al Gore ’s home state of Tennessee ran this apt cartoon , which shows how Gore is viewed .
These are the parameters of todays epic famine danger .
There is no fix to this threat , by staying within the framework of the markets game of the last 30 years , and the WTO .
The harm done was not the result of misguided policies .
It was intentional , and of the same degraded outlook toward mankind that gave us the British East India Company and the British Empire years ago .
Many of todays food - control networks are , in fact , lineal descendents .
Al Gore is their hired hand in mass murder .
End the evil .
Dont play the game .
Bury the WTO !

We provide an outlaw view of the underbelly of the beast during the 2008 National Conventions .
“ The public has to be more alert ” , warned one “ international terrorism expert ” in the Daily Mail late last year , because Scotland “ is set to become another Israel within five years ” .
“ [ A ] nti-terror measures will soon become a common feature of life ” , he assured the audience , and called for “ routine arming of police officers ” and increasing children ’s “ awareness of the dangers of terrorism ” and for them to be “ encouraged ” to report anything “ out of the ordinary ” .
The oracle of doom was one Amnon Maor , identified as the head instructor of counter - terrorism for the IDF and Israeli border police .
Maor is working with security firm 360 Defence , based near Glasgow , which is “ training Scottish police , military and civilians in security techniques ” .
This would n’t be the first time the British police benefits from Israeli anti-terror expertise .
The police squad that carried out the extrajudicial execution of the young Brazilian electrician Jean - Charles de Menezes in the London underground had received similar training .
In the post - September 11 world , Naomi Klein writes , Israel has pitched its “ uprooting , occupation and containment of the Palestinian people as a half - century head start in the ‘ global war on terror ' ” .
Britain has since been furnished with its own unpopular occupation of Arab land — and the lessons from Israel are not lost on its architects .
In disaster lies opportunity — and the only thing more useful than a thing to fear is fear itself .
The give away line in Maor ’s prescription above is his offer to increase children ’s awareness of the dangers of terrorism — absent the real thing , fear should suffice .
The Prime Minister may not have many achievements to his name , but he can claim patents to ‘ Fortress Britain ’ , whose battlements sit on a foundation of fear .
The Power of Nightmares
In October 2001 it was revealed that the Pentagon was consulting Hollywood writers and producers specializing in spy thrillers and disaster flicks to imagine future attacks in order to best prepare for them .
Developments such as the colour - coded threat alerts that change hue at the Department of Homeland Security ’s caprice have alarmed even cold war hawks like Zbigniew Brzezinski enough to lament this ‘ culture of fear ’ :
Fear obscures reason , intensifies emotions and makes it easier for demagogic politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue …
Such fear - mongering , reinforced by security entrepreneurs , the mass media and the entertainment industry , generates its own momentum .
In Britain each of the New Labour government ’s political missteps has been accompanied by similar fear - mongering .
While a terrorist threat does exist , its magnitude is wildly exaggerated .
The European Police Office ( Europol ) released its first report on terrorism last year which listed 498 terrorist attacks for Europe in 2006 ; only one was attributed to Muslims .
The majority — 136 — were carried out by the Basque separatist group ETA ; only one of them deadly .
When it came to the arrests on terrorism related charges , however , a good half were Muslims .
It began with the ‘ Ricin plot ’ : the highly publicized arrests , national hysteria and front page headlines .
There was no Ricin , or a plot .
It would n’t be until 2005 , well after Colin Powell had used it in his case to sell the Iraq war to the UN , that the ban on reporting on the case was finally lifted and the public apprised of the truth .
The February 2003 ‘ terror alert ’ had Blair scrambling tanks to Heathrow , timed conveniently to coincide with the large scale demonstrations against the coming war .
Notable support in the media came from BBC propagandist Fred Gardner , long suspected of ties to the intelligence services , themselves busy fanning the fire .
Simon Jenkins , the conservative columnist noted , “ In 2002 - 03 , before the Iraq war , the security service supplied the Cabinet Office with a weekly catalogue of ‘ terror fears ’ — anthrax , smallpox , sarin , dirty nuclear devices and a Christmas bombing campaign — to soften public opinion for the war . ”
In June 2006 , 250 heavily armed police men acting on ‘ specific intelligence ’ raided a home in Forest Gate arresting two young Muslims , shooting one in the process .
The chemical weapons that they were alleged to have possessed were never found .
Both were acquitted without charge .
The police apologized .
On August 10th , 2006 , a day after then Home Secretary John Reid had hinted that new anti-terror measures were in order , the Deputy Commissioner of Metropolitan Police , Paul Stephenson , announced that the police had foiled a plot to commit “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale ” .
Officials were soon conceding that the immediacy and scale of the threat may have been “ exaggerated ” ; however , the scare succeeded in deflecting attention from Blair ’s widely - denounced manoeuvres preventing a ceasefire in Lebanon .
From Beirut , an outraged Robert Fisk wrote :
Stephenson ’s job is to frighten the British people , not to stop the crimes that are the real reason for the British to be frightened …
I ’m all for arresting criminals …
But I do n’t think Paul Stephenson is .
I think he huffs and he puffs but I do not think he stands for law and order .
He works for the Ministry of Fear which , by its very nature , is not interested in motives or injustice .
In November 2006 , the MI5 director general Eliza Manningham - Buller warned of a violent threat from 1,600 suspects in 200 groups that could last “ more than a generation ” .
Although she identified government policy towards Iraq as the main factor contributing to the rising radicalism , Blair endorsed the statement .
He continued his scapegoating of Muslims with the periodic reiterations of the ‘ Islamic threat ’ to rationalize the fear , repression , lies and resentment brought in on the heels of the Iraq war .
When Blair announced that “ the rule of the game have changed ” , no one took it more seriously than the tabloid press ; they demonstrated just how toxic things could get when gloves come off with government sanction .
Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian confessed : “ I try to imagine how I would feel if this rainstorm of headlines substituted the word ‘ Jew ’ for ‘ Muslim ’ — I would n’t just feel frightened .
I would be looking for my passport . ”
One ca n’t miss the Islamophobic nature of much of the hysteria when one compares the difference in the treatment of the cases of Robert Cottage and David Bolus Jackson of the BNP with that of Mohammed Atif Siddique .
The case of the former two , arrested for the possession of rocket launchers , a “ record haul of chemicals used in making home - made bombs ” , extremist literature , and bomb - making information , barely got covered in national media ; the latter , a 20 year old , received front page attention and eight years in prison for merely downloading extremist literature , and his attorney Aamer Anwer , got charged with ‘ contempt of court ’ for calling the trial a “ tragedy for justice ” .
The new MI5 chief , Jonathan Evan , raised the fear factor a year on with the warning that 15 - year - olds were being “ groomed ” for terror and that there were up to 2,000 people involved in “ terrorist - related activity ” .
Recalling Donald Rumsfeld ’s “ unknown unknown ’s ” , the man appointed by John Reid with Tony Blair ’s approval , bizarrely added “ there are as many again that we do n’t yet know of ” .
Described variously as “ lurid ” , “ inflammatory ” , “ highly ideological ” , “ playing Halloween ” , it came on the eve of the Queen ’s address calling for yet another terror bill .
The institutional imperative of self - preservation may also have been at play : MI5 has already expanded by 50 % with eight new regional offices , and will have doubled in size by 2011 .
Eyebrows have been raised at these very public interventions by the heads of a clandestine service .
Simon Jenkins noted that chiefs of the secret service have long feared that the absence of a public profile may diminish funding appropriation .
“ The answer of both MI5 ’s Evans and MI6 ’s John Scarlett is to join the fear factory . ”
Taking Liberties
The assault on constitutional rights that started in the US with Clinton ’s Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty law of 1996 was replicated in Britain with the Terrorism Act 2000 .
Section 41 of the Act granted police the right to detain terror suspects for up to one week without charge ( criminal law on the other hand requires that suspects be charged within the first 24 hours of arrest , or be released ) .
Section 44 granted police stop and search rights all across Britain ( it has since been used against : Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinto for protesting outside Europe ’s biggest arms fair in London , the 82 - year - old Walter Wolfgang for heckling Jack Straw at the Labour Conference , Sally Cameron for walking on a cycle - path in Dundee , the 80 - year - old John Catt for being caught on CCTV passing a demonstration in Brighton ; , the 11 - year - old Isabelle Ellis - Cockcroft for accompanying her parents to an anti-nuclear protest , and a cricketer on his way to a match over his possession of a bat ) .
In the United States , September 11 occasioned the most robust assault yet on civil liberties in the form of Bush ’s ‘ USA Patriot Act ’ leading eminent constitutional law professor Sanford Levinson to describe Carl Schmitt , the leading Nazi legal authority , as “ the true éminence grise of the Bush administration ” to the extent that the Administration ( advised by Dick Cheney ’s lawyer , David Addington ) espoused a view of presidential authority “ that is all too close to the power that Schmitt was willing to accord his own Führer ” .
The respected lawyer Gareth Peirce noted equally worrying tendencies in the UK :
Blair bulldozed through Parliament a new brand of internment .
This allowed for the indefinite detention without trial of foreign nationals , the ‘ evidence ’ to be heard in secret with the detainee ’s lawyer not permitted to see the evidence against him and an auxiliary lawyer appointed by the attorney general who , having seen it , was not allowed to see the detainee .
The most useful device of the executive is its ability to claim that secrecy is necessary for national security .
The Anti-terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 succeeded in ramming through measures that had been rejected in the 2000 Act .
The Criminal Justice Act 2003 doubled the period of detention without charge to 14 days .
Although the government suffered a significant setback when the Law Lords swept aside the indefinite detention ruling since it broke European human rights legislation ( described by the Law Lords as “ draconian ” and “ anathema ” to the rule of law , it was seen by Lord Hoffmann as a bigger threat to the nation than terrorism ) .
Charles Clarke , the Home Secretary , immediately made clear his intention to undermine it .
The government obliged by subsequently passing the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 which gave the Home Secretary the right to use Control Orders and opt out of human rights laws .
In the wake of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7 , the government upped the ante with the Terrorism Act 2006 , which doubled — yet again — the detention period to 28 days , a period far longer than any other state in the western world .
The bill marked the first parliamentary defeat for Tony Blair , whose original proposal was for 90 days detention without charge .
Blair ’s determination to deflect attention from the failures of his scandal - ridden government by turning the war on terror into a permanent undeclared state of emergency seemed to have come up against a wall .
However , despite a noticeably prudent start , Brown ’s multiplying political problems soon had him reaching for Blairite nostrums .
He renewed the case for doubling the period of detention without charge subsequently settling for an arbitrary 42 days which the supine parliament duly passed .
This despite the fact that the newly appointed Home Secretary Jacqui Smith had conceded that circumstances had not yet arisen where it had been necessary “ to go beyond 28 days ” .
Seumas Milne reported in The Guardian that “ it ’s widely acknowledged in Westminster that a key motivation for this latest assault on long - established rights and freedoms is Brown ’s determination to wrong - foot the Tories tactically and portray them as soft on terror ” .
The deleterious effects of a creeping surveillance state cannot be discounted .
While the public may have little enthusiasm for an ID card scheme after discs containing personal details of 25 million individuals were lost by the government , Brown remains adamant .
Given the government ’s record for handling personal data , proposals for a universal register of citizen ’s DNA samples is very worrying .
So are Tony Blair ’s remarks about identifying problem children who may grow up to pose a menace to society by intervening before they were born .
A new plan under the government ’s e-borders scheme would require each person entering or leaving UK to answer 53 questions including “ credit card details , holiday contact numbers , travel plans , email addresses , car numbers and even any previous missed flights ” .
Taken when a ticket is bought , the information , it was reported , “ will be shared among police , customs , immigration and the security services for at least 24 hours before a journey is due to take place . ”
When popular shows bear names like Big Brother , the appurtenances of mass surveillance society , such as the 4.2 million CCTV cameras , become an acceptable , even desired , part of the scenery .
While the terrorist threat today has nowhere near the intensity of the IRA campaign , police are using military aircraft such as the Britten - Norman Islander used previously only in Northern Ireland during the Troubles .
Reaper robot drones of the type being used in Afghanistan will also be in operation during the Olympics .
Reign of the Terrorologist
Riding the back of the raft of anti-terror legislations are the terrorologists and the “ security ” entrepreneurs ; and they have found green pastures in Fortress Britain .
With governments unwilling to address political causes , the trend is increasingly one of framing the subject in cultural terms : ‘ they hate our way of life ’ , ‘ they hate our freedoms ’ , etc .
This clears the way for the terrorologist to step in and sell a toxic brew of cultural stereotypes and pop psychology packaged in pseudo - academic jargon as expertise .
In his study of the trade , James Petras detects the following “ eerily predictable patterns ” :
They use a common language to describe their subjects and their environment ; they are extremely ideological under a thin veneer of scientific jargon ; they possess a keen sense of selective observation ; they always pretend to possess a psychological understanding though few if any have dealt close up with their subjects in any clinical sense except perhaps under conditions of incarceration and interrogation .
Their style … slippery with euphemisms when it comes to dealing with the violence of their partisan states …
Psychobabble provides a ‘ legitimate ’ sounding channel for … assuming a state of civilized superiority in the face of their dehumanized subjects .
Indeed , the dehumanization process is central to the whole terrorist - political - academic enterprise …
One consequence of earning an elevated place in official demonology is that the bar for those passing judgement drops radically .
When it comes to Islam , Muslims and their alleged links to terrorism , any shoddy indictment passes muster .
Doom - laden sensationalism makes for good copy ; it makes no demands on rigour and scepticism , and a stable of ‘ experts ’ is readily at hand to amplify fear .
The degree to which this has penetrated public discourse was demonstrated by the Big Issue — a publication generally about as provocative as a phonebook — with a front page story on ‘ cyber terror ’ and ‘ online vigilantes ’ .
Trotting out a stable of ‘ terror experts ’ the story served as a platform for several tendentious claims ( “ There are no longer clear boundaries between real - world cells and ‘ amateurs ’ assisting terror plots via their computers ” ; “ al - Qaeda is equal in the media war ” ) .
Rather than question why a dubious source such as Evan Kohlmann — the man used as a ‘ expert witness ’ in the Atif Siddique trial who , according to sociologist David Miller , “ has no expertise beyond an undergraduate law degree and an internship at a dubious think - tank ” — should be consulted by the Scotland Yard , the story served as a puff piece for three Israel lobby hacks with an ideological axe to grind .
Rita Katz has served in the Israeli military ; Aaron Weisburd runs Internet Haganah ( Hebrew name for the paramilitary that later became the IDF ) a project of the Society for Internet Research that works with the Mossad - linked Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center ; and both Katz and Kohlmann are protégés of Steve Emerson whose own expertise includes having seen “ the hallmarks of Middle Eastern terror ” in the Oklahoma bombing ( actually carried out by Timothy McVeigh , a decorated white Christian war - hero ) .
The trade of the terrorologist is not new : incubated in the Reagan administration ’s earlier ‘ war on terror ’ , its proponents had been exposed and elegantly debunked by Edward Herman .
September 11 ushered in a new breed – ubiquitous , ideological , and relentless .
Some , such as Rohan Gunaratna of the St. Andrews - based Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence ( CSTPV ) , reinvented themselves over night as ‘ experts on al - Qaeda ’ .
Gunaratna ’s book Inside Al Qaeda became an instant best - seller , even though before the date his expertise was limited to South Asian groups , such as the Tamil Tigers .
In the book he claimed he was the “ principal investigator of the United Nations ’ Terrorism Prevention Branch ” .
However , after a Sunday Age investigation , he admitted that no such position existed .
Intelligence services have been generally dismissive of his claims .
However , despite all this , he keeps making appearances as an ‘ expert witness ’ at various UK prosecutions and in media reports .
CSTPV itself bears some scrutiny .
Established by an alumni of the RAND Corporation ( a US think - tank which played a key role during the Cold War ; satirized as the ‘ Bland Corporation ’ in Dr. Strangelove , it was an enthusiastic supporter of the arms race ) , the Centre has links to the government and intelligence agencies .
Shaping discourse on terrorism through its two influential academic journals , Studies in Conflict and Terrorism , and Terrorism and Political Violence , CSTPV emphasises terror directed against states , while mostly ignoring violence by states , excluding however those not allied to the West ( ‘ Hell is other people ’ , Sartre might say ) .
Reports by the Centre have been used by the government to rationalize permanent anti-terror legislation .
The RAND - CSTPV nexus also has stakes in the Iraq conflict through its links to mercenary firms operating in the country .
However , despite the conflicts of interest , the Centre ’s embedded expertise remains much in demand .
CSTPV ’s output may be ideological ; but it still retains a degree of sophistication .
With the low demands on rigour , joining the fray now are some actors less restrained .
In early 2006 it was revealed that authorities at several universities , including this writer ’s own , were co-operating with Special Branch as a result of a recently published study by the right wing Social Affairs Unit .
Conducted by Anthony Glees , the Director of Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies , the study claimed to find evidence of Islamist , animal liberation and British National Party recruitment on UK campuses .
The evidence comprised of the fact that people who have been arrested under anti-terrorism legislation attended universities at some point .
It castigated Universities for teaching students “ theoretical tools for understanding the world ” , such as Marxism , which could lead to further radicalization when students moved “ from campus to Mosque ” .
Policy Exchange , another dubious neoconservative outfit , shouldered its way into the debate with an Islamophobic report on extremist literature allegedly being promoted through various Mosques which , to the BBC ’s credit , was publicly debunked by a Newsnight investigation .
This , however , did not deter Policy Exchange members from using the report to lobby the EU .
Hero and Horse
On November 18 , 1822 , the Observer reported that nearly “ a million bushels of human and inhuman bones ” had been imported in the previous year from Europe into the port of Hull .
Battlefields swept alike of the “ bones of the hero and the horse which he rode ” delivered their haul to Yorkshire bone grinders who reduced them to granulary state .
“ In this condition they are sold to the farmers to manure their lands . ”
Two centuries on , the gap between the ‘ support our troops ’ rhetoric and reality has yet to be bridged .
An internal report into the state of the British Military obtained by The Independent on May 11 reveals that soldiers are living in such poverty that they can’t even afford food , with many living on emergency food voucher schemes set up by the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
“ Commanders are attempting to tackle the problem through ‘ Hungry Soldier ’ schemes , under which destitute soldiers are given loans to enable them to eat ” the paper reported .
With its proclivity for market solutions , the tradition of soldiers getting three square meals a day for free has been replaced with a controversial Pay as You Dine ( PAYD ) regime , which charges soldiers not on active duty for their meals , leading many into debt .
Likewise , slightly more than a year back on March 11 , 2007 , the Observer had revealed the shocking picture of neglect and poor treatment of wounded soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq .
It reported , for example , that “ the youngest British soldier wounded in Iraq , Jamie Cooper , was forced to spend a night lying in his own faeces after staff at Birmingham ’s Selly Oak Hospital allowed his colostomy bag to overflow .
On another occasion his medical air mattress was allowed to deflate , leaving him in ‘ considerable pain ’ overnight despite an alarm going off . ”
Another complaint alleged that one soldier “ suffered more than 14 hours in agony without pain relief because no relevant staff were on duty ” .
( This , of course , is as much a reflection of the chronic lack of surplus within the health system as it is of the wider militarised draw on public resources . )
The MoD has already revealed a serious shortage of medical staff in the armed forces : “ There was a 50 % shortfall in the number of surgeons required by the army , an 80 % shortfall of radiologists and a 46 % shortfall of anaesthetists . ”
Soldiers in the field have n’t fared any better : for example , both Reg Keys and Rose Gentle lost sons in Iraq due to the lack of proper equipment .
Iraq has taken its toll on an overstretched military .
Due to “ continuing high level of operational commitment ” an MoD report has revealed , “ more than 1 in 10 soldiers were not getting the rest between operations they needed . ”
The report also referred to a “ continuing difficult environment for army recruitment and retention ” .
With a high number of officers and other ranks going over voluntarily with another 2,000 awaiting approval of their applications to quit , the armed forces as a whole are nearly 7,000 under strength , the report revealed .
The crisis has caused the military to redouble its recruitment efforts with visits to Scottish schools up by more than 180 % in the last three years , The Herald revealed .
The news comes only weeks after the National Union of Teachers voted to block future military careers ’ presentations “ to pupils as young as 14 ” in England and Wales .
“ Despite the outlay of almost £ 500 m , in 2006 - 07 the field army – the frontline operational part of UK ground forces – missed its ‘ gains to strength ’ ( GTS ) recruitment goal by 12 % .
In 2007 - 08 , it achieved only 63 % of its target . ”
( In the US , the military has been reduced to enlisting former convicts and the mentally ill . )
The degree of desperation is also evident in the recent advertising campaign for military recruitment : the military experience is presented as a sanitized adventure , an adrenaline - soaked escape from ennui .
High - minded calls of duty and honour have been replaced with ones such as “ for the travel , for the action , for the adventure ” ; “ for the fun , for the friendship , for the Friday nights ” .
The MoD caused much consternation among the National Union of Teachers when it distributed materials on the Iraq war for use in schools .
The ministry was accused of “ misleading propaganda ” which “ unethically ” targeted recruitment materials at schools in disadvantaged areas .
One worksheet described the purpose of the UK mission in Iraq as “ helping the Iraqis to rebuild their country after the conflict and years of neglect ” .
Touting “ achievements ” in “ security and reconstruction ” it failed to mention the US - led invasion , its legality , Iraqi civilian deaths or the absence of WMDs .
This is not the MoD ’s only advance on the classroom .
Another example is the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) outreach programme , which sends DSTL scientists to talk to university and school students to encourage them to think about a career at the lab .
According to Frances Saunders , the chief executive , DSTL sponsors “ year - in - industry students , and are working with the MoD to develop school lesson texts to get people interested in the science behind defence . ”
Although DSTL already has strong links with universities including Southampton , Imperial , Oxford and Cambridge , Saunders plans to broaden this network .
Not since Suez has the military suffered a greater loss of prestige .
RAF airmen in Cambridgeshire were recently advised against wearing uniforms in public in order to avoid being “ verbally abused ” for their participation in Afghanistan and Iraq .
With the demoralizing effect of ill - conceived interventions abroad , the struggle for politicians is then of rehabilitating the myth of the military , rather that the military itself .
What interests policy makers is not so much the military , but the cult of military .
Plans are also underway to introduce US - style citizenship ceremonies for children and a new public holiday to celebrate ‘ Britishness ’ by 2012 , as part of “ wide - ranging proposals to strengthen British citizenship . ”
In sharp contrast to the decrepit military stands the fortunes of the private military industry .
The preference of recent governments for market solutions has facilitated the transfer of most military R&D to the private sector , with giants like QinetiQ and BAe Systems securing plum deals .
When the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency ( Dera ) was split in two in 2001 , QinetiQ , a British company with links to the US - based Carlyle Group , absorbed the majority of its activities .
Along with a raft of other lucrative PFIs , the private military industry is set to benefit from the largest to date , involving at least £ 14 billion of taxpayers ’ money , for a privatised Military ‘ Academy ’ at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan to train all - service personnel and private ‘ security services ’ .
The corporate bonanza in Iraq has had Private Military Contractors — mercenaries — reaping windfalls profits for investors with stakes in the businesses , such as Frederick Forsyth and former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind ( of Aegis and ArmorGroup respectively ) .
The lure of salaries , at times reaching as high as £ 1,000 a day , may be one reason why the military is losing so many of its men to the mercenary business .
While the defence establishment has long complained of funding shortages for the forces , the R&D budget remains secure .
The MoD , it was reported , has promised not to raid the R&D budget to pay for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
However , this injunction does n’t apply in the reverse , as it has been revealed that the Conflict Prevention Fund set aside for clearing landmines and removing arms from conflict zones was being raided to pay BAe Systems to subsidise the £ 5 m - £ 10 m servicing cost of six Tornado jets in Iraq .
The measure was needed because the MoD has closed its own state - of - the - art facility for servicing Tornado jets as a way of saving £ 500 m over 10 years .
Sensing opportunity as the war on terror grinds on , its neoconservative architects have swooped in from across the Atlantic to establish their presence in Britain .
With ties to the arms industry and the neoconservative wing of the Israel lobby , the Henry Jackson Society seems to be assuming the role that the Committee on Present Danger played in the United States .
Its Israel - centric worldview , as exhibited by its roster of speakers , predisposes it towards perpetual conflict .
The support for a militarized ethnocracy is not the natural inclination of a liberal - democratic Britain ; it can only be sustained in a context where Israel can be seen aligned with Britain in an overarching conflict against a common enemy .
So it is that the Israel lobby has contrived to pass its enemies off as those of the ‘ West ’ .
HJS appears well placed to sustain this state of conflict should the Tories get in as its supporters include two of David Cameron ’s key advisers .
There is a dangerous confluence of interests here .
Fortress Britain is as much a consequence of ill - conceived alliances as it is a response to the neoliberal order ’s need for distraction from its inherent contradictions .
While not nearly as unscrupulous as his predecessor , Gordon Brown ’s growing travails may lead him to seek the politician ’s time - tested remedy : scare the hell out of the population .
One only hopes that Fortress Britain is the apogee of what Tony Blair had set in motion with his promise to stand “ shoulder to shoulder ” with George W. Bush in his so - called ‘ war on terror ’ , because things could always be worse .
Media Matters :
During John Edwards ' campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , media regularly treated his personal wealth as a key to assessing his policy proposals -- a standard that is not being applied to John McCain .
It often seemed as though the news media was incapable of running a story about Edwards ' anti-poverty proposals without noting his own wealth .
The Washington Post , for example , ran a 203 - word blurb about Edwards ' eight - state poverty tour , opening it with a 28 - word reminder of the candidate 's fortune : " John Edwards is battling back the ' three H's ' that have dogged his campaign -- expensive haircuts , a lavish new house and a stint working for a hedge fund . "
By the standards the media applied to Edwards , the fact that McCain supports tax policies that would save him and his wife nearly $ 400,000 a year -- and require massive cuts to public services to pay for those tax breaks -- should surely be news .
Unlike the media 's focus on Edwards ' wealth , which did nothing to help voters understand the substance of his proposals , McCain 's potential savings under his tax plan actually would help illustrate how much the wealthy would benefit from the plan .

Volkswagen is showing up in style to the Dusseldorf Caravan Salon with the Topos Caddy Sail Design Concept , a version of their Caddy commercial van converted to mimic the style and functionality of a sailboat .
Rather than just adding some pinstripes and wood siding , the Topos Sail concept has a working wooden deck with aluminum rails .
The deck bends to to make a convenient place to lay out and enjoy the sailing , but the most trick piece might actually be the wooden ladder built - into the glass that makes the roof accessible .
A wooden deck roof is at least 1,000 times cooler than a gold - plated roof , and much classier .
Press release below the jump .
The Caddy Topos Sail Design Concept - A Caddy With a Boat Deck !
MILTON KEYNES – August 27 , 2008 : Among the display of leisure vehicles and campers on the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles stand at Europe ’s largest recreational vehicle show that starts in Düsseldorf , Germany this weekend will be an interesting Caddy Topos Sail design concept which takes its nautical theme to the extreme of having a wooden boat deck on its roof .
The Caddy Topos Sail design concept , based on the smallest model in the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicle van range , uses design cues from classic yachts and has its multi-functional roof covered with wooden decking surrounded by aluminium roof rails .
The wooden sun deck on the roof is accessed via four matching wooden and aluminium steps in the Caddy ’s tailgate , and to complete the design theme there are wooden inserts along the side of the vehicle and in the rear bumper .
Other highlights of the Volkswagen stand demonstrate its strong heritage in leisure vehicles with a celebration of 20 years of the California camper .
Volkswagen campers became popular almost as soon as the Transporter van was introduced in the 1950s , and the California model was introduced in 1988 when the third generation of the Volkswagen Transporter was in production .
With California conversions of the subsequent fourth generation of Transporter van and today ’s latest fifth generation model , more than 80,000 have been sold , which must make it one of the most successful campers ever .
Today ’s California was introduced in 2006 and is unique as it is now made by Volkswagen , who must be the only vehicle manufacturer to produce its own camper .
It is built to the same high quality standards as the rest of the range , and sold with a full three year warranty .
The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles stand can be found in Hall 16 at Dusseldorf Caravan Salon ( www.caravan-salon.de), which is open to the public from 30 August to 7 September .
U.S. agencies have taken another step forward in implementing a key international agreement to reduce air pollution from large ships .
Yesterday , President Bush signed into law the Maritime Pollution Protection Act of 2008 , which clears the way for U.S. ratification of the international treaty regulating emissions – known as MARPOL Annex VI – from large diesel - powered , ocean - going vessels .
Under MARPOL
Annex VI , container ships , tankers , cruise ships and bulk carriers must limit NOx emissions from their category three diesel engines .
It also sets a cap on the sulfur content of the fuel they burn and includes a program for designating areas where more stringent fuel controls apply , such as near coastlines that have more severe air quality concerns .
According to the EPA , MARPOL stakeholders will work to strengthen NOx and SO2 standards and the sulfur requirements in fuel this October .
If adopted , these stronger international standards have the potential to yield significant environmental and public health benefits in the U.S. and around the world ( Read more about reigning - in the pollution caused by oceangoing vessels at the EPA ’s website . )

USA Today has an unintentionally hilarious article on the dangers of ‘ digital drugs ’ that can supposedly mimic the effects of alcohol , marijuana , LSD , crack , heroin , sex , heaven and hell .
Woohoo !
I hear you shout , before realising the article is actually a woefully misinformed piece about binaural beats , a fascinating but harmless phenomenon when two pure tones of close but differing frequencies are played , one in each ear .
This can produce a perception of a pulse or a ‘ beat ’ which is n’t actually present in the sound but is a result of our brain making sense of the tones .
You need headphones to get the effect properly and there ’s a couple of examples on the Wikipedia page ( ignore the ‘ hypothetical effects on brain function ’ section though , it ’s currently full of drivel and miscited experiments ) .
The fact that it causes a ‘ pulsing ’ in the brain has led to lots of websites suggesting it can ‘ synchronise your brain waves ’ – and whenever ‘ synchronising brain waves ’ is mentioned you can be sure they ’ll be lots of nonsense about ascending to higher states of consciousness , super mind power and legal LSD being mentioned .
Actually , there are a minority of people who can have their state of consciousness altered by flashes of light at certain frequencies .
In fact , it may trigger full blown seizures in some ( photosensitive epilepsy ) but also causes minor and subtle seizure activity in others and in some can stimulate memories or images , or perhaps just cause an ‘ odd ’ feeling .
This was the basis of the original ‘ dream machine ‘ and subsequent electronic versions which flash lights in your eyes .
The history and neuroscience of this discovery was retold in the excellent book Chapel of Extreme Experience if you ’re interested .
Some preliminary research has shown that binaural beat audio can decrease anxiety or boost mood , but the studies are small and inconclusive and some are published in what we might tactfully refer to as ‘ non- mainstream ’ journals .
In the vast majority of people though , flashing lights or auditory pulses of whatever type do bugger all on their own , despite what various New Age websites and YouTube videos try and convince you ( infinite bliss anyone ? ) .
The USA Today piece manages to swallow this hook , line and sinker to fantastic comic effect :
Different types of digital drugs
Some sites provide binaural beats that have innocuous effects .
For example , some claim to help you develop extrasensory powers like telepathy and psychokinesis .
Other sites offer therapeutic binaural beats .
They help you relax or meditate .
Some allegedly help you overcome addiction or anxiety .
Others purport to help you lose weight or eliminate gray hair .
However , most sites are more sinister .
They sell audio files ( “ doses ” ) that supposedly mimic the effects of alcohol and marijuana .
But it does n’t end there .
You ’ll find doses that purportedly mimic the effects of LSD , crack , heroin and other hard drugs .
There are also doses of a sexual nature .
I even found ones that supposedly simulate heaven and hell .
There ’s plenty more great entertainment in the article .
Life imitates Chris Morris , again .
Hey , I ’m having a comedown from my infinite bliss .
I want my money back .

HERAT , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - U.S. - led coalition forces killed 76 Afghan civilians in western Afghanistan on Friday , most of them children , the Interior Ministry said .
U.S. - led coalition forces killed dozens of Afghan civilians , most of them women and children , in the western Afghanistan province of Herat on Friday , the Afghan Interior Ministry said .

The coalition denied killing civilians .
Civilian deaths in military operations have become an emotive issue among Afghans , many of whom feel international forces take too little care when launching air strikes , undermining support for their presence .
“ Seventy - six civilians , most of them women and children , were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in Herat province , ” the Interior Ministry said in a statement .
Coalition forces bombarded the Azizabad area of Shindand district in Herat province on Friday afternoon , the ministry said .
Nineteen of the victims were women , seven of them men and the rest children under the age of 15 , it said .
U.S. - led coalition forces denied killing any civilians .
They said 30 militants had been killed in an air strike in Shindand district in the early hours of Friday and no further air strikes had been launched in the area later in the day .
Air strikes were called between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. after Afghan and coalition soldiers were ambushed by insurgents while on a patrol targeting a known Taliban commander in Herat , the U.S. military said in a statement .
“ Insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small - arms and RPG ( rocket - propelled grenade ) fire , ” it said .
“ The joint forces responded with small - arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants . ”
TALIBAN COMMANDER TARGETED
Saeed Sharif , an elder and member of a local council where the strike took place , told Reuters many civilians were killed .
“ Last night , around 2 a .m. some people were attending a holy Koran recitation in Shindand district when Americans started bombing .
Tens of civilians were killed , ” said Sharif .
A senior police commander in western Afghanistan confirmed the incident but could not say how many civilians died .
“ More than 30 people have been killed .
I cannot say how many of them are civilians , ” General Ikramuddin Yawar told Reuters .
A spokesman for the Defence Ministry in Kabul said U.S. special forces and Afghan troops had been carrying out an operation against a commander named Mulla Sidiq , who was planning to attack a U.S. base in Herat .
“ Twenty - five Taliban were killed , including Sidiq and one other commander , ” said spokesman General Zaher Azimi .
“ Unfortunately , five civilians were killed in the bombing . ”
Afghanistan has seen a surge in violence this year as the hardline Islamist Taliban step up their campaign of guerrilla attacks , backed by suicide and roadside bombs , to overthrow the pro-Western Afghan government and drive out foreign troops .
Meanwhile , soldiers from the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) fired artillery rounds into Pakistan from the eastern province of Paktika on Friday in a coordinated attack with the Pakistani military , the ISAF said .
The rounds were fired at militants across the border who the Pakistani military said were preparing to fire rockets at an ISAF base in Paktika , the ISAF said in a statement .
“ Pakistan officers relayed that all rounds were on target , with no civilian casualties , ” it said .
“ ISAF troops were unable to confirm the number of insurgents killed since they were inside Pakistan . ”
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
He cuts through the water like he 's shredding through the record books at the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing .
Michael Phelps is one medal away from holding the record for the most gold medals in Olympic history .
U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps won his third gold medal and record - tying ninth of his career Tuesday morning , breaking his own world record in the 200 - meter freestyle .
The American won in a time of 1 minute , 42.96 seconds , lowering his old mark of 1:43.86 set at last year 's world championships in Australia .
It was expected he would face a strong challenge for the gold from the other finalists , but he led from the start , cruising to the wall nearly 2 seconds ahead of silver medallist Park Tae -hwan of South Korea , who finished in 1:44.85 .
American Peter Vanderkaay earned the bronze in 1:45.14 .
Phelps has nine career gold medals , tying him with four others , including swimmer Mark Spitz and track star Carl Lewis , for the most in Olympics history .
He 's got five more chances for gold in Beijing ; the next one comes Wednesday .

" We 're not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is , " said Natalie Coughlin , a world - class Olympic swimmer in her own right .
" Obviously , he 's amazing , and he breaks all these world records , but I think being a part of that , we almost take it for granted . "
In one sense , Phelps is much like the element he works in : calm , cool and clear .
It 's only when he rips into the water that the waves start .
" I want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done , " he has said .
Phelps has done lots of things : 17 world championships and a couple dozen world records .
His nine Olympic gold medals include three so far in Beijing , the last one he received Tuesday in the 200 - meter freestyle .
" It will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him , but clearly today he is the best swimmer we 've seen , " said Bob Bowman , Phelps ' coach .
Bowman began coaching Phelps when the swimmer was an 11 - year - old who had difficulty focusing outside the pool and a knack for getting into trouble .
" He was very active and never stopped moving , and it was kind of hard to harness that at first , " Bowman said .
" It 's a little bit counterintuitive because , even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer , when he raced , he was very focused . "
Swimming thousands of miles in a pool will do that to you .
" I think it was something that made me focus , " he said .
" I always had dreams of being an Olympian , being a world - record holder , being a professional athlete , being a gold medallist , and I had to focus on those goals to achieve them and I knew that . "
The focus came from year after year of workouts in the pool .
He swam nearly four miles in each workout and often practiced twice a day with hardly a day off .
Ironically , it is just that kind of intense work that may have cost Phelps much of his childhood .
iReport.com : Send Phelps a video question
" I think he missed out on a normal progression of things , but I would n't say he 's missed anything , " Bowman said .
" I would say he would tell you what he 's gained has been a lot better than what he 's missed . "
Phelps agrees .
" I would never trade going to the Olympic Games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world , I would never trade any of it in , " he said .
Phelps finds himself on the verge of diving into history .
He has the opportunity to break the Olympics ' most hallowed record and eclipse Mark Spitz 's seven gold medals in the 1972 games .
Even if he gets gold in just half of the eight events he has entered , Phelps will hold the record for the most gold medals in Olympic history and could arguably be called the greatest Olympian ever .
" There are a lot of things that people have n't done , and I want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things , " Phelps said .
With so much time spent with his head underwater , who can blame him if he likes to stick it in the clouds as well ?

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Talk of $ 200 - per - barrel oil prices by the end of the year has quietly faded away and been replaced by forecasts for $ 100 .
It would be easy to say that crude oil has failed to meet market expectations , and a bear market may be in place .
But the harder part is to figure out how long and to what point oil prices will fall .
Projections earlier this year for oil prices as high as $ 200 fell flat , with prices unable to even reach $ 150 .
" Now analysts are lining up to say the top is in , " said Sean Brodrick , a natural resources analyst at MoneyandMarkets.com .
" I 've been saying all along that volatility is the name of the game in oil this year . "
He expects prices to move lower in the short term -- $ 120 , $ 110 or even $ 100 " if we 're really lucky . "
“ ' The market is afraid to let go of its fear . ' ” — Anthony Sabino , St. John's University
It 'll probably be a rather slow drop , however .
" The air will escape the balloon more slowly than the bubble was inflated , " said Anthony Sabino , a professor of law at St. John 's University .
" That 's just a function of the hysteria of the market that inflated the bubble in the first place , " said Sabino , whose legal practice includes oil and gas law .
" The market is afraid to let go of its fear . "
Crude futures reached a record intraday level of $ 147.27 on July 11 in Globex electronic trading .
A year ago , prices were trading at $ 72 and five years ago , they were at $ 32 .
But " investors should understand that while the upside moves in oil prices have been prolific , the downside corrections have also been substantial , " said Emanuel Balarie , managing director at Balarie Capital Management .
Prices have dropped from their record level by almost 19 % , or around $ 27 , to close at $ 120.02 on Thursday .
They dropped $ 16 in the month of July alone .
" The month of July saw oil hit an all - time high but at the same time , saw the biggest dollar value pullback in the history of the oil market , " said Phil Flynn , a vice president at Alaron Trading .
Still , the recent pullback in oil prices should have been expected , " given the sizable move towards the upside ( with no major correction ) in such a relatively short period of time , " said Balarie .
Cutting back
Among the factors that have been driving prices lower is the slowdown in demand from major oil consumers .
But there 's a bigger picture to look at .
For the first six months of this year , U.S. oil demand was at about 20.08 million barrels per day -- the lowest level in five years , according to a report from the American Petroleum Institute released in mid July .
" There 's just too much supply chasing too little demand , " said Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research .
Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries averaged 32.43 million barrels per day in May 2008 , up from an average of 30.9 million for the year 2007 , according to the Energy Department 's Energy Information Administration .
And U.S. consumers have also been working hard to cut down their gasoline intake because of high retail fuel prices .

But as global production has been increasing and oil demand from the U.S. has been declining , consumption continues to increase in emerging markets such as China and India .
" The U.S. may be the world 's leader in energy thirst " with over 20 million barrels of oil a day , " but China is coming on strong , " said Brodrick .
Developing countries such as China and India are not yet done with their industrialization , said Balarie .
" There are still more roads to pave , buildings to build and cities to expand , " he said .
If China 's oil demand growth rate continues at its current pace of 6 % to 7 % per year , China will use 20 million barrels a day by 2020 -- about the same as what the U.S. uses today , according to Brodrick .
And by 2030 , China would be up to 40 million barrels per day -- twice what America uses now , he said .
But Charles Perry , president of energy - consulting firm Perry Management , argued that these are " straight - line projections , whereby the current rate of increase in demand is projected forward ad infinitum . "
" This will not occur , " he said .
" The market demands are fluid and demand will very much relate to price . "
And since China sells much of its goods to the United States , an American economic slowdown will also slow the Chinese economy , said Sabino .
" Without a doubt , it 's the U.S. that is the paramount driving force " for the global economy , he said .
" We slow down , the world slows down . "
A new rational
For now , a new player has entered the oil market , and it's called " rationality , " said Sabino .
" Long absent as speculative fever drove up prices to incredible and damaging levels , reality is setting in , " he said .
" High prices motivate conservation , i.e. the death of the SUV market , hybrids flying off showroom floors , and Americans just plain conserving energy . "
“ ' If the market closes below $ 117 , you can stick a fork in it -- it 's done . ' ” — Dale Doelling , Trends In Commodities
Recent weather forecasts for the Gulf of Mexico show no imminent threat to oil production and what 's been going on in the Middle East is " nothing we have n't seen in the last 40 years , " said Sabino .
Prices are likely to go " downhill from here , but with bumps on the road , " said SEER 's Lynch .
He expects to see oil prices at $ 100 by the end of September -- and maybe even $ 80 by the year 's end .
Dale Doelling , chief market technician at Trends In Commodities , said there 's a major support area at $ 117 for oil .
" If the market closes below $ 117 , you can stick a fork in it -- it 's done . "
For the $ 200 threshold to be passed anytime soon , there would need to be a severe political event that would potentially disrupt supply , said Chip Hodge , a managing director at John Hancock Financial Services .
" I would bet on $ 100 before I bet on $ 200 " by the end of the year , said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service .
" That underscores a lack of confidence in the U.S. and European economies " and more demand destruction is occurring , not just with gasoline but also with diesel .
“ ' I would bet on $ 100 before I bet on $ 200 ' oil prices by the end of the year .
” — Tom Kloza , Oil Price Information Service
Oil producers have been making similar bets for lower prices , according to recent action in the crude - oil options market .

Then again , there 's no real " stopgap in place for the world economy to quickly convert from an oil - based consumer to a blend of other energy options such as natural gas , solar , wind and so on , " said Neal Ryan , a manager at Ryan Oil & Gas Partners .
" Until we do , I certainly expect oil prices to remain at these elevated levels over $ 100 a barrel and eventually challenge their all - time highs again -- and then surpass them in the coming year , " he said .
Standards set for energy - conserving LED lighting
Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , in cooperation with national standards organizations , have taken the lead in developing the first two standards for solid - state lighting in the United States .
This new generation lighting technology uses light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) instead of incandescent filaments or fluorescent tubes to produce illumination that cuts energy consumption significantly .
Standards are important to ensure that products will have high quality and their performance will be specified uniformly for commerce and trade .
These standards — the most recent of which published last month — detail the color specifications of LED lamps and LED light fixtures , and the test methods that manufacturers should use when testing these solid - state lighting products for total light output , energy consumption and chromaticity , or color quality .
Solid - state lighting is expected to significantly reduce the amount of energy needed for general lighting , including residential , commercial and street lighting .
" Lighting , " explains NIST scientist Yoshi Ohno , " uses 22 percent of the electricity and 8 percent of the total energy spent in the country , so the energy savings in lighting will have a huge impact . "
Solid - state lighting is expected to be twice as energy efficient as fluorescent lamps and 10 times more efficient than incandescent lamps , although the current products are still at their early stages .
Ohno chaired the task groups that developed these new standards .
In addition to saving energy , the new lighting , if designed appropriately , can produce better color rendering — how colors of objects look under the illumination — than fluorescent lamps or even incandescent lamps , Ohno says .
NIST is working with the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) to support its goal of developing and introducing solid - state lighting to reduce energy consumption for lighting by 50 percent by the year 2025 .
The department predicts that phasing in solid - state lighting over the next 20 years could save more than $ 280 billion in 2007 dollars .
The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America ( IESNA ) published a documentary standard LM - 79 , which describes the methods for testing solid - state lighting products for their light output ( lumens ) , energy efficiency ( lumens per watt ) and chromaticity .
Details include the environmental conditions for the tests , how to operate and stabilize the LED sources for testing and methods of measurement and types of instruments to be used .
" More standards are needed , and this will be the foundation for all solid - state lighting standards , " Ohno says .
The standard is available from the IESNA .
The solid - state lights being studied are intended for general illumination , but white lights used today vary greatly in chromaticity , or specific shade of white .
The American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) published the standard C78.377-2008 , which specifies the recommended color ranges for solid - state lighting products using cool to warm white LEDs with various correlated color temperatures .
The standard may be downloaded from ANSI 's Web site .
www.nema.org/stds/ANSI-ANSLG-C78-377.cfm
DOE is launching the Energy Star program for solid - state lighting products this fall .
NIST scientists assisted DOE by providing research , technical details and comments for the Energy Star specifications .
The Energy Star certification assures consumers that products save energy and are high quality and also serves as an incentive for manufacturers to provide energy - saving products for consumers .
The solid - state lighting community is continuing to develop LED lighting standards for rating LED lamp lifetime and for measuring the performance of the individual high - power LED chips and arrays .
NIST scientists are taking active roles in these continuing efforts .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Washington policy makers and housing industry insiders hope a new tax credit for first - time home buyers will get the moribund housing market moving again .
But most analysts agree that the program is more of a band - aid than a cure - all for the battered real estate market .
What 's more , others are quick to point out that the credit must be repaid , which means it 's actually an interest - free loan that could get some homeowners in trouble .
" It 's one of those things that are more complicated than it seems at first blush , said Allen Fishbein , director of housing and credit policy for the Consumer Federation of America .
" Consumers have to make sure they understand the credit thoroughly .
The $ 7,500 credit is for people buying their first homes , and was passed as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and signed into law in July .
To qualify for the full $ 7,500 , individuals must earn less than $ 75,000 annually , while couples may earn up to $ 150,000 .
Individual buyers with income of up to $ 95,000 and couples with income up to $ 170,000 are eligible for a partial credit .
The Senate Finance Committee estimates that about 1.6 million people will use the credit .
The housing industry pushed for the program .
" Breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind , " said Richard Dugas , president of builder Pulte Homes , at a news conference to discuss the program .
First time home buyers represented about 20 % of the market for new homes in 2007 .
Realtors are also behind the credit .
" [ It ] will help chip away at inventory levels , stabilize prices and spur [ sales ] activity , " said Richard A. Smith , CEO of Realogy , the parent company of both Coldwell Banker and Century 21 .
The industry has had success with tax credits in the past .
In 1975 , Congress passed a $ 2,000 credit for home buyers ( about $ 8,200 in today 's dollars ) .
" Buyers flocked to market and cleared out a then - record inventory of homes , " said NAHB president Sandy Dunn .
But that credit did not have to be repaid .
And the impact should extend beyond first time home buyers , according to Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors .
A boost in demand for starter homes means that those sellers will be able to trade up to bigger , more expensive places , and so on up the chain .
How it works
Buyers who have not owned a home in the past three years can take a tax credit worth 10 % of a home 's sale price , up to $ 7,500 , whichever is smaller .
The credit is good for homes closed on after April 9 , 2008 and before July 1 , 2009 , and can be taken on taxes filed during 2008 or 2009 .
Even buyers who bought a home before the bill passed , but after April 9 , can claim the credit .
Unlike tax deductions , which only offset taxes by lowering taxable income , the tax credit is a straight dollar - for - dollar deduction of your tax bill .
So a buyer who would ordinarily pay $ 8,000 in taxes would pay just $ 500 .
It 's also " refundable , " which means if a buyer 's taxes are less than $ 7,500 , the government will send them a check for the difference .
For example , if a couple 's income generates a tax bill of $ 5,000 , the government will refund all of that plus $ 2,500 .
Buyers must start paying back the loan within two years , at a rate of no more than $ 500 a year for 15 years .
When the the home is sold , any outstanding balance will be repaid from the profit ; if it 's sold at a loss and the difference will be forgiven .
And some argue that mortgage lenders will take the credit into consideration , making it easier for buyers to get a loan .
" [ The $ 7,500 reserve ] will make borrowers less likely to fall into default , " said Ken Goldstein , an economist with the Conference Board , since it gives them a nest egg should they run into trouble .
Still , that assumes that buyers will sock the $ 7,500 away rather than spend it .
No cure
Indeed , the credit comes with plenty of caveats from economists and industry analysts .
" It 's not going to provide first - time home buyers with cash up front , " said the Consumer Federation of America 's Allen Fishbein .
" You have to apply to get the credit after the fact .
There 's a delay before you get the financial advantage . "
And there are concerns that borrowers may treat the credit as a windfall , spending it as if it does n't have to be repaid .
" It may appear to be free money , " said Fishbein .
" Consumers have to have their eyes open about how this works . "
Other economists caution that while the credit may be helpful , it 's hardly a solution to the crisis .
" It will not turn things around , " said Jared Bernstein , an economist with the Economic Policy Institute .
" Given the economy , it will only push a precious few first - time home buyers over the edge right now . "
Plummeting home prices will blunt any impact that the credit may have , according to Nicholas Retsinas , director of the Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies .
As far as he 's concerned , the market is simply too soft right now for a modest measure like this to make a big difference .
" The challenge right now is as much willingness to buy as affordability , " he said .
" The market still has this psychological barrier because people think prices will be lower tomorrow .
I do n't think this can overcome that barrier . "
Wow .
There is so much hackery in this short clip that it 's hard to know where to begin .
While reporting on McCain 's Anbar gaffe , the " Morning Joe " squad not only fails to acknowledge how serious and unprofessional it was for CBS to selectively edit the gaffe out of the interview , they completely buy into the McCain campaign 's damage control spin .
And as if it that were n't bad enough , Joe Scarborough makes it a point to go out of his way and call the arm - waving host that ran with the story ( an obvious allusion to his colleague Keith Olbermann ) " ignorant " and " too stupid to be on TV . "
Download Download ( h/t Heather for vids and transcript )
" Look let me tell you .... and I know a couple of hosts ran this last night and made a huge deal because some liberal blogger picked it up .
I will guarantee you the host that ran it , were waving their arms , had no idea whether the Sunni Awakening , or , or or , the surge began at the same time .
They also , anybody that would argue that the Sunni Awakening would have survived in Al Anbar Province , without the surge , anybody that would make that argument is so ignorant of the facts on the ground in Western Iraq , in Al Anbar Province , and what the Sunni sheiks were doing throughout 2007 , that they are too stupid to be on TV .
And I hope they do n't carry that argument much longer because it is laughable . "
Let me try and break this down for the slow among us .
This is what McCain said :
" Colonel MacFarland was contacted by one of the major Sunni sheiks .
Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others .
And it began the Anbar awakening .
I mean , that ’s just a matter of history . "
Actually , no , it 's not a " matter of history . "
Whether or not the surge helped strengthen the al - qaeda - routing awakening is not the issue ; the issue is McCain crediting the surge with creating the awakening in the first place .
That is , as a matter of fact , UNTRUE .
Now , if McCain had said the surge " strengthened the awakening , " it would be different .
But by saying it " began the awakening , " he is deliberately distorting the time line in order to give the surge more credit than it 's due , and thus give himself more credit than he 's due .
It 's that simple .
When confronted by Senator Obama with the prospect that the surge is n't entirely responsible for the security improvements , McCain is forced to play the only card he has left in his deck and attribute everything to the surge , even though the greatest gains began before it .
It 's not hard to understand .
I wonder if the McCain campaign realizes how foolish they look right now .
While Barack Obama is overseas looking presidential and having his foreign policy ratified by the Iraqi government , John McCain is home undermining his own foreign policy " expertise , " undercutting his main argument for the surge , and looking childish as he stomps his feet and blames the press .
All I can say is ... keep it up !
The Bill of No Rights
By Lewis W. Napper
We , the sensible of the United States , in an attempt to help everyone get along , restore some semblance of justice , avoid any more riots , keep our nation safe , promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of debt - free liberty to ourselves and our great - great - great grandchildren , hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny , guilt - ridden delusional , and other liberal , commie , pinko bedwetters .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that a whole lot of people were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights .
ARTICLE I
You do not have the right to a new car , big - screen color TV or any other form of wealth .
More power to you if you can legally acquire them , but no one is guaranteeing anything .
ARTICLE II
You do not have the right to never be offended .
This country is based on freedom , and that means freedom for everyone – not just you !
You may leave the room , turn the channel , express a different opinion , etc. , but the world is full of idiots , and probably always will be .
ARTICLE III
You do not have the right to be free from harm .
If you stick a screwdriver in your eye , learn to be more careful , do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all of your relatives independently wealthy .
ARTICLE IV
You do not have the right to free food and housing .
Americans are the most charitable people to be found , and will gladly help anyone in need , but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes .
ARTICLE V
You do not have the right to free health care .
That would be nice , but from the looks of public housing , we ’re just not interested in public health care .
ARTICLE VI
You do not have the right to physically harm other people .
If you kidnap , rape , intentionally maim or kill someone , do n’t be surprised if the rest of us get together and kill you .
ARTICLE VII
You do not have the right to the possessions of others .
If you rob , cheat , or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens , do n’t be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still wo n’t have the right to a big - screen color TV or a life of leisure .
ARTICLE VIII
You do not have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience .
We hate oppressive governments and wo n’t lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you ’d like .
However , we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat .
ARTICLE IX
You do not have the right to a job .
All of us sure want you to have one , and will gladly help you along in hard times , but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities in education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful .
ARTICLE X
You do not have the right to happiness .
Being an American means that you have the right to pursue happiness – which , by the way , is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by those around you who were confused by the Bill of Rights .
In Iraq and elsewhere , improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) pack a double - deadly whammy :
They can kill when they explode , and then they turn surviving soldiers into sitting ducks when Humvee tires blow out .
Conventional Humvee tires need a certain amount of air pressure , but also may include so - called " run-flat " inserts that wrap around the tire 's rim to keep it from going completely flat when the tire 's surface is ruptured .
The U.S. Army , however , is looking for an alternative that can keep its vehicles running faster and farther than a run - flat donut after an attack .
To keep troops from being stranded and easily ambushed on the battlefield , the Army is working with researchers to develop tires for their Humvees that can better withstand roadside attacks .
One such design comes from Resilient Technologies , LLC , based in Wausau , Wisc. , and the University of Wisconsin–Madison 's Polymer Engineering Center .
With a four - year , $ 18 - million grant from the Pentagon , Resilient is working to create a " non-pneumatic tire " ( NPT ) technology , called that because it does n't require air .
The NPT looks like a circle of honeycombs bordered by a thick black tread .
" There 's a lot of space for shrapnel to pass through , " says Ed Hall , Resilient Technologies 's director of business affairs .
" Even if you remove 30 percent of the webs , the tire will still work . "
Resilient is now working to deliver to the Army Research Lab a prototype wheel that the Army would be able to manufacture on its own .
" The Army Research Lab approached us , saying that flats on Humvees made them susceptible to attack , " Hall says .
" We looked at a lot of non-pneumatic designs before coming up with a polymeric web . "
Resilient says it 's too early to say how much the tires will cost or even which polymers they 're using , because they 're still in the prototype phase .
( The company installed a set of 37 - inch ( 94 - centimeter ) NPTs on a Wausau - based National Guard Humvee to test them in April . )
Although the military is hoping to put these tires in use as soon as possible , Resilient has no plans for a consumer version right now .
It may be a decade or more before an NPT makes spare tires a relic of the past : that 's how long Michelin says it will be before its airless " Tweel " comes to market .
In the meantime , the Tweel is more likely to show up on small construction vehicles .
And for those of you wondering why all tires are n't simply made out of solid rubber , some construction vehicles use them on sites with debris that can easily shred a pneumatic tire , but solid tires give an incredibly rough ride , generate a lot of heat , and might be even worse if a piece came off during an explosion , because it could not easily be repaired .
The NPT 's honeycomb structure is designed to support the load placed on the tire , dissipate heat and offset some of these issues .

Travelers beware : U.S. agents now have the authority to seize and retain laptops indefinitely , according to a new policy detailed in documents issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
As part of border search policy , government agents are now authorized to seize electronic devices and inspect documents in them , the document states .
The electronic devices might include laptops , cell phones , portable music players or storage devices such as portable hard drives .
Agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection will also be allowed to translate and share documents with other government agencies .
The DHS document , issued July 16 , appears to state publicly a policy that has already existed .
Laptops and electronic devices have been subject to search in the past , and travelers have reported not getting their devices back .
The policy has drawn strong criticism from lawmakers and nonprofit groups , who charged that the searches were invasive and a violation of an individual 's privacy rights .
Computers contain a vast amount of private information about family , finances and health , which could be easily copied and stored in government databases , the Electronic Frontier Foundation has complained .
The policy document states that being able to examine documents and electronic devices is crucial for " detecting information concerning terrorism , narcotics smuggling ... contraband including child pornography , and ... other import or export control laws . "
The new DHS policies allow customs agents to analyze the contents of laptops without any suspicion of wrongdoing , U.S. Senator Russ Feingold said in a statement .
" The policies that have been disclosed are truly alarming , " Feingold wrote .
The policy could blur the distinction between " search " and " seizure , " which could also allow DHS officials to steal personal documents from laptops it has retained , Feingold wrote .
I want to make this clear :
In the war between Russia and Georgia , we should be rooting for the Russians .
Indeed , the Russians are alright .
For example , this week I read that Americans who are opening franchises such as Starbucks in Moscow are trying to train the local Russian workers to smile to the customers .
This is because Russian service providers , just so you understand , do n’t like to smile .
Why should they like to do it ?
Why should someone whose career pinnacle thus far is serving grand lattes smile ?
Moreover , what can a customer who just bought a Starbucks coffee do with a smile ?
How will this smile help him ?
Once he tastes the coffee , the only thing anyone can do for him is give him his money back and offer a comforting hug , and even that wo n’t completely compensate for the unpleasantness .
Only American service providers smile automatically while getting six bucks an hour for doing their dead - end job .
Meanwhile , only American customers believe this smile and smile back .
More realistic nations – that is , everyone – know there ’s nothing to smile about in the pour - coffee - for - me - and - I ’ll - leave - you - a - quarter industry .
In fact , when it comes to completely enlightened nations , like the French for example , a waiter who is caught smiling has his license revoked on the spot .
The American entrepreneurs also discovered that their Russian employees are accustomed to no longer working once they get a promotion .
From an American point of view , this is terrible conduct that requires re-education .
Yet from a Russian ( and also Israeli ) point of view , what ’s unclear here ?
So you were promoted ?
You were transferred to a corner office ?
You got a secretary and a luxury vehicle ?
It ’s time to rest , brother .
Give others the opportunity to work a little , just like you worked in the past .
Other people also want to be promoted .
Sit down and do nothing ; this is why we have those other people here , what ’s their name , oh yeah , employees .
And so , the Russians , a nation where service providers do n’t smile and certainly do n’t use a promotion to work harder , sound completely sane to me .
Russians are serious characters , and their smiles , as is the case with most human beings , have some value .
Yet the Americans emptied smiles of any value or emotion , after they made them free .
The American smile is meaningless .
Strangers throw it your way on the street as if it was a free local newspaper at noon .
It has neither meaning nor intention .
It has no reason for being .
It ’s a false smile .
Yet the Russians are thinking people .
They know that smiles have value , just like they know what Georgia is doing in south Ossetia , and they ’re willing to fight against it .
I believe that in Russian it ’s called “ respect . ”

Congressman Ron Paul fears that a staged incident exploited as a pretext to attack Iran may be the precursor to a national draft , as he responded to Sy Hersh ’s astounding report that Dick Cheney proposed faking a Gulf of Tonkin style incident by killing Americans in the Straits of Hormuz and blaming it on Iran .
“ The influence is still there that they want it to happen , they probably themselves do n’t have a day set to do it but they ’re waiting for an opportunity and something will come along , ” Paul told the Alex Jones Show .
“ They ’re capable of doing anything , ” said Paul , refering to the consideration unveiled in the Downing Street Memo , where Bush and Blair discussed painting a U2 spy plane in UN colors and goading Saddam to have it shot down as a pretext to invade Iraq .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Asked about Cheney ’s proposal to kill Americans as part of a false flag attack to be blamed on Iran , Paul responded , “ The sad part is a lot of people wo n’t be surprised ….it ’s tragic , it ’s sad , all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of Americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the Iranians and the country ’s going to be ready to go to war , they ’d even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save Israel , we have to march in , so we need a draft – that ’s the worst part that I fear , ” said the Congressman .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Back in January 2007 , Paul voiced his fears on the House floor of a “ contrived Gulf of Tonkin style incident that may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran . ”
During an appearance on the Alex Jones Show last month , Congressman Paul said that a strike on Iran has already been green lighted , judging from what his contacts in and around Congress were telling him .
“ It is still totally bewildering to me when I see men and women in the Congress that I know and like doing this just to get along .
Most of them will say “ I agree with you on all you say but the Iranians are bad people and they might attack us some day …
I hear members of Congress saying ‘ if we could only nuke them ’ , ” said Paul .
During an event at the Campus Progress journalism conference earlier this month , journalist Sy Hersh detailed how a meeting took place in Dick Cheney ’s office on the subject of “ how to create a casus belli between Tehran and Washington , ” part of an ongoing effort to provide an excuse to attack Iran .
“ There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war , ” Hersh explains .
“ The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up . ”

The federal government would need to quarantine infected households and ban public gatherings to contain pandemic flu , according to a computer simulation study conducted by researchers from Virginia Tech and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ You would n’t go out to the movies .
You would n’t congregate with people , ” said researcher Stephen Eubank .
“ You ’d pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down . ”
The consensus among health experts is that a pandemic , or global epidemic , of influenza is inevitable .
The last such pandemic , in 1918 , killed between 40 and 100 million people .
Because of the belief that a pandemic cannot be avoided , researchers are instead looking into ways to limit its effects .
In the current study , researchers used a computer to model the hypothetical spread of flu pandemic in the city of Chicago under various containment scenarios .
They found that a vigorous early response could reduce the infection rate by 80 percent .
“ Depending on how fast it is spreading , it seems as though you really need to throw everything you can at it , ” Eubank said .
Under the containment scenario , people infected with or exposed to the disease would be confined to their homes , and schools and day - care centers would be shut down , as would places of public gathering like bars , restaurants and theaters .
Offices and factories would remain open but would operate at reduced capacity due to quarantines .
The extreme measures would need to continue for months , until a vaccine was developed .
“ We are not talking about simply shutting things down for a day or two like a snow day , ” Eubank said .
“ It ’s a sustained period for weeks or months . ”
The computer model assumed widespread compliance with the response plan , but Eubank says he does n’t anticipate that as a problem .
“ In the context of a very infectious disease that is killing a large number of the people , I think large fractions of the population wo n’t have a problem with these recommendations , ” he said .

R.A. Radford was an economist taken prisoner during World War Two who later wrote about the complex cigarette - based economy that thrived in the POW camps in a fascinating 1945 article .
You can also read it online as a pdf if you want to see it in its original type - print glory , which I have to say , does rather add to the atmosphere it so wonderfully evokes .
It ’s a vivid insight into the social organisation of the camps , and just the descriptions of the market pressures are quite interesting in themselves .
For example , the standard currency was a cigarette , but heavy air raids meant people would smoke more , presumably owing to stress , thereby altering the value of the currency through scarcity .
The camp residents imposed trade regulations , had trading areas , and some even developed businesses :
Around D - Day , food and cigarettes were plentiful , business was brisk and the camp in an optimistic mood .
Consequently the Entertainments Committee felt the moment opportune to launch a restaurant , where food and hot drinks were sold while a band and variety turns performed .
Earlier experiments , both public and private , had pointed the way , and the scheme was a great success .
Food was bought at market prices to provide the meals and the small profits were devoted to a reserve fund and used to bribe Germans to provide grease - paints and other necessities for the camp theatre .
Originally meals were sold for cigarettes but this meant that the whole scheme was vulnerable to the deflationary waves , and furthermore heavy smokers were unlikely to attend much .
The whole success of the scheme depended on an adequate amount of food being offered for sale in the normal manner .
To increase and facilitate trade , and to stimulate supplies and customers therefore and secondarily to avoid the worst effects of deflation when it should come , a paper currency was organised by the Restaurant and the Shop .
It ’s completely readable even if you ’re not familiar with economics and is a captivating window into POW camp society as seen through the eyes of a monetary expert .

The UN has estimated that 20,000 civilians have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began in Georgia .
The BBC's Gavin Hewitt reports from the frontline near the town of Gori , where Russian planes have been in action .
As he reported on the fate of civilians in Georgia , his team came under attack from Russian fire .
At Christmas I tend to get attacked by my philosophical ghouls who want to play around with me .
I begin thinking of our religious beliefs since religion plays such an overwhelming part in the lives of a majority of Americans .
And it did with our forefathers as well , who , having suffered persecution at the hands of a power structure that sponsored a set of differing religious beliefs , braved the stormy Atlantic to settle in the wilderness of America where they could worship as they pleased , and kill the Indians .
Then they went to war with England , and sculptured a constitution , and there you have it , presto !
the First Amendment that guarantees freedom of religion .
Perhaps you believe that the First Amendment to the Constitution will protect you to embrace whatever religion sings to your soul .
Well , it will , of course , if you are a Presbyterian or Lutheran or even one of those who have been mocked and belittled from the time I was a child — a “ Holly Roller ” they were called .
But they were rolling for Jesus .
In my day the Catholics prayed to God in Latin because , obviously , He only understood Latin , and the priests were all dressed up in glittering nighties and wore strange crowns and rang bells .
And even they were talking to Christ through his mamma .
I thought that was smart , knowing as I did , the power that mammas have .
And the Baptist dumped you in a tub and near drowned you to wash away your sins , which meant to me that Baptists had more sins than Methodists , the church I grew up in , because in the Methodist Church the preacher just dipped his soft , white , uncalloused fingers into a silver bowl , got a drop or two on his fingers , and then sort of pressed the drops on your head , which told me right off that Methodists did n’t have as many sins to be washed away as Baptists .
Then there were those who had the days of the week all mixed up and went to church on Saturday instead of Sunday , and , if you could scrape up a dime , how could you see Hopalong Cassidy at the Saturday afternoon show if you had to go to church instead ?
And then there were those who were trying to put doctors out of business because they left all healing to Jesus – some sect called Christian Scientists , which did n’t seem very scientific at all .
I thought Jesus probably liked doctors .
If Jesus was too busy to hear your prayers , there was always a doctor to back Him up .
But none of these belief systems caused any serious problems because the First Amendment said that in America you could worship as you pleased .
I do n’t know what they would do to us if we were teaching our children from the time of first thought that Santa Claus was a lying fiction that represented the degenerate corporate money structure and was created only so Americans would buy a lot of junk at Christmas for their kids in order to insure the profits of the corporate king .
And what would happen if you taught your kids that Jesus and Santa were in competition with each other — as a matter of fact , as it turns out , Christmas is not the celebration of the birth of Christ , but it ’s the time when Santa comes and , if you are a kid from a poor family trying to scrape enough together to eat , it is obvious that Santa does not love you as much as he does the rich kid , because the rich kid got a new bike and you got nothing , which teaches that money and virtue are somehow related , and that being poor is the first sin .
I have no problem with the various religions or with Santa .
The human species is born with that overriding instinct of all instincts – survival — the other side of which is the fear of death .
So we invent whatever belief systems are necessary to cope with that omnipotent fear , and we are born Baptists or Catholics or Muslims depending on the parents we drew out of the big basket in the sky .
Does n’t seem like much of a basis to kill each other because of the parents , along with their beliefs , that we , and they , drew out of said big basket in the sky .

The following article was commissioned by the Report Newsmagazine but was not published .
Apparently it became overlooked and forgotten .
I can't blame the editor for that .
He was busy fighting a case for freedom of the press in a Human Rights Tribunal of the Alberta Human Rights Commission at the time .
Response to Jeff White Andrea Yates notwithstanding , .all men are beastly brutes , if we are to believe what Jeff White told us .
Re: Report , Apr. 29 , 2002 , p. 40 According to Jeff
White , " Men have always specialized in wholesale killing of older children . "
Well , maybe he has always done so ( how did he get away with it ? ) , but nobody else I know did .
He told more whoppers in his article .
He mentioned a survey ( unnamed ) " of 35 cultures from around the world , " that " found that 21 of them killed deformed or sickly children , " and " positively demanded " their deaths .
" Only Christians did n't approve of it . "
By my reckoning , 35 - 21 = 14 .
Were those 14 cultures exclusively Christian ?
Did Jews and Muslims habitually kill their disabled children ?
Are Christians to be despised for bringing an end to the practice of destroying those that do n't conform to pagan ideals of beauty or convenience ?
Hitler promoted such " Whitish " cleansing .
The more of our Christian ideals we discard , the more the people on the Left cleanse .
It 's now a women 's right !
In addressing the topic of the male role in " serious domestic violent crime , " Jeff White covered a selective and very broad range of subjects , localities and much anecdotal evidence .
From there he then drifted back to Canada and cemented his hypothesis of men being habitual killers of their families firmly into place with StatCan 's estimates on partner violence , even if covering only a fraction of family violence .
Those data relate to all alleged violence between men and women only , including instances of men yelling at their wives , giving them the cold shoulder or " scaring " them .
They are demonstrably tainted with StatCan 's pro-feminist and family - hostile editorial bias .
Moreover , they are not even based on biased convictions but largely on the results of telephone surveys .
[ 1 ]
Why not , advocacy numbers fit a pet theory so much better , right ?
StatCan 's very broad definitions of " mother " and " father " deliberately mislead .
A " spouse " could mean just about anyone in the presence of a woman or man , no matter the duration or quality of the presence .
" Mother " is likely to be a natural mother , whereas " father " is most likely any man but a natural father .
Thereby it is made to appear that we can safely ignore the far superior safety of families headed by married biological parents .
However , in their care , as Patrick Fagan from the Heritage Foundation identified , children are 33 times less likely to be seriously abused and 73 times less likely to be killed than in single - mother " families . " [ 2 ]
American government agencies report numbers that are more objective , not as subjective as those Jeff White selected .
In the US in 1999 , 70.3 percent of perpetrators of child abuse were female parents acting alone or with others .
Out of an estimated 826,000 victims of child maltreatment , nation - wide , 1,100 were fatalities .
Their perpetrators break down as follows : PERPETRATOR RELATIONSHIP [ 3 ]
31.5 % Female Parent Only
10.7 % Male Parent Only *
21.3 % Both Parents *
16.3 % Female Parent and Other
1.1 % Male Parent and Other *
4.5 % Family Relative
6.1 % Substitute Care Provider(s )
5.7 % Other
2.7 % Unknown
* " Male parent " in that context most likely is just about anything but a natural father .
That means that , acting alone or with others , female parents were responsible in 69.1 percent , and male parents in 33.1 percent of cases of fatal child maltreatment .
Contrary to Jeff
White 's yarn , if anyone cornered the market on the killing of children , women did , not men !
Furthermore , considering stepfathers , common - law husbands , boyfriends and other strange males involved in the lives of women and in the abuse of " women 's " children , it emerges that natural fathers are the least likely to let harm come to any child .
That 's what we should try to establish , not deny and twist around .
Not much can be gained by tarring all men or women with the same brush .
It would be a long jump from the circumstance that at most three percent of people engage in child abuse to the assertion that therefore all women ( or all men ) are child abusers .
Such jumps in logic are a prerogative usurped by feminists , not the mark of an objective journalist .
Space does n't permit to go into the misperceptions promoted by Jeff White with respect to partner violence .
He should look up the studies undertaken by Drs. John Archer , Martin Fiebert and others . [ 4 ]
Newspapers , too , in spite of their liberal bent still provide much useful information , as long as we can keep it free of editorializing by uninformed people or those with an agenda .
By the way , there were no " horrors of the Yates trial , " but the trial exposed , examined and judged the horrors visited by Andrea Yates on the children she and her husband conceived .
Was it necessary to publish an article that contained such a large collection of misleading information ?
Are n't men being vilified enough already without anyone adding to the general slander directed against them ?
Let 's hope that Jeff
White 's article is not a sign of worse things to come , and that we wo n't see the Report join the drive to keep women and " their " children safe from those beastly brutish men , although the media frequently report that women kill children in revenge against the children 's fathers .
What 's next , the promotion of deadly ideologies of people like Prof. Steven Pinker ? ( " birth is as arbitrary a milestone as any other " in setting a boundary for the killing of a child [ 5 ] )
They significantly extend abortion to include the new - born whose continued life will depend solely on a " rational " decision by the mother , all in compliance with the " prehistoric tradition of infanticide as the oldest method of reproductive control . "
At least Steven Pinker , who used almost identical words , only speculated that there may have been such a tradition .
On Jeff White 's keyboard it became an assertion .
The Report printed it and always told the truth before , therefore the " prehistoric tradition " ( an oxymoron ) must be true ?

As Russian forces started to hand over control of the Georgian town of Gori yesterday , you could detect a note of surprise , even disappointment , in many media reports .
So the all - out Russian invasion of plucky little democratic Georgia might not be going to happen after all .
Could it be that the bear was drawing in his claws ?
Well , Russia did not have long to worry about losing its reputation as backyard bully .
Within hours , the United States envoy to Georgia was spinning a whole new myth to the BBC about how it was only decisive US intervention – by which he presumably meant the warplanes laden with humanitarian aid by then ostentatiously parked at Tbilisi airport – that the mighty erstwhile Red Army had been turned back .
The many Georgians who had counted on more timely and robust assistance from their US protector surely laughed a bitter laugh .
But there were signs , with the arrival of the US Secretary of State in Georgia , that this version was gaining hold .
The story of this war , it seems , will be that the US faced down a snarling , expansionist Russia , and forced it to limp back to its lair .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This is a travesty .
But it is only the latest and most glaring in a series of Western misrepresentations and misreadings of Russian intentions throughout this sorry episode .
They began with the repeated references to Russian " aggression " and " invasion " , continued through charges of intended " regime change " , and culminated in alarmist reports about Russian efforts to bomb the east - west energy pipeline .
None of this , not one bit of it , is true .
Take " aggression " and " invasion " .
Georgia declared itself to be in a state of war with Russia .
War , regrettably , is war , and a basic objective is to reduce , or destroy , the enemy 's military capability .
This is what Russia was doing until it accepted the ceasefire .
The positions it took up inside Georgia proper can be seen as defensive , not offensive .
Gori houses the Georgian garrison on South Ossetia 's border .
And anyway , how did hostilities begin ?
Georgia sent troops into South Ossetia .
The status of that region – which declared unilateral independence – is anomalous .
It is inside Georgia 's borders , but outside its control .
But one reason why the dispute has not been solved is that the " fudge " over independence brought with it a degree of stability .
Georgia 's action upset that stability .
But did anyone describe it as " aggression " ?
Trying to explain Russian " aggression " , many reports went further , observing a " new " mood of Russian aggressive nationalism .
Today 's Russia , they reasoned , was uniquely liable to lash out , because energy wealth had fuelled new national ambitions .
Where , though , is the evidence that Russian national pride is automatically malign ?
If you exclude Chechnya , which Russians have always regarded as part of Russia , then neither Putin , nor Medvedev , had sent troops outside Russian borders before this point .
As for the idea that Putin wants to restore the Soviet Union – derived from his remark about the Soviet collapse being " among the greatest catastrophes " of the 20th century – nothing could be further from what he did .
Far from hankering after a lost empire , Putin used his years as president systematically to fix Russia 's post - Soviet borders , signing treaties with every neighbouring country that would agree – including , last month , China .
Of course , Russia does not like the idea of another Nato member on its borders .
But this is not the same as wanting to restore " ex- Soviet space " .
It reflects Russia 's view of its legitimate security interests .
Perhaps the most pernicious assumption over the past week , however , is that Russia wanted to effect " regime - change " .
Russian officials categorically denied this , insisting that they had no business overthrowing an elected leader .
You might scoff , but Russia has done nothing that would contradict this .
The Kremlin would probably be delighted if Georgians eventually punished their President for his misguided enterprise , but Russia seems to accept that Georgians decide what happens in Georgia .
Why was it so difficult for outsiders to believe that Moscow wanted precisely what its leaders said they wanted : a return to the situation that had pertained before Georgia 's incursion into South Ossetia – and does it matter that its intentions were so appallingly misread ?
Yes it does .
If outsiders impute to Moscow motives and objectives it does not have , they alienate Russia even further , and make a long - term solution of many international problems that more difficult .
It is high time we treated Russia 's post - Soviet leaders as responsible adults representing a legitimate national interest , rather than assuming the stereotypical worst .

Instead of counting dollars worth of gear , lets try to estimate how many Terabytes of data are being collected :
Most shooters are using top of line Nikon or Canon bodies , so say 12 - 16MP , likely shooting RAW format , so let guess file sizes between 15 - 24 MB , 18 MB on average .
Shooting in bursts of a dozen or so , several times a minute , let ;s say each shooter takes on average 48 shots per minute , throughout the day .
I 'm sure none of them are being paid hourly wages , so in order to make a dime they are probably working 12 hours a day , half of which ( conservatively ) is spent behind the viewfinder ( except for the guy in the lower left of the picture above )
So on average each shooter is collecting : 18MP*48shots/min.*60min./hr*6hr/day = 311GB /day .
using the 1,100 photographers , that 's 342TB of digital images captured every day at the Olympics .
I believe there are 19 days of events plus the opening and closing ceremonies , so lets say photographers work every day , that 's 7,184TB of images .
MORE THAN 7 Petabytes of photos !
And to top it off they are all of pretty much the same thing .
Can anyone else see how inefficient photojournalism is at these events ?
I 've always thought it is so redundant when I see groups of photographers standing around shooting the same thing from the same perspective .
It 's 10 years since Murray Bail published his enchanting novel Eucalyptus , an Australian fable about a father who sets a test for his daughter 's suitors : that they must name every one of the hundreds of species of gum - tree he has planted on his land .
In the end the beautiful daughter is won not by the man with the most complete memory for eucalypts , but by the one who makes up the best stories .
Eucalyptus is very much about story - telling , and its attachment to fable and myth is explained in a withering attack on the sorts of fictions the " national landscape " tends to produce : " There 's nothing more dispiriting , deja vu , than to come across another story of disappointment set in the Australian backblocks . "
The narrator also dislikes urban versions of this " solemn sentimentality " , stories told " in the confessional first - person singular " in which " a kind of applied psychology has taken over story - telling , coating it and obscuring the core " .
That seed of an idea germinates in The Pages , a curious and intriguing novel of contraries , whose central theme is the opposition between philosophy and psychology , and which is extremely wary of sentimentality and confessionalism .
It begins with two women in their 40s , a philosopher and a psychoanalyst , driving out of Sydney to a remote sheep farm in New South Wales on a mission quite as odd as the planting of every known species of eucalyptus .
Erica , the philosopher , is going to assess the work of a dead man called Wesley Antill .
Thirty years earlier , Antill quarrelled with his father , left his brother and sister on the sheep farm , ran away to Sydney and developed an interest in philosophy as " an intricate word - model of the world " .
Meanwhile , he worked as a hospital porter ( one of the novel 's best sequences ) ... # 65279 ; and spent years wandering through European cities , " thought - thinking " , until events turned him homewards .
His brother and sister agreed to let him write his philosophy in the woolshed while they ran the farm .
Here , living in puritan simplicity , he tried to invent a new philosophy , a new " theory of the emotions " .
Then he died , and his will requested that his work be published out of estate costs .
The family lawyer ( a nice Dickensian character ) has appointed Erica to see if there is any value in " the pages " , Wesley 's unfinished life 's work .
Erica , a reserved , attentive , orderly woman , is travelling with her friend Sophie , a narcissistic , importunate , sexy psychoanalyst , who is unaware that her friend is having an affair with her father , with whom Sophie is obsessed .
The temperamental opposition between the two women is also a theoretical opposition between philosophy 's impersonality and psychiatry 's subjectivity .
But it is unevenly balanced because Sophie is given such silly things to say .
The imbalance is driven home by some bad - tempered riffs on the self - obsession and complacency of psychiatry and its ( female ) devotees .
The story of their drive into the pastoral landscape , of their meeting with the interesting Antills , of Erica 's baffling encounter with Wesley 's hieroglyphic " pages " , of the crisis between the two friends and the landscape 's gradually increasing influence over the city visitors is intercut with the history of Wesley 's life .
This moves from third - person narrative to first - person memoir to the notes on the " pages " that Erica - and we - are trying to understand .
So the pages we are reading make a commentary on different kinds of narrative , different ways of thinking about the world .
Wesley 's story begins with the difficulty of being a philosopher in Australia .
Does n't philosophy , this self - educated oddball asks himself , require old , dark countries , rather than a country of wide spaces , cloudless skies and " not enough history " ?
And does n't it require travel , meetings , accidents , so that data from observation can be built up ?
Wesley 's picaresque encounters are for a time , he thinks , his philosophic education .
But the real events of his life - deaths , love , betrayal - in which he displays staggering emotional incompetence , eventually suggest that a better means of " thought - thinking " might be to go home and stay put .
Wandering had been an evasion .
Meanwhile , the world is still out there , impervious and resistant : " What possible dent could philosophy make on the fact of existence ? "
It is hard to tell if this intellectual bildungsroman , in itself absorbing , is intended as a joke .
I was in two minds as to whether Wesley Antill is meant to be a genius , a kind of Australian Wittgenstein , or a self - deluding , grandiose eccentric .
The tone of Bail 's oblique , demanding , intelligent , sardonic work reminds me of JM Coetzee 's cryptic narratives , where the reader is never sure how far to invest in the characters .
What is clear , though , are the oppositions that drive the novel along , between rural and urban , restraint and emotion , light and dark , picaresque travels and rooted pastoralism , Europe and Australia , objective and confessional narratives , order and turmoil .
These oppositions begin to break down interestingly .
The self - controlled Erica gets lost in the bush and has to be rescued .
Philosophy , at first so emphatically contrasted with subjective psychoanalysis , ends up taking the form of an autobiography .
An ( unidentified ) quotation from Nietzsche hangs above Wesley 's desk , saying that philosophy is " a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir " .
Murray Bail plays a laconic , self - concealing game , cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories .
The Pages is not an easy or open book , but it is an oddly compelling one .
The spell is most powerfully cast in the brilliant quiet skill of the writing , which can make the world come alive on the page , as in this startling , one - paragraph storm : " A dark mass rushing across the sky towards them , gathering above the roof , where it paused , then cracked open , a thunderous splitting apart , echoing , and again close ; making them jump ...
Simultaneously , lightning exposed them to windows , the way celebrities under siege in hotels are flash - photographed from the garden beds .
By then it was raining .
It was coming down .
Tons of nails or wheat or gravel hitting the tin roof , pipes and gutters overflowing , while the thunder continued but moving away . "
After all , perhaps , it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for , to grasp " what he saw before him , ordinary objects " , to " fit words only to what can be seen " .

Gun control laws frequently require the use of technology by law enforcement , as well as placing requirements on manufacturers and , ultimately , the consumer .
Are these effective ?
Since I live in California I will focus on local laws , the # 1 state for the Brady Campaign .
Registration – Many states , including California , require gun registration , most often just for handguns .
There are several problems with registration .
Who must register ?
Who maintains the records ?
How to handle private sales or transfers ?
How to handle lost / stolen weapons ?
The main problem is the thousands of hours of administrative burden .
And what are the real benefits ?
Professor John Lott found that in Chicago and Washington D.C. , there have been no crimes where tracing a gun back to the registered owner was instrumental in identifying someone involved in a crime .
( “ Gun Licensing Leads to Increased Crime , Lost Lives ” , L.A. Times , Aug 23 , 2000 ) .
And there is always the question if the lists of gun registrations could be used later for confiscation .
If you do not think guns will be seized from lawful gun owners without just cause , just look at the fiasco in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .
Child Access Prevention –
This is basically a requirement for “ child proof ” trigger locks to be sold with each gun .
California requires these with each gun purchase .
While not a bad idea , in theory , the reality is less than ideal .
One of the major problems with the DC gun laws is that lawful weapons ( rifles and shotguns ) had to be disassembled or equipped with trigger locks .
This makes the weapon less than effective for home defense as you have to fumble to unlock / assemble the weapon , load it , and then you are ready to use it for the emergency in progress .
And they do not prevent opening without a key / combination .
“ The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) tested 32 gun locks - 16 trigger locks and 16 cable locks - and found that all but two models can be opened without a key . ”
( CPSC Video script , Press Release # 01-078 , August 12 , 2002 ) .
Large Capacity Magazines –
This puts a limit on the number of rounds per magazine in magazine fed weapons .
As an example , California allows no more than 10 - round magazines .
The theory is this will limit the number of rounds some crazed idiot can fire without having to reload .
My Beretta 92 FS Vertec is designed to accommodate a 15 round magazine .
The magazines shipped with the pistol have a crimp in them that limits it to holding 10 rounds .
So what ?
It takes less than 2 seconds to pop out a magazine and insert another .
This is a useless law .
I saw a remarkable demonstration in a History Channel program , “ Extreme Marksmen . ” Jerry Miculek used a six - shot revolver for one of his exhibitions .
He fired at a target 30 feet away and placed 12 rounds on target in less than 3 seconds , blindfolded .
That means he fired six rounds blindfolded and hit the target each time , reloaded blindfolded , and hit the target six more times while still blindfolded - in under 3 seconds .
Who needs large capacity maazines if you know what you are doing ?
Ballistic Fingerprinting – Gun dealers or manufacturers must provide police with sample bullets / cartridges or digital images of bullets / cartridges prior to the sale of a handgun .
This is not required in California , fortunately .
In another article by John Lott ( National Review Online , “ Ballistic Fingerprinting ’s a Dud , Another failed gun-control strategy ” , February 04 , 2005 ) , Professor Lott points out , “ New York is spending $ 4 million per year .
Maryland has spent a total of $ 2.6 million , about $ 60 per gun sold .
But in the over four years that the systems have been in effect neither has solved a single crime . ”
Microstamping -
This is a new technology that is not in commercial use today .
Basically a unique serial number is engraved in the firing pin of each pistol .
This serial number is then imprinted on the primer of the bullet casing , or in some instances on the cartridge , when the gun is fired .
Unfortunately , California has already passed a law requiring use of the technology by all manufacturers who sell firearms in California .
This new law will go into effect in 2010 .
It is surprising ( or not since the Brady Campaign rates California best ) this law passed when the technology was tested by the University of California , Davis , and found lacking .
Their original press release on May 3 , 2007 , was titled ( emphasis added ) Microstamping Guns Feasible but Flawed , Study Finds .
The first paragraph stated ( emphasis added ) :
“ New technology to link cartridge cases to guns by engraving microscopic codes on the firing pin is feasible , but does not work well for all guns and ammunition tested in a pilot study by researchers from the forensic science program at UC Davis .
More testing in a wider range of firearms is needed to determine the costs and feasibility of a statewide program of microstamping , as called for by proposed state legislation , the researchers said . ”
Sounds like microstamping is not ready to me .
Their press release was updated on May 13 ; new title : “ Firearms Microstamping Feasible but Variable , Study Finds ” .
And the first paragraph says ( emphasis added ) :
“ New technology to link cartridge cases to guns by engraving microscopic codes on the firing pin is feasible , but did not work equally well for all guns and ammunition tested in a pilot study by researchers from the forensic science program at the University of California , Davis .
More testing in a wider range of firearms is needed , the researchers said . ”

Another St George 's Day , another smattering of minor events and muted celebrations around England .
St George is the patron saint of England , and handy with dragons
Find out what you can do to mark the day - and how England 's efforts still have some way to go to match the celebrations and global attention afforded other UK national days .
ST GEORGE'S DAY
With the day falling on a Monday - perfect for a Bank Holiday some patriots might argue - landlords are leading the charge with St George 's bunting to attract the post - work crowd .
Still , there is fun to be had in the daytime - London has a handful of events organised by Mayor Ken Livingstone , the fourth year running that such festivities have been held .
The highlight will be a screening of classic British comedy on a giant screen in Trafalgar Square starting at 1230 BST , including a showing of Monty Python and the Holy Grail at 1930 BST .
Prior to the film there is a world record attempt for a coconut orchestra , an idea inspired by a scene from the film .
Volunteers are needed , with coconuts provided .
Registration is from 1700 BST .
' Growing popularity '
Mr Livingstone acknowledged St George 's
Day events were growing in popularity , calling them " an opportunity to highlight the best in English culture " .
However , the mayor funds a much bigger St Patrick 's Day celebration , complete with parade .
A clear sign that St George has some serious catching up to do .
Other events include :
In Guildford , Surrey , there is a special farmers market in the high street from 1030 BST to 1530 BST .
Leicester has a day of celebrations taking place in its historic market place .
Tameside council in Manchester is pulling out the stops , transforming Ashton town centre into a medieval village .
In Coventry a full scale re-enactment of the myth is taking place , featuring St George , a cast of medieval characters and the obligatory dragon .
Performances take place in the Upper Precinct between 1230 BST and 1330 BST .
St. George Unofficial Bank Holiday is an independent group that wants a national bank holiday for England on 23 April .
Soon to be appearing on a flagpole near you - possibly
Of that number , 205 replied , with 158 stating they do not plan to celebrate the day .
Campaign organiser Graham Smith said one excuse given by several councils is that " we only have one flagpole " .
He added : " A number of councils said they wanted to do a celebration but have n't got the budget . "
Finally , if you really want to mark the day but have not got time , you can buy a new set of stamps being released by Royal Mail .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think it 's about time we celebrated being English

The stamps , entitled Celebrating England , portray an image of St George , a photograph of the Houses of Parliament and the Cross of St George flag .
In short , there are some things to do , but St George is facing some stiff competition , not least from across the water .
ST PATRICK'S DAY
Everyone wants to be Irish on St Patrick 's Day .
It could be the " craic " or the estimated 13 m pints of Guinness drunk worldwide on 17 March .
Everyone feels Irish when it comes to St Patrick 's Day
Revelry , and often excess drinking , is the order of the day wherever you are marking it .
This year in London , 100,000 people watched the fifth annual St Patrick 's Day parade .
The biggest party was in Birmingham .
Nine days of events were put on this year and close to 150,000 people turned out for the parade .
The same numbers are not expected to take to the streets for St George .
In Dublin the festivities lasted for five days and saw 4,000 performers and more than a million people take to the streets .
The official St Patrick 's festival ( the " Day " was dropped when the festivities began to last the week ) was established by the Irish government in 1995 .
Politicians take the day seriously too .
It has become common for the entire government to be abroad , promoting the country around the world .
It seems unlikely Westminster will be deserted on Monday for the same reasons .
Americans take Paddy 's Day very seriously .
In 2005 the Chicago River was dyed green to celebrate .
But New
York takes the crown for the biggest parade in the world , with two million people turning out to watch .
The lights on the Empire State Building turn green too .
The lights are also changed to recognise St David 's Day .
St George 's Day is not on the lighting rota .
Elsewhere celebrations are varied and sometimes bizarre .
In Tokyo there is an Irish sports day and in Sydney a bachelor of the year award .
Unlikely places like Montserrat and the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador have the day as a public holiday .
ST DAVID'S DAY
St David 's Day on 1 March is generally a more sedate affair than its Irish counterpart .
The Welsh Assembly want a bank holiday for St David's Day
There is an annual St David 's Day public lecture at Cardiff University - this year it looked at the impact of devolution on citizenship .
Also this year , historical treasure Tintern Abbey was lit up in red and green .
At London Paddington station , announcers read out train information in Welsh and English .
Cultural celebrations
Schools in Wales celebrate with special concerts or eisteddfodau , with readings and songs .
Younger girls wear national costume to lessons .
Boys wear a leek or a daffodil .
In the past children were given a half - day holiday and some schools still continue the tradition .
Culture is the order of the day in other parts of the world too , like New York where Wales Week is packed with music , theatre and arts events .
President George W Bush gave a speech this year on St David 's Day , praising Welsh contributions to American life .
But St David's
Day is still not a recognised bank holiday in Wales , and the Welsh Assembly 's request to make it so have been rejected .
ST ANDREW'S DAY
Until recently there have been limited celebrations of St Andrew 's Day on 30 November in Scotland , but that is changing .
Holyrood 's Presiding Officer George Reid kilts up for the New York 's Tartan Day
In 2006 , the parliament designated the day a voluntary public holiday after much wrangling .
It was only a partial victory though , as employers are not required to give staff the day off .
Matters were not helped by the " monumental gaffe " , according to Scottish National Party activists , of the parliament getting the date of St Andrew 's Day wrong in 2006 .
Last year there were a number of government - sponsored events , mostly focused on traditional Scottish music and dancing .
Scotland spirits
There were also Scottish themed events hosted by UK embassies .
The consumption of traditional food and drink like atholl brose and cranachan are encouraged , as is the wearing of kilts .
There are special assemblies in schools and the first minister issues a message .
Just as with St Patrick 's and St David's , America often celebrates on a grander scale than the Scots themselves .
In the US , the equivalent is Tartan Day - in fact Tartan Week - although it is celebrated in April not November , and includes 1,800 pipers , drummers and clansmen .
Deleted photo sparks fears DEA hiring mercenaries Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008

When a California medical marijuana dispensary , Organica Collective , was raided last Thursday by agents of the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency and local police , the Los Angeles Times ran a dramatic story on the incident , accompanied by a set of photographs showing the raid and its aftermath .
According to the Times , witnesses described the DEA agents as " removing computers , medicine and money , and using a steel cylinder battering ram to get into the upstairs bedrooms . "
When they left four hours later , all that remained was " trash , counters strewn with open and empty glass jars , piles of receipts thrown on the ground , upturned couch cushions , bits of marijuana on the edges of counters and an ATM with its doors torn open and emptied .
...
An outdoor vegetable garden had plants uprooted , along with marijuana plants removed by the agents . "
However , one particular photograph from the Times story has drawn more attention than anything else .
That picture , which has now been widely reproduced at blogs , shows a long - haired man , wearing a Blackwater tshirt and with a pistol at his belt , passing a box marked " DEA Evidence " to other agents participating in the raid .
Blackwater , a private mercenary army often employed by the US government for security services and by local police forces for training , has drawn widespread criticism for its shoot - em - up tactics in Iraq and has recently aroused suspicion by its establishment of a private intelligence service and its growing role in global drug enforcement .
A medical marijuana website may have been the first to draw attention to the picture , noting , " Were used to the DEA calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement .
But I guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below , which appeared in the LA Times today , it looks like they had to resort to calling in Blackwater . "
The next day , Tim King of Salem - News.com gave wider distribution to the story , writing , " Are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the DEA ?
A photo from the LA Times shows proof of one of two things ; either Blackwater members are now working for the Bush White House 's Drug Enforcement Agency , or this semi-illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined . "
The photo has since been taken down by the Times , but it has continued to circulate online .
Although there has been no previous suggestion of a Blackwater role in domestic drug enforcement , the single picture was sufficient enough to set off furious discussion at both left - wing and libertarian message boards and blogs .
At Democratic Underground , posters generally acknowledged there was no proof of Blackwater involvement and some pointed out that tshirts of the sort shown in the photograph are available online .
However , others found the idea possible , citing Sen .
John McCain 's recent call for an Iraq - style approach to urban crime .
One poster even claimed , " They were also used in raids in Humboldt County last month against the growers .... Operation Southern Sweep .
Ca n't find any news stories about it , but some people I know have said they were using Blackwater as well as DEA agents . "
At Boing Boing , however , a more skeptical commenter suggested , " I 'm willing to bet he 's DEA .
Blackwater probably would n't hire someone who looked that scuzzy , but DEA agents frequently look like dirtbags .
Would YOU sell dope to someone who looked like a federal agent ? "

McCain and the ' Unitary Executive '
If John McCain wins the presidency – and gets to appoint one or more U.S. Supreme Court justices – America ’s 220 - year experiment as a democratic Republic living under the principle that “ no man is above the law ” may come to an end .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
To put the matter differently , if a President McCain replaces one of the moderate justices with another Samuel Alito – as McCain has vowed to do – then Justice Department lawyer John
Yoo ’s extreme vision of an all - powerful Executive could well become the new law of the land .
On May 6 in Winston - Salem , North Carolina , during a speech aimed at appeasing conservatives , McCain promised to appoint justices in the mold of George W. Bush ’s selections , Justice Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts , expanding the court ’s right - wing faction that also includes Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
Those four justices already have embraced the Bush administration ’s radical notion that at a time of war – even one as vaguely defined as the “ war on terror ” – the President possesses “ plenary ” or unlimited powers through his commander - in - chief authority .
As expressed in classified memos by Yoo when he was a key lawyer in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , there should be , in essence , no limits on what a war - time President can do as long as he is asserting his duty to protect the nation .
Alito also is associated with this concept of a “ unitary executive , ” holding that a President should control all regulatory authority , define the limits of laws via " signing statements " and – at his own discretion – override treaties , the will of Congress and even the Bill of Rights and the Constitution .
Under this theory , a President can cite his commander - in - chief powers to spy on citizens without warrants , imprison people without charges , authorize torture , order assassinations , and invade other countries without congressional approval .
With just one more Alito , that view would claim control of the U.S. Supreme Court and allow a new five - to - four majority to , in effect , rewrite the Constitution .
The founding principle of the United States – that everyone possesses certain “ unalienable ” human rights – would be history .
[ For details , see Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush . ]
' Activist ' Judges
All this would occur under the right - wing assertion that McCain was appointing justices who “ strictly interpret ” the Constitution .
It has been a long - held tenet of the conservative movement that “ activist ” judges were at fault for outlawing racial segregation and other statutes that discriminated against minorities .
More recently , the Right has concentrated its wrath on Supreme Court rulings that struck down laws criminalizing abortion and homosexual acts .
But the “ strict constructionist ” phrase is really a euphemism for a double standard , objecting to judicial decisions that conservatives do n’t like while justifying judicial activism when it serves right - wing causes , such as giving President Bush authority to brush aside the Constitution as he prosecutes the “ war on terror . ”
Even if the clear intent of the Founders was to avoid a tyrannical Executive by placing key war - making powers in the hands of the Legislature , right - wing legal scholars have favored overturning those principles in the name of an all - powerful President .
So , on one level , McCain might choose another Alito or two in order to reverse Roe v.
Wade or allow states to crack down on homosexual rights .
But he also would be enshrining the concept of a “ unitary executive . ”
Thus , perhaps more than any other question , the November election will settle whether a future Supreme Court will reshape the United States into an imperial system both at home and abroad – or roll back President Bush ’s expansion of executive power in the direction of the Founders ' original vision .
Obama - Clinton Battle
There is also a political component on the Democratic side to McCain ’s May 6 promise to Republicans that he will help the Right consolidate control of the federal judiciary , including the Supreme Court .
While many supporters of Hillary Clinton – especially middle - age white women – have told pollsters that they wo n’t vote for Barack Obama if he wins the Democratic nomination , that position might ensure that a core feminist principle , “ reproductive rights , ” will be struck down by the Supreme Court .
In other words , to show their anger over the defeat of a female presidential candidate , Clinton supporters might end up contributing to a historic defeat for feminist rights , including the possible outlawing of abortions in many states .
However , beyond the issue of abortion and other privacy rights , Democrats and all Americans will be faced with a fundamental question when they vote in November :
Will they continue the noble experiment of a democratic Republic with " unalienable " rights for all , what the Founders envisioned with the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution of 1787 ?
Or , do Americans want to go down the path marked by the likes of Yoo , Alito and Bush – ceding virtually all power to one individual who can operate beyond all laws and outside the rules of human behavior – and do so with the blessing of the U.S. Supreme Court ?

Lidwina , patron saint of ice skaters
Albinus of Angers , patron saint against pirate attacks
Domninus of Fidenza , patron saint against rabies
Expeditus , patron saint against procrastination
Apollonia , patron saint of dentists
Drogo , patron saint of coffee brewers , coffee house owners and unattractive people
George , patron saint of … a lot
Mungo , patron saint of Glasgow , Scotland and salmon
You might know the name Cabrini – Cabrini - Green in Chicago is pretty infamous for being a rough public housing development .
I 'm sure the development 's namesake , Frances Xavier Cabrini , AKA Mother Cabrini , would be pretty disheartened to know this if she were still around today .
Today is the day Mother Cabrini was canonized ( made into a saint ) by Pope Pius XII and was made the patron saint of immigrants due to her work with Italian immigrants in the Cabrini - Green area .
This particular designation makes sense , but some of the occupations , places and ailments that are assigned patron saints are pretty obscure ( and some are almost humorous ) .
I thought I would share a few .
Little 14 - year - old Lidwina of Schiedam , the Netherlands , was ice skating when she fell and broke a rib .
She never recovered and became increasingly paralyzed until nothing would work except for her left hand .
Also , she apparently shed pieces of herself , including skin , bones and intestines .
Her parents kept these bits in a vase ( obviously ) .
She was officially canonized on March 14 , 1890 , and became the patron saint of ice skaters .
Albinus had a big heart ( as saints tend to have ) and could n't resist a call of distress .
He used church money to free hostages from pirates .
Obviously , pirate attacks are n't very common today , but in the 10th century , St. Albinus came in handy for the people of the walled town of Guerande .
They had gotten word that pirates were on their way to attack the village and immediately started to pray to St. Albinus .
The attackers were mysteriously deterred and the town was saved .
Legend says Domninus died in 304 A.D. when he was beheaded for converting to Christianity and carrying a cross through Piacenza .
Supposedly he picked up his head and left it on the site where he wanted his cathedral to be built .
This does n't explain why invoking his name is thought to cure rabies , but nonetheless , this information would have been really helpful when Michael Scott was planning the Michael Scott Dunder - Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run for the Cure .
AKA Saint Elpidius , Expeditus was also beheaded in the early 300s .
He decided to become a Christian and the devil showed up in the form of a crow , telling him that he could wait until tomorrow to convert .
Expeditus stamped the crow under his feet and insisted that he would become a Christian today .
That 's it ; as of tomorrow I am going to start sending prayers up to Expeditus .
I have a bit of an aversion to dentists , so Apollonia 's story makes me cringe : when she was tortured for her Christian beliefs , part of the torture included having all of her teeth either pulled out or smashed out .
Ugh .
When you see her represented in artwork , it 's usually with some pincers holding a tooth .
The tooth glows as if holy .
Rumor had it that Drogo could bilocate – be in two different places at the same time .
People saw him hard at work in the fields at the same time others saw him at church .
At some point he came down with an illness that left him incredibly deformed and the villagers were scared of him .
They built him a cell attached to the church and Drogo stayed there for about forty years , with nothing to sustain him but the Eucharist , barley and water , which I think must be the connection to coffee .
Saint George is a busy guy .
He is the patron saint of agricultural workers , archers , armorers , boy scouts , butchers , cavalry , Crusaders , equestrians , farmhands , farmers , field hands , field workers , Freemasonry , horseman , husbandry , husbandmen , knights , riders , Rover Scouts , saddle makers , saddlers , scouts , shepherds , soldiers , Teutonic Knights , Canada , England , Georgia , Germany , Greece , Lithuania , Malta , Moldova , Portugal , Russia , Serbia , Montenegro , Ethiopia , Aragon , Catalonia and Moscow .
For you Harry Potter readers , there really was a St. Mungo .
Well , officially his name was Kentigern .
" Mungo " was a nickname that meant " dear one " .
That 's him lording over the Glasgow coat of arms , and the coat of arms is actually made after four miracles Mungo performed - bringing a dead bird back to life , starting a fire with tree branches , bringing a bell from Rome and saving a Queen from death by finding her ring inside a fish in the river .
I guess that 's why he's the patron saint of salmon .
Reader aristan says Glasgow was a salmon - fishing village pre-Mungo , so there you have it .
My guess was wrong !
CHINA'S increasingly affluent citizens may not all be able to afford cars just yet .
But they clearly yearn for some motive power beyond that provided by their two legs .
The standard bicycle , synonymous with mass transport in China , is not enough for everyone .
Over the past few years electric bikes , with small motors that give a little help to the rider , have become more popular , with more than 20 m made last year according to a new report , “ China 's Clean Revolution ” .
The hope of environmentalists , of course , is that mass transport powered by electricity would pump less carbon into the air than transport powered by internal combustion engines .

If you ask Simran about compact florescent light bulbs , she may crack one open and cut you .
Not really , that would scatter mercury , but she is loca for the light bulbs .
Check Monday ’s Huffington
Post for the full version of this post .
People give you this whole rap about how easy saving the planet is .
Change a light bulb and save the world .
Yes and no .
How about we consider it a start rather than an end destination ?
Lighting accounts for about 20 % of our electric bills .
Traditional bulbs burn heat rather than light , so are extremely inefficient .
Compact florescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) are 80 % more efficient and can last up to 10 times longer than a traditional bulb .
Last December , Congress voted to phase out the inefficient incandescent .
By 2012 , the 100 - watt bulb will be history .
In the interim , environmentally - minded folks of all ilks are heralding the bulb .
The virtual Stop Global Warming march reminds us swapping out three incandescent bulbs for CFLs will save us 300 lbs. of carbon dioxide and $ 60 a year .
The Coalition On the Environment and Jewish Life suggests installing CFLs for Hanukkah as a way to redefine “ energy - stretching light ” and reflect environmental stewardship .
Students in Pennsylvania sell light bulbs instead of candy to raise money for their schools .
( Simran prefers candy . )
If you have n’t changed your bulbs , get with the program .
The light is a lot prettier than what you remember from your high school cafeteria .
Thanks to the University of Kansas School of Journalism and Lacey Johnston for research assistance .
A few years ago I started finding sticks around the yard covered with strange messages that looked like they had been seared right into the wood .
It turned out that the unknown words were names sacred to the world of Bionicles
\– and that one of his friends had taught my son how to set fire to things with a magnifying glass .
After laying down some parameters ( I grew suspicious when he said that something smelled " like burning ants " )
I agreed to let him experiment , carefully , with his new - found mode of expression .
I even incorporated his message sticks into an article on solar - powered crafts .
And in the course of researching that article , I found a fascinating experiment performed by the Mythbusters , those guys on the Discovery Channel who try to prove or disprove urban legends and other popular folklore .
In 2004 , Jamie and Adam reflected on one of the world 's oldest enduring tales — did the Greek scientist Archimedes set fire to a Roman fleet of ships using only mirrors and sunlight ?
The duo claimed to have disproved the myth , but an engineering class at MIT decided to give it a try themselves .
Their successful attempt to set a two - dimensional model of a boat aflame led to an invitation to recreate the experiment with the Mythbusters themselves .
This new try resulted in some charring and smoldering but not much of a conflagration .
Now they 're at it again .
And you can help !
Makezine 's blog reports that the show is looking for 300 volunteers to man the mirrors on a third attempt at the Archimedes Death Ray .
The experiment take place in September in the San Francisco area .
So if you 're a fan of the show ( which has been called the biggest booster for science on television ) and do n't mind standing around for a day in the hot sun , give them a ring .
Ca n't make it ?

Few markets are as widely misunderstood and subject to so many misconceptions as gold .
Many of those misconceptions stem from gold 's dual role as a commodity and money .
This post will attempt to clear up some of those misconception with a few facts .
Let 's start with one key fact .
Gold is Money
How can I actually claim that ' gold is money ' ?
After all , it is not used as official money anywhere and barring isolated instances of payments made from a digital gold account , it is unlikely that one will ever make a payment in gold these days .
In addition , central banks seem intent on ' demonetizing ' gold , as the biggest CB holders of gold ( except the US ) continue to unload it , ostensibly to earn the higher returns provided by bonds .
Selling gold for returns is actually a spurious argument , because reserves are just that : reserves .
And the primary purpose of reserves is not to produce a return .
In spite of all this , we still know that gold is money , because it trades in the market as if it were money .
Let 's see if we can prove that thesis .
Gold Supply and Demand
If gold 's price were determined by fabrication demand alone ( jewelry and industrial uses ) , it could not possibly trade at a price of $ 650 oz .
Many gold analysts , from the mainstream to fringe groups such as the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ( GATA ) claim that they can predict what the gold price will do by adding up annual fabrication and investment demand ( as well as dehedging demand by miners ) and contrasting the resulting total with annual supply ( mine supply , central bank selling , disinvestment and scrap ) .
In short , they analyze the gold market in the same manner as they would analyze the copper market .
It should be immediately obvious that this can't be correct .
After all , nearly the entire gold ever mined ( approximately 150,000 - 160,000 tons ) is still here .
In short , the total potential supply of gold is some 97 - 98 % greater than the gold produced every year ( approximately 2,600 tons ) .
On that basis it makes no sense to apply traditional commodity supply / demand analysis based on annualized trends in the gold market .
Simply put , there is a big difference between commodities that are effectively used up ( aside from scrap residual returning to the market every year ) and a commodity the indestructibility and durability of which inter alia made gold the ' money commodity ' in the first place .
Jewelry Demand vs. Monetary Demand
One can further illustrate gold 's unique nature as money with a study of gold prices vs. jewelry demand .
If record fabrication demand for gold ( jewelry ) must be good for the price of gold , then a historic high in jewelry demand should in theory coincide with a high gold price .
However , record high jewelry demand in 1999 - 2000 in actual fact coincided with a 20 year bear market low in the gold price - the exact opposite of what traditional commodity supply / demand analysis would suggest .
We can therefore conclude that there must be a source of gold demand that is of far greater importance than the jewelry and industrial demand components , and that demand constitutes the true driver of the price of gold in terms of fiat money .
Indeed , there is .
This demand component is called ' monetary demand ' .
Monetary demand and the supply of gold is actually best described as the ' degree of reluctance of the current owners of gold to part with their gold at current prices ' since , as mentioned above , some 160,000 tons are owned by somebody already .
De facto gold acts in the markets as if it were another currency rather than a commodity .
It often keys off other currency cross rates , such as dollar / euro , and has a strong tendency to ignore all the typical supply / demand analysis thrown at it by the mainstream ( including the World Gold Council which should know better ) .
A rising gold price usually begets falling jewelry demand , which is exactly what the theory of price elasticity would suggest .
But at the same time , rising prices actually tend to stoke investment demand , just as a developing uptrend in the stock market tends to invite more demand rather than less as this chart , courtesy of Sharelynx Gold shows .
Click on the chart for a better presentation .
The above chart shows that the record high in jewelry demand coincided with the 20 - year bear market low in the gold price .
So what was driving the price of gold higher ?
We know it was monetary demand driving the price because the total fabrication demand for gold has been basically flat since 1999 .
Ironically enough , the chart also shows the price of gold was falling for over 20 years even as fabrication demand was rising .
This is further proof that fabrication demand is not the most important driver of the price of gold .
Finally , it should also be noted that some jewelry demand , especially in India , is in reality monetary demand in disguise .
The sin of attaching importance to jewellery demand in gold price forecasts is engaged in by all the major brokerage houses .
This leads even the best of money managers to making mistakes , as evidenced below :
Legendary value investor Jean - Marie Eveillard recently stated the following in a Fortune interview :
" When we started our gold fund in 1993 - which proved to be six or seven years too soon - I mistakenly thought that my downside was protected by the fact that jewelry demand was fairly vibrant .
But I was wrong .
I think gold moves up and down based on investment demand mostly . "
The WGC ( World Gold Council ) meanwhile tries to gauge ' implied investment demand ' respectively ' dehoarding ' retroactively , by adding up known new annual supply ( from mining , scrap , central bank selling and hedging ) and contrasting it with known annual fabrication demand .
The difference , it reckons , must represent ' implied investment demand ' ( presumably the demand from gold ETF ’s figures in these calculations as well these days ) .
However , as we noted , investment demand is also expressing itself by the reluctance of current gold holders to sell at a given price .
This reluctance can not be measured , and actual investment demand is therefore also not measurable .
Gold Mine Production vs. Total Demand
The above chart depicts another peculiarity of the gold market ’s supply / demand situation :
As the price of gold rises , mine production actually flattens out and falls .
There are two reasons for this unusual response to higher prices .
During low gold price environments , mines are forced to ‘ high grade ’ ( i.e. , mine higher grade portions of their orebodies ) .
Once the price rises , they shift their mining activities to lower grade portions of their orebodies , that have n’t been economic to mine previously .
During periods of low gold prices , exploration spending falls , so that once prices rise , very few new mines are set to open and take up the slack from depleted mines .
It can take up to 7 - 10 years from the discovery of an economic orebody to the point when mining can begin .
What motivates monetary demand for gold ?

Beaded Seat Covers Are Cheap , Keep You Cool
A few months ago in a post about A/C alternatives I promised you I ’d try some of the gadgets and get back to you .
Well , summer has finally hit and in between sweaty drives around town I ’ve been doing a little research .
Here ’s what I ’ve learned :
the A/C shirts , according to some cycling reviews I ’ve read , are kind of uncomfortable and do n’t last very long .
Coupled with the high price , I let this one pass ; this was the cheapest option , and therefore first on my list , stay tuned for more info ; seems like it would work better than # 1 , but again , cost is a factor .
I might give this a try later ; definitely still on the to do list , expect an update on this before I shell out for # 3 ; this is definitely next up with the beaded seats already taken of , when I return from HybridFest this is my next mod .
Before thinking about these tricks for alternative A/C , I ’d always thought those beaded seat covers were for weirdos .
Luckily , the other founder of EcoModder told me that they did a great job of keeping you cool in the summer .
I was a little skeptical , but when he showed me his beaded covers and I realized I could get a pair for just $ 26 dollars ( shipping included ) , I figured it was worth a try .
The Komfort Beads showed up on my doorstep the day after I ordered them , and I went right ahead and threw them on both my passenger and driver ’s seats .
It was n’t very hot outside , so I could n’t tell how they worked during short trips around town , but today they got their first real trial .
The Date
When I removed my A/C ( most of you will think I ’m a fool , but it never worked anyway ) , I decided that the ultimate replacement would be found when I could go to a date and take a date in my car without showing up a puddle of sweat or reducing her to one .
Today I got to put this to the test , as it was extremely sunny and blisteringly hot on the way to an engagement with a lady caller .
I wo n’t get into the date , but the beads were a success .
When I showed up I was a little toasty , but my back felt much nicer than usual and was n’t a pool of sweat .
The seat was still slightly uncomfortable , but it was definitely refreshing to have my back feeling good .
When she got into the car , she agreed .
I ’m sure she ’s used to A/C , but I did n’t hear any complaints about the heat .
The only negative seemed to be that the beads could tug at longer hair .
Success !
Yep , I ’m going to call it a success .
The beads do n’t put you in a 70 F paradise , but they greatly improve summer driving and reduce sweat .
Especially for just $ 26 for a pair , this was a great deal .
Does anyone have any other beaded seat cover brands they can recommend ?

Advertisement A three - legged dog with a passion for locomotives has become a regular attraction on board a steam train .
Despite losing a leg in a car accident Peggy the Jack Russell often walks six miles ( 9.7 km ) from her home in Rhewl , Denbighshire , to Berwyn station .
She joins tourists on the train and can ride up to seven - and - a - half miles ( 12 km ) of track through the Dee Valley .
Owner Dilys Lloyd regularly gets phone calls from the guards , asking her to collect Peggy from Llangollen station .
Mrs Lloyd , a retired teacher , said : " She loves going for a walk and appears fascinated by the trains , especially if she can have a free ride .
" I miss her and start calling out her name .
When she does n't come , I know she has gone again .
" She has probably followed walkers to the train station and got on board .
The next thing I get a call from the station .
She 's a little monkey ... I do n't know when she is going to go next
Dilys Lloyd , owner " Sometimes , if the walkers are doing a circular route , then she will arrive back with them . "
She added : " She 's a little monkey , she is honestly .
" Peggy is perfect in every other way .
" I do n't know when she is going to go next . "
Peggy was hit by a car as a pup and had a leg removed during surgery .
But Mrs Lloyd said she still loved to walk long distances .
Sometimes , she said Peggy jumped on the train at Berwyn station and got off at the next stop at Glyndyfrdwy .
But often , she rides all the way to Carrog before the train changes direction and returns to Llangollen .
The Llangollen Railway Society 's track is seven - and - a - half miles long and runs from Llangollen to Carrog .
The society wants to extend the track by about two - and - a - half miles ( four kilometres ) to Corwen .
The plans are due to be discussed at a public meeting in Corwen on Monday .

Boom : Apple Worth More Than Google
As Steve Jobs would say : “ BOOM . ” Apple ( AAPL ) has eclipsed Google ( GOOG ) in market value .
Apple ’s current market cap : $ 159.37 billion .
Google ’s : $ 157.56 billion .
Not that we did n’t see this coming .
Indeed , Valleywag predicted it back in November 2007 .
“ Apple knows how to design not just gadgets , but the businesses that go around them , ” the blog noted .
“ And as a result , we would n’t be surprised if Apple is worth more than Google within two years . ”
Make that two years or less .
I wonder if Michael Dell would shut Apple ( AAPL ) down and give the money back to its shareholders now ?
Meat 's Contribution to Global Warming ' The Cow Is a Climate Bomb '
Whether cattle are reared organically or with conventional farming methods , the end effect is bad for the environment , according to a new German consumer report .
The agricultural lobby , however , is preventing politicians from tackling this massive source of greenhouse gas emissions .

Artist Peter Coffin and lighting designers Cinimod Studio collaborated on a lighting display that involved flying a UFO over Gdansk in Poland earlier this month .
The performance was part of the Gdansk Festival of Stars .
The aluminium UFO structure used measured 7 metres across and was covered in 3000 individually controlled LEDs .
Controlled by a solid state computer and powered by an onboard generator , the LEDs displayed a series of changing patterns .
The UFO circled the city centre suspended from a helicopter on 4 July .
Watch a video of the performance here .

The following information is from Cinimod Studio :
--
" A UFO has been spotted over the historic town of Gdansk , Poland , on July 4 2008 .
The UFO flew in along the coast from the nearby town of Sopot , and then circled the centre of Gdansk .
The UFO made its startling and surprising appearance soon after sunset .
It appeared to be covered in lights displaying a series of geometric colour patterns . "
Cinimod Studio already has a reputation for creating innovative lighting and structural designs , but with the UFO project design director Dominic Harris has quite literally pushed the envelope and taken lighting design to new heights .
The photos and video links published here are record photograph of the preparation and the flights , and have not been modified beyond basic colour and exposure corrections .
" Untitled ( UFO ) " is an art project conceived by established New York artist Peter Coffin and created in collaboration with London - based Cinimod Studio .
Coffin had been wanting to create a public UFO flight performance for several years , but it was not until he met Harris that he had the confidence to proceed with making his vision a reality .
After an intense period of structural and electrical design , and fabrication , the UFO made its inaugural public appearance on 4th July 2008 as a part of the Gdansk Festival of Stars .
To realise the UFO , Cinimod Studio worked closely with a multitude of specialist suppliers , and monitored the progress via regular workshop visits .
A " transfer of technologies " saw electronic and mechanical designs developed for a standard application re-appropriated and modified for integration within the UFO project .
The overall UFO structure is 7 metres in diameter and manufactured of aluminium for lightness .
3000 bright and individually controllable Color Kinetics LED nodes have been arrayed across the structure and are controlled via a solid state computer .
An onboard 6 kw generator provides the system power , and the overall UFO can be remotely controllable via SMS messaging .
It is suspended from 8 points to a single 50 m strap line attached to the Mi2 helicopter above .

Artist Peter Coffin has created a truly phenomenal artwork which due to the scale , complexity and sheer audacity of the project , would not have been possible without the support of a number of key sponsors and suppliers .
Primary sponsorship came from Warsaw's Open Art Project and New York 's Art Production Fund .
The LED lighting was sponsored by Color Kinetics / Philips .
The overall physical and lighting design and coordination was by Cinimod Studio , with Mike Harrison of White Wing Logic providing the electrical systems design and on - site electrical engineering .
A special thank you is also extended to LiteStructures , Architainment , Pharos Controls , Harrington Generators , the Gdansk Shipyard , the festival organisers , and the incredible mountain - rescue pilots responsible for the safe take - off and landing of the UFO !

ATLANTA  A county school system in metropolitan Atlanta on Thursday became the nation ’s first in nearly 40 years to lose its accreditation , and the governor removed four of its school board members for ethics violations .
The school system in Clayton County , just south of the Atlanta city limits , was ruled unfit for accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools , one of the nation ’s six major private accrediting agencies , after school board members failed to meet the group ’s standards for leading a school system .
An investigation by the agency found that county officials had not made sufficient progress toward establishing an effective school board , removing the influence of outside individuals on board decisions , enforcing an ethics policy or meeting other requirements for accreditation , Mark A. Elgart , the chief executive of the association , announced Thursday at a news conference .
County officials said they were planning to appeal the decision .
The loss of accreditation could impair the ability of Clayton County students to attend some colleges and earn scholarships .
It could also prevent teachers from receiving benefits if they change school systems , and could mean a loss of money for pre-kindergarten education .
Russia escalated its assault on Sunday despite strong diplomatic warnings from Mr. Bush and European leaders , underscoring the limits of Western influence over Russia at a time when the rest of Europe depends heavily on Russia for natural gas and the United States needs Moscow ’s cooperation if it hopes to curtail what it believes is a nuclear weapons threat from Iran .
President Bush , in Beijing for the Olympics , strongly criticized the Russian attacks , especially those outside South Ossetia , and urged an immediate cease - fire .
In an interview on NBC on Monday morning , he said he had been “ very firm ” with both Russia ’s prime minister , Vladimir V. Putin , and its president , Dmitri Medvedev .
Earlier , Vice President Dick Cheney expressed a strong warning for Russia .
In a telephone conversation with the Georgian president , he said “ that Russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States , as well as the broader international community , ” a spokeswoman , Lea Anne McBride , said in a statement released by the White House .
Russian officials say Georgia provoked the assault by attacking South Ossetia last week , causing heavy civilian casualties .
But Western diplomats and military officials said they worried that Russia ’s decision to extend the fighting and open a second front in Abkhazia indicated that it had sought to use a relatively low - level conflict in a conflict - prone part of the Caucasus region to extend its influence over a much broader area .
On Sunday , Russian artillery shells slammed the city of Gori , a major military installation and transportation hub in Georgia .
In the separatist region of Abkhazia , Russian paratroopers and their Abkhaz allies battled Georgian special forces and tried to cross the boundary into undisputed Georgian territory , Georgian officials said .
Russia dropped a bomb on Tbilisi ’s international airport shortly before Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner of France , who was sent by the European Union to try to mediate , was due to land , Georgian officials said .
It twice bombed an aviation factory on the outskirts of the capital .
Russia ’s Black Sea Fleet patrolled the coast of Abkhazia , and its Defense Ministry said Russian warships had sunk a Georgian gunboat that fired on them .
The 1920s satnav ... and other weird and wonderful gadgets that never quite took off
It was the invention of the future - a tiny machine complete with its own map that would tell motorists which way to go .
But this was no satnav - after all , the communications satellites that help modern cars locate themselves were still decades away .
Instead , the route - finder for the well - equipped 1920s driver was a wristwatch - style device equipped with minuscule maps .
Lost in time :
The 1920s route - finder that never took off
Miniature scrolls bearing the directions were loaded onto the watch and revolved as the wearer continued his journey .
The 1920s TomTom never took off - perhaps because there were too few motorists to buy them .
It is one of the labour and face - saving devices to go on display from a private collection of weird and wonderful gadgets from the past .
Maurice Collins , a retired businessman from Muswell Hill , London , has cherry - picked 50 must - have items from his collection of 1,400 historic gadgets to show off at the British Library Business and Intellectual Property Centre .
Mr Morris said his collection was a celebration of ' ingenious products that attempted to solve human difficulty ' .
Other crazy Heath Robinson contraptions in the show include ...
BURGLAR ALARM
The clockwork mechanism on this 1870s burglar alarm was wound up and the upright lever set , before the device was placed at the foot of a door and a spike pushed into the floor .
If an intruder tried to enter , the lever would be pushed down and set off the surprisingly loud and effective bell .
PISTOL PURSE
Highwaymen were a real danger in the late 19th century and this cunning design might just have saved your honour , property and even life .
A dainty weapon was concealed in a secret compartment of this seemingly normal ladies ' purse .
The barrel could hold only one bullet - so you had to make your shot count .
ELECTRO MASSAGER
During the 1930s , body massage was not seen as a luxury or part of being pampered but was , correctly , regarded as important for maintaining healthy skin and good circulation .
However this functional - looking dynamo massager appears neither pleasurable nor safety conscious , as it gave tiny electric shocks to the user .
TOE SOCKS
These pre-shrunk ' To Sox ' were designed to act as toe protectors .
Produced during World War II , it was claimed that they could reduce hosiery costs by up to 80 per cent .
They were designed to be worn over the big toes , to protect socks from wear .
THE ENVELOPE SEALER
This invention , by Reynolds of Chicago , was a byword for gravitas and efficiency .
When the lever is cranked , a roller forces an open envelope to undergo a dampening process , before a second roller presses it closed .
PEEP SHOW
Hand - cranked
' What the butler saw ' machines were a staple of British amusement arcades for much of the 20th century .
Some featured supposedly erotic slideshows - like this one , pictured above left , - while others offered comedies and dramas .
All were available for a penny and were seen through a metal socket on the screen .
CIGARETTE HOLDER
This double holder , pictured above right , is thought to have been inspired by a fictional cigarette case belonging to Bulldog Drummond - hero of Sapper 's bestselling crime novels of the day - which ' held Turkish on one side and Virginian on the other ' .
LIGHT SPECTACLES
Invented in the U.S. in the 1930s , these specs were adorned with two small , battery - powered lights , with a long wire trailing beneath .
The experience was marred only by the likelihood of electrocution when it rained .
EYE MASSAGER
Apparently it was not enough to have
a gadget for massaging the body .
By the 1920s , it was also deemed necessary to devise a mechanism
to massage the eyeballs .
This convoluted gadget was
pressed to the face .
The user would then operate the small lever to compress the rubber bellows which would in turn emit cool puffs of air directly onto the eyeballs .
MOUSTACHE PROTECTOR
Having a bushy moustache has always been something of an obstacle to refined dining - particularly when it came to mulligatawny soup .
The answer was to use a moustache protector , spoon or cup - designed with a hole for the mustachioed man to sip through .
FOOD PROCESSOR
The modern food processor is something we take for granted - just fill the bowl and push the switch .
More satisfying - and quieter - was this Victorian food chopper .
Turning the handle pushes the cutting arm up and down and rotates the bowl at the same time .
FINGER STRETCHER FOR PIANISTS
Developed in America in 1910 to help pianists hit the sprawling notes demanded by the likes of Stravinsky and Debussy .
Careful use was required : it is thought the composer Schumann destroyed his hands using an early version .
PAGE TURNER
Designed for musicians this dates from 1905 .
Sheet music could be prepared for turning by fixing the top of each metal rod on to the desired page .
When ready , a catch was pulled free and the page flipped over .
CLOCKWORK TEASMADE
Patented in Birmingham in 1902 , this brass and copper tea maker was the first Teasmade .
The alarm clock triggered a switch and a match was then struck against moving sandpaper , lighting the spirit stove under the kettle .
Once the water boiled , the steam pressure lifted a hinged flap and the kettle would tilt , filling the teapot beneath .
Finally , a plate would swing over the stove , extinguishing its flames .
AN EARLY LAVATORY
In the 19th century , the cost of using a public convenience , such as this , was one penny - hence the phrase ' to spend a penny ' .
This decorative 1870s water closet was manufactured by Mr Jennings - a plumber who made his name installing such WCs at the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851 .
Fox cuts off 12 - year - old relating Georgian violence Diane Sweet

This A 12 - year - old American girl and her aunt found themselves in the middle of a bombing in Georgia this week while on a vacation to visit family members .
An ABC news affiliate reported , " Amanda Kokoeva likes to swim and hang out with friends in Walnut Creek , but what she went through just five days ago in South Ossetia shocked her and shook the world . "
" On the 7th , we were in a cafe and then all of a sudden we heard a bunch of bombs going off and explosions and we got scared , " Kokoeva said .
The ABC report continued , " Amanda was at the end of a month and a half long visit with relatives in South Ossetia when a battle broke out between Russia and Georgia .
The fighting forced her to spend the night in her uncle 's basement . "
" Through all this there 's explosions everywhere .
It was really scary because I had never really heard these kinds of sounds in my life so loud and the whole sky would light up all the time , " said Amanda .
ABC 's report added , " Her uncle survived , but thousands of others did not .
Laura says she was thankful the Russian troops were there to protect the Ossetians . "
During an interview on Fox News they were describing how Russian soldiers saved them from the Georgian attack , and helped them get to an airport in Moscow where they were able to fly back home , but the Fox news host abruptly cut them off after just two minutes of recounting the events to go to a commercial break .
As they are being cut off , Amanda 's aunt says , " Yes , I know you do not want to hear this . "
After returning from the commercial break , the Fox reporter gives Amanda 's aunt just 30 seconds to speak before saying " As we all know , there are always gray areas in war . "

The July NPD sales numbers have been released , and as always , Nintendo dominates in every way , while Microsoft and Sony battle it out for a distant second place .
The industry continues to see large growth year over year , with a 35 percent jump in sales for the year to date , and an impressive 48 percent jump in software sales alone .
With the large difference between the sales of Nintendo 's hardware and software and its two main competitors , one could easily make an argument that Nintendo is to be thanked for much of that growth .
Nintendo
The Nintendo Wii sold 555,000 units in July , while the Nintendo DS sold 608,400 units .
While this may look like a dip from last month due to the number of weeks in July , it 's still much higher than anyone else on the charts .
Games for Nintendo's platforms also make up five of the top ten slots in the software sales , with Wii Fit taking the number two slot with 369,600 units sold , Guitar Hero : On Tour taking the number three slot with 309,700 units sold , Wii Play coming in at number four with the 284,000 units sold , Mario Kart Wii taking the seventh place with 174,500 units sold , and Rock Band for the Wii coming in at number eight with 165,800 .
Nintendo properties continue to sell amazingly well , and the Wii version of Rock Band is the only version on the charts this month .
It might be a hacked down port , but the market sure does n't seem to care .
With Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero : World
Tour on the way , we 'll see how much longevity the first Rock Band finds on the charts .
Data source : NPD Group
Sony
Sony took the number three slot in hardware sales , with the PlayStation 3 selling 224,900 units and the PlayStation Portable coming in fourth with 221,700 units .
Metal Gear Solid 4 did n't seem to have the staying power that we expected ; it 's nowhere on the top ten software sales , although the PS3 version of NCAA Football 2009 came in at number five with 242,500 units sold .
PlayStation owners still love their sports games , and the system is starting to have a large enough installed base to put these games on the charts .
Likewise , the PS3 version of Soul Calibur IV came in at number nine , selling 155,800 .
With Home and LittleBigPlanet on the way , as well as a standard $ 400 80 GB system announced at E3 , the PlayStation 3 looks to have a bright future .
To begin to chip away at Microsoft 's lead in lifetime sales , though , we 're going to have to see some much larger gains .
Microsoft
Microsoft is n't doing poorly , but the company sure does n't have much to brag about this month .
The 360 sold 204,800 units , outselling only the PS2 with its 155,500 in sales .
As usual , the number one slot in software sales belongs to a 360 game , as NCAA Football 2009 sold 397,000 units .
In the number six slot we have Soul Calibur IV with 218,900 units sold , and number 10 is Sid Meier 's Civilization Revolution , a rather surprising seller with 147,600 units moved .
Microsoft needs to do something to get its momentum back ; the days when the company could rest on its higher installed base and Sony 's floundering are long over .
There are n't many surprises on this month 's charts , although the fact that Metal Gear Solid 4 did n't chart at all is a little unsettling .
Of course , for all we know , the game is still selling very well , just not quite enough to make it onto the top ten list .
The fact that Sony was able to chart two multiplatform games speaks well to its installed base , however , although Sony will have to deal with the upcoming rumored 360 price drop in the next few months .

Nintendo , as per the usual , has nothing to worry about except the online grumblings of hardcore gamers .
I will never understand why some religious groups keep whining about the most inane sexual things , from Susan Storm 's bra size to Princess Peach 's underpants , but the last protest by religious group " Focus On The Family " - urging people to bully American Airlines for their in - flight unfiltered wireless internet access - makes me want to start slapping them right , left and center .
Apparently , " Focus On The Family " is imagining row after row of seat screens full of all kinds of human , animal , and mini -fig genitalia .
Their senior analyst for media and sexuality - take that Dr. Ruth - David Weiss had this very stupid thing to say :
" Because this nation has not been serious about vigorously attacking pornography , some believe it is appropriate to view in public .
Not only will the flight attendants be placed in a situation that could be considered sexual harassment , passengers who openly view porn where children can see it may be violating federal harmful - to - minor laws . "

First , you do n't need the internet to watch porn in your portable device .
Then , fortunately , most of this nation is not stupid .
In " this nation , " and any other nation , individuals know how to behave in public and , if they do n't , they would get their ass kicked by the crew or other passengers .
Just like I can watch porn on my iPhone or laptop in any public place across the country but I do n't because it 's just wrong , the same will apply here , Mr. David Weiss .
American Airlines says they will not change their policy of unfiltered internet access , because that will jeopardize the access to legitimate web sites , leaving it to flight attendants to handle any possible problem , as it should be .
And that 's good .
I 'll keep flying them , but not for the porn .
OK , for the porn too .

The 15 economies of the eurozone contracted by 0.2 % between April and June , heightening fears that the euro area is sliding towards recession .
The eurozone 's first decline since it was created in 1999 was driven by a slowdown in exports and consumer spending .
The German economy , Europe 's largest , shrank by 0.5 % in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter .
And in both France and Italy GDP shrank by 0.3 % in the second quarter .
The slowdown was less pronounced in the wider European community of 27 nations including the UK , which contracted by 0.1 % .
The possibility that the European Central Bank is cutting interest rates in 2008 to support the sickening economy is remote
Economist Jörg Radeke
BBC economics editor Hugh Pym on the impact on the UK However Estonia , where the economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter , is now considered to be in recession .
Ireland , whose economy contracted in the first quarter of the year , has not yet released its second quarter growth figures .
Compared to the second quarter of 2007 , the eurozone economies grew by 1.5 % and the 27 European Union countries grew by 1.7 % .
The news weakened the euro , which was already well down from its recent highs against the dollar .
But high eurozone inflation , which was unchanged on the month , made it unlikely that the European Central Bank , which raised interest rates last month , will reverse its stance .
' Deterioration '
The figures reflect the way in which exporters have been affected by the strength of the euro , which makes their products more expensive overseas , and a more general slowdown in global demand .
French finance minister Christine Lagarde , said the decline in the French economy in the second quarter " mostly reflects the deterioration of our international context , which particularly weighed on our exports and which is common to all European countries " .
" The fundamentals of the French economy are healthy , " she added .
Meanwhile a German finance minister said its economy could contract again in the next quarter which would mean Germany was officially in recession .
" At the moment that can not be ruled out , " said deputy economy minister Walther Otremba .
' Orders down '
Germany was once seen as the main driver of growth in the eurozone .
HAVE YOUR SAY
In simple terms it will lead to more unemployment - as order books fail to fill up John Ford , Exeter However exporting companies , such as Berlin - based manufacturer Witels Albert , are cutting back after seeing orders decline in the last few months , especially from the US .
" There is a slowdown in the industry and one of the main reason is the rise in oil price , " chief executive Horst Schneidersreit , told BBC News .
" We have seen this in our own company .
Our orders have slowed down . "
Despite the sharp slowdown in the second quarter in Germany , the government said it still expected GDP growth of 1.7 % this year .
Spain was the only one of the major eurozone economies to see its economy expand between April and June .
It grew by 0.1 % compared with the previous quarter .
Inflation steady Figures also released on Thursday showed that prices across the euro area rose by 4 % in July compared to a year earlier .
The European Central Bank increased interest rates in July by 025 % to 4.25 % in a bid to combat rising prices .
The July figure is the same as June 's inflation rate , but although the rate of increase is not quickening , economists said rising prices were still a concern .
" Although inflation has been stable at 4.0 % in July , it is still way above target , " said Jörg Radeke from the Centre for Economics and Business Research .
" Hence , the possibility that the European Central Bank is cutting interest rates in 2008 to support the sickening economy is remote . "

What are these ?
Why Is the Dollar Losing Value ?
A closer look at the dollar and the euro and how the dollar 's drop affects you .
Sept. 20 , 2007  --
The Canadian dollar has reached parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time since 1976 .
They are now equal in value .
The euro also soared to its highest - ever level against the dollar , trading above $ 1.40 for the first time since the currency was introduced in 1999 .
So why is the dollar plunging , and what impact does that plunge have on U.S. and world markets ?
Here 's a look at some of the reasons for the dollar 's fall , and the consequences
Why the Weak Dollar ?
There are several reasons .
First , there 's the difference between the interest rate in the United States -- the one the Federal Reserve just dropped by half a percentage point to 4.75 percent -- and the interest rates of other central banks around the world .
When the United States dropped its rate , other banks did not follow .
Now the spread between the interest rate at the European Central Bank ( home of the euro ) and the Federal Reserve ( home of the dollar ) is smaller than it has traditionally been , and that has weakened the value of the dollar against the euro .
Put another way , you would get a better interest rate return holding a euro than a dollar .
Second , central banks around the world have been diversifying their holdings away from dollars to euros , British pounds and so on .
That means there are more dollars out there in currency markets available to purchase .
More dollars floating around means diminished value .
What Effect Does This Have ?
Look at the record - high price of oil .
Even if the same amount of oil is being pumped out of the ground , since it is traded in dollars and the dollar has weakened , the price of oil has increased to make up for the lost value of the dollar , creating a sort of vicious cycle .
Oil - producing countries do n't want to keep all the dollars they are getting for their oil , since it 's worth less , so they are diversifying and converting their dollars into euros or other currencies .
That pushes more dollars back out into currency markets , which in turn pushes down the dollar 's value .
One analyst told ABC News that Russia used to have 90 percent of its financial reserves in dollars .
It now has 45 percent in dollars , 45 percent in euros and 10 percent in British pounds .
What Does This Mean in the U.S. ?
The news is mixed .
It 's good , because it makes what we produce here cheaper to sell in foreign markets , and that in turn spurs exports of our products around the world .
That translates into more manufacturing and more jobs .
For example , BMW and Mercedes Benz want to build cars in the United States , because they can do it cheaper in nonunion states than in Germany , where they 'd pay labor and parts in euros , and then bring the cars to the United States , where they would be too expensive to sell at a profit .
But a weak dollar is bad , because it leads to inflation in this country .
Imports from foreign countries will become more expensive , and in particular , oil will be more expensive .
That puts pressure on businesses to increase prices for anything that uses oil or products that come from overseas .
One benefit for American shoppers is that China has largely pegged its currency to ours , so that keeps the price of Chinese - made goods low and therefore , keeps a check on inflation .
U.S. Treasuries , Bonds , Mortgages , Stocks
What does a weak dollar mean for all that , and why should I care ?
If the dollar falls too much , foreign investors and banks wo n't be so interested in buying T - bills and bonds that keep the U.S. government and businesses humming .
That 's because the interest rate might not be enough to compensate for inflation .
In other words , whatever is earned would be worth less money .
To attract buyers , the T - bills and bonds will sell for less and have higher interest rates .
And since many mortgages are tied to these interest rates , that might mean mortgage rates wo n't drop anytime soon .
Also , a weak dollar might scare away foreign investors who do n't want to own stock in U.S. companies .
What About Foreign Investors ?
Could there be a wholesale dumping of U.S. dollars by foreign governments and investors ?
Maybe .
But that would be executing a sort of " nuclear option . "
If China were to dump its reserves of dollars into currency markets , that would dramatically lower the value of the dollar .
All those bonds and T - bills that the country holds would drop in value , as inflation would erase any gains from the investment .
China would be less able to sell its goods to the United States because the dollar would be too weak , and Chinese products would be more expensive .
If Saudi Arabia were to call for oil to be traded in euros , " that announcement would be the end of the U.S. dollar , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief currency analyst at CMC Markets .
But he said that would never happen as long as the United States and Saudi Arabia are allies , and the U.S. continues to negotiate arms and other deals with the world 's largest oil producer .
These Harvard business gurus will ruin us all
' If you can't explain it to your mother , you do n't understand what you 're talking about . '
That was one of my Harvard professor 's top rules of finance - and one our beleaguered captains of industry would do well to follow .
Perhaps if a sensible fiftysomething mother presided over the City or Wall Street , she might have been able to stop the madness currently gripping our financial markets .
Earlier this month , the Royal Bank of Scotland announced the second largest quarterly loss ever for a British bank : £ 691 million .
On Wall Street , Merrill Lynch has written off billions of pounds of assets - and yet its chief executive , Stan O'Neill , who led the bank into its present inferno , left with an £ 80 million retirement package .
Wall Street 's HBS - educated powers are growing ever more cynical
O'Neill is an MBA - he has a master 's degree in business administration - from Harvard Business School ( HBS ) .
So , too , is his successor , John Thain .
HBS is arguably the world 's most influential graduate institution .
Its alumni include George W. Bush , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , not to mention dozens of chief executives of international companies .
HBS graduates also dominate the newer industries of private equity and hedge funds .
Harvard MBAs , and MBAs in general , decide how we work , how much we earn , even how much holiday we have .
I gained a sobering insight into the high - achieving world of finance while studying at HBS from 2004 until 2006 .
My fellow students were a ferociously talented bunch who referred to themselves as ' insecure overachievers ' .
Even by their late 20s , their CVs were a glittering list of academic and professional achievements .
Yet their greatest fear was not living up to their potential .
A classmate called HBS a ' factory for unhappy people ' .
They were graduating racked with fear of not becoming wealthy or powerful , or of seeing their personal lives wrecked by work .
At Harvard , I had expected an education in business basics .
What I got was something more akin to a two - year session on the capitalists ' career couch , surrounded by 900 classmates .
Masters of the universe : George Bush and his US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are both Harvard Business School graduates
My peers divided into two groups .
The first was made up of ' finance motorheads ' , the ones who had come from Wall Street , were going straight back and wanted lots of money .
For them , classes came second to parties , holidays and drinking .
I noticed some of them had expensive cars .
When I asked about it , I was told that they emptied their accounts by buying a $ 20,000 car so they could qualify for grants - of about $ 20,000 .
Cars did n't have to be declared on their financial aid forms , so HBS was basically buying them BMWs .
The second group of students included the ' ethical jihadists ' , the pious types who acted as though business was free of the trickery and cruelty that has defined it throughout history .
They talked about ' corporate social responsibility ' as if it was something for which we should be grateful .
Of course , such high - minded morals rarely exist .
In fact , two sets of economic laws now apply : one for the MBA elite and one for everyone else .
For instance , the elite use bogus arguments to justify their vast incomes .
It 's a competitive market for executives , they say , so you have to pay for the best .
Nonsense .
No one begrudges great entrepreneurs their wealth , but paying millions to a mediocre careerist to lead his company to near oblivion ?
It does n't make sense .
One of the main reasons Britain and America are in an economic mess is because business has driven a wedge between itself and the rest of society .
Businessmen talk of ' leverage ' when they mean debt and ' outsourcing ' when they mean cutting jobs at home .
They talk of ' off - sites ' when they mean executives loafing around a hotel supposedly coming up with ideas .
Even at HBS students talked about ' takeaways ' rather than lessons , ' going forward ' instead of the future , and ' consensus building ' rather than agreeing .
When talking during a lesson about a company having to make more greetings cards , a fellow student actually said : ' We need to do a deep dive on production to improve our metrics . '
Management consultants and bankers have forgotten how to talk in paragraphs but communicate in bullet points and PowerPoint presentations .
If you can make business seem like voodoo , you can charge more for helping people to understand it .
Except it is n't voodoo .
Business is just not that complicated .
How can you take a mortgage , sell it in ten pieces and then keep on selling it and borrowing against it ?
How can it make sense to lend to people who do n't even have a payslip ?
These are not difficult questions .
Yet none of the geniuses who run the financial universe seems to have asked them before the credit crunch hit us all .
The truth is that the further the business world drifts from normality , the more cynical it becomes .
I 've lost count of the number of management consultants who have told me their work is bogus .
Or the bankers who say their job is not to help clients , but win big fees by forcing them into a deal .
All too often , these people are MBAs - and the consequences of having these insecure overachievers running our economies are becoming more pronounced every day .

A steep decline in the stock price of General Growth Properties Inc. prompted a top executive of the company to sell half of his common shares this week to cover a margin call .
Bob Michaels , General Growth 's president and chief operating officer , sold 700,000 shares Tuesday at an average price of $ 27.13 , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The sale left Mr. Michaels with 690,507 common shares in General Growth , which develops and owns shopping malls .
Mr. Michaels , who joined the Chicago - based company in 1972 , serves on the board in addition to his executive post .
General Growth owns more than 200 U.S. malls .
General Growth 's stock has fallen nearly 50 % from its year - ago level primarily because of investors ' concerns about the weakening U.S. retail environment and General Growth's $ 18.4 billion in debt coming due in the next 3 ½ years .
Howie Klein Has Had Enough of the Party 's ' Democrats in Name Only ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon
8/12/2008 , 1:44 pm PT
Apropos of our article on Friday describing the " Rovian dirty tricks " that FL - 24 Congressional candidate , Clint Curtis , alleges his primary opponent , former State Rep.
Suzanne Kosmas , has been using to mislead local voters an article in today 's DeLand - Deltona Beacon highlights again Curtis ' criticism of his opponent as no more than a Democrat In Name Only ( DINO ) .
Curtis called Kosmas a " conservative blue - dog Democrat . "
He said " She could change her name to Republican and never have to change a vote . "
Kosmas , in return , might ask , " Curtis who ? "
She said she does n't know Curtis .
" I am running as a Democrat , " Kosmas said .
" Running as a Democrat . "
A telling phrase , that .
While Kosmas claims to be against the war , it turns out she co-sponsored a resolution , adopted on March 21 , 2003 , while in the Florida legislature that pledged " support of President Bush in his stand against Saddam Hussein " .
Unfortunately , Kosmas is n't the only hand - picked Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) candidate being put up this year almost solely on the basis of the DCCC 's short - sighted conjecture that they can win in a previously " red " district because the candidate either has lots of their own money , or is damned - near a Republican .
Curtis , the Progressive Democrats of America ( PDA ) - endorsed candidate , has been courageously opposing head - on the hopelessly corrupt Republican incumbent Tom Feeney for years .
( See this clip from Uncounted to get an idea , or this BRAD BLOG Special Coverage page . )
Yet , he 's been fighting an uphill battle trying to raise money to defeat the DCCC 's candidate , the wealthy real estate developer , Kosmas , ever since he told them he'd vote with his constituents who put him in office , rather than as per the directives of Nancy Pelosi .
Yesterday , our buddy Howie Klein - who knows more about on - the - ground politics and the real positions of Congressional candidates than anyone we know --- decimated the DCCC for their drive to put " Democrats " in office , at any cost .
The " Stalinist " effort , as he describes it , to put such candidates as Kosmas in office ( whether or not they end up voting with Republicans more often than Democrats ! ) has been the basis of the DCCC's " Red to Blue " program launched under the previous DCCC chair Rep.
Rahm Emanuel and still in play under its new chair , Chris Van Hollen ....
The latter , Klein writes , promised " in accord with democratic norms and Party rules --- to allow hotly contested primaries to play themselves out and not take sides the way Emanuel had done ... Van Hollen promised to not follow the Stalinist path Emanuel had lain out .
But he has . "
In his piece he describes Kosmas as a " DCCC shill " and " just some rich person who promises to be easily led around by the nose , " while Curtis is the grassroots candidate who ought to be supported .
" Savvy activists learned long ago that the DCCC is entirely untrustworthy , " Klein writes , " and that many of their hand - picked candidates are the mirror image of brainwashed or brain - dead Republican rubber stamps . "
His entire article is a worth a read , if only to see where your local candidate fits in , and if they have a more Progressive , if less - monied , candidate running against them who may need your support .
But his slams of the DCCC are a must read .
Here 's a few choice quotes :
...
Although they try keeping it on the down low , several on the Red to Blue list are pro-war and some are corporate - leaning shills .
It 's never about Democratic ideal , values , principles ... it 's always getting as many members willing to call themselves " Democrats , " for whatever reason , into Congress .
That 's how Democrats wind up in the majority in the House and can't get anything accomplished .
Last year many of the Red to Blue candidates got into Congress and immediately started voting like Republicans -- but just on crucial issues like the war in Iraq , warrantless wiretaps , immigration reform , trade policies ...... Although they try keeping it on the down low , several on the Red to Blue list are pro-war and some are corporate - leaning shills .
It 's never about Democratic ideal , values , principles ... it 's always getting as many members willing to call themselves " Democrats , " for whatever reason , into Congress .
That 's how Democrats wind up in the majority in the House and can't get anything accomplished .
There were 17 Democrats who voted more frequently with Republicans than with Democrats on the key substantive issues that divide the two parties .
Of the 17 , nine are freshmen .
...
Last year if you donated to the DCCC's Red to Blue program , you helped elect people who are determined to keep the war in Iraq going , who voted to allow warrantless wiretaps , and who were willing to rubber stamp Bush trade policies that throw American workers out of their jobs ... and who actually applaud Nancy Pelosi 's decision to take impeachment off the table .
In fact , they are a big part of the reason why Nancy Pelosi did take impeachment off the table .

PRINCETON , N.J. ( MarketWatch ) --
Low - income and middle - income households are dealing with higher energy bills in similar fashion these days -- lowering the thermostat , eating out less , buying cheaper versions of products they need , spending less on clothes and medicine , and even changing their plans for education .
Fuel - oil prices have increased more than 40 % in the past year and gasoline prices increased by over a third , leaving many low - and middle - income households struggling to pay their energy bills , according to a new survey by the National Energy Assistance Director 's Association released Wednesday .
A majority of households surveyed ( 57 % ) said energy bills are higher today than they were a year ago .
While the impacts of steadily increasing energy costs are being felt hardest by low - income families -- a family of four making less than $ 33,300 a year -- plenty of families making between $ 33,300 and $ 77,000 say they are feeling the pinch and changing what they buy and how they heat and cool their homes .
More lower - income households reported that their energy bills had increased ( 63 % ) than any other economic group .
Roughly 60 % of low - income households , 49 % of moderate - income households , and 42 % of middle - income households said it is more difficult for them to pay these bills this year , according to the study .
Gasoline prices hit household budgets the hardest , according to the study .
Nearly three - quarters of low - income , 70 % of moderate - income , and 61 % of middle - income respondents said that increased gasoline costs had a large impact on their budgets .
The two biggest cutbacks across all households are scaled - back purchases of basic household necessities ( 43 % ) and smaller food bills ( 43 % ) .
As prices at the pump continue to climb , at least 65 % of respondents of all income groups said they are driving less , while low - income households reported they are much more likely to use public transportation and ride - sharing more .
Low - income households are making sacrifices elsewhere to counter increased home energy and gasoline costs including fewer food purchases ( 70 % ) , not buying medicine ( 31 % ) , and altering plans for their education or their children 's education ( 19 % ) .
Higher wage - earning families are less likely to report financial strain from higher energy bills .
But a quarter of families making between $ 55,000 and $ 77,700 said it was more difficult to pay their energy bills this year and 65 % of high - income households reported driving less .
Conservation measures
Higher prices are causing households across the economic spectrum to reduce energy consumption .
Families reported closing off parts of their home because they can not afford to heat or cool the space , setting the thermostat at far cooler or warmer settings than is comfortable , and going out to spend time in warmer places .
High - income households were much less likely to report that they made these kinds of sacrifices , the survey found .
Ten percent of the people surveyed said they took on an additional job and more than half said that they reduced the amount they put into savings .
Yet despite taking these actions some , 14 % of households reported that they were behind on paying their energy bills .
Eight percent of low - income and 8 % of moderate - income households said they had had their electricity shut off , while 12 % of low - income and 4 % of moderate - income households said they had their natural gas shut off .
Sales of more efficient energy systems and appliances are getting a boost from higher energy prices , according to survey respondents .
The purchase of a more efficient air conditioner was reported by 15 % , followed by 14 % that said they bought a more efficient heating system , and 28 % that reported they bought a more efficient appliance .
These appliances typically use less energy and water .
More than two - thirds of all households surveyed said they had purchased compact florescent light bulbs .
Consumers are expected to see even higher electricity and gasoline bills in the coming months , the Energy Department said this week in its Short Term Energy Outlook .
Average residential electricity prices are expected to climb 3.7 % this year and another 3.6 % in 2009 .
Some utility companies in North Carolina , New Jersey and Ohio have already filed for rate increases .
Gasoline prices are also expected hit a monthly average peak price of $ 4.15 per gallon in August , the agency said .
Higher prices are likely to mean even further cuts in family budgets .

New research shows that magpies can recognise themselves – the first time this has been shown in non-mammals .
Magpies with coloured stickers recognise themselves in the mirror ( Credit : Helmut Prior , Goethe University )
Self - recognition , once thought to be an ability enjoyed only by select primates , has now been demonstrated in a bird .
The finding has raised questions about part of the brain called the neocortex , something the self - aware magpie does not even possess .
In humans , the ability to recognise oneself in a mirror develops around the age of 18 months and coincides with the first signs of social behaviour .
So - called “ mirror mark tests ” , where a mark is placed on the animal in such a way that it can only be observed when it looks at its reflection , have been used to sort the self - aware beasts from the rest .

Of hundreds tested , in addition to humans , only four apes , bottlenose dolphins and Asian elephants have passed muster .
Helmut Prior at Goethe University in Frankfurt and his colleagues applied a red , yellow or black spot to a place on the necks of five magpies .
The stickers could only be seen using a mirror .
Then he gave the birds mirrors .
Catch a glimpse
The feel of the mark on their necks did not seem to alarm them .
But when the birds with coloured neck spots caught a glimpse of themselves , they scratched at their necks – a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own .
Those who received a black sticker , invisible against the black neck feathers , did not react .
Self - recognition was thought to reside in the neocortex , but birds do n’t have one .
Franz de Waal at Emory University in Atlanta points out that the magpie does nevertheless have a big brain .
“ You need a large brain with a lot of connectivity , ” he says .
“ If it had been a sparrow , it would have been a problem . ”
The authors suggest that self - recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of convergent evolution , where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits , although they arrive at them via different routes .
De Waal agrees : “ Magpies are known for their ability to steal shiny objects and to hide away their loot .
It ’s not too far - fetched that a master thief like a magpie has that perspective - taking ability , ” he says , referring to the idea that the birds have a “ theory of mind “ .

Ten years ago around this very time — April through June 2008 — our intrepid Microsoft guru Peter Bright evidently had an identity crisis .
Could this lifelong PC user really have been pushed to the brink ?
Was he considering a switch to ... Mac OS ?!?
While our staff hopefully enjoys a less stressful Memorial Day this year , throughout the weekend we 're resurfacing this three part series that doubles as an existential operating system dilemma circa 2008 .
Part two ran on May 4 , 2008 , and it appears unedited below .
Last time , I described how Apple turned its failure to develop a modern OS into a great success .
The purchase of NeXT gave Apple a buzzword - compliant OS with a healthy ecosystem of high - quality third - party applications .
Meanwhile , Microsoft was lumbering along with Windows XP .
Although technically sound , it was shot through with the decisions made more than a decade earlier for 16 - bit Windows .
In 2001 , when XP was released , this was not such a big deal .
The first two or three versions of Mac OS X were troublesome , to say the least .
Performance was weak , there were stability issues , and version 10.0 arguably was n't even feature complete .
It was n't until early 2002 that Apple even made Mac OS X the default OS on new Macs ; for the first few months of its life , XP was up against " Classic " Mac OS 9 .
But OS X did n't stand still .
Apple released a series of updates in quick succession , strengthening the platform with new features like Core Audio , Core Image , Core Data , and Quartz Extreme , and providing high - quality applications that exploited these abilities .
All this time , XP itself stood still .
The core Windows platform did n't change between 2001 and late 2006 .
Although XP itself was essentially unchanged , Microsoft did try to produce a modern , appealing platform for future development .
That platform was , of course , .NET , and observant readers will have noticed that I did n't mention it in part one .
This was no accident , as the whole .NET story deserved a more thorough examination .
Microsoft attempts modernity
In 2002 , Microsoft released the .NET Framework .
The .NET Framework was brand spanking new .
It was designed and implemented from the ground up .
It could have been clean and consistent and orthogonal and with a clear design and powerful concepts .
It could have been a way out of the quagmire that is Win32 .
It could have provided salvation — an environment free of 16 - bit legacy decisions , with powerful APIs on a par with what Apple had developed .
It was certainly promoted as such .
. NET was pushed as the future , the way all Windows development would occur in the future .
The plans became quite aggressive ; in the OS that was to succeed Windows XP , new functionality would be accessed not through Win32 but through .
NET , meaning that any developer wanting to exploit the latest and greatest OS features would have to venture into this brave new world .
So .NET could have been a step into the 21st century .
It could have been , but it was n't .
Technically , .NET was fine .
The virtual machine infrastructure was pretty sound , the performance was reasonable , and C# was an adequate ( if not exactly ground - breaking ) language .
But the library — the .NET " API " used for such diverse tasks as writing files , reading data from databases , sending information over a network , parsing XML , or creating a GUI — the library is another story altogether .
The library is extremely bad .
It is simplistic and inflexible and in many ways quite limited .
See , .NET has a big problem : its target audience .
. NET was meant to be a unified platform that all developers would use — after all , if new OS features required .
NET , a broad cross-section of developers would use it .
The problem is that not all developers are created equal .
By looking at the different kinds of developers out there , we can understand why .NET is the way it is .
What follows is not an exhaustive taxonomy of all the weird and wonderful breeds of programmer , but rather a rough taxonomy of some of the key species .
A developer taxonomy
At one level , you have people who are basically business analysts ; they 're using Access or Excel or VB6 to write data analyzing / number crunching applications .
These things are hugely important in the business world , totally unexciting to anyone else , and the people writing them are n't really " programmers . "
I mean , they are , in the sense that they 're writing programs , but they 're not especially interested in programming or anything like that .
They do n't really care about the quality of the libraries and tools they 're using ; they just want something simple enough that they can pick it up without too much difficulty .
They 'll never write the best code or the best programs in the world ; they wo n't be elegant or well - structured or pretty to look at .
But they 'll work .
Historically , as I said , these are the kind of people who Access is made for .
Access is a great tool , quite unparalleled .
Sure , it 's a lousy database engine with a hideous programming language , but the power it gives these people is immense .
So Access and VB6 and Excel macros are where it's at for these guys .
At the next level , you have the journeyman developers .
Now these people are n't " business " people — they are proper programmers .
But it 's just a job , and they 'll tend to stick with what they know rather than try to do something better .
They might be a bit more discerning about their tools than the business types , but they 're not going to go out of their way to pick up new skills and learn new things .
They might use VB6 or Java or C # or whatever ; it does n't really matter to them , as they 'll use whatever offers them the best employment opportunities at any given moment .
Their code will probably look more or less the same no matter what .
They 're not going to learn the idioms of whatever specific language they 're using , because there 's no need , so it 's just not for them .
A key feature of these developers is that , most of the time , they 're writing " enterprise " software .
This is n't software that will sit on a shelf in a store for someone to buy ; it 's custom applications to assist with some business process or other .
Truth be told , it probably wo n't have to look very nice or work very well ; it just has to get the job done .
With " enterprise " software , you can often get away with a clunky program , because the people who are using it have all been trained on what to do .
If doing X makes the application crash , that 's okay — they can just be taught not to do X any more .
In spite of the often mediocre quality of the software these people write , they 're a group that 's immensely important to Microsoft .
These programs are a key part of the platform lock - in that Microsoft craves .
If a company has some business - critical custom application written in Visual Basic 6 , that company is n't going to roll out Linux to its desktops ; it 's trapped on Windows .
At the final level , you have the conscientious developers .
These are people who care about what they 're doing .
They might be writing business apps somewhere ( although they probably hate it , unless they are on a team of like - minded individuals ) but , probably more likely , they 're writing programs in their own time .
They want to learn about what 's cool and new ; they want to do the right thing on their platforms ; they want to learn new techniques and better solutions to existing problems .
They might be using unusual development platforms , or they might be using C++ , but they 'll be writing good code that 's appropriate to their tools .
They 'll heed UI guidelines ( and only break them when appropriate ) ; they 'll use new features that the platform has to offer ; they 'll push things to the limit .
In a good way , of course .
In the pre-.NET world , this was n't really a big problem .
The first group used Excel macros and Access ; the second group used Visual Basic 6 , and the last group could use C++ or whatever beret - wearing funky scripting language was à la mode at the time .
This all worked out fine , because one of the few nice things about Win32 is that it was designed for C. C is in many ways a very simple language , and it's also a ubiquitous language .
As a consequence of this , pretty much every other programming language created in the last couple of decades can , one way or another , call C APIs .
" .NET could have been a step into the 21st century .
It could have been , but it was n't . "
. NET is n't like that .
Although .NET can call C APIs ( just like everything else can ) , the real objective is for all programming to reside in the .NET world .
. NET is meant to be the entire platform , with all the different languages that people use living inside the .NET environment .
This is why .NET has APIs for tasks like reading and writing files ; in the .NET world you 're not meant to use Win32 to do these things , you 're meant to use .
NET 's facilities for doing them .
It 's still possible to use different languages with .NET ( in fact , it 's easier than it was in the pre-. NET days ) .
Just now , the different languages all use the common set of .NET APIs for drawing windows on screen , or saving files , or querying databases , and so on .
Because everything now has to live " within " the .NET world , .NET has to be all things to all people .
Well actually , that 's not true .
It 's trying to be good enough for the first and second kind of programmer .
The third type — well , just ignore them .
They 're too demanding anyway .
They 're the ones who care about their tools and get upset when an API is badly designed .
They 're the ones who notice the inconsistencies and omissions and gripe about them .
The .NET library is simple to the point of being totally dumbed down ; it 's probably okay for the first and second groups , not least because they do n't know any better , but for the rest it 's an exercise in frustration .
This frustration is exacerbated when it 's compared to .
NET 's big competitor , Java .
Java is no panacea ; it too is aiming roughly at the middle kind of developer , which is understandable , as they 're the most numerous .
But Java 's much more high - minded .
It 's much stronger on concepts , making it easier to learn .
Sun does n't get it right the whole time , but the people behind Java have clearly made something of an effort .
One practical manifestation of this is that .NET reflects a lot of the bad decisions made in Win32 .
For example , .NET provides an API named Windows Forms for writing GUIs .
Windows Forms is based heavily on the Win32 GUI APIs ; the same GUI APIs that owe their design to Win16 .
To properly write Windows Forms programs , you need to know how Win32 works , because there are concepts from Win32 that make their presence felt in Windows Forms .
In Win32 , every window is related to a specific thread .
There can be multiple windows that belong to a thread , but every window is owned by exactly one thread .
Almost every action that updates a window in some way — moving it on - screen , changing some text , animating some graphics , anything like that — has to be performed within the thread that owns the window .
This restriction in itself is not entirely uncommon .
There are very few truly multithreaded GUI APIs , because it tends to make programs more complicated for no real benefit .
The problem lies in how .NET makes developers handle this restriction .
There 's a way to test whether an update to a window needs to be sent to the thread that actually owns the window or not , along with a mechanism for sending the update to the window 's thread .
Except this way does n't always work .
Under some situations , it can tell you that you 're using the correct thread already even if you 're not .
If the program then carries on and tries to perform the update , it may succeed or it may hang or crash the application .
The reason for this unhelpful behavior is the way Windows Forms depends so heavily on Win32 .
These little issues are abundant .
The .NET library does work .
It more or less has all the main pieces you need , but it 's full of areas where you have to deal , directly or indirectly , with the obsolescent mediocrity of Win32 .
On their own , none of these issues would be a show - stopper , but they all add up .
It 's a death of a thousand cuts .
There are so many places where the Win32 underpinnings " shine through " and taint what should have been a brand - new platform .
John Higgs is a journalist , television writer and producer and author .
His latest book , I Have America Surrounded : The Life of Timothy Leary , published by the Friday Project , is the first full biography of the pioneer of psychedelic drugs .
I Have America Surrounded official website
1. The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley
Huxley 's account of his experiments with mescaline in the 1950s make psychedelic use sound like a perfectly reasonable and admirable pursuit which would bring credit to any middle class gentleman .
Huxley never wrote a dull sentence in his life and this is certainly one of his best works .
If its influence of the likes of Timothy Leary or Jim Morrison is considered , then it could easily be his most culturally important book .
2. The Great Shark Hunt by Hunter S Thompson
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is usually considered Thompson 's best work , but I much prefer The Great Shark Hunt .
It 's a huge book , a collection of the best of his journalism from the 60s and 70s , and it shows that Thompson had a far greater range than his later reputation suggests .
His essay about Hemingway 's death , in which he tried to understand why such a once - vibrant man ended up blowing his brains out in small town America , is particularly poignant following Thompson 's suicide .
3. The Electric Kool - aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe
This is Wolfe 's account of life with Ken Kesey , the Merry Pranksters and the birth of the American west coast psychedelic movement .
Wolfe knew that a detached , even - handed journalistic approach could never really explain what was happening , so he gave his book the same psychedelic viewpoint as his characters .
The result is a wonderful piece of writing .
For those of us who were n't born in the 60s , this is probably the closest we can get to experiencing it .
4. High Priest by Timothy Leary
Leary was a prolific writer , producing over 30 books and hundreds of essays and papers .
I 've chosen his autobiographical High Priest ( 1968 ) for this list as I think it is one of his most accomplished pieces of writing .
It captures both the drug experience and the sense of discovery so well ; the moment a scientist realises that the implications of their work are so huge that their life will never be the same again .
5. Sisters of the Extreme : Women writing on the drug experience by Cynthia Palmer and Michael Horowitz ( eds )
Psychedelic use is split fairly evenly between the men and women , but the desire to write about and try to explain the experience is a predominantly male trait .
Certainly every other book in this top ten is from a male author , which is why this book so important .
It sheds light on the otherwise hidden half of the psychedelic experience .
6 . The Long Trip : A Prehistory of Psychedelia by Paul Devereux
Devereux 's impressive and thorough trawl through prehistory will be an eye - opener for anyone who thought drug use was a modern phenomenon .
Devereux demonstrates that this point in history is a strange quirk in the human story , a rare time where we do n't have a structure for incorporating psychedelic use into our society .
If nothing else , it will make you view your ancestors in a different light !
7. DMT : The Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman , MD
The medical profession has written little about psychedelics since Timothy Leary , which makes this book all the more valuable .
DMT , a natural chemical produced by the human brain , is a hallucinogen so powerful that it makes LSD look like lager shandy .
DMT throws up some very big questions about the workings of the brain , consciousness and about the world at large , and Strassman does not shy from these .
For those who think that one day science will have all the answers , this book shows just how clueless we still are .
8. Cosmic Trigger : Final Secret of the Illuminati Volume 1 by Robert Anton Wilson
The usual medical warning about psychedelic use is that it is dangerous for anyone with latent or undiagnosed neurotic or schizophrenic disorders .
Perhaps a more important warning would be that psychedelic use can trigger an onslaught of utterly weird synchronicities which leave the user in a world that has seemingly gone totally crazy , while they still feel perfectly sane .
Robert Anton Wilson describes this situation better than anyone , and this sanity - bashing account of his personal journey through what he calls ' Chapel Perilous ' is one of his best works .
Anti-drug campaigners should distribute this book in schools , and ask children if they could handle that much madness .
9. Bill Hicks : Agent of Evolution by Kevin Booth and Michael Bertin
Psychedelics are often thought to have faded in influence after the mid 70s , but this is not the case .
Instead , they became more subtly integrated into people 's lives , to the degree that they did n't overshadow an individual 's other interests or achievements .
Bill Hicks is a good example .
Although he frequently talked about his psychedelic use on stage he is not generally labelled as just a ' drugs comic ' , and I suspect that my inclusion of this book in this list will surprise a few people .
This honest biography by his close friend Kevin Booth shows how integral psychedelics were to his life and , ultimately , his legacy .
10 . What the Dormouse Said : How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff
This is significant because it is one of the first books to look at the legacy that the psychedelic movement of the 60s left behind .
Many people will be surprised by the debt the idea of a ' personal computer ' owes to psychedelics , the significance of the geographical location of Silicon Valley on the San Franciscan peninsula , or why Steve Jobs would say that taking LSD was one of the " two or three most important things " he has ever done .
An impressive account of recent history .
11 . The Road of Excess by Brian Barritt
A psychedelic top 10 , of course , goes up to 11 , which allows me to include Barritt 's autobiography .
One of Timothy Leary 's lovers recently told me that she thought this book had the greatest descriptions of acid trips ever written , and she may well be right .
This is a piece of literature that has clearly never been within a hundred yards of a copy editor , and it is all the better for it .
Words just spill forth with no interest in grammar , coherence or where the narrative is going , but it possesses such an innate wit and swagger that it is a complete joy from start to finish .
Psychedelia in its purest form , studded with flashes of brilliance .
Another swimmer was killed by a shark off the Pacific coast of Mexico on May 24 , the second tragic shark encounter in two months in that area , thus officially launching another summer of shark hysteria .
The Mexican Navy immediately took to seas to search for the sharks , perhaps with the intent to punish them or at least send a stern warning to the shark community .
Shark reports are now a regular feature of the news as far away as the New England coast ; the sharks are tracked as if they are as deadly as a tornado or summer storm .
What would be the reaction to the death of a kid in Iowa killed by a bee sting ?
Imagine the drama unfold as angry and nervous denizens take to the fields with insect repellent .
Never mind pollination :
The bees must die .
And why not ?
Worldwide bees are nearly a hundred times deadlier than sharks , killing about 500 people annually , including about 50 in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Yes , sharks are deadly .
It has something to do with their gazillion or so razor - sharp teeth .
But while it is prudent to avoid waters populated with sharks , shark encounters are rare and fatalities from attacks are even rarer .
The number of shark attacks averages about 65 worldwide annually , according to the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida .
Expect about 30 attacks in U.S. waters , mostly near Florida .
In 2007 there was only one death , way over in New Caledonia in the South Pacific .
Two deaths near Mexico is a bad start to the summer season , when folks are most likely to be in the water , but this might not challenge the annual average of five to ten deaths .
Deadlier than sharks , with wings or collars
So which animals should you really avoid ?
Many consider the mosquito to be the deadliest animal on earth , because it is responsible for malaria , yellow fever , dengue fever and many other diseases , killing millions of people each year .
Technically , though , it is not the mosquito but the parasite or virus it is carrying in its gut — protozoan parasites , for malaria — that causes the disease .
Snakes are the most dangerous land animals , killing tens of thousands people a year worldwide .
Deadly snake bites are rare in the United States , but snakes still edge out sharks , responsible for five or ten deaths a year , largely in the Southwest .
Tens of thousands more people are killed by scorpions and venomous spiders — but again , no spider - citing report , no film at 11 .
Along with those treacherous bees , dogs top the list of killers in the United States .
Through the 1980s and until 1995 — the last year of official statistics — the CDC was recording nearly 20 deaths per year , almost entirely from pit bulls and rottweilers .
Call of the wild
In the jungle , the mighty jungle , the lion sleeps while crocodiles kill about 2,000 humans each year .
Elephants and hippos each kill hundreds more , largely by trampling the unsuspecting victim surprised by these animals ' speed .
In the ocean , fear jellyfish more than sharks .
In particularly , that 's the box jellyfish family of about 20 species , which live in tropical waters .
Their venom is the deadliest among animals , and they are responsible for about 100 human deaths per year .
The sting from a Portuguese Man o' War — confused for a jellyfish , technically a colony of sea polyps — also can be deadly but mostly just hurts a lot .
Jaws , the reality
There 's a simple reason why sharks do n't attack humans repetitively , unlike what you saw in the movie " Jaws : " Humans do n't taste good .
Sharks prefer blubber .
Shark teeth are lined with nerve endings that can sense the calorie - rich blubber of a seal as opposed to the bone and muscle filling most humans .
The only problem is that sharks sample by biting .
Most people will survive a shark bite , but it can be debilitating nonetheless .
Serious surfers are at greatest risk , comprising the majority of shark - attack cases .
Most of us in the water , with blubber or not , are safe .

Top 10 Deadliest Animals
An internal memo suggests that the White House will be unable to recover thousands of missing White House e-mails by the end of George W. Bush 's term in office .
According to a document dated June 20 and leaked to the Associated Press , the White House IT shop has been soliciting bids from contractors to perform the recovery project , but the document estimates the work will not be completed until April 2009 , three months after either Barack Obama or John McCain will have moved into the Oval Office .
The White House IT shop has estimated that as many as five million e-mails were lost between 2003 and 2005 .
The recent leak offers a rare glimpse at its progress in recovering them .
The White House has treated the process like a closely - guarded secret .
In June , a federal judge ruled that unlike most parts of the federal government , the White House Office of Administration is not required to respond to requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
The White House told the AP that the leaked document was " outdated and seriously inaccurate , " but refused to elaborate on what was inaccurate about the document or to provide any details about how far the recovery effort had progressed .
Archiving of government e-mail communications is required by federal law , yet the Bush administration has struggled since 2002 to comply with the requirement .
The administration inherited a working archival system from the Clinton White House .
But when the Bush IT shop decided to switch from a Lotus Notes - based e-mail system to one based on Microsoft Exchange , it broke compatibility with that software .
Since then , the White House has repeatedly tried and failed to develop a new system .
It first tried to retrofit the old Notes - based system to work with Exchange , but concluded that the approach was unworkable .
It then took bids to design a new Exchange - based archiving system .
According to one whistleblower , that system was finalized in 2006 , but was reportedly mothballed at the last minute by White House CIO Theresa Payton , who cited vague performance concerns .
In the interim , the White House IT shop has relied on a clumsy manual system called " journaling , " in which ( in the words of a February Congressional report ) " a White House staffer or contractor would collect from a ' journal ' e-mail folder in the Microsoft Exchange system copies of e-mails sent and received by White House employees . "
Because the resulting files were saved manually and haphazardly on various White House servers , stuff tended to get lost .
The memo estimates that there may be as many as 225 days with missing e-mails .
Some of the most significant e-mail losses occurred in the spring and summer of 2003 , a period during which the White House was planning and executing its fateful invasion of Iraq .
Yet the leaked memo suggests that the White House is not planning to attempt recovery of e-mails older than October 2003 .
Despite its difficulties recovering lost e-mails , the White House IT shop has repeatedly rebuffed outside offers of assistance .
The National Archives , the federal agency responsible for historical preservation of official government documents , has been warning the White House about problems with its e-mail system since 2004 .
It sent repeated messages during 2007 offering to help with recovery and preservation efforts , but its entreaties were apparently ignored .
Meanwhile , two private organizations , the National Security Archives and Citizens for Responsibility in Washington , have been pressing the Bush administration in court over its e-mail preservation policies .
In a May court filing , the White House insisted that it had everything under control , and that no court supervision of its recovery efforts was necessary .
Government projects are almost never completed ahead of schedule , so it 's a safe bet that government IT workers will still be struggling to restore missing e-mails when George W. Bush leaves office on January 20 , 2009 .
Documents of significant value to future historians may be lost in the confusion that invariably accompanies the change of administrations .
Russia 's blitz into the former Soviet republic of Georgia has exposed starkly the limits of US military power and geopolitical influence in the era following the invasion of Iraq .
Georgia is one of the closest US allies in Eastern Europe .
President Mikheil Saakashvili has visited the White House three times in the last four years .
Yet this warm relationship did not stop the Kremlin from unleashing a ferocious military response after Georgian troops entered the separatist province of South Ossetia .
US efforts to expand Western influence and spread democracy along Russia 's borders may now be threatened .
US relations with Russia itself , at the least , are in flux .
" This gets at the stability of the framework the US thought was going to govern the post - cold - war world , " says Stephen Sestanovich , senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Russian leaders on Tuesday said they had ordered a halt to military action in Georgia .
The move followed five days of air and land attacks that had routed Georgia 's Army and sent Russian troops deep into Georgian territory .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced on national television that Georgia had been punished enough for its move against South Ossetia , which has close ties to Russia .
But Medvedev did not immediately announce any withdrawal of forces from current positions and there were reports of continued scattered fighting .
" If there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions , you should take steps to destroy them , " he told his defense minister at a televised Kremlin meeting .
President Bush , for his part , on Aug. 11 demanded that Russia end its dramatic escalation of violence in Georgia and agree to an immediate cease - fire and international mediation .
" Russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century , " said Mr. Bush in a statement televised shortly after his return to the US from the Beijing Olympics .
But since the crisis began , there has been no hint that the United States would consider any kind of military move , even logistical aid for Georgian forces , that would bring it into direct conflict with Russia .
The US and the West appear to have little leverage over a Moscow that is flush with oil money and eager to reestablish its position along its borders .
Expulsion of Russia from the G - 8 group of industrialized nations was among the few apparent strong actions the US and Europe could take .
Other possible moves include threatening Russia with the loss of the 2014 Winter Olympic games at the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
" The United States , its allies , and other countries need to send a strong signal to Moscow that creating 19th - century - style spheres of influence and redrawing the borders of the former Soviet Union is a danger to world peace , " said Ariel Cohen , senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation , in an analysis of the impact of the crisis .
Georgian President Saakashvili has long been one of the Bush administration 's favorite world leaders .
Georgia contributed 2,000 troops to the US effort in Iraq , and Mr. Saakashvili has talked often of his support for Bush administration efforts to spread freedom and democracy among the countries of the former Soviet Union .
Saakashvili and Bush seem to share a good personal chemistry .
Bush visited Georgia in 2005 ; during Saakashvili's return visits to the White House , the two joshed about folk dancing and their wives ' luncheon plans .
In March , at a White House appearance , Saakashvili thanked Bush for supporting Georgia 's aspirations to join NATO and for " protecting Georgia 's borders . "
" I think this is a very unequivocal support we 're getting from you , " the Georgian leader told the US president , for the cameras .
The US has long publicly stated that it is in favor of a peaceful settlement of Georgia 's disputes with its breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Yet Saakashvili decided to send troops into South Ossetia , anyway .
That appears to have been the spark that set off the crisis – or the provocation that Russia was waiting for .
Perhaps the Georgian leader thought the US would come to his aid if he got in trouble .
If so , he did not take into account the drain that Iraq has been on US forces and the US standing in the world – or the American need to work with Russia on other important geopolitical issues , such as the effort to curb Iran 's nuclear program .
" In many respects , Saakashvili got too close to the US , and the US got too close to Saakashvili ....
Perhaps that made him overreach , " says Charles Kupchan , senior fellow for Europe Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Ukraine , among other nations , will surely watch the outcome of this crisis closely , according to Mr. Kupchan .
US hopes of girdling Russia with Western - oriented governments now appear in question , as Moscow reasserts influence over its " near abroad . "
US hopes that Russia would be essentially a benign economic partner may also have been dashed when Russian tanks rolled into Georgian territory .
" Victory in this war with no consequences for Russia will reinforce antidemocratic forces in Russia , increase the militarization of its foreign policy , and encourage Russia to take more risks elsewhere on its borders , " says Stephen Jones , professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley , Mass .
With the US far from the area of conflict , European attitudes will be crucial .
Yet on Georgia and Russia , different European countries take different positions , and they have serious internal disagreements as well .
The European position tends to skew along lines of interest and history .
Older European states , such as France and Germany , have strong economic and energy ties to Russia and see themselves as necessarily working with Moscow .
Former Warsaw Pact states like Poland , Hungary , and the Baltic nations view Moscow with real suspicion based on bitter recent history as involuntary allies of the Soviet Union .
Britain , increasingly wary of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's Russia , takes a dim view of Moscow after a season of tensions and spats .
East German - born Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor , regards Prime Minister Putin at least as a question mark , but she has been skillful at pragmatic moves that have kept Berlin - Moscow relations strong .
" Nothing meaningful can be done as a matter of American policy if there is no consensus among European states that this represents something deeply shocking , " says Mr. Sestanovich of the Council on Foreign Relations .

In 2003 , Neal Stephenson 's book Quicksilver hit the stands .
It was the first in a series called The Baroque Cycle , featuring ( among many other things ) the exploits of alchemists and mathematicians .
But before Quicksilver was released , a promotional website appeared , featuring a mysterious opening page followed by some basic information -- an author bio , some sales information , and an excerpt of the upcoming novel .
But what of that opening page ?
It was apparently an encoded message in graphical form , presented for fans to solve .
It looked like this :
Readers around the world rallied to crack the code , but Todd Garrison ultimately solved it .
Garrison wrote an account of the decipherment , which makes for really interesting reading .
With minimal knowledge of cryptology ( apparently mainly from Stephenson 's own novel Cryptonomicon ) , Garrison ran through a series of hypotheses related to encryption , ciphers , and so on .
After many false starts , he discovered that the message was n't " encrypted " at all -- it was just in a very , very obscure language .
Still , deciphering that language was an immense task that involved finding a book more than 300 years old and reverse - engineering the language to figure out English words from the promotional website .
Anyway , without giving anything more away , here 's a selection from Garrison 's account :
The key to deciphering the message seemed to be predicated on finding a real - life example of this strange writing .
Once that happened , the pieces would fall into place , and the mystery would be solved .
But how to go about it ?
The problem - - a rather immense one , in fact -- meant taking something that was graphic in nature and trying to conduct research using text - based tools .
I had in front of me an entire page of these squiggly lines and no real way to come up with decent keywords to use in a search engine .
How does one ask , for example , " What can you tell me about this symbol , comprised of a horizontal line with two crooked arms attached to it , bisected by a funny S - shaped line with a tiny circle at its base ? "
It was n't gonna work .
First I was going to have to figure out who had created this monster .
The only thing I could think of was to search for examples of ancient writing and cross-reference the results with names like Newton , Liebniz , Hooke , et al .
As I had feared , nothing seemed to turn up graphically ; plenty of information was available in text form , but nothing seemed to be visually helpful , leaving me with a big fat goose egg .
While it was interesting to read about , I had no idea whether I was on the right track or not .
The net result meant having to pore over copious amounts of material in hopes that eventually something would show me the way .
Read the rest for a great bit of puzzle - solving !
Using custom functions with SQLAlchemy and SQLite
I recently developed a Web - based translation memory ( TM ) application in Python .
One thing the application does is fuzzy glossary matching : given a source sentence , it'll find all terms in the glossary that are fuzzy substrings of that sentence ( using my fuzzy substring matching module , which is based on the Levenshtein distance algorithm ) , and return the terms along with their translations .
Here 's how I created a custom function for fuzzy glossary searches , using SQLAlchemy for the ORM , with SQLite as the database engine .
Assuming you 've got your SessionClass object , create a session , and get a connection object :
import subdist subdist def make_gloss_func( haystack ) :
" " " Creates a fuzzy substring matcher using haystack
" " "
get_score = subdist.get_score def gloss_func( needle ) :
return get_score ( needle , haystack )
return gloss_func class TM ( object ) :
" " " Represents a translation memory ( TM ) / glossary " " " # stuff skipped … def gloss_search ( self , query , minscore ) :
" " " Do a fuzzy glossary search .
" " " try :
session = self .
SessionClass () # Create the custom function
gloss_func = make_gloss_func( query )
conn = session.bind.connect ( )
conn.connection.create_function (" gloss_score " ,
1 ,
gloss_func ) # Execute the query
search_string = " " " SELECT * FROM records
WHERE gloss_score ( source ) >=:minscore " " "
return conn.execute ( search_string ,
dict ( minscore=minscore ) ) finally :
self.SessionClass.remove ( )
Speedup
Just for fun , I compared the speed of ( 1 ) using custom functions in SQLite with ( 2 ) keeping the records as a Python array , and getting the matches in pure Python using a list comprehension .
I found that the SQLAlchemy version is about 8 times faster .
In the test , I created a glossary of 44,732 records using random word pairs , and got the fuzzy substrings for a query sentence .
version time native Python 0.7837 s SQLAlchemy 0.0966 s
Since the fuzzy - matching code and database code are written in C , the SQLAlchemy version is probably approaching near - C speeds , with the only slowdown being the overhead of calling them from Python ( which is pretty minimal ; most of the work is done elsewhere ) .
More importantly , the SQLAlchemy version easily meets my performance target of a 50,000 - record search in 0.25 seconds , while the native Python version falls pretty far short .
Also interestingly , I found that psyco did n't speed up either version at all , and in fact made both slightly slower .
Another demonstration that you should profile rather than applying psyco as a panacea .
Here 's the code used for the test .

Published in the August 2008 issue .
Robert Downey Jr.'s chocolate complexion , kinky short hair , and " hot damn ! " cadence in the Vietnam satire Tropic Thunder is blood kin to the shoe - polish - stained cheeks , Brillo - pad pompadours , and declarative " yessum , massa ! " of yore .
Honky is still playing Negro .
But once the lights dim , it 's hard to tell what 's more shocking : that Robert Downey Jr. is in blackface or that after about two minutes , you stop thinking about it .
Hollywood has n't manufactured this kind of wide - release minstrelsy since that nice Jewish boy Gene Wilder delivered his hilariously inept and subversive strut with Richard Pryor in Silver Streak in 1976 .
( Unless you count the times African - Americans wore it themselves , like Spike Lee 's black - blackface diatribe against nappy - headed racism in 2000's Bamboozled , or the Wayans brothers ' creepy paleface cross-dressing in 2004's White Chicks . )
Time was , blackface was as common as Uncle Tom servants and jim crow laws .
Even the transition from silent film to talkies wore its racism as a badge of honor , with 1927's The Jazz Singer best known for Al Jolson 's ebony visage belting out " My Mammy . "
The most lily - white stars in Hollywood 's firmament -- including Judy Garland and Bing Crosby -- were only too happy to rub on that inky greasepaint and shake their jazz hands while smiling with those big painted lips .
And once you were bedecked in bigotry , there were two options : ham it up like Stepin Fetchit ( Amos ' n ' Andy 's white creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll , for example ) or just wear the outfit but act the way you always do ( Al , Bing , and Judy ) .
Downey mixes both , playing up stereotypes by declaring his love of crawfish and collard greens , but pulling back enough so it 's not a shrill caricature .
( Helping him to balance that act is black stand - up comic Brandon T. Jackson as a rapper - turned - actor who keeps busting Downey 's chops about the mahogany charade , which gives him even more license to black it up . )
How does Downey pull it off ?
Singular talent .
The Oscar - nominated actor has spent his career perfecting humor and pathos in equal measure .
Which means that when , in Tropic Thunder , he plays a dead - serious Australian Method actor who insists on taking a role originally written for a black man , what ends up parodied is the self - seriousness of Method acting and the Vietnam - movie trope of the chitlins - chewing Negro grunt .
Blackface is n't the subject ; it 's the vessel .
And it does n't hurt that he 's in a damned funny film .
Writer - director Ben Stiller uses the conceit of three self - centered actors making a Vietnam drama in Southeast Asia as his starting point for moviemaking mockery .
And Tropic Thunder ( August 15 ) is relentlessly , mercilessly , brutally hilarious .
Still , what major movie star wants to risk offending anyone -- especially a star who just rocketed into the blockbuster - franchise stratosphere with Iron Man ?
" If Downey thinks something is going to be offensive , it 's going to tempt him to do it , " says James Toback , who has directed three movies starring Downey , including Black and White , in which he cast the actor as a bisexual documentarian who makes a pass at an unsuspecting Mike Tyson ( and almost gets pummeled ) .
Downey may be fearless , but he's also shrewd enough to know the difference between being racist and telling a joke about racism .
In Tropic Thunder , minstrelsy is a curiosity , not a flash point -- precisely because the man in black is so cool .

( Fortune Magazine� ) --
" Are you ready ? " shouts Josh Ball , manager of GameStop No. 1,782 in Euless , Texas , near Dallas .
He 's standing before more than 100 fidgety young men and women lined up in the strip - mall parking lot outside his store .
They 've been here for hours in the warm spring air , waiting for midnight when the latest version of Grand Theft Auto - the ever controversial hoodlums - and - pimps videogame - goes on sale .
It 's getting close to the appointed hour , and these people can barely contain themselves .
" ARE YOU READY FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO IV ? "
Ball hollers again .
" YEAH ! " the crowd shout back .
Ball understands .
He 's a gamer himself .
He thinks Grand Theft Auto ( a.k.a. GTA ) is the coolest thing you can do with two thumbs .
The 23 - year - old has been telling customers for weeks to reserve their copies and is stoked to see so many of them here tonight .
At 12:00 A.M. sharp , Ball and his employees open the doors and start handing out games .
They close up three hours later .
But Ball is n't done yet .
He rushes home and plays his own copy of GTA4 until six .
Two hours later he 's back at store 1,782 for the morning rush .
" It 's just a never - ending process , " Ball says later .
Number one by far
Guys like Josh Ball are the reason GameStop will sell more copies of GTA4 than any other retailer this year .
Michael Pachter , an industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan , predicts that of the 12 million copies of GTA4 sold this year , nearly one out of five will go through GameStop .
" They 'll be No. 1 by far , " Pachter says .
That 's what Wall Street has come to expect from the videogame chain started 21 years ago by Barnes & Noble chairman Len Riggio .
Videogames are n't just kids ' business anymore , of course - they 're a fast - growing , $ 19 billion industry with arguably as much pop-culture significance as Hollywood .
No retailer has more cachet among gamers than GameStop , and only Wal - Mart has a larger share of the market - for now .
According to market researcher NPD , Wal - Mart had a 21.3 % market share last year .
GameStop 's share was 21.1 % , and may well overtake Wal - Mart 's this year .
It is n't often that a retailer challenges Wal - Mart in any category .
How has GameStop pulled it off ?
First , all those Josh Balls .
They really are gamers , and they really do connect with customers .
If you 've shopped for games at Wal - Mart , you know the difference .
You have to track down someone to unlock the game cabinet .
And if you are looking for advice , forget it .
Second , GameStops are everywhere - 4,061 in the U.S. and another 1,203 abroad ( and counting ) .
You ca n't visit a mall or a strip center without seeing one .
Last , and this is key , GameStop has a trade - in policy .
Bring in your old game , and the store will credit it toward a new one .
That 's heaven for a teenager who wants a new copy of Halo 3 for $ 60 .
The benefits of a console war
Now GameStop is reaping the benefits of the latest console war .
The new generation of platforms like Microsoft's Xbox 360 , the Sony PS3 , and the Nintendo Wii are driving hardware and software sales to new heights .
GameStop 's sales for fiscal 2007 were $ 7.1 billion - a 33 % increase over the previous year ; same - store sales were up 24 % over the same period .
Its net earnings rose 82 % , to $ 288 million .
GameStop 's stock price has risen 480 % since its 2002 IPO .
And yes , Ball and his fellow store managers get options .
GameStop will probably have a good year in 2008 too , thanks in part to GTA4 .
But after that ?
Open question .
The Wii may be attracting new customers - mainly women - to games .
But they may prefer shopping at Target to GameStop .
The videogame retailer also faces a future in which hits like GTA4 move from being packaged goods to digital downloads .
Those are two serious challenges .
Can GameStop meet them ?
Well , it would n't be the first time this company defied expectations .
Most people do n't think of Riggio as a game guy .
If anything , they know him as the man behind Barnes & Noble , the bookstore giant with the sofas and lattes .
Riggio found himself in the game trade in 1987 , when Barnes & Noble bought the 797 - store B. Dalton chain .
Along with that purchase came five Software Etc. shops .
They sold computer programs and videogames .
Riggio was intrigued .
" It 's pretty simple , " he recalls thinking at the time .
" Books are basically software . "
And videogames were just software .
So he opened 372 Software Etc. outlets in malls .
By 1993 videogames were 36 % of the chain 's sales .
But Riggio discovered books and videogames were in fact very different .
You do n't need a gizmo to read a Stephen King novel , but you do need a Nintendo console to play Mario games - and that console would be obsolete in five years , tops .
It was a cycle : new console , crowds at Software Etc. , then crowds leave to await the next console .
Repeat .
In 1993 Software Etc. got caught between console cycles and had a lousy Christmas .
In an uncharacteristic moment of self - doubt , Riggio decided to merge Software Etc. with a competing chain that had the what - were - they - thinking name of Babbage's .
The results were disastrous .
Babbage 's filed for bankruptcy in 1996 .
A changing business
" It was just tomfoolery , " Riggio says of the Babbage 's adventure .
But he was too embarrassed to walk away .
So he and two former B. Dalton executives - Dick Fontaine , now GameStop 's CEO , and Dan DeMatteo , now COO - took action .
They closed stores and repaired relationships with disgruntled vendors like Nintendo .
Meanwhile , the business was changing .
A guy named David Pomije had come up with a new kind of game store named FuncoLand .
He did n't see the need to be in high - rent malls ; low - rent shopping centers suited him fine .
Pomije pushed used games harder than new ones .
Why ?
Because FuncoLand made a 50 % margin on used games - more than twice its margin on new ones .
At first Barnes & Noble tried to compete by opening strip - mall stores called GameStop .
Then , in 2000 , it bought Pomije 's company for $ 159 million and turned his business model into a science : buy consoles and games that customers bring in , immediately resell what you can , and fix the rest .
( Damaged goods are sent to the company 's elaborate " refurbishment " center in Texas , where workers on three shifts repair PlayStations and Xboxes and take scratches out of damaged games so they can be resold . )
There 's one more important chapter in the history of GameStop : purchasing its largest rival , Electronics Boutique , in 2005 for $ 1.4 billion .
GameStop could n't have picked a better moment for the acquisition .
The deal closed just as Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , Sony ( SNE ) , and Nintendo released their next - gen machines .
That , plus the success of Nintendo's handheld DS and the fact that game publishers have continued to make games for older platforms like the PS2 - it all means that GameStop is moving more product than anyone would have imagined 20 years ago .
" We no longer talk about videogame cycles , " says Fontaine .
" We talk about cycles within cycles . "
The Internet looms
This wo n't last forever .
One day , games will be distributed on the Net , not sold on discs .
That 's a touchy subject for GameStop : you can't sell used downloads .
GameStop says the disc era is far from over .
Maybe , maybe not .
Meanwhile , there 's a more pressing challenge for GameStop .
Remember those new customers brought in by the Wii ?
This summer Nintendo unveils Wii Fit , an aerobics and yoga game .
It 'll probably be a hit , but it 's targeted at moms - and you do n't see many of those in a GameStop unless their kids drag them in .
So this is a chance for Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) and Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) to erode GameStop 's market share .
Or is it ?
DeMatteo says his company is trying to change its image from the " village pool hall " to the " Starbucks of videogame stores . "
Now GameStop people will just have learn to talk about yoga positions on Wii Fit with the same passion they display discussing Uzi tactics on GTA4 .
Hey , it could happen .
Ken Pescatore , manager of a GameStop in Springfield , N.J. , says he 's already made some adjustments to his pitch .
He does n't use the term " controller " when he 's talking to moms about the Wii ; he uses the more familiar - sounding " remote . "
He talks about health and hobbies a lot .
" With the release of Wii Fit , you can do your exercises in the living room , " Pescatore says , lighting up .
" If horseback riding is your hobby , there 's even a game that will simulate that ! "
This is n't playtime for Pescatore .
He manages a store with annual sales of $ 2.5 million .
Do you think he 's going to let those newbies at the Wal - Mart or Target down the street take his customers ?
Over his dead stock options .

His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
As Vancouver readies itself for the eyes of the world for the 2010 Olympics , the city tries to recover from the stigma of association with the Pickton murders and the Downtown Eastside .
Both tragedies are connected to prostitution , but while some groups want to decriminalize sex work to make it safer , others are vehemently opposed to changing the laws , saying it would increase the exploitation of vulnerable women and children .
Incorporated in February of this year , the West Coast Co-operative of Sex Industry Professionals is a project to organize sex workers both locally and nationally .
Apart from plans to run a co-op brothel , the group also plans to provide a variety of other services to sex workers , such as helping them find alternate employment in exiting the sex trade and serving as an industry association , with occupational health and safety training and minimum labour standards .
A plea for amnesty
One of the co-op 's founders is Susan Davis , a veteran of 22 years as a sex worker and a member of the B.C. Coalition of Experiential Communities .
She says that criminalization and increased enforcement of sex work laws has actually made it less safe for the people involved .
" They 've closed 20 strip clubs in three years .
I 've got exotic dancers who are now asking me how they can work safely as escorts when they never wanted to have full contact .
Now they 're being forced to choose sex work that 's beyond their physical boundaries .
What will be the emotional impact of that ?
" And the escort job market is so tight that as they enter , generally they 're younger , more beautiful , more marketable , and inevitably someone else will lose their job , and be pushed out onto the street .
This elimination of the safe work environment and the undermining of the stability of our industry is creating the environment that 's allowing workers to go missing and be killed at levels that are just ridiculous , " says Davis .
However , the co-op brothel could violate the Canadian Criminal Code 's regulations regarding sex work .
Davis asks for an amnesty from the authorities .
" All we were asking for was that the amnesty be limited to within the walls of the physical site , limited for a certain amount of time , let 's say two years , subject to review , all those kinds of things .
But it 's our intention to go out on a series of community engagements across the city of Vancouver , to try to negotiate the terms and limitations with all stakeholders , including business owners and residents . "
Suit filed in BC to overturn sex work laws
In a typically Canadian compromise , the exchange of money for sex is legal under the Criminal Code , but many activities associated with it are not .
Section 210 prohibits keeping a bawdy house , such as a brothel ; Section 212 criminalizes living off the avails of prostitution ; and Section 213 prohibits communicating for the purposes of prostitution .
These laws , argue the reformers , actually make sex work less safe .
Section 210 forces sex workers to work on streets instead of indoors with greater comfort and security .
Section 212 is intended to control exploitative pimping , but it also prevents sex workers from supporting children or partners , or hiring drivers or other support workers .
Section 213 prevents sex workers from sharing information about bad dates or recommending clients to each other , and makes it difficult for sex workers to negotiate with clients beforehand .
Two different legal challenges set aside the issue of the morality of sex work and instead approach from the perspective of harm reduction .
Vancouver 's Pivot Legal Society has launched a challenge to those sections in the B.C. Supreme Court .
Based on interviews with 91 sex workers in the Voices for Dignity project , PIVOT found all but one who addressed the issue demanded the bawdy house law be repealed .
" We overwhelmingly heard women say , ' Build a house , build a house , build a house , ' " says Karen Mirsky , a lawyer for Pivot Legal Society .
They cited reasons of , " Safety , dignity , the ability to have a shower after meeting with a client .
To use a bathroom .
To know that there 's somebody there , that if they ring a bell , they can get assistance if they need it .
The ability to negotiate with somebody semi-privately , not on a street corner , so that everything 's clear and everybody agrees to the details of the contract . "
Challenge in Ontario Supreme Court , as well
Pivot 's challenge is based on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , claiming that the prostitution law violates freedom of expression , the right to life , liberty and security of the person and the right to equality .
Meanwhile in Ontario , a partnership of madams and lawyers leads another challenge in the Ontario Supreme Court .
Alan Young , an associate professor at York University 's Osgoode Hall Law School , has made many challenges to laws that criminalize consensual acts , including obscenity and marijuana possession .
His current challenge to the prostitution laws comes after the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the communications and bawdy house laws in a separate challenge in 1990 .
Young says , " Under Section 7 of the Charter , you can argue what 's called gross disproportionality , which is the harms created by the law grossly outweigh the benefits of the law .
You could not find a phrase that 's better tailored to the prostitution argument , because the idea of this prostitution case is simple .
The law puts prostitutes into situations that jeopardize their physical and psychological safety .
That 's the harm of the law .
What 's the benefit of the law ?
This is where people just look at you dumbfounded . "
Freedom from pimps ?
One of the plaintiffs in Young 's case is Terri - Jean Bedford , a 22 - year - veteran of the sex trade who used to operate a bondage bed and breakfast under the name Madame de Sade .
She says current prostitution laws disadvantage sex workers .
" They just can't communicate , which again leaves them vulnerable .
They have to get in the car , and go around to a dark alley .
They do n't have any sheets to question the client : what do you like , what do n't you like ?
And then afterwards , where 's the cleanup ?
You can't wash up , you can't sanitize .
" In a house , that 's all available to you .
There 's dignity , there 's self - respect .
They can have a coffee and talk .
In my house , we had a three - page questionnaire , so I could weed out the people I did n't want to deal with , or refer them to people who do like to deal with that type of person . "
Bedford says that legitimate houses of prostitution would help get sex workers off the street and away from exploitation .
" I think when you give women their freedom , dignity and respect , things change , attitudes change , and their opinions of themselves might change .
Before they decide that they 're going to work for a pimp , someone that 's going to abuse them , I think they might choose working independently in a house . "
Wide range of sex work
Though the stereotypical image of the sex worker is the woman in skyscraper heels on a street corner at night , street - level prostitution comprises only a minority of Vancouver 's sex trade , anywhere from 8 to 20 per cent , depending on who is asked .
The majority is made up of escorts and massage parlour workers , as well as exotic dancers , dominatrices , webcam performers and others who do n't do direct sexual contact .
These sex workers skirt the edge of the laws regarding bawdy houses and living off avails .
Kate Gibson , executive director of the WISH drop - in centre for women working the sex trade in the Downtown Eastside , says " The [ Vancouver ] police do n't use those laws a lot .
They use them some , but they 're always a threat , so they can be used .
I think that many of the arrests are usually complaint driven . "
Inspector John Dehaas of the VPD's Diversity & Aboriginal Policing Section says that the enforcement is mostly about location and asking sex workers to move elsewhere in response to complaints .
He would n't give any position on decriminalization , but he did say that , " Making things illegal sometimes has unintended consequences . "
Advocates of decriminalization also allow that it might not provide much help to survival sex workers .
" The law really has very little bearing on their daily activities , except for the fact that they are out there , and they can be charged , and they can be arrested for communication , and they can get a criminal record for it .
But the law probably is n't front - of - mind in whatever they do .
Women who work in the survival sex trade need all kinds of other supports like housing , some financial security , all the social determinants of health that they probably do n't have , and some nutrition , " says Gibson .
Survival - level workers may be unable to find work in legitimate brothels because of mental health or addiction issues .
' Criminalize the men '
Despite the widespread support for decriminalization among sex workers , activists and agencies such as the Canadian HIV / AIDS Legal Network , some women 's groups are strongly opposed to any decriminalization .
Daisy Kler , a spokesperson for Vancouver Rape Relief and Women 's Shelter , says , " [ For ] the person with the drug addiction , the harm is the drugs being used .
In this case , the harm is being done by a john , or a pimp .
So really , if we were to reduce the harm , it would be by what we say , proposing to criminalize the men who are buying and selling the women . "
" I think anything that legitimates prostitution as either work or a free choice among women entrenches the harm that 's done to women and affects all women 's equality . "
The Aboriginal Women 's Action Network released an e-mail statement that said , " Prostitution is inherently violent , " and rejected the harm reduction approach .
" Contrary to current media coverage of the issue , the available evidence suggests that it [ decriminalization ] would in fact be harmful , would expand prostitution and would promote trafficking , and would only serve to make prostitution safer and more profitable for the men who exploit and harm prostituted women and children . "
Irene Tsepnopoulos - Elhaimer , executive director of Women Against Violence Against Women , says , " The laws , as they now stand , do n't protect women in the mainstream , so we do n't believe that the laws for prostitution being changed will protect women in that industry . "
" There is no doubt that the winners here are the pimps , the organized crime and , frankly , the state .
If we 're really looking at ending violence against women , why do we cut funding to women 's centres , why do we marginalize women 's organizations , rape crisis centres , and why does the federal government put out a budget that mentions women six times and organizations 120 times ? "
To license or not ?
Decriminalization advocates also stress the importance of social services , of helping women with exit strategies and of preventing violence and exploitation .
Alan
Young wants the law prohibiting living on the avails of prostitution struck down , so sex workers can hire drivers and bouncers legally , " but that leaves nine other subsections of [ Section ] 212 to deal with exploitive pimping .
I 'm sick of people accusing me of bringing a case to create a pimp 's paradise . "
If the laws are changed to allow brothels , what regulations will apply to them ?
Bedford and Davis both say that the state should take a hands - off approach , leaving sex workers to build solutions on their own , instead of the kind licensing regime in parts of Nevada .
Young says , " A lot of sex trade workers are deathly afraid of regulation , [ and ] are willing to be criminalized to keep away from what they consider to be the horrible regime in Nevada ....
It 's a little off - putting that you do three - day shifts and you 're not allowed to leave during the three days unless you 're chaperoned .
The medical testing is overbearing . "
In August 2007 , Nicole Parisien , a 33 - year - old woman , was found murdered near a Kitsilano apartment which she had been using as a massage parlour .
The police arrested a suspect less than a week later .
The Parisien murder demonstrates that even indoor sex workers are targets of violence , and it shows that prostitution is not confined to downtown or the Downtown Eastside or the industrial areas of Strathcona .
Sex work happens in bourgeois Kitsilano and everywhere else in Vancouver , defying any attempt to confine it or stamp it out .
To say " not in my back yard " to a brothel ignores the fact that there probably is an outpost of the sex industry closer to your home than you know .
Talking to people about prostitution is like asking the blind sages about the elephant .
One group tells of a business that is unfairly stigmatized and persecuted by archaic , moralistic laws that do more harm than good .
Another tells of a meat grinder that acquires and consumes the most vulnerable and powerless women and children for profit , and existing laws are the only thing preventing it from being worse .
It 's pointless to use the same term , " prostitute , " to describe both an independent escort who earns over $ 10,000 per month and a 13 - year - old First Nations girl on the " kiddie stroll . "
The questions are , does the existing regime harm both of them , and what can be changed to help both of them ?

A leading candidate to be Israel 's next premier called for a death toll of 70 Palestinians a day when he was head of the military during the second intifada , according to a best - selling book by two Israeli journalists .
The account of a briefing given in May 2001 to senior West Bank army commanders reinforces the image of hawkishness enjoyed by Shaul Mofaz .
He has emerged as the main rival to the Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , for the leadership of the Kadima party being vacated by Ehud Olmert .
Mr Mofaz is expected to stress his security credentials as a former chief of staff and defence minister in his campaign to defeat Ms Livni , the most popular among the Israeli public of the candidates to succeed Mr Olmert as party leader .
According to the book Boomerang , by Ofer Shelah , of Yedhiot Ahronot , and Raviv Drucker , of Channel Ten , Mr Mofaz convened a meeting of brigade and regimental commanders covering the occupied West Bank at Jerusalem 's Ammunition Hill .
It occurred early in the premiership of Ariel Sharon when the intifada was well under way .

The book , which was well reviewed , and was based on extensive interviews with officials and documentary research , chiefly made news when it was published in 2005 because of its contention that Mr Sharon had , in large part , dismantled the Jewish settlements in Gaza to deflect the threat of a corruption indictment .
The two prominent journalists say in the book that the chief of staff at one stage of the Jerusalem meeting – " in an exceptional act " – ordered the person customarily responsible for recording the pronouncements of the military 's top officer on such occasions to stop doing so .
The general then warned , says the book , without placing his remarks in direct quotes , that there would be " no more messages to the Palestinian Authority so that it will act " .
The authors say that Mr Mofaz instead laid down that they call " a price to be set exactly " .
The authors say that he said he wanted " 10 slain Palestinians " in each territorial brigade area .
The book goes on to record that one senior officer then whispered to the Central Command commander , Yitzhak Eitan , that he would be well advised to ask for such an order in writing and added : " It comes to 70 killed a day " .
It then says that General Eitan convened the same group of officers the following day and " made clear that what Mofaz said [ was ] not to be understood as an order and should not be treated as a directive for action . "
But it adds that one officer , the brigade commander in the Hebron area , Colonel Yehuda Albek , " preferred the Mofaz version " to that of General Eitan .
The next day , he began an action near Dahariya against Palestinian police " who had not committed any hostile acts " .
A policeman was killed and several wounded .
When the colonel was summoned to command HQ to explain the operation to his concerned superiors , he said that it was in line with the remarks made earlier by the chief of staff , says the book .
There was no immediate response from Mr Mofaz 's office yesterday to inquiries about the book 's account .
Meanwhile , Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the right - wing Likud , called for an immediate election , which the polls show he would win .
" It does n't make any difference who heads Kadima .
They are all party to a string of failures by this government , " he said .
Mr Netanyahu could get his way if the victor of the Kadima leadership contest fails to form a workable coalition to stay in office .
In that case elections could be called for early next year – with the possibility that Mr Olmert could remain as caretaker prime minister until then .
Facebook game Scrabulous is no longer available to users in North America as the Hasbro case develops .
Hasbro is claiming that Scabulous is a trademark and copyright infringement on Scrabble .
It ’s easy to side with the underdog in the case .
Two guys from India did what Hasbro failed to do , bring a old game to Facebook that became an instant hit .
Hasbro ’s decision to sue Scabulous , instead of working with them , or even acquiring them , is a gross public relations failure , however copyright is a different matter .
Scrabulous was n’t a case of copyright infringement for personal use such as in downloading music , instead the founders of Scrabulous were making $ 25,000 a month , clear commercial copyright infringement .
The RIAA and others may seek to claim that there is no difference between personal use and corporate gain , but depending on the country and law , there is a distinct difference .
Most would consider a moral difference between the two as well .
Scrabulous will lose the case as Hasbro legally holds the copyright over Scrabble and derivative works , however the case highlights the failure of American copyright law in another way : the length of copyright granted under the Sonny Bono Act and the Copyright Act of 1976 .
Scrabble should be in the public domain
Scrabble was created in 1938 by Alfred Mosher Butts .
The game was originally known as Lexiko .
In 1948 , James Brunot acquired the manufacturing rights to the game and changed the name to Scrabble .
Selchow and Righter acquired the rights in 1952 and the trademark in 1972 .
In 1986 the rights passed to Coleco , who quickly went belly up , with Hasbro then acquiring the rights .
( source : Wikipedia )
The key to the history is the date that Scrabble was created : 1938 , 70 years ago .
Even if we take 1948 , the year the game became known as Scrabble , the gap in now 60 years .
Copyright in the United States initially lasted for less than 30 years , but the length of time has been extended by Congress on numerous occasions .
The 1909 Copyright
Act set the duration of copyright protection at twenty - eight years with a possibility of a twenty - eight year extension , for a total maximum term of fifty - six years .
The Copyright Act of 1976 took the length to “ a term consisting of the life of the author and 50 years after the author ’s death . ”
Notably the Act was n’t entirely retrospective , with works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year falling into the public domain .
The Sonny Bono
Act extended the tame frame further to 70 years post death .
Alfred Mosher Butts died in 1993 , meaning that under current law , Scrabble will be protected under copyright until 2063 .
And yet , if Scrabble was treated under the copyright law it was initially published under , it would have come out of copyright in 1994 .
Corporate greed vs the public good
The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution authorizing copyright legislation reads : “ To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . ”
Note the language : securing for limited times to Authors and Inventors .
Some may argue against copyright completely , but as a concept enshrined in the United States constitution , it was meant to protect others from copying works so as to promote the creation of new works , where by the creators of such works could profit from them .
How exactly do the creators of such works profit from their works when they ’ve been dead 20 years , or longer ?
They do n’t .
The concept of copyright as a tool to promote science and arts has been replaced by legal acts of corporate greed .
The only beneficiaries of extended copyright law , in both the 1976 Act and the later Sonny Bono
Act are corporations who hold rights to those works .
The Public Good : Patent vs Copyright
In considering lengths of copyright , it ’s important to consider the benefits of works entering the public domain .
In the manufacture of drugs , American Patent laws grant 20 years exclusivity over a registered drug , after which time others may copy the patent for the production of generic medication .
The legality of patents is granted under the same clause as copyright in the United States Constitution , but why such a lengthy difference in length between inventions and works of art ?
There is a perceived public good with inventions entering the public domain .
Any time you visit a drug store and buy generic medication that is significantly cheaper than the original , you gain from the expiry of that specific drugs patent .
But there is a public good in art works be available in the public domain as well .
We can legally perform , without restriction , a Vivaldi concerto , but we cant legally perform an Elvis song without paying for the rights to do so .
That some may not consider Elvis worthy of the public good is a moot point : the concept of public good is not considered on a case by case basis , it is considered as a whole .
Most would accept that some period of exclusivity should be granted for new works of art , as per the Constitution , but there can be no public good in locking up works of art for hundred of years when we accept that inventions are not extended the same length .
Conclusion
American copyright law has become corrupted from the intent of the founding fathers to promote invention and art , to one that protects special interests without considering the greater good .
Scrabble is 70 years old and is not only covered by copyright today , but will be covered by copyright for another 55 years , for no reason other than some well oiled lobbying of America ’s so - called leaders .
The intent of copyright is to encourage creativity by granting a period of exclusivity , but not at the exclusion of others with time .
Copyright law as it stands today limits the creation of new works by denying the rights of others to create derivative works after a reasonable time .
Copyright law today works against the greater good .

Through tax incentives and other programs , we make sure it 's safe and relatively profitable to grow lots and lots of food on that rich soil of the American grain - growing Midwest , California vegetable farms , and Sunbelt citrus groves .
But when we have a surplus of cheap food , how do we unload it so the price does n't fall so far that our farmers go out of business ?
We sell it below value in foreign countries .
That practice of ours has been putting small farmers out of business all over Africa and many other countries .
Foreigners can buy American food for less , even after all the shipping costs , than they can get it from farms fifteen miles away in their own countries .
The result has been a flood of small farmers in many countries to urban centers that do n't have jobs for them .
I 've seen poverty like that firsthand in Brazil in the 1970s -- though there it was n't the fault of American farm policy .
Highways lined with poor families walking from their abandoned farmsteads or farming jobs to go live in favelas on the fringes of the big city and beg on the street to survive .
In some places , famines are artificial and caused by wars or vicious government policies -- one thinks of Ethiopia twenty years ago and Darfur right now .
But at this moment , millions of people have been plunged suddenly into serious malnutrition because the cost of food in their countries has doubled -- or tripled .
Why ?
Because of another American agricultural policy .
Now that we 've made people in many other countries dependent on cheap American food , all of a sudden we started paying farmers to stop growing food and start growing ethanol .
That 's right .
Using the rising price of gasoline and our need for energy independence as an excuse , midwestern farmers are now being paid to grow corn and soybeans solely so that it can be converted into something our cars can burn .
And guess what that did to those food surpluses we used to sell overseas ?
After destroying the agricultural base of many countries , we have suddenly pulled the rug out from under them .
They can still get food , but it costs three times as much .
In other words , we have done to them just what the oil - exporting countries ( led by Russia , with its deliberately slowed - down production ) have done to us .
We complain about the evil conspiracy that drove up our oil prices and want to punish Exxon , even though they do n't control the price .
We whine and cry about it even though we still pay less than most countries for our fuel .
But we have carelessly done the same thing to the poorest people in the world , and we 've done it , not with gas , but with the food they feed their children .
Ethanol Solves Nothing
The irony is that our ethanol program is not helpful in any way toward solving the coming petroleum crisis .
It 's not just that you have to burn a lot of fuel running the heavy equipment we use to plow , plant , and harvest the crops that we turn into fuel .
The real problem is that the soil of the Midwest is not all that rich .
We 've been overfarming it for years , and the only reason we get the huge crops we get is because of fertilizer .
And guess what it takes to make the fertilizers that are most widely used ?
Natural gas .
I had n't known that before I started doing a little research .
I always thought fertilizer had manure and compost in it -- that it was all made from waste products .
But no , a huge proportion of the fertilizer we use comes from petrochemicals .
If we run out of natural gas ( and there 's no reason to think we wo n't ) , we wo n't be able to fertilize our fields so we can grow the crops that we turn into ethanol .
This is why ethanol solves nothing .
It is part of the problem .
So we 're starving people in other countries because we have fooled ourselves into thinking that we can farm our way out of our oil - and - gas problem -- though it takes oil and gas to do the kind of farming that lets us grow enough crops to burn large quantities of them as ethanol .
Even if the margin still allows us to save some petroleum and gas by using ethanol , is it enough that it 's worth starving foreigners so we can drive our cars cheaply , as much as we want ?
Let Them Grow Rice
Naturally , some will think that people in those other countries can just leave the city and go back to farming .
First , even if that 's possible in the long run , it wo n't help them this year .
If you have a shortage of , say , toasters , you can run the toaster factories day and night , putting on extra shifts and hiring extra workers , and in only a few days , extra toasters are on the market .
But you can't do that with food .
No matter how hungry you are , you still have to wait for planting season and then wait longer for the plants to grow and produce the fruit or roots or seeds or leaves or stems that we need to eat .
A year , folks , at least with most plants .
It 's even more complicated than that .
Some of these people left the land twenty years ago .
The ones who farmed are now old .
The young people have never lived on the farm .
They do n't know how to do it anymore .
My ancestors were very good farmers .
That does n't mean I know anything at all about growing plants .
Especially not in North Carolina , where exactly none of my ancestors lived .
Even worse is the land problem .
Right now in rice - growing countries , every square inch of rice - able land is already under cultivation .
And land that used to be farmed is now covered with cities and roads or inundated by dams .
In other words , there 's less and less land , so taking up the slack when America lowers its production is impossible in the short term , and pretty hard in the long term .
Do We Have a Duty to Feed the World ?
Yes .
Why ?
Because we can .
If we can feed the world , and have made them dependent on our agriculture for their survival , and then choose not to produce enough food to feed them at affordable prices , then we do n't have any moral right to continue to live our high life with our much - vaunted freedom -- we cannot build our prosperity on the hunger and starvation of millions of people abroad .
What About Our Need for Fuel ?
Ethanol is about as sensible as fuel cells as a " solution " to the looming oil crisis .
It 's true that many of the world 's richest oil fields are well past peak production , and new finds are not keeping pace with the fields that will soon be going off line .
But ethanol is not a " solution , " just a slight augmentation , a momentary slowdown in the exhaustion of oil and natural gas .
And fuel cells are n't even that :
They 're just an energy storage system .
They consume more energy than simply burning gas .
Even shale oil and new oil field finds are mere postponements .
No geologist seriously suggests that we are not nearing the end of economically extractable oil and gas .
In a mere century and a half , we will have burnt nearly all the petroleum and natural gas that can be reached by any known method .
Not that it was n't a wonderful ride -- look at our population !
Billions and billions , in large part because cheap fuel made it possible for every corner of the world to trade with every other , and to transport foodstuffs across vast distances .
And we Americans have ridden the crest of the wave .
We never had a shortage of food in our own country -- but now we import fresh fruits and vegetables , at huge expense in fuel costs , from southern - hemisphere countries so that everything is always in season .
What we must have , and quickly , are sources of energy that do n't involve any consumption of oil .
Whenever anyone suggests that we use wind , waves , tides , rivers , solar collectors , photovoltaic cells , or geothermal energy , people always trot out stats showing that these sources can only meet " 5 % " or " 2 % " of our national energy needs .
But what if we do all of them ?
How long before they 're meeting , in combination 20 % or more of our power needs ?
Another objection :
We have too many furnaces that depend on heating oil or natural gas , and electricity does n't always work as well .
My answer is : So what ?
When we run out of heating oil and natural gas , then the efficiency of appliances powered by those fuels will be zero .
Twenty percent of our current energy needs is not trivial -- it 's worth subsidizing .
Nuclear Power
I 'm fed up with people complaining about the dangers of nuclear power .
It 's true that a nuclear meltdown can have devastating effects .
Compare it with global starvation and then see what you think .
The effects of nuclear meltdown can be prevented by rigorous maintenance and oversight .
But when there 's not enough food , there 's just flat - out not enough food .
We have better designs for nuclear power than ever .
We need to treat this as a national emergency and start bringing more nuclear power online -- the way France already has -- with the same kind of national effort that we put into building the interstate highway system or getting to the moon .
All these power sources impose costs , and all of them result in electricity , which is useless to an internal combustion engine .
We 'll have to convert over completely to electric cars and other electrical transportation systems .
So ... we 'll drive slower and have to stop and recharge more often .
Or we 'll have to use more public transportation .
Boo hoo .
We 'll get used to it in no time .
It 's better than the disaster that will strike if we do n't act now to get the infrastructure in place to deal with our inevitable , and fast - coming , post - oil future .
The Free Market Likes Devastation
I hear conservatives who hate the idea of the government taking action trumpeting the idea that the free market will deal with the end of oil .
This is such hogwash .
The free market does n't do anything -- it just decides how much it will cost .
If there 's nothing to sell that will do the job , then the price of it will be very high and making it will be very profitable -- except that there is n't any to sell so the free market will be helpless .
The free market did n't build the interstate highway system -- or the intercontinental railway before it .
Government did .
The free market will burn every ounce of oil and then collapse .
Careful but rapid government - subsidized work on new infrastructure can make it so there 's no collapse at all .
If we do it soon enough , we might even be able to stop using petrochemicals for fuel and fertilizer soon enough that we 'll still have plenty left for airplane and spacecraft fuel , where electricity just does n't do the job .
Back to Food
Which brings us back to food .
Because it 's not just about our cars .
When oil is nearly gone , where do you think we 'll spend the last dregs of it ?
It wo n't be in our cars -- we 'll be walking to the supermarket by then .
We 'll be spending it on trucks carrying food from distant farmlands to the big city .
That 's why we need an agricultural revolution just as badly as we need a fuel revolution .
And for precisely the same reason , and on exactly the same schedule .
Cuba , of all places , has been doing interesting work .
When their subsidy from the USSR ended ( along with the USSR ) , they had to reinvent agriculture .
It had to be moved closer to the city .
So , horrible as their form of government is , they were able to adapt quickly .
They encouraged urban and near - urban agriculture and allowed it to be private rather than collective .
As a result , some urban space was reclaimed for agriculture and a notable percentage of the need for vegetables is being met by , yes , the free market -- instead of the black market .
Meanwhile , they have been working with non-petrochemical fertilizing systems .
We do n't use those chemical fertilizers because they 're necessarily the best -- we use them because they 're the cheapest to make and transport .
That wo n't be true for much longer , so the government needs to subsidize or incentivize alternate fertilization methods .
There are , for instance , plants -- no , let 's admit they 're weeds -- that can be safely grown along with cash crops .
Or cash crops that can be grown together and benefit each other .
The " weeds " help protect the soil from erosion ; they help replenish the soil without additional fertilizer .
Organic farmers have also developed methods that work quite well .
Work with genetics is creating crops that resist pests without using petrochemical - based insecticides .
Right now government incentives are everywhere in agriculture and transportation .
It 's not like I 'm proposing that we introduce a lot of government regulation or fiddling in a pristine field that is right now a free - market paradise .
I 'm saying it 's time to stop incentivizing destructive programs like ethanol and start shaping our system so it rewards foresight and preparation for the future .
The future has no burnable petroleum or methane in it .
Period .
That 's a fact -- the only disagreement is about the schedule .
People are already starving around the world in part because of wrong - headed government intervention in the U.S. agriculture and transportation system .
Why not do the compassionate , smart , foresighted thing and solve the problem now ?
It does n't even take serious sacrifice .
It only takes brains .
Earmarks and Pork Barrel
Why are we subsidizing the useless ethanol system ?
Politics .
Congresswights from the ethanol - growing states are behind the program because it means immediate cash to farmers and voters in their states .
Shame on them for starving people in other countries just for the sake of fat - cat contributions and votes .
Do they really think their continuation in office is worth the death of a single child in Bangladesh ?
Why are n't we moving ahead lickety - split with incentives for non-petrochemical agriculture and with nuclear and renewable energy sources ?
Why are n't we mandating efficient electricity - based long - and short - distance transportation systems at the expense of automobiles ?
Right now the electricity comes largely from coal , which does not solve the non-existent carbon - emissions problem -- but even if you believe in Al Gore 's sad little god called Global Warming , you must surely see that all the non-carbon - based fuel systems will service only electric - powered vehicles .
Therefore , converting completely to electricity is one of the steps along the way to non-carbon - based transportation , even if we do n't yet have enough non-carbon electricity to supply it .
Why do we continue to build more interstates instead of working as fast as we can to get every single truck off the highway and onto the backs of trains ?
Part of our national salvation is going to be rebuilding our railroads with brand - new high - efficiency rails and many , many more miles of parallel tracks .
We would never have become dependent on trucks and cars to the degree we have today if government had not created the interstate highway system .
Our goal now should be -- must be -- to make it useless and unused as quickly as possible , and replace it with faster passenger trains and vastly more freight trains , all of them powered by electricity alone .
Electricity that will eventually be generated by non-carbon - based systems .
You want pork barrel , Mr. Congressman ?
Then get government to subsidize or give tax breaks to the companies building and installing photovoltaic roofs , or at least plant - growing self - air - conditioning roofs , on every house and building in your district or state -- and then make sure you have companies in your state carrying out this business .
Are We the Stupidest Civilization in History ?
You 've got to give Rome some credit here -- they really could n't see their fall coming .
But the fall of Western Civilization is so absolutely predictable and obvious , and its causes are so visible and imminent , that history will surely record ours as being the stupidest civilization that ever existed .
We have the money , right now , to convert to systems of transportation and agriculture that do not require any burnable fuel ( beyond infinitely renewable hydrogen as a storage and transportation device ) .
Instead , we go on mainlining petroleum and methane and then gibber on about how our " free market " or " democracy " will triumph over everything .
The free market creates nothing and does not care .
And democracy lasts only while stomachs are full -- and armies have the fuel to move .
Global Warming -- or , I should say , Climate Change ?
A phony , a bugbear exploited by cynical liars like Al Gore for their personal benefit .
The coming collapse in oil ?
This is one that is visible , obvious , provable .
Our presidential candidates are all claiming that they 'll adopt genuinely harmful , stupid , unfair , and ineffective treaties like Kyoto to solve the nonproblem of carbon emissions .
Not one of them is offering a single coherent idea about achieving complete independence from petroleum and methane before it is forced on us , suddenly and with cataclysmic results .
So I guess now is not the time to suggest that our space program 's first priority should be to prepare to divert or destroy any meteor on a collision course with Earth .
It 's just another of those inevitable but unschedulable world - wrecking events that we 're just too dumb to foresee and prevent .

The true story and the challenge of the Cuban journalists
* * *
Excerpt : `` Out of a basically humanist sentiment , we rejoiced at the news that Ingrid Betancourt , three US citizens and other captives had been released .
The civilians should have never been kidnapped , nor should they have been kept prisoners in the conditions of the jungle .
These were objectively cruel actions .
No revolutionary purpose could justify it .
The time will come when the subjective factors should be analysed in depth . ''

By Fidel Castro Ruz
July 3 , 2008 --
Seven days ago I wrote about one of the great men in history : Salvador Allende , a man the world remembered with deep emotion and respect on his first centennial .
However , no one quivered or even recalled the date of October 24 , 1891 , when the Dominica Republic 's despot Rafael Leonidas Trujillo was born , eighteen years before our admired Chilean brother .
Both countries , one in the Caribbean and the other in the extreme south of Latin America , suffered the consequences of the danger that Jose Marti foresaw and tried to avert .
As he indicated in his celebrated posthumous letter to his Mexican friend who had fought with Juarez -- and this is an idea I never tire of repeating : “ Now , I am everyday in danger of giving my life ... to timely prevent with the independence of Cuba that the United States expand over the Antilles and that , with that additional force , they may come against our American lands .
Everything I 've done until today , and everything I 'll do , is for that purpose . ”
Our victorious revolution was a friend of Allende , at the same time it hated Trujillo .
This was an uncouth Pinochet begotten by the United States in the Caribbean .
The despot had been the result of one of the Yankees ' military interventions in the island that country shares with Haiti , a country which was the first Spanish colony .
The US Navy infantry had invaded that sister republic to secure its country 's economic and strategic interests .
Of course , there was not even a Platt Amendment there to cover up the action with a legal mantle .
In 1918 , the US recruited , among others , the adventurous and greedy native Dominican , the son of a small merchant , who was then trained and admitted , as a 27 - year old , to the National Army .
In 1921 , he went on to another training course with the Military Academy established by the country 's occupiers .
After he finished there , he was appointed unit chief and promoted to the rank of captain for the services paid to the interventionist forces , although he was not previously a lieutenant .
At the end of the Yankee occupation in 1924 , Trujillo was ready to act as an instrument of the United States in high posts in the military , which he would use to deal the classic coup d’etat and the typical “ democratic elections ” leading him to the presidency of the republic in 1930 .
The beginning of his term coincided with the years of the Great Depression that hit the US economy so badly .
Cuba , the country most dependent and shackled by the trade agreements , stood to suffer the most severe consequences of that crisis .
On the other hand , the naval base and the humiliating and unwarranted Platt Amendment would give the US constitutional rights to intervene in our nation and to tear to pieces it glorious history .
In the neighbouring country , with less direct economic dependence , the shrewd and voracious Trujillo handled whimsically the properties of the Dominican middle class and the oligarchy .
The major sugar mills and many other branches of industry became his private property .
That cult to private appropriation did not offend the capitalist concepts of the empire .
Many neon signs claimed everywhere ``God and Trujillo ' ' .
Many cities , avenues , roads and buildings were named after him or his relatives .
The same year he became president , a hurricane hit hard on Santo Domingo , the country 's capital .
After the city recovered from the damage , he renamed it Trujillo City .
Never before had the world known such a personality cult .
In the year 1937 , he carried out along the border a huge massacre of Haitian workers .
This was his reserve labour force in agriculture and construction .
He was a steady US ally .
He was involved in the inception of both the United Nations and the OAS in 1948 .
On December 15 , 1952 , he travelled to Washington in his other capacity as plenipotentiary ambassador to the Organisation of American States and stayed in that country for three and a half months .
On July 2 , 1954 , he travelled to Spain on board a transatlantic ship which took him to Vigo .
Franco , who was already an ally of the empire , welcomed him at the Madrid North Station accompanied by all members of the diplomatic corp .
My relationship with the Dominican Republic dates back to my days at the university .
I had been honoured with an appointment to president of the Committee for Dominican Democracy .
It did not sound as a very important position , but since I was kind of rebellious , I took it seriously .
The time to do something came up unexpectedly .
The Dominican exiled fostered in Cuba the creation of an expeditionary force .
I enlisted with it when I had not yet completed my sophomore .
I was 21 years old .
I have told the story before of what happened then .
After the frustrated Cayo Confites expedition , I was not among the over 1000 prisoners taken to the Columbia military camp , where Juan Bosch went on a hunger strike .
These men had been incarcerated by the head of the army in Cuba , General Perez Dameras , who had received money from Trujillo to intercept the expedition .
The general did this when the expeditionary were close to the Wind Passage .
A Cuban Navy frigate , aiming with its bow cannons at our leading boat , ordered us to return and to dock at the Antilla 's port .
I then jumped into the water of the Nipe Bay together with three other expeditionaries .
We were four armed men .
I had met Juan Bosch , an outstanding Dominican leader , in Cayo Confites , where we trained , and we talked at length .
He was not the chief of the expedition but he was certainly the most prestigious personality among the Dominicans , even if he was ignored by some of the main leaders of that movement and by the Cuban chieftains who had rather important and well paid official relations .
I was then very far from even imagining this that I ’m writing today !
Eleven years later , when our fight in the Sierra Maestra Mountains was about to successfully conclude , Trujillo granted a credit to Batista to buy weapons and ammunition , which were brought by plane in the second quarter of 1958 .
He also volunteered to fly in 3000 Dominican troops , and later another force that would land in Oriente .
Batista 's tyranny was defeated on January 1 , 1959 , thanks to the hard blows dealt by the Rebel Army and the revolutionary general strike .
The repressive state came crumbling down all throughout the island and Batista left for the Dominican Republic .
He travelled there in the company of other sinister characters of that regime , such as the well - known thug Lutgardo Martin Perez , his 25 - year - old son Roberto Martin Perez Rodriguez and a group of the top military chiefs of his defeated army .
Trujillo offered Batista a warm welcome and accommodated him at an official residence for distinguished guests , although he later sent him to a luxurious hotel .
He was concerned over the example of the Cuban Revolution , therefore , he counted on the top chiefs of Batista 's former army and the likely support of the tens of thousands of members of the three army branches and the police to organise a counterrevolution and support it with the Caribbean Legion , which might have had about 25,000 soldiers from the Dominican Army .
The US administration , being aware of these plans , sent a CIA officer to Santo Domingo to talk with Trujillo and assess his plans against Cuba .
By midst February 1959 , this man met with John Abbes Garcia , head of the Dominican intelligence services to whom he recommended to send agents to recruit hostile elements in the ranks of the victorious revolution .
He did not say that the US government already had William Alexander Morgan Ruderth , a US citizen and CIA agent , who had infiltrated the second front in the Escambray , a man they had promoted to the rank of commander and who was one of the main chiefs there .
The development of these events , which make for a fascinating story , can be found in the books of senior Cuban intelligence and security officers , in the testimonies of leaders of military units of the Rebel Army who were directly involved , in autobiographies , official statements made in those days and reports by national and foreign journalists , all of whom it would be impossible to mention in this reflection .
There is another book in the process of publication written by a comrade who joined the militias when he was 17 , and who for his good conduct and sharp mind was then transferred to the prime minister 's and commander in chief 's security detail , where he studied to become a stenographer , then took notes of the conversations and collected the testimony of hundreds of participants in the events he narrates .
This chapter of the history of our revolution has yet to be recounted .
As is understood , the top revolutionary leaders were constantly informed of the news about the enemy 's plans .
We then conceived the idea of dealing the Yankees ' , Batista 's and Trujillo 's counterrevolution a hard blow .
When the weapons sent by sea from Florida to carry out the first actions and the chiefs and plotters were all under strict control , we simulated a successful counterrevolution in the mountainous Escambray zone , and in Trinidad , which had an airstrip .
We then proceeded to isolate the municipality of that small and friendly town where revolutionary political work was intensified .
Trujillo was full of enthusiasm .
A company of our soldiers disguised as peasants shouted at the airstrip : “ Long live Trujillo !
Down with Fidel ! ” which was reported to headquarters in the Dominican Republic .
They had dropped plenty of ammunition from planes .
Everything was unfolding according to plan .
On August 13 , a plane came in with a special envoy from Trujillo .
It was Luis del Pozo Jimenez , the son of a former mayor and Batista follower in the capital and a prominent figure with the regime .
He pointed out on a map the positions that would be bombed by the Dominican Air Force and inquired about the number of legionnaires necessary in the first stage .
Another notable envoy came with him .
It was Roberto Martin Perez Rodriguez who , as we have already indicated , had travelled with his father and Batista as they escaped to the Dominican Republic that January 1 .
He was accompanied by several mercenary leaders who would stay behind .
The plane had to go back .
Its crew was the same that had carried Batista when he ran away .
I was in proximity of the airstrip with Camilo Cienfuegos and other military chiefs .
The head of the Cuban military personnel who had to unload the weapons and communication equipment had understood that they should arrest the aircraft crew .
At this point , a co-pilot realised that something was wrong and a shootout ensued .
Trujillo's envoys and the other mercenary chiefs were then arrested .
There were casualties .
That same night I visited the wounded from both sides .
We could n't go ahead with the plan .
Up until then , communications between Trujillo and the counterrevolution in the Escambray had taken place through short wave .
Trujillos 's official radio station broadcast triumphant military reports similar to those we would hear from Radio Swan and Miami in the days of Giron .
We never used Cuba 's public stations to spread false official reports .
It would have been possible to continue with the game even after the plane had been seized and Luis del Pozo Jimenez and Roberto Martin Perez Rodriguez were arrested .
We could have faked a mechanical failure of the plane that should have returned there , but that would have misled and confused our people , which were by then restless over the news about the alleged counterrevolutionary victories in Escambray publicly spread from Trujillo City .
That August 13 , 1959 , was my 33rd birthday .
I was in my prime , physically and mentally strong .
It was a major revolutionary victory , but at the same time a signal about the times that would come and a sad gift from Rafael Leonidas Trujillo on my anniversary .
Twenty months later we would be fighting at Giron [ Bay of Pigs ] ; there would be violence and bloodshed in the Escambray , by the sea shore , in towns and all over the country .
It was the counterrevolution organised by the United States .
In that country they would have executed Roberto Martin Perez Rodriguez and Luis del Pozo Jimenez , as mercenaries in the service of an enemy power .
The Revolutionary Courts sentenced them to prison , and they were not mistreated .
What was the final destiny of Martin Perez ?
He migrated to the United States , legally , and he is today a standard bearer of the Cuban American terrorist mafia which supports Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
A distinguished Canadian journalist and researcher , Jean - Guy Allard , describes the terrorist life of Roberto Martin Perez Rodriguez as follows :
“ … in fact , since early in his life , ‘ Macho ’ [ his nickname ] Martin Perez joined the Batista police and , for his special merits , that is , his beating of the prisoners in the last months of the bloody regime , he earned the rank of Sergeant .
“ Both , the father and son were so close to Batista that , on January 1st , 1959 , instead of running away to Miami , they followed the dictator to his sanctuary in the Dominican Republic .
“ … released on May 29 , 1987 … in 1989 he joined the Cuban American National Foundation ( CANF ) established by the CIA under Ronald Reagan .
“ He would very soon be leading the paramilitary committee created by this organization which ensures the financing , among others , of the terrorist group Alpha 66 and other extremist groups acting against Cuba .
“ … Martin Perez Rodriguez took part in the arrangement of a series of failed attempts on the life the President of Cuba during various Ibero American Summits .
“ In 1994 , on the occasion of Fidel ’s attendance to the 4th Summit , in Cartagena de Indias , Colombia … he purchased a 50 mm Barret gun and explosives which were transferred to Colombia from Miami … by plane !
“ …he plotted with Jimenez Escobedo and Eugenio LLameras with a view to the 5th Ibero American Summit in 1995 .
That year , he revived the same plan for the Non Aligned Movement Summit , also in Cartagena de Indias , Colombia .
“ In 1997 , at Margarita Island , Venezuela , on the occasion of the 7th Ibero American Summit of Heads of Sate and Government , Posada mounted another conspiracy with direct support from Martin Perez Rodriguez and other leaders of CANF …
“ …he signed the Declaration of support for terrorism against Cuba published by the Foundation on August 11th … Roberto Martin Perez , Feliciano Foyo and Horacio Garcia are some of the people Posada publicly named as the ‘ financiers ’ of his terrorist actions during his interview with the New York Times in 1997 .
“ …he sponsored in Miami an exhibition of paintings by [ Orlando ] Bosch and Posada [ Carriles ] , the two masterminds of the sabotage against the Cuban civilian plane , in 1976 , where 73 people were killed .
“ In 1998 , the great advocate of the ‘ political prisoner ’ carried out one of his dirtiest deeds : with other Miami Mafia ringleaders …he led the new FBI chief , the very corruptible Hector Pesquera , to the arrest of five Cubans who had infiltrated the ranks of the terrorist organizations .
“ …his unfailing friendship with Guillermo Novo Sampol , the murderer of Chilean leader Orlando Letelier is well known …
“ The Republican candidate should know that his 73 - year - old protégé was the first to assert that on the day of his longed for victory over the Cuban Revolution he would drive a bulldozer from the Cabo San Antonio to the Punta de Maisicrushing the island population guilty of any links with the Revolution .
“ … on another occasion , asked about the risk of killing innocents in an attempt on Cuban leaders he said that he did n’t care if ‘ the Pope died ’ . ”
The historical truth tells us that John McCain 's father commandeered the amphibious attack , the invasion and occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1965 against the nationalist forces led by Francisco Caamaño , another great hero of that nation whom I knew very well and who always had confidence in Cuba .
Dedication to Cuban journalists and honesty
I dedicate this reflection on historical events to our dear journalists , since it coincides with the 8th Congress of the Union of Cuban Journalists ( UPEC , by its Spanish acronym ) , whom I consider like family .
How I would have liked to study the techniques of their trade !
The UPEC has been very generous in publishing a book under the title Fidel , the journalist , which will be presented tomorrow afternoon .
They sent me a copy with several articles published in clandestine or legal newspapers over five decades ago , with a prologue by Guillermo Cabrera Alvarez and the selection , introduction and notes by Ana Nuñez Machin .
I gave Guillermo Cabrera the nickname of “ the genius ” since I first met him .
It was the impression I received from that great man who unfortunately passed away last year .
He had had a heart surgery some time ago at the prestigious Cardiovascular Center established by our revolution in Santa Clara City .
I reread some of the articles published in Alerta , Bohemia and La Calle , and I relived those years .
I wrote those articles when I felt the need to convey certain ideas .
I did it out of pure revolutionary instinct .
I always applied the principle that words should be simple and the concepts understandable to the masses .
Today I have more experience , but I 'm not as strong ; it 's harder for me to do it .
Our people 's educational level is higher with the revolution , thus the task is more difficult .
From the revolutionary point of view , discrepancies are not important ; it is the honesty of the opinion that counts .
And , it is from the contradictions that the truth will emerge .
Perhaps , it would be worthwhile some other time to make an effort to make some observations on this issue .
Ingrid Betancourt 's release in Colombia
Yesterday , an important event took place , which will be an issue the following days .
This is the release of Ingrid Betancourt and a group of people held by the FARC , that is , the Revolutionary Armed Forces from Colombia .
On January 10 this year , our ambassador to Venezuela , German Sanchez , following a request of the Venezuelan and Colombian governments , took part in the release of Clara Rojas to the International Red Cross .
She had been a candidate for vice - president of Colombia when Ingrid Betancourt was running for president and was kidnapped on February 23 , 2002 .
Consuelo Gonzalez , a member of the House of Representatives , kidnapped on September 10 , 2001 , was released with her .
An era of peace was opening for Colombia .
This is a process Cuba has been supporting for over two decades , as it is most convenient for the unity and peace of the peoples of our America , using new ways in the special and complex circumstances prevailing after the demise of the USSR in the early 1990s -- which I wo n't try to analyse here -- very different from those existing in Cuba , Nicaragua and other countries in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s .
The bombing of a camp in Ecuadorian soil in the early hours of March 1 -- while Colombian guerrillas and young visitors from different nationalities were sleeping -- using Yankee technology ; the occupation of the territory , the coup de grace on the wounded and the kidnapping of corpses as part of the terrorist plan from the United States government was repudiated the world over .
A Rio Group meeting was then held in the Dominican Republic on March 7 .
There the events were strongly condemned while the US administration applauded .
Manuel Marulanda , a peasant and communist militant , the main leader of that guerrilla group founded almost half a century ago was still alive .
He passed away on the 26th of that same month .
Ingrid Betancourt , feeble and sick , as well as other captives with a serious health condition could hardly resist any longer .
Out of a basically humanist sentiment , we rejoiced at the news that Ingrid Betancourt , three US citizens and other captives had been released .
The civilians should have never been kidnapped , nor should they have been kept prisoners in the conditions of the jungle .
These were objectively cruel actions .
No revolutionary purpose could justify it .
The time will come when the subjective factors should be analysed in depth .
We won our revolutionary war in Cuba by immediately releasing every prisoner absolutely unconditionally .
The soldiers and officers captured in battle were released to the International Red Cross ; we only kept their weapons .
No soldier will ever surrender if he thinks he will be killed or subjected to cruel treatment .
We are watching with concern how the imperialists try to capitalise on what happened in Colombia in order to hide and justify their heinous crimes of genocide against other peoples .
They want to deflect international attention from their interventionist plans in Venezuela and Bolivia and from the presence of the 4th Fleet in support of the political line that intends to obliterate the independence of the countries located south of the United States while taking possession of their natural resources .
These should be illustrative examples for all of our journalists .
In our times , truth is navigating rough seas , where the mass media are in the hands of those threatening human survival with their immense economic , technologic and military resources .
That 's the challenge faced by the Cuban journalists !
Fidel Castro Ruz , July 3 , 2008 , 4.26 pm .
Friday has come and gone .
In quiet style , another U.S. bank has been closed by the FDIC : First Priority Bank of Bradenton , Florida .
The appearance of reality is that a number of banks will fail in the short - term without warning .
What do you do when your bank is closed by the FDIC ?
Do n’t panic by storming the doors .
Assuming that you follow the $ 100,000 account rule , Uncle Sam has you covered .
The FDIC has provisions to make your life much simpler without losing your cool .
In the case of First Priority Bank , all non-brokered deposits ( more details ) have been transferred to SunTrust Bank .
The bank will re-open on Monday during regular business hours at the former First Priority Bank main office and branch locations and money usage is uninterrupted .
The change is designed to be transparent and you maintain the right to withdraw your money based on available funds during any business day .
After all , the FDIC does n’t want a loss of confidence on their hands .
You are well covered .
The first best thing to do is the visit the FDIC website .
You will find a press release about any closed banks on the front page of the FDIC website near the top .
On the press release , you will find a link that will allow you to verify the insurance status of each of your accounts .
This link will be available for use no later than the first business day after bank failure .
There is a linked list of any affidavits , forms and any declarations that may relate to your bank closing along with complete instructions , assuming that you need them .
In a pinch , you can call the FDIC Call Center at 800 - 837-0215 during posted hours , which are generally quite generous .
That is all there is to the initial process .
In the case of First Priority Bank , insured funds are now in the receivership of SunTrust Bank .
You are n’t required to do a thing to protect your insured money .
Of course , proper money management considering insurance coverage limits is always your best protection .
Avoiding brokered accounts is probably good medicine as well during these troubled times to avoid needless complexity .
Buck up soldier .
Unless you are a careless millionaire , you are probably well taken care of right now .
But how many millionaires have bundles sitting in a bank at low or no interest ?
Mr. Joe Average is well protected for checking and savings .
Having a fit , should you choose to have one , ought to be reserved for more serious economic situations .

The flag and coat of arms of Siauliai district was drawn according to pictures , which was taken from booklet : DISTRICT OF SIAULIAI AND ITS CONTEMPORARY HERALDRY [ L a L 02 ] .
Here is information from this book :
" Siauliai District is a peculiar territory of Northern Lithuania .
The biggest part of it lies in the ancient lands of Siauliai ( the Sun ) , the western part in the former lands of Knituva .
The present territory of Siauliai District is 1819 km2 .
Its western part is populated by the western Samogitians ( Varniai ) , the biggest part - by the western Highlanders ( aukstaiciai , Siauliai ) .
The number of the population is 51,200 ( data of 2001 ) .
The Via Hanza ( Ryga - Berlin ) and Panevezys - Palanga highways , the railway lines Vilnius - Klaipeda , Vilnius - Mazeikiai , Vilnius - Ryga cross the territory .
Siauliai District was formed in 1950 and has undergone several territorial - administrative reforms : in 1962 Siauliai and Kursenai Districts were joined into one with the administrative centre in Siauliai , so the present territory of Siauliai District has been in existence for 40 years .
Since 1963 the rural districts of Bazilionai , Ginkunai , Gruzdziai , Kairiai , Kursenai , Kurtuvenai , Kuziai , Meskuiciai , Micaiciai , Pakape , Raudenai , Smilgiai and Sakyna were included into the territory .
Since 1995 the District Municipality Administration has been reorganised and the territory has been divided into 10 smaller administrative units ( seniunijos ) : Kursenai town , Bubiai , Gruzdziai , Kursenai rural , Kuziai , Meskuiciai , Raudenai , Sakyna , and Siauliai rural .
Since 2001 Ginkunai has come into existence .
Later the rural unit of Siauliai was subdivided into 2 .
Siauliai District Municipality was headed by K. Purvinskas ( 1965 - 1969 ) , J. Leinartas ( 1965 - 1969 ) , A. Norvilis ( 1969 - 1975 ) , V. Budrikis ( 1975 - 1978 ) , A. Morkunas ( 1978-1990 ) .
After the restoration of the Independence of Lithuania V.Krasauskas ( 1990 - 1994 ) , R. Maciunas ( 1994-1995 ) , B. Cekanauskas ( 1995 ) , V. Girnius ( 1995 - 1996 ) , A. Jonuska ( 1997 -2000 ) acted as the heads of the Municipality .
R. Jakutis , present Mayor of the District Council , has been elected on April 3,2000 .
The Act on the Restoration of the State Independence has brought significant changes into the cultural and spiritual life of local people , new opportunities of free and democratic development have been created for the whole country and the District in particular .
Values of the past , historical symbols have been revived .
The State symbols - the national flag , the anthem , the historical coat of arms ( the Vytis ) have been legalised , the historical coats of arms of towns have been revived and many new ones have been created .
Kursenai is the first town in the District to get its coat of arms ( 1994 ) .
Later ideas about the creation of the flags and coats of arms for the settlements and centres of the seniunijos were developed and the coats of arms for Sakyna , Kairiai , Gruzdziai , Meskuiciai , Bubiai , Raudenai , and Kuziai were created .
Siauliai District , which occupies a big territory around Siauliai City , never had any coat of arms .
In 2001 the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission was addressed to create the coat of arms and the flag for the District .
The symbols of the District were confirmed by the President of the Republic of Lithuania on February 19,2002 .
The flag and the coat of arms are the heraldic symbols not only of the town as the centre of the rural district ( seniunija ) but of the rural district itself .
New traditions for the use of the coats of arms are being created there by fostering recognition of the past and present , inspiring love for the country and the State and are becoming an inseparable part of the State , city , town and rural district festivals .
Introduction of new heraldic traditions created the necessity for the remaining 3 rural districts of Kursenai , Siauliai and Ginkunai to have the coats of arms of their own .
These heraldic symbols are going to be included into the present publication .
The initiators of this booklet were driven by the fact that the heraldry of the district and some rural districts has been confirmed by the President of the Republic of Lithuania .
The local government and cultural institutions , whose workers organise State and district festivals , the Lithuanian public , especially teachers and students who are interested in the heraldry and history of their country and their locality are to benefit from this publication .
We trust that this booklet will act as a stimulus striving to recognise the historical past of the country and the locality .
Siauliai District Coat of Arms
Siauliai gained its significance as a territorial - administrative centre in the II half of the 18th century .
Up to that the time Raseiniai was the only court centre in Zemaitija ( Samogitia ) .
In 1758 it was requested by the Raseiniai Seimas to found more courts as Zemaitija occupied a big territory with a great number of inhabitants .
In 1764 Zemaitija was divided into two parts ( Lat. repartitio ) of Raseiniai and Telsiai and in 1775 the centre was moved from Telsiai to Siauliai .
In 1790 there were 3 centres in Raseiniai , Siauliai and Telsiai .
The 3 centres and their borders were legalised by the Reform Parliament or the 4 Year Parliament ( 1788 - 1792 ) and in 1793 by the Gardinas Seimas .
The parts were renamed as pavietai , later ( in the 19 th century ) as counties .
In 1775 , when the centre was moved from Telsiai to Siauliai , the court seal depicted the mounted knight of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the land court officer 's coat below .
Such a seal from 1788 shows the knight and Liudvikas Pilsudskis ' , officer 's , coat of arms : an arrow spread wide at the bottom with a half - cross on the right .
After the reform of 1790 the heraldry of Siauliai land was changed : the knight was replaced by the arms of the Duchy of Zemaitija with a bear as to stress the administrative dependence .
Such seals are in several collections : Academy of Sciences Library , Department of Manuscripts , Archives of History of the State of Lithuania , Siauliai Pavietas Land Court .
The seal was redisigned in 1795 , introducing the double - headed eagle of the Russian Empire in the upper and the knight in the lower part .
Such a composition is found in the seals of 1797 and 1814 .
In this way the heraldry of Siauliai land of the 19 th century consists of 3 symbols : the double - headed eagle in the upper , and the knight and the bear in the lower part or the knight and the officer 's coat .
Such a composition might have remained until the middle of the 19 th century .
In 1842 the province of Kaunas was founded with Siauliai as a part of it .
On June 11,1843 , a new emblem was given : a greyish ( silver ) obelisk ( a copy of the Borodino monument commemorating the War of 1812 ) on a field of azure of two merging rivers .
The sketches of the coats of arms of the 6 counties presented for Teodoras Mirkovicius , Vilnius governor , included the one of Siauliai : the upper field of a shield divided per fess was charged with the new Kaunas province coat and the lower field with three shocks of yellowish wheat on a field of green intercrossed with a sickle .
This coat of arms was disapproved by the Vilnius governor who introduced only one shock of wheat , but on April 6 , 1845 the Emperor Nicholas I confirmed the first version .
The original is in the collection of the Russian State Archive in St Petersburg .
It is worth mentioning that the new coat of arms was designed for Siauliai County and later became the coat of arms of Siauliai city .
In 1857 the Heraldry Department led by Bernhard Kohne was founded in the Russian Empire .
New coats were created for the Lithuanian provinces , but the one for Siauliai province contained several mistakes .
It was redesigned by B. Kohne , nevertheless , remained as a paper variant .
World War I and collapse of the Russian Empire brought independence for the Baltic States .
In 1917 the obelisk in Kaunas was torn down by the Germans .
After the formation of the Independent State of Lithuania the historical symbols were resurrected .
Speaking about the Siauliai coat of arms there exists the description of the mysterious coat from the 16th century with three symbols : the knight , the bear and three shocks of wheat .
In 1922 Juozas Tumas Vaizgantas in the magazine " Our Past " published the description of Siauliai County which was originally written by Mauricijus Griskevicius and translated from Polish by Davainis Silvestravicius .
He wrote that Siauliai District was part of Upyte and had the symbol of its own : " a double white cross on a green hill on a field of azure " .
The old heraldry of Siauliai land presents three symbols : the knight , the bear and three shocks of wheat .
Siauliai land belonged to the Duchy of Samogitia although it symbolically as Siauliai land paid taxes to Trakai land .
The design work of the coat of arms for Siauliai District included the wish of Siauliai District Municipality to depict as many as possible historical events : the Sun Battle of 1236 , victory of the Samogitians over the Teutonic Order , the Hill of Crosses visited by Paul II in 1993 , educational and cultural movement in the period of Press Ban .
However , it was impossible to include all those events in one coat of arms , so the choice was made to depict the bear , the war axe and the shield charged with small cross .
The war axe and the figure of the bear taken over from the coat of arms of Samogitia symbolise the victory of the Samogitians over the Teutonic Order .
The shield with crosses is the symbol of the Hill of Crosses as well as the determination of the land to protect the values of Christianity .
The silver colour of the bear represents the historical colour of the Samogitian war flag , the azure of the Trakai land flag .
They remind the double administrative dependence of Siauliai land .
The golden colour is a characteristic colour of nobility , the black - of education and science .
The final design is made by Rolandas Rimkunas : the silver bear with a golden axe in his claws and a shield charged with golden and black crosses at his left shoulder on a field of azure .
The tongue of the bear is red and his claws are golden .
In 2001 the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission was addressed to create the coat of arms and the flag for the District .
The symbols of the District were confirmed by the President of the Republic of Lithuania on February 19 , 2002 . "

Description of the flag of Siauliai district :
The white cloth is charged with the coat of arms of Siauliai district .
The coat of arms is surrounded by eleven eight - pointed stars , which represent eleven municipalities of Siauliai district .
The relationship of the width of the flag to the length is 1:2 .
The relationship of the length of the flag to the length of staff is 1:1.7 .
The flag of Siauliai district was confirmed by the President of the Republic of Lithuania on February 19 , 2002 .
Author - R. Rimkunas .
Description of the flag based on decree of the municipality of Siauliai district ( full text in Lithuanian : < www.siauliai-sav.lt>).

Siauliai District -
On a white field the arms of Siauliai District : on a blue field a silver bear with a golden axe and shield powdered with golden and black crosses , surrounded with by golden 8 - pointed stars .
Flag proportions 5:6 , fringe is golden , finial is golden knob .
The bear means Samogitia , as Siauliai land derives from historic Samogitia ( and partially to ethnic Samogitia too ) , and the silver colour of the bear and white of the flag field also are the traditional white background of Samogitian banners .
But taxes from Siauliai land were paid to Upyte , i.e. to Trakai province .
So the traditional blue of Trakai is used for the field of arms .
The axe symbolizes the victory of Samogitians against the Livonian Order in 1236 at Saule ( most likely the first mention of Siauliai in written sources ) .
The shield with crosses symbolizes both the famous Hill of Crosses and Christian values .
11 stars mean 11 elderships of the district .

It happens all the time does n’t it ?
You need to unmount a CD or you want to pack away the external drive but when you try to umount it you get the dreaded “ device is busy ” message .
Would n’t it be great if Linux actually told you what was keeping the drive busy ?
Here we are in 2008 , I ’m using Ubuntu Gutsy , and that message has n’t changed in all the years I ’ve used Linux .
# umount / media / disk /
umount : / media / disk : device is busy
umount : / media / disk : device is busy
First thing you ’ll do will probably be to close down all your terminals and xterms but here ’s a better way .
You can use the fuser command to find out which process was keeping the device busy :
# fuser -m /dev/sdc1
/dev/sdc1 : 538
# ps auxw|grep 538
donncha 538 0.4 2.7 219212 56792 ?

Seems the act of waking a sleeping laptop to a full - blown OS is no longer in vogue .
We 're not sure when this happened though we 're pretty sure that ASUS ' decision to embed SplashTop into its P5E3 mobo had something to do with it .
The benefit , of course , is an extension of battery life to days instead of hours assuming that you 're not regularly booting into Vista or XP ( which you probably are ) .
Anyway , these new instant - on OSes are all the rage these days in products from netbooks , to ultra-portable fashion statements , and now business laptops thanks to Dell .
Dell 's solution , as applied to its newly announced Latitude E4200 and E4300 , features a fully - dedicated , Linux - based system - on - a - chip subsystem consisting of a low - power ARM processor and flash memory that runs independent of your laptop 's CPU and storage .
The OS is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 and includes a Firefox - based browser with custom email , calendar , and contacts applications , MS Office and PDF viewers , and all the drivers required to make use of the laptop 's hardware and HSDPA radios -- an Instant Messaging client and browser support for Flash and Java are in the works .
Data is pulled ( you set the refresh rate ) from an Exchange server via wireless connection , only .
IT types should be aware that the first batch of Latitudes will ship in a " reader " mode which boots the OS and apps off the laptop 's hard drive and likewise reads the laptop 's cached data .
In November , Dell will rollout the fully embedded Latitude ON system and offer a mini-PCI upgrade to those first - release models .
Check the video after the break to hear Dell explain it in their own words .

Recently , LifeHacker conducted a poll asking readers what their top resolution is for 2007 .
The second most popular resolution was " Save money and get my finances in order . "
Let 's face it : there are millions of people out there who woke up on New Year 's Day resolving to get their finances in better shape .
The vast majority of them will go at it the wrong way : they 'll go about things much like a binge dieter , cutting tons of fat out of their spending for the first few weeks , but eventually they 'll give up and by mid-February , their credit cards will be ballooning again .
Why does this happen ?
The reason is that revamping your personal finances requires a good foundation , most of which has very little to do directly with dollars and cents .
Instead , it requires some careful thinking about not only your specific finances , but also about your life goals and your feelings about money .
Are you willing to spend one hour a day this month to getting on the right financial page and making your resolution a success ?
If you are , let 's get started .
Each day this month around mid-day ( in the United States ) , I 'll post some specific action points for you to follow and think about today .
Some of them you can do on your daily commute just by thinking ; other ones might require some time at home with a calculator or a spreadsheet ( or other things ) .
Each one requires about an hour of your time .
What 's the goal ?
The overall goal of these posts is to transition you from a New Year 's resolution ( or any resolution ) to fix your money to a healthy relationship with your money , with a goal - oriented internal philosophy that makes it easy for you to keep going on the right financial path .
What can I do to rescue my money in the interim ?
Many of these steps ( especially early ones ) wo n't seem to do anything to affect your checkbook .
Why ?
The checkbook is n't really the foundation of your finances .
If you want to do things that will save money in the interim , the best thing you can do is do simple things to trim a bit of spending , such as using the ten second rule .
Other than that , let these steps run their course .
Do not do anything radical !
The plan to fix things must come from within you ; integrating someone else 's plan will cause you lots of frustration .
My plan is to help you define your true goals and figure out what you can do to meet them .
Without further ado , let 's get started .
I 'll add links to all of the steps on this post , so if you want to save them , just bookmark this post .

The House Judiciary Committee is holding hearings today on the numerous abuses of power and impeachable offenses of George W. Bush and right out of the gate , Florida Rep. Robert Wexler lays out the clear case for the need to begin impeachment hearings .
I fully recognize the significance of holding impeachment hearings and I have not come to this position lightly .
Not one bit .
But when an administration takes actions that amount to High Crimes , we , the Representatives of the people , are left with no option other than to seek impeachment and removal from office .
Our government was founded by a delicate balance of powers , whereby one branch carefully checks the other branches to prevent a dangerous consolidation of power .
The actions of this White House have eviscerated this careful balance .
This is not a Democratic or Republican issue .
This is an American issue .
Without these checks and balances the President can run roughshod over any law with impunity .
Congress must end this disturbing pattern of behavior , and in these circumstances , unfortunately , the only option left is impeachment hearings .
You got to give Wexler credit , he 's been very vocal for pushing for accountability and taking the hits from the wingnuts for it .
And now he 's getting support from other Democrats in the House , like Maurice Hinchey :
Congressman Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Friday , July 25 , 2008 during a hearing entitled , " Executive Power and Its Constitutional Limitations . "
Hinchey will highlight the reasons he co-authored two resolutions with U.S. Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) that formally condemn President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and former Attorney General Gonzales for misconduct regarding U.S. military involvement in Iraq and for repeated assaults on the rule of law .
The hearing begins at 10:00 am and can be viewed via the House Judiciary Committee 's webcast .
" President Bush and senior members of his administration have repeatedly defied the Constitution , violated the law , put our country in jeopardy , and made a mockery of our judicial system , " Hinchey said .
" This hearing will enable the facts to be presented in a clear and straightforward way so that the Congress and the American people can more fully understand just how corruptly this administration has operated .
With an eye toward the future , we must ensure that history books note that this Congress stood up to this administration and formally admonished it for all its violations of law . "
Full transcript below the fold
Thank you , Mr. Chairman .
I applaud your tenacity and courage for calling for this hearing .
For the past few months , I have vigorously argued that this committee should be immediately begin impeachment hearings .
The allegations made against the Bush White House documents serious abuses that if proven , would certainly constitute High Crimes .
The White House is charged with deliberately lying to Congress and the American people , manipulating intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , ordering the illegal use of torture , firing US Attorneys for political purposes , denying the legitimate Constitutional powers of congressional oversight by blatantly ordering subpoenas among countless other crimes .
Never before in the history of this nation has an administration so successfully diminished the Constitutional powers of the Legislative branch .
It is unacceptable and it must not stand .
This is not how our Founders so carefully and delicately designed our democracy .
In a deliberate effort to reduce the power of this Congress , and obstruct our ability to provide oversight over the Executive branch , President Bush has ordered Karl Rove , Harriet Miers , Josh Bolten and other administration officials to simply ignore Congress by refusing to testify .
This failure of administration witnesses to even appear is unprecedented in the history of our nation .
The Bush White House has distorted the concept of Executive Privilege beyond recognition in order to hide White House wrongdoings .
Faced with this litany of wrongful actions , I am convinced the most appropriate response to this unprecedented behavior is to hold hearings for impeachment .
[ applause ]
The power of impeachment — excuse me — the power of impeachment , which our Founding Fathers provided to the House of Representatives was designed precisely for this type of wrongdoing .
I fully recognize the significance of holding impeachment hearings and I have not come to this position lightly .
Not one bit .
But when an administration takes actions that amount to High Crimes , we , the Representatives of the people , are left with no option other than to seek impeachment and removal from office .
Our government was founded by a delicate balance of powers , whereby one branch carefully checks the other branches to prevent a dangerous consolidation of power .
The actions of this White House have eviscerated this careful balance .
This is not a Democratic or Republican issue .
This is an American issue .
Without these checks and balances the President can run roughshod over any law with impunity .
Congress must end this disturbing pattern of behavior , and in these circumstances , unfortunately , the only option left is impeachment hearings .
We have been down this road before .
Yes , we have .
In 1973 , Articles of Impeachment were introduced against President Nixon after he inappropriately tried to use Executive Privilege to bury evidence of his wrongdoing .
I think it would be helpful to delve more deeply into what happened during the Nixon administration , particularly as it relates to the obstruction of the oversight powers of this Congress .
Mr. Chairman , I thank you so much for having this hearing and giving the American people an opportunity to hear about how we can begin to take our government and our country back .

What can I possibly say about the “ Fetish ” Barbie scheduled to spank – uh , hit – store shelves this autumn ?
Only that it ’s about time .
And I have to have one .
There ’s a whole cadre of people who have never liked the anatomically impossible doll ’s squeaky - clean image ; some of us even suspected there was a kinky woman inside .
Now she ’s becoming the straight man ’s / lesbian version of Tom ’s of Finland ; the one - time ideal of feminine perfection is all but wielding a whip .
Oh right .
She already did that dressed as Catwoman Barbie .
You had to know this was coming .
First she dumped that white - bread Ken .
Then Mattel began the Barbie Double Entendre Series ( disclaimer : there is no such line ) with the Barbie Hot Tub Bus Vehicle Playset , which sounds an awful lot like those stripper limos that drive around , hmm ?
Black Canary Barbie will be unleashed in September , no doubt spawning a whole new generation of fetishists .
The back - of - box copy reads :
“ Black Canary is dressed in her black motorcycle jacket , fishnet stockings , black gloves , and boots .
This is truly one hot chick ! ”
Dude , she ’s plastic .
And 11.5 ” tall .
And if she were a real woman , she ’d be 7 ’ 2 ” and her boobs would be so huge she ’d… topple … over …
Ohh .
( Point of fact : DC Comics ’ Black Canary has way bigger boobs .
She ’s athletic , curvy and sexy , and she looks like a real woman .
Except she ’s sci-fi .
And drawn in ink . )
Mattel has no problem making their signature doll look like she enjoys tying up men and whipping them , as long as it ’s clear she ’s playing an actress who played a woman whose superpower is , uh , a high - pitched scream .
They want to make sure parents understand she is in no way actually participating in such activities , making doubly sure the icon was two degrees from being mistaken for Dominatrix Barbie .
I have to say , a lot of people have been waiting for this day , simply because they – okay , we – disliked Barbie ’s purity and wanted to see her be , well , dirty .
The Weirdest Barbie Ever
Barbie does n’t look all that out of place in black leather and fishnets , unlike the oddity Mattel is still trying to live down : “ Pooper Scooper ” Barbie .
( Buy here )
That was the most incongruous of all the incarnations .
I would ’ve sworn she was a cat woman .
“ Pooper Scooper ” Barbie will have competition for the Weirdest Barbie come October .
Mattel will release – or maybe sic the birds on – America ’s trademark doll with “ Alfred Hitchcock ’s The Birds Barbie™ ” .
The press release form includes copy from the back of the package :
“ As you can see , the doll is being assaulted by a trio of angry avian attackers , making this one of very few products to be both awesome and classy . ”
“ Assaulted , ” “ awesome ” and “ classy ” in the same sentence ?
That ’s worth the $ 44.99 alone .
But wait !
There ’s more !
Mattel also touts that the doll has “ real fake birds ! ” and “ high - quality head looks scared and has awesome hair ! ” and asks the question on everyone ’s lips ( not ) : “ Will these plastic birds damage her delightful handbag or her carefully styled hair ? ”
Somewhere poor Hitch is watching his own horror movie unfold .
I love reading your comments ( well , most of them ) .
Are you going to join me in collecting bizarre Barbies now ?
What ’s your fantasy Barbie ?
What would you create as her next outfit , character or situation ?
UPDATE : Black Canary is now available .

A new study in Emerging Infectious Diseases concludes that bacteria not influenza killed most people in the 1918 flu epidemic .
The lesson : stock up on antibiotics for the next flu pandemic — bird flu , horse flu , or otherwise .
New Scientist reports that researchers sifted through first - hand accounts , medical records , and infection patterns from 1918 and 1919 .
They found that bacterial pneumonia piggybacked on surprisingly mild flu cases .
And the victims did n’t die fast .
A supervirus would have likely killed them in three days .
Instead , most people lasted more than a week and some survived two weeks — classic hallmarks of pneumonia .
Most compelling : medical experts of the day identified pneumonia as the cause of most of the 100 million deaths — the most lethal natural event in recent human history .
Other research suggests the brutal mechanism .
Influenza killed cells in the respiratory tract , which became food and home for invading bacteria that overwhelmed overstressed immune systems .
Ten years later , penicillin overpowered bacteria in subsequent influenza epidemics .
But nowadays we ’re having those nagging antibiotic problems .
So health authorities are increasingly interested in the role bacteria will likely play in the next pandemic .
Yet little action has been taken .
“ They are just starting to get to the recognition stage , ” says Jonathan McCullers , infectious disease expert .
“ There ’s this collective amnesia about 1918 . ”

Latvian seeks £ 4 million compensation after being jailed for killing Nazi sympathisers in World War Two
Freedom fighter : Vasiliy Kononov during the war
More than 60 years after the end of World War Two , a man is to be judged by Europe 's highest court on whether he was right or wrong to kill Nazi sympathisers collaborating with Hitler .
Latvian Vasiliy Kononov , 85 , is claiming compensation of £ 4 million for being convicted and sentenced to six years imprisonment by his own country in 2001 for the unlawful killing of civilians who had betrayed a partisan group to the Germans .
Kononov , a guerrilla attached to the Soviet Red Army , helped kill the civilian collaborators after tricking them into admitting they had handed the partisans over to the Nazis .
Years later courts in Latvia found him guilty of crimes against humanity .
But Kononov is claiming that he acted correctly in killing the nine civilians in a Latvian village in 1944 , because at the time he was legitimately fighting with the Red Army , and on the side of the Allies including Britain , to repel the Nazis from the Baltic state .
He also claims that he is the victim of political correctness in modern day Latvia , a European Union country where the State now openly defends those who fought for the Nazis against the Soviet army in the Second World War .
The Latvians argue the Soviets were seen as the greater threat to the country 's independence , and this justified siding with Hitler .
The verdict from the European Court of Human Rights , due next month , will effectively re-open the issue of war crimes during the Second World War as established under the Nuremberg trials , by deciding whether a man can be punished for fighting against the Nazis .
It is seen as a test case which could lead to other financial claims in eastern Europe .
' During the war , Kononov was a specialist mine layer who personally destroyed 14 German troop trains heading into his country , ' said his lawyer Mikhail Joffe .
Court battle : Vasiliy Kononov today aged 85 and his lawyer Mikhail Joffe who is taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights
In March , 1944 he was assigned to discover the fate of a partisan group of 12 men led by a Major Chugunov who disappeared near the village of Maliye Baty after being betrayed by villagers in the pay of the Nazis .
Disguised in a Nazi greatcoat , Kononov talked to villagers who boasted how they had betrayed the partisans .
Then Kononov and his men held a war court that convicted the villagers .
The villagers were given a written judgement sentencing them to death .
Most were shot , although a man , and two women were in a building that Kononov set on fire and died in the flames .
In all , nine people were killed , including a child , which Kononov admitted was a mistake .
Kononov , who later became a police colonel in Latvia , was arrested in February 1998 .
Convicted to six years , he spent 620 days in jail during which time his brother and son died .
Kononov was not let out to the funerals .
Human rights lawyer Joffe then began the series of appeals that will end in Strasbourg next month .
The case brings into focus Latvia 's contempt for the former Soviet Union after over four decades of occupation , with Kononov being cast as a Stalinist thug massacring civilians .
It hinges on whether the highly decorated former guerilla can be classified as a Soviet occupier of Latvia or as a Latvian citizen fighting the Nazi invaders .
' The Latvian courts agree that Kononov was a member of an anti-Hitler coalition , they do not dispute that , ' said Joffe .
' They also agree that those villagers were in collaboration with Nazis .
' Yet they claim that Kononov was representing Soviet occupiers and killed the civilians who were acting according to the laws of that time .
' But this is nonsense .
He is a native Latvian , he was fighting for his country .
' And according to the rules of war , people taking guns from invaders in exchange for food and protection were not civilians anymore , but collaborators .
' This process is purely political like other things Latvia has been doing recently - such as reburying Nazis as heroes , and organising monuments and eternal flames at Nazi cemeteries . '
Kononov , now 85 , said : ' I have never doubted that I was fighting for the right thing .
' It was a shock for me to know that what I did to defend my country is now considered a crime . '
The secret - spilling site Wikileaks announced this week that it 's acquired thousands of e-mails belonging to a top aide to Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez .
But do n't look for them online .
In a departure from its full - disclosure past , Wikileaks is auctioning off the cache to the highest bidder .
Wikileaks began soliciting bids from media organizations on Tuesday , for what it describes as thousands of e-mails and attachments from 2005 to 2008 that provide insight into Chavez 's management , CIA activities in Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution .
The winner gets exclusivity and embargoed access to the documents , though Wikileaks will publish all of them eventually .
The auction contrasts sharply with Wikileaks ' original goal of recruiting legions of netizens to publicly analyze formerly secret corporate and government documents .
The site says the money it earns in the auction will go to its source defense fund .
University of Minnesota media ethics professor Jane Kirtley laughed when told of the scheme .
" Ethically speaking , why do n't they just publish it ? "
Kirtley asked .
" They pride themselves on being a new breed of news delivery . "
Launched nearly two years ago , Wikileaks made its mark publishing sensitive Guantanamo Bay documents and fending off a lawsuit from Swiss banking company Julius Baer that attempted to wipe the site off the net , but only ended up rallying support for the site .
But Wikileaks ' most public figure – Julian Assange , a former hacker and journalist – told Wired.com earlier this year that the wiki model had failed and that the site would be experimenting with new economic models , though he did not mention plans to ask media organizations to bid on leaked documents .
The auction is just an experiment , and carries too much overhead to be employed for every leak , Assange said by e-mail Tuesday .
When asked whether he expects news organizations such as The Washington Post to bid on documents , Assange argued that media outlets already pay for news .
" Media organizations pay hundreds of thousands to millions for photos and video footage , " he said .
" People magazine notoriously paid over $ 10 [ million ] for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie 's baby photos . "
Stephen Aftergood , who runs a complementary and competing site called Secrecy News that focuses on U.S. government documents , called the e-mail trove a " coup " for Wikileaks .
But Aftergood also doubts the auction model will attract quality media outlets .
" It looks like Wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials , " Aftergood said .
" I think it will automatically rule out publications like The New York Times and others that might devote significant attention to an in - depth look at such internal e-mails but would not pay for them . "
Outside of the tabloid press , U.S. media generally refuses to pay sources as a matter of professional ethics .
The fear is that such payment would provide an economic incentive for sources to fabricate documents and stories .
Kirtley , who led the Reporters ' Committee for the Freedom of the Press for 14 years , shares Aftergood 's practical objections , noting that many outlets have strict policies against paying sources .
" Whether [ U.S. media outlets ] are cheap or have ethics , I do n't know , " Kirtly said .
" From an entrepreneurial standpoint , I think Wikileaks will be disappointed . "
Assange , though , argues that any news worth reading is worth paying for .
" The degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for ' the ' news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives , " he writes .
" Indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows , manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment . "
For his part , Aftergood is skeptical of the auction , but he 's not opposed to it .
" But maybe I 'm wrong , " he said .
" It 's worth a try . "
UPDATE : This story was modified to note that the emails would be made public after a period of time when only the winning bidder has access .
Professor Jane Kirtley 's name was also misspelled .
Assange writes in with thoughts on scarcity and the perceived value of documents freely available on the web .
The big issue for Wikileaks is first rate source material going to waste because we make supply unlimited , so news organizations , wrongly or rightly , refuse to " invest " in analysis without additional incentives .
The economics are counter - intuitive – temporarily restrict supply to increase uptake .
This is not what we wanted to find , but it has been our solid experience over two years and is a known paradox in economics .
Given that Wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories , the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it .

I have unwittingly ruined my country ...
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit .
Our system of credit is concentrated .
The growth of the nation , therefore , and all our activities are in the hands of a few men .
We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world .
No longer a government by free opinion , no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men . "
Future Scenarios after the Illegal and Immoral Attack on Islamic Republic of Iran and subsequently Iran 's interventioning ally Russia .
Either U.S. do it first to " protect Israel " and force the artificial upholding of Petrodollar Hegemony in international trade after Iran eliminates " paper tiger " US Dollar in favor of Euro currency or Israel Air Force attack the targeted military bases and developed nuclear reactors ( of which Iran is legally bound by signature and ratification with Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for peaceful use in generating electricity ( 2 - 3 % enrichment needed to produce electrical energy , while 90 % enrichment is required to create powerful weapon - grade warhead ) to which U.S. is Constitutionally bound while Israel refuses to sign , preferring secrecy and ambiguity ) first to provoke Iran 's fury and count on U.S. to back Israel as it defends and counterattacks that will inevitably culminate in " The Point of No Return " in the fury of regional and international strife .
_____________
1. Iran , Russia and China ( the latter two co-founding members of Shanghai Cooperation Organization that will intervene to defend crucial resources and eliminate Western threats as the counter to NATO and U.S. Imperialism ) will formally declare total war on State of Israel , United States , United Kingdom and France ( Nicolas Sarkozy ) and possibly Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Australia , Japan and other developed / developing nations that choose to side with the Imperial West comprising U.S. , U.K. and Israel ( the modern equivalent of Axis ) .
Syria and Iraq , the latter currently ( mostly ) a Shiite state with factions of Sunni and Kurdish , may join Iranian Forces to turn on American - British occupiers to engage in air , sea and ground combat resulting in retaliatory counterstrike by air to ground bombardment , ground to air missile volley and infantry , massacres , etc.
Iraqi civilians will turn on American - British occupiers for imprisonment and destruction including contracting & service employees such as government diplomats , Halliburton , Blackwater , DynCorp and make - shift food / drink joints i.e. McDonald's , Burger King and Starbucks .
2 . Oil price per barrel goes up through the roof to $ 200 - 300 range , possibly more if it severely affects to the exhaustibly approached degree the law of supply and demand after Iran defeats enough American force to forcibly shut down Strait of Hormuz .
The world , so dependent on oil to run the global economy , will grind to a halt -- unprecedented in human history -- within a week .
Overnight or two days is doable , once reserve reaches depletion in haste .
See fifth point for more detail .
3. U.S. Dollar finally tanks so execrably America will face hyperinflation , similar to 1923 Germany .
" It 's economics , stupid . "
4 . The Federal Reserve will no longer have the " power " to sustain the tanking American economy , so America , with nearly $ 10 trillion in " officially reported " national debt and $ 53 + trillion dollars in unfunded or hidden liabilities ( derivatives , etc ) , will go totally bankrupt .
In retaliation over Middle East regional strife instigated by Israel and U.S. , China will liquidate its trillion - dollar USD reserve and cease financing America ( 2 - 3 billion dollars daily ) to keep the governmental operation " afloat " , immediately pummeling the vulnerable U.S. Dollar to get nailed in the coffin .
Wall Street goes ballistic when Dow freefalls to the bottom that could lead to the Second Great Depression , causing national panic and induce instant bankruptcies of banks and businesses .
It is not known how closely tied the other markets ( Japan , Hong Kong , France , Frankfurt , etc ) are to the deathly weak U.S. Dollar and whether the collapse of U.S. Dollar will cause other markets to nosedive at the same time .
This is not the first time the international stock market crash occurred , take 1997 Asian financial crisis for example , which was indeed controlled by Western financial vultures ( International Monetary Fund , etc behind the scene ) as explained in Chalmers Johnson 's Blowback .
It is entirely possible the Elite -- with traitorous Jews included as the conspirators with their financial manipulation knowledge -- are deliberatingly debasing the Dollar but for what reason ?
Besides pure greed by insider trading for superior enrichment .
Possible answer in number 8 .
5. American government will spiral out of control after total economic collapse .
Governmental services will be spotty or cease to exist , such as Medicaid , Medicare , Social Security , Transportation Security Administration , Food & Drug Administration , FCC , U.S. Small Business Administration , Law Enforcement Agencies and Departments ( DEA , maybe FBI , maybe CIA , maybe BATFE , U.S. Treasury , various Departments in the U.S. Government sectors [ maybe State , Interior , Education , Energy ] , et cetera ) .
Chaos will prevail in local and state governments as well , with numerous services such as wildlife administration suspended .
The unemployed people dependent on public assistance and welfare handouts will rise to violence in desperate survival .
The poor , including cash - strapped college students dependent on rental , reasonably cheap food and public transportation , will rise up in riots over soaring costs of food , drinkable liquid and even real estate & personal effects associated with break - the - roof surging oil prices .
The middle class will be destroyed to sudden impoverishment .
Only the wealthy can afford , at least for a while -- provided they have the best security personnel and firearms available for maximum protection from trespassers , looters , rioters and power - tripping governmental thugs intent to attack the properties and loved ones .
6 . Pertaining to the nature of post - economic collapse that renders Government paralyzed and near inoperable , crime will go through the roof with mass - scale riots , looting and horrific acts of home invasions , assault , kidnapping , torture , murder and rape .
Ownership of guns and ammunition will be CRUCIAL to defense of self and family & friends and hunting for subsistence and raw survival .
7. Martial law will be declared nation - wide ( see National Security Directive 51 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 and Military Commissions Act of 2006 [ 1 ] ) and may include Canada and maybe Mexico if the economic outcome of U.S. Dollar become a bleak reality .
Possible all three nations could become a new union as North American Union [ 1 ] as the new monetary policy takes effect to issue Amero currency in order to stabilize the economy raised from the ruins .
8 . The new Amero - based economy may rise , and subordinance will be mandatory , with resistance and sedition subject to severe penalty up to and including long - term imprisonment without due process ( Habeas Corpus since the inception of Magna Carta in the 13th century completely eviscerated ) and execution with appeal no longer an option .
9 . The subdued populations will be subject to involuntary slavery and will be forced to receive human RFID chipping as a mandate that supersede previously existing municipal and state laws that ban RFID chipping .
10 . The Bill of Rights , and the U.S. Constitution as a whole , will be rendered invalid and destined for complete evisceration , including 1st , 2nd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th , 8th and 22nd Amendments ( 22nd limits presidential terms to two ) .
The Declaration of Independence will be viewed as quaint and alien to the new ruling Establishment , be it plutocratic - oligarch dictatorship in collaboration with the Military given power to issue directives and impose tyrannical rule of law in North America .
Canada may join in the security agreement ostensibly to suppress insurrections and control chaos , not unlike NORAD .
11 . United States of America may remain in name only .
The ages - old name of the Constitutional Republic may be dissolved to form the new totalitarian state under another proposed name , not unlike George Orwell 's prophetic novel 1984 .
12 . The West , as the new Axis , will contrive by irrational , ultranationalistic - induced megalomaniacal decisions to deploy nuclear weapons to subdue by terror and destroy by empowerment the defending and intervening nations that deserve the right to retaliate according to the just rules of war .
Neither side will emerge a victor due to the greater destructive possibilities of nuclear warfare and its aftermath that may mean hundreds of millions of innocent people will perish in parts of the world , primarily the Middle East - Central Asia and Eastern and Western regions of the U.S .
13 .
The nuclear warfare will expand around the world if Pakistan dares to attack India or vice versa , China invades " defenseless " U.S. / EU - backed Japan over trade / diplomatic disputes or revenge for humiliation 70 decades prior ( WWII - era Japanese atrocities , like 1938 Rape of Nanking ) , etc .
If the U.S. or Israel dare to attack Medina and Mecca by invasion or using conventional bombardment or nuking , a billion Moslems will rise up to form the greatest collective force in humankind history .
Israel will be unable to resist the onslaught .
U.S. , U.K. , France and other " infidel " European nations ( the latter 's neutrality may be disregarded ) will share this fate .
14 . World War III commences from the beginning and will be the most destructive episode of current human civilization .
Famine - caused human - on - human violence in wide - scale riots will incur across the world on fire .
Water and food seeds will be considered more precious than metals .
Desirable craft skills such as carpentry , ceramics and agriculture will be highly sought after for learning and to rebuild the ravaged areas once peace is restored .
15 . Human survival will be questionable due to global famine -- food reserves thoroughly depleted due to billion tons of additional greenhouse gases ( soot , ash , methane , sulfur , carbon dioxide and numerous pollutants ) and severe radiation that damage and kill life - sustaining food plants close to extinction in the duration of the global chaos , resulting in global dimming [ 1 ] and continuous cycles of extremely volatile weathers caused by climate warming ( El Niño for example ) .
16 . Members of the ruling Elite may survive due to foresightedness and their hoarding of precious resources , especially healthy livestock , seeds , clean water and purity & survivalist technologies .
Animal life will be mostly critically endangered and extinct arising from deadly radiation , overhunting and overfishing and suffocating illness & starvation from profound ecological and environmental damage ( total pollution , ravaged war zones with rotting corpses and massive amounts of ammunition , depleted uranium , nuclear and bomb craters , etc ) .
17 . Police states comprised of hardened and blood - thirsty military people and former law enforcement officers drafted to fight the Hated Enemy , under the strict management of the Fascistic ruling Elite that somehow manage to survive termination ( obliteration by execution upon citizen arrest or perished in targeted zones ) to " rebuild civilization " , will be at their most oppressive -- the depths of brutality and cruelty in the subjugation of defenseless surviving populations upon forcible disarmament by the Fascists who answer only to the Elitist orders , no matter how remote wherever they live to subsist as survivalists , will rival the likes of Attila the Hun .
They will shoot , assault and mutilate at will with recklessness and heartlessness in purely base and gleeful sadism , imprison to transport to concentration camps and opportunity to kidnap women and children to rape in excruciating , brutally degrading successions with absolute impunity being impervious to any moral objection , by self or other .
Men can be sodomized for amusement and slaughtered in the meanwhile .
The absolute individual -- never restrained by conscience in morals and decency -- power to play " jury , judge and executioner " over ordinary human beings will be poisonously intoxicating .
Jackbooted Fascists armed to the teeth will have the sentiment of the heart of stone in rigid event control and free - style and / or controlled termination .
18 . The New World Order -- composed of the collective power structure wielded by the surviving members of the Illuminati ( hundreds or thousands of top - secret " Shadow Government " with substantial power in intelligence , business [ industrial and medical ] , monetary / finance , science , military and government ) that convene to form One World Government -- may rise from the ashes of death and destruction to offer salvation to the subjugated and fatigued human beings .
Acceptance equals spared life .
Rejection is death by immediate imprisonment , torture and termination .
Who knows what will happen next ?
History Channel " Decoding the Past " ( 7:35 )
Mayan prediction ( 12 min )
Mayan civilization -- extinct before the arrival of Columbus that ushered in the greatest genocide this world has ever seen -- predicted the " Apocalypse " -- End of the World -- in late 2012 , possibly into 2013 and furthermore .
Why the Mayans ?
Because they had a very intimate knowledge of the heavens as astronomers who take studying the night sky too seriously and developed a complex calculation system to measure and determine the times when they happened upon the final count .
They believed this Earth was " re- born " a number of times after extinction - level times ( such as when the Age of Dinosaurs ceased to exist with the combination of the meteor that impacted in the Yucatan region , mega earthquakes tearing apart continents that exceed the perfect 10 on the Richter scale and dozens of violently active supervolcanoes spewing massive ashes and lava seas which led to complete coverage of the Earth atmosphere in ash and sulfur killing off almost all life that culminated in a very long period of global cooling ) .
This time , to the Mayan astronomers , it 's really " The End " .
What cause we may never know ( except that pole shift could happen anytime after sub - 10,000 year interval ) .
However , I am continually fascinated by the conjectural subject of Nibiru , also known as Planet X .
That need not be said further due to the majority of public scorn doubting its existence , let alone mere speculation .
Humankind survival is at stake .
Human arrogance and stupidity will be to blame for our eventual extinction .
Like JFK said , " mankind must end war or war will end mankind . "
Dr. Stephen Hawking was right - he said the only way of improving our survival is to overcome the common disagreement the world over ( politiking and belligerent war - like attitude among Imperialists and Zionists ) , raise a few trillion dollar fund contributed by the humans who can afford -- even a penny -- ( forced taxation is out of the question ; I oppose carbon and unconstitutional income tax ) to build the advanced technology and transport to outer space and attempt to colonize Mars or other life - sustaining planet .
Of course , banish nuclear power technology as inherently destructive when misused .
On the subject of nuclear armament , we were this close in the cases of close call , especially 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis .
The sanity of President John F. Kennedy prevented the terrible outcome by repudiating Pentagon and Cabinet warhawks ' demand to attack Post - Revolution Cuba and chose to " feel the enemy 's feet " to deal with the belligerent U.S.S.R. ( and in doing this diplomatically , restrain the somewhat irrational Fidel Castro and Che Guevaro from hitting the red button , as Robert McNamara 's story will attest in the splendid Oscar - winning documentary The Fog of War ) averted the catastrophe .
JFK , despite his human flaws , died a true patriot whose life was cut short by the cooperation of CIA and Mossad in eliminating the target , partly to avenge the failure of Bay of Pigs invasion to overthrow Fidel 's Communist - Leninist government ( JFK refused to order U.S. Armed Forces assistance for coverage ) as well as President Kennedy 's implied threat to splinter CIA into " thousand pieces and scatter to the winds " reacting to CIA 's incorrigible attitude and partly to shut him up over Israel 's secret nuclear proliferation in Dimona .
Unbelievable as it may seem , but I believe this to be the fact .
The extremities of Zionism and Western Imperialism will be the culprit of the destruction of this great human civilization that have seen at least five thousand years of amassed knowledge on innumerable subjects beginning with agriculture , science and politics , conventional wars , periods of peaceful harmony and life -- some good & happiness and some monstrously evil & sorrowful .
If it were not for the existence of base wickedness of the ruling Establishment in the West -- the severely compromised and controlled United States , illegitimate & paranoid Zionist regime of Israel and hedonistically corrupt Saudi Kingdom and Europe , there would be no foreign and corporate corruption of the Congress , perpetuality of fraud and usury in central banking and financial industry , false pretexts for wars with staged or instigated false flag attacks and exploitation of the common and destitute in predatory capitalism ( slavery , deliberate impoverishment , land theft , ungodly waste , compromised food & water , biopiracy [ terminator seeds , livestock mammal genetics patenting , etc ] , environmental destruction , etc ) in collusion with the mass media as the useless , servile and cowardly " Fourth Estate " that perpetuate half - truth , lies , propaganda and deception to induce civilian subordination to " authority received as the truth rather than truth as the authority , " to borrow the quote by 19th century English poet Gerald Massey .
As it stands now , the Establishment reigns supreme , whether you like it or not .
French and Iranian Revolution happened because the Elite abused their " privileges " to oppress the common people and the common people retaliated and risked their patriotic lives to overthrow the Corruptors in native nationalist fervor .
The 1917 October ( Bolshevik / Soviet ) Revolution and 1949 Chinese Revolution are apt comparisons , but like France , it led to terrible blood shedding and further oppression that later formed " progressive " republics with the representative governments installed after the period of red terror on the iron heel of totalitarianism vanish .
If it were not for the utter apathy of the torpid Americans dazzled by " bread and circuses " -- obesity - inducing refined food with subpar to non-existent nutrition value and select television channels known for covert and obvious propaganda , right - wing shill radio , mindlessly bad movies and other venues of entertainment that detract from the matter of real politics and undermine patriotic vigilance in accountability of the U.S. government and its elected & employed representatives , the Second American Revolution would have risen to conquer and destroy the Elitists to eliminate the Fascist Pluto - Oligarchy and shed the illuminating light on the true meaning of the twin pillars of " Freedom " and " Liberty " as promulgated by Samuel Adams , the founding revolutionary that led to the formation of a new country freed from British tyranny under King George III .
The problem is , the British is still here , figuratively speaking .
And if they have a choice in that time , they would rather side with the British to continue exploiting and oppressing the People of the colonial states .
And ostracize the Khazaric / Talmudic Jews to exile ( and even termination by indisputable proof of persistent vile characteristics -- I do not mean merely innocent Jews of Semitic and non-Khazariac origins who would be spared and welcomed , but hard - core Talmud adherents ) through revocation of U.S. citizenship and forbidden from covert interference as the numerous nations had done in the past because of their genetic and patterned traits of treason , dishonesty and exploitation of the conservative - progressive systems of American social , political and capitalist structures to consolidate the corruptible tenets of prestige , power and wealth .
Once the factors of pernicious nature and influence is eliminated as elucidated in exhaustive detail above -- completely , utterly , totally -- America will speedily recover from the economic and social pains and the political system restored to Constitutional standards in " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . "
And the world will recover and humankind would be in harmony , if only the Corruptors -- Talmudic Zionist Jews , Jingoistic Warhawks ( military and Neoconservative / Neoliberal ) , Predatory Capitalist - Exploiter Corpocrats , Perfidious Congressional / Parliament Politicians , Power - Mongering Bureaucrats and Rothschild & Warburg - type International Bankers -- are deprived of their rights to kick out of the nations of which they are the citizens for Treason that proved injurious to the socioeconomic health and morale of the nations and endanger the unwritten rule of enforcing the peace and liberty of Civilization in fair diplomacy and justice ... above all else .

Complete letter excerpt from The Writings of Samuel Adams , Volume II , published 1904 to 1908 Messieurs EDES & GILL , " Ambition saw that stooping Rome could bearA MASTER , nor had Virtue to be free . "
I Believe that no people ever yet groaned under the heavy yoke ofslavery , but when they deserv'd it .
This may be called a severecensure upon by far the greatest part of the nations in the world whoare involv'd in the misery of servitude :
But however they may bethought by some to deserve commiseration , the censure is just .
Zuinglius , one of the first reformers , in his friendly admonition tothe republic of the Switzers , discourses much of his countrymensthrowing off the yoke :
He says , that they who lie under oppressiondeserve what they suffer , and a great more ; and he bids them perishwith their oppressors .
The truth is ,
All might be free if they valuedfreedom , and defended it as they ought .
Is it possible that millionscould be enslaved by a few , which is a notorious fact , if allpossessed the independent spirit of Brutus , who to his immortalhonor , expelled the proud Tyrant of Rome , and his " royal andrebellious race ? "
If therefore a people will not be free ; if theyhave not virtue enough to maintain their liberty against apresumptuous invader , they deserve no pity , and are to be treatedwith contempt and ignominy .
Had not Caesar seen that Rome was readyto stoop , he would not have dared to make himself the master of thatonce brave people .
He was indeed , as a great writer observes , asmooth and subtle tyrant , who led them gently into slavery ; " and onhis brow , ' ore daring vice deluding virtue smil'd " .
By pretending tobe the peoples greatest friend , he gain'd the ascendency over them :
By beguiling arts , hypocrisy and flattery , which are even more fatalthan the sword , he obtain'd that supreme power which his ambitioussoul had long thirsted for :
The people were finally prevail 'd upon toconsent to their own ruin :
By the force of perswasion , or rather bycajoling arts and tricks always made use of by men who have ambitiousviews , they enacted their Lex Regia : whereby Quod placuit principilegis habuit vigorem ; that is , the Will and pleasure of the Princehad the force of law .
His minions had taken infinite pains to paintto their imaginations the god - like virtues of Caesar :
They firstpersuaded them to believe that he was a deity , and then to sacrificeto him those Rights and Liberties which their ancestors had so longmaintained , with unexampled bravery , and with blood & treasure .
Bythis act they fixed a precedent fatal to all posterity :
The Romanpeople afterwards , influenced no doubt by this pernicious example , renew'd it to his successors , not at the end of every ten years , butfor life .
They transfer 'd all their right and power to Charles the Great :
In eum transtulit omne suum jus et poteslatem .
Thus , theyvoluntarily and ignominiously surrendered their own liberty , andexchanged a free constitution for a TYRANNY !
It is not my design at present to form the comparison between thestate of this country now , and that of the Roman Empire in thosedregs of time ; or between the disposition of Caesar , and that of ---; The comparison , I confess , would not in all parts hold good : The Tyrant of Rome , to do him justice , had learning , courage , and greatabilities .
It behoves us however to awake and advert to the danger weare in .
The Tragedy of American Freedom , it is to be feared is nearlycompleated : A Tyranny seems to be at the very door .
It is to littlepurpose then to go about cooly to rehearse the gradual steps thathave been taken , the means that have been used , and the instrumentsemployed , to encompass the ruin of the public liberty :
We know themand we detest them .
But what will this avail , if we have not courageand resolution to prevent the completion of their system ?
Our enemies would fain have us lie down on the bed of sloth andsecurity , and persuade ourselves that there is no danger
They aredaily administering the opiate with multiplied arts and delusions , and I am sorry to observe , that the gilded pill is so alluring tosome who call themselves the friends of Liberty .
But is there nodanger when the very foundations of our civil constitution tremble ?
- When an attempt was first made to disturb the corner - stone of thefabrick , we were universally and justly alarmed :
And can we be coolspectators , when we see it already removed from its place ?
With whatresentment and indignation did we first receive the intelligence of adesign to make us tributary , not to natural enemies , but infinitelymore humiliating , to fellow subjects ?
And yet with unparallelledinsolence we are told to be quiet , when we see that very money whichis torn from us by lawless force , made use of still further tooppress us - to feed and pamper a set of infamous wretches , who swarmlike the locusts of Egypt ; and some of them expect to revel in wealthand riot on the spoils of our country .
-
Is it a time for us to sleepwhen our free government is essentially changed , and a new one isforming upon a quite different system ?
A government without the leastdependance upon the people : A government under the absolute controulof a minister of state ; upon whose sovereign dictates is to dependnot only the time when , and the place where , the legislative assemblyshall sit , but whether it shall sit at all :
And if it is allowed tomeet , it shall be liable immediately to be thrown out of existence , if in any one point it fails in obedience to his arbitrary mandates .
Have we not already seen specimens of what we are to expect undersuch a government , in the instructions which Mr. HUTCHINSON hasreceived , and which he has publickly avow'd , and declared he is boundto obey ? -
By one , he is to refuse his assent to a tax - bill , unlessthe Commissioners of the Customs and other favorites are exempted :
And if these may be freed from taxes by the order of a minister , maynot all his tools and drudges , or any others who are subservient tohis designs , expect the same indulgence ?
By another he is to forbidto pass a grant of the assembly to any agent , but one to whoseelection he has given his consent ; which is in effect to put it outof our power to take the necessary and legal steps for the redress ofthose grievances which we suffer by the arts and machinations ofministers , and their minions here .
What difference is there betweenthe present state of this province , which in course will be thedeplorable state of all America , and that of Rome , under the lawbefore mention'd ?
The difference is only this , that they gave theirformal consent to the change , which we have not yet done .
But let usbe upon our guard against even a negative submission ; for agreeableto the sentiments of a celebrated writer , who thoroughly understoodhis subject , if we are voluntarily silent , as the conspirators wouldhave us to be , it will be consider 'd as an approbation of the change .
"
By the fundamental laws of England , the two houses of parliament inconcert with the King , exercise the legislative power :
But if the twohouses should be so infatuated , as to resolve to suppress theirpowers , and invest the King with the full and absolute government , certainly the nation would not suffer it . "
And if a minister shallusurp the supreme and absolute government of America , and set up hisinstructions as laws in the colonies , and their Governors shall be soweak or so wicked , as for the sake of keeping their places , to bemade the instruments in putting them in execution , who will presumeto say that the people have not a right , or that it is not theirindispensible duty to God and their Country , by all rational means intheir power to RESIST THEM .
" Be firm , my friends , nor let UNMANLY SLOTHTwine round your hearts indissoluble chains .
Ne 'er yet by force was freedom overcome .
Unless CORRUPTION first dejects the pride , And guardian vigour of the free - born soul , All crude attempts of violence are vain .
Determined , hold Your INDEPENDENCE ; for , that once destroy'd , Unfounded Freedom is a morning dream .
"
The liberties of our Country , the freedom of our civil constitutionare worth defending at all hazards :
And it is our duty to defend themagainst all attacks .
We have receiv'd them as a fair Inheritance fromour worthy Ancestors :
They purchas'd them for us with toil and dangerand expence of treasure and blood ; and transmitted them to us withcare and diligence .
It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy onthe present generation , enlightned as it is , if we should suffer themto be wrested from us by violence without a struggle ; or be cheatedout of them by the artifices of false and designing men .
Of thelatter we are in most danger at present :
Let us therefore be aware ofit .
Let us contemplate our forefathers and posterity ; and resolve tomaintain the rights bequeath'd to us from the former , for the sake ofthe latter .
- Instead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts wehave already made , which is the wish of our enemies , the necessity ofthe times , more than ever , calls for our utmost circumspection , deliberation , fortitude and perseverance .
Let us remember , that " ifwe suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty , we encourage it , and involve others in our doom . "
It is a very serious consideration , which should deeply impress our minds , that millions yet unborn maybe the miserable sharers in the event .
Millions of years of evolution have maximized the efficiency of how sea creatures move through water while humans have been trying to perfect streamlined designs for barely a century - but we 're catching up .
Biologists and engineers from across the U.S. have been studying the flippers , fins and tails of whales and dolphins and discovered some features of their structure that contradict long - held engineering theories .
Dr. Frank Fish of West Chester University will talk about the impact these discoveries may have on traditional industrial designs on Tuesday 8th July at the Society for Experimental Biology 's Annual Meeting in Marseille [ Session A2 ] .
Large vortices are formed behind the troughs along the leading edge whereas flow behind the tubercles forms straight streamlines .
The effect of these flow patterns induced by the tubercles is to delay stall .

Some of his observations are already being applied to real life engineering problems in a field known as biomimetics .
The shape of whale flippers with one bumpy edge has inspired the creation of a completely novel design for wind turbine blades .
This design has been shown to be more efficient and also quieter , but defies traditional engineering theories .
" Engineers have previously tried to ensure steady flow patterns on rigid and simple lifting surfaces , such as wings .
The lesson from biomimicry is that unsteady flow and complex shapes can increase lift , reduce drag and delay ' stall ' , a dramatic and abrupt loss of lift , beyond what existing engineered systems can accomplish , " Dr Fish advises .
" There are even possibilities that this technology could be applied to aeronautical designs such as helicopter blades in the future . "
The work centers on studies of vortices , tornado - shaped water formations that develop in the wake of the animals .
The dolphin uses a high efficiency mechanism to generate large amounts of thrust by the action of its tail fins .

" In the case of the humpback whale , vortices formed from tubercles ( bumps ) on the front edge of flippers help to generate more lift without the occurrence of stall , as well as enhancing manoeuvrability and agility , " explains Dr Fish .
" In the case of the tails of dolphins , vortices are formed at the end of the up and down strokes .
These vortices are involved in the production of a jet in the wake of the dolphin that produces high thrust .
By regulating the production of the vortices , the dolphin can maximize its efficiency while swimming . "
This work will be presented at 13.10 pm on Tuesday 8th July at the Society for Experimental Biology 's Annual Meeting ( 6th – 10th July 2008 ) at Parc Chanot , Marseille , France .

The entire discussion only applies to unsafe languages , the ones that dump core .
By which I mean , C. Or C++ , if you 're really out of luck .
If it can dump core , it will dump core , unless it decides to silently corrupt its data instead .
Trust my experience of working in a multi- processor , multi- threaded , multi- programmer , multi-nightmare environment .
Some C++ FQA
Lite readers claimed that the fact that I deal with lots of crashes in C++ indicates that I 'm a crappy programmer surrounded by similar people .
Luckily , you do n't really need to trust my experience , because you can trust Google's .
Do this :
Find a Google office near you .
Visit a Google toilet .
You 'll find a page about software testing , with the subtitle " Debugging sucks .
Testing rocks . "
Read it .
Recover from the trauma .
Realize that the chances of you being better at eliminating bugs than Google are low .
Read about the AdWords multi - threaded billing server nightmare .
The server was written in C ++.
The bug could n't happen in a safe language .
Meditate on it .
Consider yourself enlightened .
This is n't the reason why this post has " Google core dump " in its title , but hopefully it 's a reason for us to agree that your C/C++ program will crash , too .
I love globals
What happens when we face a core dump ?
Well , we need the same things you 'd expect to look for in any investigation : names and addresses .
Names of objects looking at which may explain what happened , their addresses to actually look at them , and type information to sensibly display them .
In C and C++ , we have 3 kinds of addresses : stack , heap and global .
Let 's see who lives there .
Except the stack is overwritten , because it can be .
Do n't count on being able to see the function calls leading to the point of crash , nor the parameters and local variables of those functions .
In fact , do n't even count on being able to see the point of crash itself : the program counter , the link register , the frame pointer , all that stuff can contain garbage .
And the heap is overwritten , too , nearly as badly .
The typical data structure used by C/C++ allocators ( for example , dlmalloc ) is a kind of linked list , where each memory block is prefixed with its size so you can jump to the next one .
Overwrite one of these size values and you will have lost the boundaries of the chunks above that address .
That 's a loss of 50 % of the heap objects on average , assuming uniform distribution of memory overwriting bugs across the address space of the heap .
So do n't count on the stack or the heap .
Your only hope is that someone has ignored the Best Practices and the finger - pointing by the more proficient colleagues , and allocated a global object .
Possibly under the clever disguise of a " Singleton " .
Not a bad thing after all , that moronic " design pattern " , because it ultimately allowed to counter cargo cult programmers ' accusations of " globals are evil " with equally powerful cargo cult argument of " it 's a design pattern " .
So people could allocate globals again .
Which is good , because a global always has an accurate name - to - address mapping , no matter what atrocity was committed by the bulk of unsafe code running on the loose .
Ca n't overwrite a symbol table .
And it has accurate type information , too .
As opposed to objects you find through void* , or a base class pointer where the base class lacks virtual functions or the object vptr was overwritten , etc .
Which is why I frequently start debugging by firing an object view window on a global , or running debugger macros which read globals , etc .
Of course you can fuck up a global variable to make debugging unpleasant .
For example , if the variable is " static " in the C sense , you need to open the right file or function to display it , and you need the debugger front - end to understand the context , which will be especially challenging if it's a static variable in a template function ( one of the best things in C++ is how neatly its new features interact with C's old ones ) .
Or you can stuff the global into a class or a namespace .
I was never able to display globals by their qualified C++ name in , say , gdb 5 .
But no matter ; nm < program > | grep < global > followed by p *( TypeOfGlobal * ) addr always does the trick , and no attempts at obfuscating the symbol table will stop it .
I still say make it a real , unashamed global to make debugging easier .
If you 're lucky , you 'll get to piss off a couple of cargo cult followers as a nice side - effect .
Google Core Dump
A core dump is a web .
Its sites are objects .
It 's hyperlinks are pointers .
It 's PageRank is a TypeRank : what 's the type of this object according to the votes of the pointers stored in other objects ?
The spamdexing is done by pointer - like bit patterns stored in unused memory slots .
The global variables are the major sites with high availability you can use as roots for the crawling .
What utilities would we like to have for this web ?
The usual stuff .
Browsers .
Debugger object view window is the Firefox , and the memory view window is the Lynx .
The core dump Lynx usually sucks in that it does n't make it easy to follow pointers – can't click on a word and have the browser follow the pointer ( by jumping to the memory pointed by it ) .
No back button , either .
Oh well .

The ability to translate variable names to raw addresses .
Works very reliably for globals and passably otherwise .
Works reliably for all objects in safe languages .

Reverse DNS .
Given an address , tell me the object name .
Problematic for dynamically allocated objects , although you could list the names of pointer variables leading to it ( Google bombing ) .
Works reliably for global functions and variables .
For some reason , the standard addr2line program only supports functions though .
Which is why I have an addr2sym program .
It so happened that I have several of them , in fact .
You can download one here .
" Reverse DNS " is particularly useful when you find pointers somewhere in registers or memory and wonder what they could point to .
In safe languages , you do n't have that problem because everything is typed and so you can simply display the pointed object .

Google Core Dump , similar to Google Desktop or Google for the WWW .
Crawl a core dump , figure out the object boundaries and types by parsing the heap linked list and the stack and looking at pointers ' " votes " , create an index , and allow me to query that index .
Lots of work , that , some of it heuristical .
And in order to get type information in C or C++ , you 'll have to either parse the source code ( good luck doing it with C++ ) , or parse the non-portable debug information format .
But it 's doable ; in fact , we have it , for our particular target / debugger / allocator combo .
Of course it has its glitches .
Quirky and obscure enough to make open sourcing it not worth the trouble .
I really wish there was a reasonably portable and reliable Google Core Dump kind of thing .
But it does n't look like that many people care about debugging crashes at all .
Most core dumps at customer sites seem to go to / dev/null , and those that can't be easily deciphered are apparently given up on until the bug manifests itself in some other way or its cause is guessed by someone .
Am I coming from a particularly weird niche where the code size is large enough and the development rapid enough to make crashes almost unavoidable , but crashes in the final product version are almost intolerable ?
Or do most good projects allocate everything on the stack and the heap , so with those smashed they 're doomed no matter what ?
Or is the problem simply stinky enough to make it unattractive for a hobby project while lacking revenue potential to make a good commercial project ?
Would you like this sort of thing ?
If you would , drop me a line .
In the meanwhile , I satisfy my wish for a Google Core Dump with my perfect implementation for an embedded co-processor , the one I 've poked at with Tcl commands .
With 128 K of memory , no dynamic allocation , and local variables effectively implemented as globals , perfect decoding is easy .
I 'm telling ya , globals rule .
As to my " reverse DNS " implementation :
I could make it more portable by parsing the output of nm -- print - size .
But just running nm on a 20 M symbol table takes about 2 seconds .
I want instantaneous output , ' cause I 'm very impatient when I debug .
.
But just running nm on a 20 M symbol table takes about 2 seconds .
I want instantaneous output , ' cause I 'm very impatient when I debug .
Alternatively , I could make it more portable by using a library such as bfd .
But that would drag in a library such as bfd , and I had trouble with what looked like library / compiler version mismatches with bfd , whereas my ELF parsing code never had any trouble .
Also , an implementation parsing ELF is more interesting as sample code because you get to see how easy to parse these formats are .
So it 's elfaddr2sym , not addr2sym .
( It 's really 32 - bit - ELF - with - host - endianness - addr2sym , because I 'm lazy and it covers all my targets . )
There 's a ton of addr2sym code out there , and maybe a good addr2sym program .
I just did n't find it .
I have an acknowledged weakness in the wheel reinventing department .
Of course I do n't demangle the ugly C++ names ; piping to c++ filt does .
The program is in D , because of the " instantaneous " bit , and because D is one of the best choices available today if you care about both speed and brevity .
Look at this : lowerBound !( " a.st_value <= b " ) ( ssyms , addr ) does a binary search for addr in the sorted ssyms array .
As brief as it gets out of the box with any language and standard library , is n't it ?
The string is compiled statically into the instantiation of the lowerBound template ; a & b are the arguments of the anonymous function represented by the string .
Readable .
Short .
Fast .
Easy to use – garbage - collected array outputs in functions like filter ( ) , error messages to the point – that 's why a decent grammar is a good thing even if you are n't the compiler writer .
Looks a lot like C++ , braces , static typing , everything .
Thus easy to pimp in a 3GL environment , in particular , a C++ environment .
You can download the Digital Mars D compiler for Linux , or wait for C++0 x to solve 15 % of the problems with < algorithm > by introducing worse problems .
By the way , the std.algorithm module , the one with the sort , filter , lowerBound and similar functions , is by Andrei Alexandrescu , of Modern C++ Design fame .
How is it possible that his stuff in D is so yummy while his implementation of similar things in C++ is equally icky ?
Because C++ is to D what proper fixation is to anaesthesia .
There , I bet you saw it coming .
What does " global " mean ?
For the sake of completeness , I 'd like to bore you with a discussion of the various aspects of globalhood , in the vanishingly small hope of this being useful in a battle against a cargo cult follower authoring a coding convention or such .
In C++ , " global " can mean at least 6 things :
Number of instances per process .
A " global " is everything that 's instantiated once .
Life cycle .
A " global " is constructed before main and destroyed after main .
A static variable inside a function is not " global " in this sense .
" Scope " in the " namespace " sense ( as opposed to the life cycle sense ) .
We have C - style file scope , class scope , function scope , and " the true global scope " .
And we have namespaces .
Storage .
A " global " is assigned a link time address and stored there .
In a singleton implementation calling new and assigning its output to a global pointer , the pointer is " global " in this sense but the object is not .
Access control .
If it 's in a class scope , it may be private or protected , which makes it less of a global in this fifth sense .
Responsibility .
A global can be accessible from everywhere but only actually accessed from a couple of places .
For example , you can allocate a large object instantiating lots of members near your main function and then call object methods which are n't aware that the stuff is allocated globally .
So when I share my love of globals with you , the question is which aspect of globality I mean .
What I mean is this :
I like global storage – link - time addresses – for everything which can be handled that way .
A global pointer is better than nothing , but it can be overwritten and you will have lost the object ; better allocate the entire thing globally .
I like global scope , no classes , namespaces and access control keywords attached , to make symbol table look - up easier , thus making use of the global allocation .
I like global life cycle – no Meyers ' singletons and lazy initialization .
In fact , I like trivial constructors / destructors , leaving the actual work to init / close functions called by main ( ) .
This way , you can actually control the order in which things are done and know what the dependencies are .
With Meyers ' singletons , the order of destruction is uncontrollable ( it 's the reverse order of initialization , which does n't necessarily work ) .
Solutions were proposed to this problem , so dreadful that I 'm not going to discuss them .
Just grow up , design the damned init / close sequence and be in control again .
Why do people think that all major operations should be explicit except for initialization which should happen automagically when you least expect it ?
" Globals " in the sense of " touched by every piece of code " is the trademark style of a filthy swine .
There are plenty of good reasons to use " globals " ; none of them has anything to do with " globals " as in " variables nobody / everybody is responsible for " .
I think that everything that 's instantiated once per process is a " global " , and when you wrap it with scope , access control , and design patterns , you should n't stop calling it a global ( and instead insist on " singleton " , " static class member " , etc. ) .
It 's still a global , and its wrapping should be evaluated by its practical virtues .
Currently , I see no point in wrapping globals in anything – plain old global variables are the thing best supported by all software tools I know .
I think this can be used as " rationale " in a coding guideline , maybe in the part allowing the use of globals as an " exception " .
But I keep my hopes low .

Microbial biofilms form in rocky pools , fed by hot springs containing arsenic
In the warm , bubbling pools of Mono Lake in California , scientists have isolated a bacterium that fuels itself on arsenic .
Combining light and arsenic , these bacteria make their food and multiply using a chemical that is toxic to most other life forms .
The researchers think using arsenic as an energy source was a process used by ancient bacteria .
Their findings are reported in the journal Science .
Ronald Oremland of the US Geological Survey explained that these bacteria are photosynthetic , using sunlight - like plants - to turn carbon dioxide into food .
What is different about them is that instead of using water in this process , they use arsenic .
The US - based researchers isolated the bacterium from the lake , which lies at the foot of the Sierra Nevada .
Colour film " These lakes are fed by hydrothermal waters that leach out arsenic - containing minerals from the surrounding rocks , " Dr Oremland told BBC News .
The researchers noticed that the bacteria had colonised small , hot pools , forming colourful " biofilms " .
Bacteria living in Mono Lake , California can survive the high levels of arsenic " We suspected that these bacteria were using arsenic to make a living , so we scraped the biofilms off the rock and studied them under laboratory conditions . "
By first withholding light , then arsenic , the team showed that the bacteria required both to grow .
This the first time an organism has been found that can use arsenic to photosynthesise under anaerobic conditions , Dr Oremland believes .
He suspects that this is an ancient ability in bacteria .
" We think that bacteria were photosynthesising before oxygen was present in the atmosphere , " he said .
Primordial niche Understanding how arsenic is metabolised by bacteria could help scientists comprehend its damaging effects inside human cells .
Worldwide , 144 million people are exposed to toxic levels of arsenic in their drinking water .
It enters the body 's cells by diffusion ; and once inside , it disrupts how they function by binding to their machinery , inactivating it , and disrupting the way energy is transported .
Long - term exposure can lead to skin disease and kidney and bladder cancer , and it is thought to stunt the intellectual development of children .
The most arsenic - contaminated regions are in India , Pakistan , and China , where soluble arsenic in ground waters is above the World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) suggested maximum safe level of 10 parts per billion .

What are these ?
It looks official .
John MCCain has chosen Alaska Governor Sarah Palin with 1.5 years of leadership experience as governor .
Wikipedia reports that she got a degree in journalism , then had a job as a sports reporter at an anchorage TV station .
She served four years on the Wasilla city council .
She went on to run for and become mayor of Wasilla ( population 5,470 ) Alaska .
Her husband is a commercial fisherman and and a " world class snow machine racer .
Update : Info on Todd Palin , Alaska 's First Man , Husband of Sarah Palin
Sarah Palin Interview : What does the VP do ?
Here 's the beginning of a profile on her .
Help build it by adding your comments .
44 years old pro-life Catholic , lifetime NRA member
Governor since 2007 , former mayor of
Charged with abuse of her power for firing the public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the man her sister was in a nasty divorce with .
I 'm guessing that the McCain camp will use this in her favor , arguing that even if it were true , she was protecting her sister from an abusive man .
One report suggests
" Attorney General Colberg said his office 's review began after State Senator Hollis French was quoted in The Wall Street Journal about two weeks ago saying the governor could be impeached as a result of the probe .
That raised questions about how impartial the Legislature 's investigation was going to be , according to the governor 's office .
Colberg told KTUU it is n't witness tampering .
The only problem is that if the worst case scenario happens , it will appear as if a potential defendant , the Palin Administration , was prepping potential witnesses .
Opinion : Sarah Palin could have saved herself a lot of grief if she had simply told us why she canned Walt Monegan last month instead of serving up some New Age Oprah - style drivel about " new energy " and " new direction " .
There seems to be a disturbing aura of New Age influence within the Palin Administration .

" Just tell me one thing Barack Obama has done that you admire , " I asked a prominent Democrat .
He paused and then said that he admired Obama 's speech to the Democratic convention in 2004 .
I agreed .
It was a hell of a speech , but it was just a speech .
On the other hand , I continued , I could cite four or five actions -- not speeches -- that John McCain has taken that elicit my admiration , even my awe .
First , of course , is his decision as a Vietnam War POW to refuse freedom out of concern that he would be exploited for propaganda purposes .
To paraphrase what Kipling said about Gunga Din , John McCain is a better man than most .
But I would not stop there .
I would include campaign finance reform , which infuriated so many in his own party ; opposition to earmarks , which won him no friends ; his politically imprudent opposition to the Medicare prescription drug bill ( Medicare has about $ 35 trillion in unfunded obligations ) ; and , last but not least , his very early call for additional troops in Iraq .
His was a lonely position , virtually suicidal for an all - but - certain presidential candidate , and no help when his campaign nearly expired last summer .
In all these cases , McCain stuck to his guns .
Obama argues that he himself stuck to the biggest gun of all : opposition to the war .
He took that position back when the war was enormously popular , the president who initiated it was even more popular , and critics of both were slandered as unpatriotic .
But at the time , Obama was a mere Illinois state senator , representing the ( very ) liberal Hyde Park area of Chicago .
He either voiced his conscience or his district 's leanings or ( lucky fella ) both .
We will never know .
And we will never know , either , how Obama might have conducted himself had he served in Congress as long as McCain has .
Possibly he would have earned a reputation for furious , maybe even sanctimonious , integrity of the sort that often drove McCain 's colleagues to dark thoughts of senatorcide , but the record -- scant as it is -- suggests otherwise .
Obama is not noted for sticking to a position or a person once it ( or he ) becomes a political liability .
( Names available upon request . )
All politicians change their positions , sometimes even because they have changed their mind .
McCain must have suffered excruciating whiplash from totally reversing himself on George Bush 's tax cuts .
He has denounced preachers he later embraced and then , to his chagrin , has had to denounce them all over again .
This plasticity has a label : Pandering .
McCain knows how it 's done .
But Obama has shown that in this area , youth is no handicap .
He has been for and against gun control , against and for the recent domestic surveillance legislation and , in almost a single day , for a united Jerusalem under Israeli control and then , when apprised of U.S. policy and Palestinian chagrin , against it .
He is an accomplished pol -- a statement of both admiration and a bit of regret .
Obama is often likened to John F. Kennedy .
It makes sense .
He has the requisite physical qualities -- handsome , lean , etc. -- plus wit , intelligence , awesome speaking abilities and a literary bent .
He also might be compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt for many of those same qualities .
Both FDR and JFK were disparaged early on by their contemporaries for , I think , doing the difficult and making it look easy .
Eleanor Roosevelt , playing off the title of Kennedy 's Pulitzer Prize - winning book , airily dismissed him as more profile than courage .
Similarly , it was Walter Lippmann 's enduring misfortune to size up FDR and belittle him : Roosevelt , he wrote , was " a pleasant man who , without any important qualifications for office , would very much like to be president . "
Lippmann later recognized that he had underestimated Roosevelt .
My guess is that Obama will make a fool of anyone who issues such a judgment about him .
Still , the record now , while tissue thin , is troubling .
The next president will have to be something of a political Superman , a man of steel who can tell the American people that they will have to pay more for less -- higher taxes , lower benefits of all kinds -- and deal in an ugly way when nuclear weapons seize the imagination of madmen .
The question I posed to that prominent Democrat was just my way of thinking out loud .
I know that Barack Obama is a near - perfect political package .
I 'm still not sure , though , what 's in it .

But to Herbert , it 's all about race

But to Herbert , its all about race : // link // print // previous // next //
MONDAY , AUGUST 4 , 2008 HOW OUR SIDE LOSES ELECTIONS :
What follows will diverge from our usual topics .
But it seems to us that the liberal world worked hard last week to lose the current White House election .
The data are already rolling in and we show few signs of understanding them .
To keep within our normal parameters , lets start with the Lieberman - Kerry match - up on yesterdays Meet the Press .
We think Tom Brokaw showed poor judgment in staging this surrogate match - up .
( In our view , Brokaw has been amazingly bad in his month on Meet the Press . )
The optics here were fairly clear : All Republicans favor McCainand so does a big famous Democrat .
It would be fine to stage a debate , as others have done , in which Lieberman promotes McCains stance on Iraq while Hagel promotes Obamas ; theres facial parity in such a battle .
But we think yesterdays match - up was poorly conceived .
By its nature , it was more prejudicial than probative ,  in a way which favored McCain .
That said , the two solons debated , for half an hour .
And uh - oh !
We thought Lieberman massacred Kerry , especially in the first ten minutes , in which Kerry did what our side did all last week :
Yelled eek - a- mouse about the idea that McCain would have run that vile , naughty ad .
That ad the ad with Britney Spears in it !
Good heavens !
Dear Jesus !
How dare he ?
In our view , liberal reaction was foolish all week .
On Sunday , we thought Kerry got massacred as he boo-hooed , blubbered , wept and wailed about that naughty ad .
Almost surely , David Gergen then made matters worse with his view of another McCain ad .
What happened last week when McCain ran that ad ?
Instead of laughing at the ad and saying it showed that McCain is a fly - weight , we did what we most love to do we started a fight about race , casting ourselves as the high - minded party and squealing , shrieking , complaining and yelping about McCains misconduct .
Josh Marshall was one who leaped to this stance , insisting that the use of Spears and Hilton was racial and racially troubling .
Yesterday , the results began rolling in and only a certain kind of liberal could be surprised by the numbers .
At TPM , Josh posted the following e-mail .
Later , he had to clean up what the e-mailer said about Tapper ( same link ) : E-MAIL TO TPM ( 8/3/08 ) : Disquieting Rasmussen numbers this morning McCain 's crying racism worked .
53 percent of Americans , including the same percentage of whites and half of all Democrats , think that Obama 's " dollar bill " remark was " racist . "
Only 22 percent think the Paris Hilton ad was racist most of those being black people , of course ( only 18 percent of white people took this view ) .
The good news this morning ?
God Bless David Gergen !
Really he was on This Week and said ( check the video or transcript for exact wording ) , " When McCain 's camp calls Obama  The Messiah  and  The One .  he 's really calling him uppity .
I 'm from the South , and we understand what that means .
That 's code . "
Jake Tapper looked like he had been pole - axed .
Donna Brazile knew what he was talking about , of course .
But GS , George Will , and Tapper had to be bluntly told the way the world works by Mr. Blandly Bi-partisan ....
That Rasmussen survey is only one measure , and no single survey can be definitive .
In fairness , its hard to know what regular people think the word racist means in this context .
But lets be frank :
You have to be especially clueless to be surprised by those disquieting  numbers to be surprised that McCains approach worked  and complaints about the Spears ad didnt .
Indeed , regarding the Hilton / Spears ad , were amazed that  18 percent of white people called it racist .
We re amazed that the numbers that high !
Yes , those numbers may be distressing .
But you have to be exceptionally clueless to be find the numbers surprising .
And yes , this is the way a certain type of liberal  has lost elections down through the years .
It was amazingly foolish to start yelling race about that silly blip of Spears .
When people like Josh insisted on this , they massively took the bait from McCainin a way the McCain campaign most likely never dreamed possible .
It was amazingly foolish to scream and yell about that Spears / Hilton adexcept to say that its foolishness shows that the GOP wants to distract you .
It was especially dumb to discuss it in terms of race to discuss its alleged dog - whistle since that s a claim that will almost surely strike most undecided voters as far - fetched , improbable , odd .
It wasnt smart to react that way unless we dont care who wins in November .
If we only care about being right ( in our minds ) , then that reaction made good sense , of course .
In past decades , liberals and lefties did this sort of thing quite often , as you might recall reading Nixonland .
This week , we rushed to take the bait again , displaying our high - minded ways .
Earth to liberals :
In that Spears / Hilton ad , McCain is calling Obama a lightweight .
It s what Walter Mondale did to Gary Hart when he mockingly asked ,  Where s the beef ? 
It s what experienced candidates do when confronting inexperienced challengers .
Unfortunately , we reacted in lightweight ways by yelling race and seeking relief and the numbers began to move .
It s how our side has lost elections at various times in the past .
Remember , once more , before you get mad :
This only matters if you care who wins .
If you want this to be a graduate seminar , go ahead knock yourselves out .
More on the topic :
More on this topic follows , below .
On our side , we think this was a foolish week unless we dont care about winning .
HERBERT , MEET DOWD AND MEET NARRATIVE :
We agreed with major parts of Bob Herberts column on Saturday .
For example :  Spare me any more drivel about the high - mindedness of John McCain ,  Herbert wrote .
As a general matter , we strongly agree .
But then , we started asking , in 1999 , why pundits insist on driving the tale of McCains brilliant character .
We also agree with the first two parts of the following paragraph : HERBERT ( 8/2/08 ) :
Whatever you think about Barack Obama , he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign .
Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for John McCain .
So I guess we understand Mr. McCains motivation [ in saying Obama played the race card . ]
Well stay away from definitive judgments about McCains motivation .
But we agree , whole - heartedly , that race is dangerous for Candidate Obama .
( See the post above . )
But wait theres more !
 [ I ] ts frustrating to watch John McCain calling out Barack Obama on race ,  Herbert wrote .
We agree with that sentiment too .
Obamas misstep last week was basically trivial , and McCain rode it hard all the way to the bank .
McCains record on race is spotty , unimpressive .
It s frustrating when he gains this advantage .
But we disagree with something Herbert said in this column and we thought his claim was striking .
And sure enough !
One day later , Maureen Dowd drove home our point for us !
Question : Is Obama being insulted mainly or wholly due to his race ?
That s the charge that Herbert made just before he said that discussions of race are dangerous to Obama .
Is Obama being insulted mainly or wholly due to his race ?
We agree somewhat with the start of this passage but with little that follows : HERBERT :
The racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control .
It was at work in that New Yorker cover that caused such a stir .
( Mr. Obama in Muslim garb with the American flag burning in the fireplace . )
It s driving the idea that Barack Obama is somehow presumptuous , too arrogant , too big for his britches a man who obviously does not know his place .
Mr. Obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity .
The reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black .
Is the racial fantasy factor out of control ?
We wouldnt put it that way ourselves , but we thought the New Yorker showed very poor judgment when it published that cartoon cover .
Race is a suspect category  in the law .
In our view , it should be a suspect category  in humor and publishing too .
On the other hand : Does a racial fantasy factor explain the fact that Obama has been tagged as presumptuous , too arrogant , too big for his britches ? 
Does Obamas race constitute  the sole reason hes been subjected to such grotesque insults ?
This claim might seem to make perfect sense if youve lived on Mars for the past dozen years .
But in fact , Candidates Kerry and Edwards and Gore were tagged in remarkably similar ways .
In fact , this is the way Democratic nominees get tagged in modern elections .
Is Obama presumptuous , too arrogant ?
With minor variations , that s the way all Dem nominees now get tagged by Republicans , and within large chunks of the press corps .
With minor variations depending on circumstance , its the standard put - down of Dem nominees .
We think its striking that Herbert doesnt seem to know this factor doesnt want to discuss it .
Just how standard is this put - down ?
Just consider Maureen Dowds treatment of Obama and Kerry .
In yesterdays Times , Dowd offered her latest wail from inside the walls of Versailles .
The lady gazed upon Obama and saw a proud , haughty man : DOWD ( 8/3/08 ) : Obama bears a distinct resemblance to the most cherished hero in chick - lit history .
The senator is a modern incarnation of the clever , haughty , reserved and fastidious Mr. Darcy .
Like the leading man of Jane Austen and Bridget Jones , Obama can , as Austen wrote , draw  the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien .
... he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased . 
As she gazed on this Dem nominee , Dowd thought of Pride and Prejudice .
But then , that s precisely where her thoughts turned four years ago as she gazed on proud , haughty Kerry !
Heres what our biggest Antoinette said then , about that Dem presumptive : DOWD ( 3/18/04 ) :
The election is shaping up as a contest between Pride and Prejudice .
Mr. Kerry is Pride .
 He has a tendency toward striped - trouser smugness ,  Dowd moronically said .
To drive home her point , she then quoted 
Kerry saying something about NASCAR  something hed never said : DOWD ( 3/18/04 ) :
Even when he puts on that barn jacket over his expensive suit to look less lockjaw and says things like , '' Who among us does n't like Nascar ? he can come across like Mr. Collins , Elizabeth Bennet 's pretentious cousin in '' Pride and Prejudice . ''
Mr. Collins always prattles on about how lucky people would be to be rewarded by his patron , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , with '' some portion of her notice ' ' and to receive dollops of her '' condescension . 
No , the proud Mr. Kerry had never made the comment Dowd quoted  in that passage .
But so what ?
The manufactured quote - that - wasnt helped us see how pretentious he was !
And , of course , as the year dragged on , it ran four additional times in the Times .
See THE DAILY HOWLER , 11/6/04 , with links to prior reports .
Let s review .
In 2004 , Candidate Kerry was said to be proudsmug , condescending , pretentious .
In 2008 , Candidate Obama is said to be proud presumptuous , haughty , above being pleased .
( Four years earlier , Candidate Gore was endlessly played as  the smartest kid in the class as someone who thinks hes better than you , just as Lady Hillary does . )
And Herbert , reporting directly from Mars , thinks  the sole reason for this portrait of Obama must be his race !
Weirdly , he says this in the same column where he says Obamas chance for election is endangered by discussions of race .
Let s spell out the basic shape of current presidential politics .
Let s try to guess why people like Herbert seem a bit clueless about it .
As has long been noted , voters prefer Democrats on most major issues ; this has been the case for years .
For that reason , Republicans have largely built White House campaigns around alleged issues of character .
Especially in the Clinton - Gore era , the mainstream press corps played along , giving loud voice to comic - book claims .
( Al Gore was raised at the Ritz ! )
Today , Obama is said to be haughty , pretentious much like the others before him .
In the process , punishing narratives have locked into place about those haughty Dems .
( John Edwards had a big house ! )
If you re didnt finish fifth from the bottom when you were in college if you actually know what you re talking about youre slammed for gross condescension .
At present , this is how White House elections get decided and liberal elites have done an extremely poor job explaining this bull - roar to the public .
But , for reasons unknown , Herbert thinks it must be all about race when this theme is now dumped on Obamas head .
Weve banged on Herbert a lot in the past year ; we only single him out today because Saturdays claim seemed so perverse .
In our view , it s much as weve described in the past : Herbert played along with these themes when they were aimed at the Clintons and Gore .
Now , when these themes are aimed at Obama , he seems to think its all brand new .
But then , theres a certain type of liberal who loves nothing so much as taking the high - minded stance about race .
Would these liberals rather be right ( at least in their own minds ) ?
Or would they rather let Obama be president ?
What Herbert said that was accurate : Quoting Herbert again , from Saturdays column :  Whatever you think about Barack Obama , he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign .
Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for John McCain . 
That is nt necessarily true , of course .
But libs and Dems should keep that warning in mind .
Same damn narrative , eight years back : From Herberts column , two days after Bush and Gores crucial first debate .
Anyone notice a narrative here ?
Here we see these trivial themes played out eight years ago : HERBERT ( 10/5/00 ) :
If he can somehow force himself to stop sighing and interrupting and behaving condescendingly in front of the television cameras , Al Gore may yet get elected president . [...]
But Vice President
Gore never wins easily .
He may have the experience and most of the issues on his side , but he can't keep his superciliousness in check .
He just ca n't do it .
So there he was on Tuesday night sighing loudly with disdain , or smiling contemptuously , or smugly , as Governor Bush did the best he could with this answer or that .
Earth to Al Gore :
This turns people off . [...]
But Mr. Gore seems to feel the need to pour it on to offer not just his answer to a given question , but to show us everything he knows about the topic .
He does n't seem to realize that in the real world , people hate Eddie Haskell . [...]
The vice president 's boorishness gets in the way of his message and almost certainly pushes some voters into a more favorable view of Mr. Bush , who benefits from a more conversational tone and the demeanor of an ordinary guy .
Was that Herbertor did Maureen Dowd write that ?
According to Herbert , Gore was condescending , supercilious , contemptuous , disdainful .
He was smug and boorish just as Kerry would turn out to be !
By contrast , Bush was more of an ordinary guy . 
Incredibly , Herbert even said that Bush did the best he could with this answer or that ,  even though many of his statements and charges were grossly , baldly inaccurate .
Eight years ago , Herbert was applying these RNC frameworks to the smug , supercilious Dem .
Today , these same frameworks get applied to Obamaand to Herbert , it s all about race .
He says this even as he says that discussions of race could doom Obama .
But then , our side is almost impossibly feckless .
It s how John McCain could still win .

On this page :
A few days ago somebody asked me why I bothered in the West Wind Ajax Toolkit with building a custom JSON parser , which is a valid question .
After all Microsoft now has two separate JSON parsers in the .NET framework so why use a custom parser ?
Some time ago - before the days of Microsoft Ajax 1.0 - I built my own .
NET JSON serializer and deserializer , because there 's was limited support for JSON serialization and more importantly deserialization available at the time .
There were a few frameworks out there - including my favorite which was Anthem at the time - which included JSON serializers that could send JSON data to JavaScript clients for consumption .
Generating JSON output is actually pretty straight forward as the encoding mechanisms are easy to produce even for complex and hierarchical objects from managed code .
The other end - de-serialization into a specific .NET type - is considerably more difficult to do because the language format for JSON is fairly terse with many redundant symbols .
Parsing JSON is no picknic especially if you want to build a parser that can validate JSON up front or during processing as invalid ( and in fact , the one I built does n't ) .
When I first started out on this path I used Anthem 's serializer as a base line and then tacked on my own de-serializer .
Right around the time that happened Microsoft released the fist builds of ASP.
NET AJAX ( ATLAS at the time ) which also included a new JavaScriptSerializer , which I was glad to see at the time .
I figured my code would n't be needed for too long so I did n't spend much time on making the de-serializer work perfect in all scenarios and let it be ' good enough ' for now to wait for release in the .NET framework .
Heck , after all deserialization of client data coming back to the server is less common than sending data , especially when talking about complex types coming back from the client .
But the need quickly accelerated as we all discovered the power of building JSON style RPC service interfaces that could effectively feed data back into the front Web UI .
It turned out to be a long haul to MS AJAX 1.0 and in the meantime I needed a solution and so the parser evolved .
Fast forward to today .
Currently the .NET framework contains two JavaScript JSON parsers to choose from :
JavaScriptSerializer in System .
Web.
Extensions
DataContractJsonSerializer in System.Runtime .Serialization .
Web
JavaScriptSerializer in System .
Web.
Extensions
This component is part of the ASP .
NET AJAX update library in System .
Web.
Extensions and allows serialization and deserialization of data .
The interface is pretty straight forward and works reasonably well for most data types in application scenarios .
The serializer works by simply passing an object and returning a string JSON result .
Type support is adequate although there are a some useful omissions .
In short you can do stuff like this :
StockServer ss = new StockServer ( ) ; StockQuote quote = ss.GetStockQuote( " MSFT " ) ; JavaScriptSerializer ser = new JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; string json = ser. Serialize ( quote ) ; StockQuote quote2 = ser.Deserialize < StockQuote >( json ) ;
to serialize and then deserialize content .
At first glance this looks great - it 's nice and easy but there 's a small , but annoying shortcoming here :
The Deserialize method is generic and so requires a type known at compile time - it can't be type variable , but has to be a type constant .
StockQuote quote2 = ser.Deserialize< StockQuote >( json ) ;
The generic parameter must be a type constant ( or typeof ( ) ) in order to work , but you can't do something like this :
Type stockType = quote . GetType( ) ; ... StockQuote quote2 = ser.Deserialize < stockType >( json ) ; // does n't work
because generics are compiler based and create effectively overloaded method stubs for each type variation .
Bummer in this case .
I really hate it when APIs provide ONLY generic interfaces and no way to specify a type dynamically .
Anyway , this means that out of the gate you can't easily create dynamic routines that do things like parsing a number of parameters say to forward calls to an object dynamically as you might do to build a JSON service .
Actually - after posting a small blip on Twitter today - I got a hint from Stuart Thompson about using Reflection to provide a generic parameter at runtime .
With that it 's possible to access to the Deserialize method with a type variable :
public static object FromJsonString ( string json , Type type ) { // ***
Have to use Reflection with a ' dynamic ' non constant type instance JavaScriptSerializer ser = new JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; object result = ser. GetType( ) .
GetMethod( " Deserialize " ) . MakeGenericMethod ( type ) .
Invoke ( ser , new object [ 1 ] { json } ) ; return result ; }
It 's ugly but it works for this scenario .
To make this more reusable you can create an Extension class that provides JSON features ToJson ( ) on object and FromJson ( ) on string along with classic static methods :
/// < summary >
/// Json Extensions based on the JavaScript Serializer in System.web /// </summary > public static class JsonExtensionsWeb { /// < summary > ///
Serializes a type to Json .
Note the type must be marked Serializable /// or include a DataContract attribute .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " value " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static string ToJsonString ( object value ) { JavaScriptSerializer ser = new JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; string json = ser.Serialize ( value ) ; return json ; } /// < summary > ///
Extension method on object that serializes the value to Json . ///
Note the type must be marked Serializable or include a DataContract attribute .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " value " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static string ToJson ( this object value ) { return ToJsonString ( value ) ; } /// < summary > ///
Deserializes a json string into a specific type .
///
Note that the type specified must be serializable .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " json " ></ param > /// < param name = " type " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static object FromJsonString ( string json , Type type ) { // ***
Have to use Reflection with a ' dynamic ' non constant type instance System .
Web.Script.Serialization .
JavaScriptSerializer ser = new System .
Web.Script.Serialization . JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; object result = ser. GetType( ) .
GetMethod( " Deserialize " ) . MakeGenericMethod ( type ) .
Invoke ( ser , new object [ 1 ] { json } ) ; return result ; } /// < summary > ///
Extension method to string that deserializes a json string /// into a specific type .
///
Note that the type specified must be serializable .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " json " ></ param > /// < param name = " type " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static object FromJson ( this string json , Type type ) { return FromJsonString ( json , type ) ; } public static TType FromJson < TType > ( this string json ) { System .
Web.Script.Serialization .
JavaScriptSerializer ser = new System .
Web.
Script. Serialization . JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; TType result = ser.Deserialize < TType >( json ) ; return result ; } }
One thing that 's nice about the JavaScriptSerializer is that it works on most common .NET types and does n't require any special object attributes .
I think this is an important feature of any JSON serializer because unlike typical ' Service ' interfaces often times JSON is used purely for UI services to feed data and having to specify any sort of attribute or markup contract only gets to be counter productive .
This is especially useful when used in combination with dynamic type results through anonymous types explicitly created in code or - probably more to the point - LINQ based custom results that are filtered down to only return the exact data required to the client .
Using the JavaScriptSerializer with the above extension classes allow you do the following with an anonymous type :
// ***
Can serialize anonymous types with JavaScriptSerializer var valueDyn = new { Name = " Rick Strahl " , Entered = DateTime .Now.AddDays(-10 ) , Number = 100.22 M } ; json = valueDyn.ToJson ( ) ; this .
WriteValue ( json ) ;
Note that while you can Serialize an anonymous type , you cannot Deserialize it because anonymous types do n't have a parameterless constructor .
However , if you have a concrete type that matches the object signature of the object serialized into JSON you can still potentially import the data .
So you can serialize just the data you need on the client , but you can deserialize back into the full originating type .
Another issue : JavaScriptSerializer chokes on circular references which are common in data models ( like LINQ to SQL ) .
Anyway - this dynamic behavior is quite useful and is a big plus of this serializer over the DataContractSerializer as we 'll see in a minute .
The JavaScriptSerializer has another problem though :
It 's now marked obsolete and according to the documentation and compiler error we 're supposed to use DataContractJsonSerializer for Json serialization .
I think it was a good idea that JSON moved into a more generic portion of the .NET framework , but unfortunately the DataContractJsonSerializer has even more restrictive interface than JavaScriptSerializer .
So in summary :
Pros :
Easy to use
Does n't require any marker interfaces to serialize objects
Cons :
API requires static types for Deserialization ( generic method only )
Dynamic Types require Reflection and extra code
Class has been deprecated by Microsoft
Does n't work with a few common data structures
Chokes on circular references
DataContractJsonSerializer
DataContractJsonSerializer is part of .NET 3.5 WCF extensions and lives in System .
ServiceModel .
Web .
The primary purpose of this new Serializer - and it shows - is to handle the JSON serialization support for the .NET 3.5 WCF
Http extensions which provide REST and AJAX services that are specifically geared to the Web model .
As such the WCF 3.5 REST and AJAX services are quite at odds with the rest of WCF in that they do n't interoperate really as smoothly as other service types that can usually just tweak a few configuration settings and enjoy the same behavior for various different protocols .
The difference here is that the HTTP protocols are highly specialized to REST and AJAX scenarios which does n't fit with the SOAP style messaging normally used in WCF .
IOW , the HTTP REST / AJAX services are the odd man out when it comes to WCF functionality .
The DataContractSerializer clearly is geared towards serving the needs of the WCF platform as it uses and even requires use of attributes to adorn objects and members to allow them to be serialized and deserialized .
And therein is probably the biggest downfall of the DataContractJsonSerializer :
It requires WCF compatible types and attributes .
The model for serialization is also a bit more verbose than the JavaScriptSerializer , although it 's nothing that a small wrapper method can't fix easily .
Here 's how to serialize and deserialize :
StockServer ss = new StockServer ( ) ; StockQuote quote = ss.GetStockQuote( " IBM " ) ; DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer ( typeof ( StockQuote ) ) ; MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream ( ) ; ser.
WriteObject ( ms , quote ) ; string json = Encoding .Default.GetString(ms.ToArray ( ) ) ; // *** Deserialize ms = new MemoryStream ( Encoding .Unicode.GetBytes( json ) ) ; ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer ( typeof ( StockQuote ) ) ; StockQuote quote2 = ser.ReadObject ( ms ) as StockQuote ; ms. Close ( ) ;
The DataContractJsonSerializer is a little more work to use than the JavaScriptSerializer as it works off input streams , but it 's still pretty simple .
The code used can be easily abstracted and the serializer works well as long as you 're working off serializable types .
For completeness here 's the same extension class using the DataContractSerializer as the base converter :
public static class JsonExtensions { /// < summary > ///
Serializes a type to Json .
Note the type must be marked Serializable /// or include a DataContract attribute .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " value " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static string ToJsonString ( object value ) { DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer ( value.GetType( ) ) ; MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream ( ) ; ser.
WriteObject ( ms , value ) ; string json = Encoding .Default.GetString(ms.ToArray ( ) ) ; return json ; } /// < summary > ///
Extension method on object that serializes the value to Json . ///
Note the type must be marked Serializable or include a DataContract attribute .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " value " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static string ToJson ( this object value ) { return ToJsonString ( value ) ; } /// < summary > ///
Deserializes a json string into a specific type .
///
Note that the type specified must be serializable .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " json " ></ param > /// < param name = " type " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static object FromJsonString ( string json , Type type ) { MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream ( Encoding .Unicode.GetBytes(json ) ) ; DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer ( type ) ; object value = ser.ReadObject ( ms ) ; ms. Close ( ) ; return value ; } /// < summary > ///
Extension method to string that deserializes a json string /// into a specific type .
///
Note that the type specified must be serializable .
/// </summary > /// < param name= " json " ></ param > /// < param name = " type " ></ param > /// < returns ></returns > public static object FromJson ( this string json , Type type ) { return FromJsonString ( json , type ) ; } }
The big problem with DataContractSerializer is that it only works off serializable types .
You need to either have the type marked with a [ DataContract ] and explicit [ DataMember ] values or the type must be marked as [ Serializable ] .
Both might make good sense for WCF style service scenarios but for JSON messages sent from Web applications this requirement is pretty much a deal killer .
This also means no anonymous type support so if you want to use this serializer with data returned from LINQ queries you 'll have to make sure you return full entities and these entities are marked up with the appropriate attributes .
Yechh ...
Pros :
Microsoft 's official JSON parser
Works with dynamic types
Updated and integrated with WCF
Deals with circular references ( also some control over depth of serialization )
Cons :
Requires marked up types - Serializable or DatContract / DataMember required
Requires a number of assembly refs
So where does that leave us ?
As I mentioned at the outset , the two parsers are workable , but both have their issues .
Clearly Microsoft is pushing towards DataContractJsonSerializer , but with it come some limitations that make it somewhat unusable in certain scenarios .
For me the inability to push results from dynamic LINQ queries to the client is proving to be fatal .
JavaScriptSerializer works well enough with a few exceptions , but the problem here is the the Obsoleting by Microsoft .
Also I have a fair bit of legacy code that uses DataSets and DataTables fed back from list based data of business objects and it's very useful to feed that to the client as object arrays .
This will change eventually , but in the meantime this old code needs to continue to work with this data .
This can be done with JavaScriptSerializer by creating special TypeResolvers but it 's a pain - this should just be built in even if some functionality is one way .
The other issue is that both serializers are using some proprietary formats for things like dates .
It 's not a bad solution as long as you 're running MS AJAX or a compatible framework ( my toolkit also supports those formats ) , but if a client passes data in a different format ( say new Date ( ) or the new ' suggested ' ISO date literal ) the deserializers choke , which is problematic when dealing with non-.NET based client JSON serialization .
For me - it means I can't switch to the built in JSON parsers , so for the time being I 'm sticking with my existing home grown parser which addresses all of these issues .
But , maintenance of a parser is always a pain especially as standard changes and additions are likely to occur .
JavaScript serialization is pretty trivial , but the deserialization can get pretty gnarly quickly especially if validation is required :-{. I 'd much rather use something out of the box .
So I 'm hoping that Microsoft will step up and provide something that 's a little more light handed than the DataContractJsonSerializer .
There are also several other libraries out there including JSON .
Net , Ajax .
Net Pro , Anthem .
Net and several others that also provide JSON services with varying degrees of flexibility as is the West Wind Ajax Toolkit where you can find the above mentioned free standing JSON parser .
I use JSON serialization daily and for the moment at least I 'm glad that I have a custom parser in place because I have more control over the process and can allow any kind of content to go through the parser and format it as needed easily .
In the end that 's what counts ...

It says here according to Reuters by way of the Associated Press and America On Line that " Mars could resemble the lawless Wild West if privately funded adventurers seeking to exploit the planet get there before governments , a leading British astronomer said Wednesday " .
Ooooooooh ...
The " leading astronomer " , somebody calling himself Sir Smugly Pinchbottom - Rabbitwarrenor at least he should have been a net tax consumer wallowing in a plush gig at something calling itself the Institute of Astronomy , was addressing some sort of science conference in Leicester , England when he delivered his dire prognostication .
I 'm pretty sure that a cold shiver of goosefleshed apprehension traveled through the assembled nerdity , government - nourished one and all , as he did .
There could well be a permanent human presence on the Red Planet within a century , Sir Smugly boldly predicted ( somehow completely unaware of predictions exactly like that having been made for more than a century ) .
He warned his audience that if these settlers are privately funded adventurers of gasp !free - enterprise , or even anarchic disposition , the result could resemble the American Wild West .
Heaven forfend !
Does n't everybody know that if humankind continues to insist on expanding outward from Earth , into the rest of the Solar System , that explorers and settlers must be preceded by bureaucrats who will set up offices for the IRS ( make that " Inland Revenue for Sir Smugly ) , the EPA , and the ATF ?
It would n't be real civilization without them , would it ?
The remainder of the article , which an old friend was kind enough to send me , confined itself pretty much to this telescope - jockey 's antiquated views on " more efficient propulsion systems " and space elevators .
Through the whole thing , though , I kept wondering why he cared .
What makes Sir Smugly interested enough in exploring the void and settling new worlds to make a speech about it ?
What golden vision of the future moves him besides more rules , more regimentation , more parking meters , more George Bush and more Tony Blair ?
If that 's all Sir Smugly wants out of the future , he can stand on any streetcorner in London ( Islington 's nice ; you can visit a quaint street market , buy tiny clams in a paper cone , and eat them raw with salt ) , breathe the pollution , and appreciate all of the scenic hundreds of DON'T DO THIS signs .
Me , ladies and gentlemen , I want that " lawless Wild West " , he whimpered about , because in a way the 20th century has utterly failed to do it worked .
A sociological study twenty years ago showed that in the third quarter of the 19th century in the " lawful mild East " Nantucket , I think it may have been ( or is that just the limerick I 'm remembering ? ) .
No , make it New Bedford , Mass .
where hardly anybody had a gun and they suffered 140 murders in ten years and a proportionate number of other violent crimes .
In Leadville , Colorado , by comparison , a town of similar size and composition , they had exactly zero murders because everyone had guns and knew how to use them .
Look at it this way : there were so few violent criminals in the American West that to this day we remember their individual names .
Can you think of any famous eastern American criminals from the same period of history ?
If you can't , it is n't because they were so few of them .
As I write this , there 's a big , heavy , large - caliber semiautomatic pistol lying on the desk beside my keyboard .
( There 's always a big , heavy , large - caliber semiautomatic pistol lying on my desk beside my keyboard . )
I have a low - slung belt for it somewhere , and a western style holster .
Why is it there , cluttering up my mouse - space ?
Partly I just love looking at the damned thing .
Partly , it 'll put a hole in an intruder I can throw a dog through .
Partly , I know from experience that I can hit a man-sized target with it anywhere within a hundred yards .
If I live long enough to go to Mars , that heavy , large - caliber semiautomatic pistol , or something like it , is going with me , to slap my right thigh as I shuffle through the Martian desert looking for ... but that 's another story , is n't it ?
One I 'll write after I finish Ceres .
I 'll be the crusty old - timer nobody can understand the oxygen helmet probably wo n't help who fills 'em full of bullets or laser holes or something whenever they try to set up an office for the Department of Agriculture or the Veteran 's Administration .
They wo n't hang me for it , though .
I 'll be backed up by other crusty old - timers who do n't want to see the faintest trace of government besmirching the pristine surface of the Red Planet .
A good thing , too , because getting hanged on Mars will be even more unpleasant than getting hanged on Earth , involving weights tied to your feet , or a big , complicated centrifuge , or a gallows three times as high and rope three times as long .
Somebody needs to tell Sir Smugly that individuals flock to a frontier because they want to get away from things like government .
The great Freeman Dyson once observed that when we finally get out to the asteroids , the IRS will never be able to find us .
It 's true , sooner or later , the preachers and bankers and lawyers come along to spoil it all , but before that , our species gets to try out new ideas and reshape its way of life .
Human progress gets made before the Roddy MacDowalls insinuate themselves and stifle it , and it 's time to move on .
Finally there was n't a place in the American West to move on to .
But as Captain Kirk should have observed , space is the endless frontier .
First the planets , then the stars , and eventually other galaxies .
Which means perpetual human progress something that statists , authoritarians , and bureaucrats , suffering a sort of sociopolitical " motion sickness " Robert LeFevre first described , all fear .
But humanity needs to learn to live without government because it 's killing them .
Amnesty International tells us that , between war and other officially - sanctioned bloodlust , governments of every type possible murdered a quarter of a billion in the 20th century .
It will be able , thanks to technology , to kill many more than that in the 21st century .
If I live that long , I plan on not being here .
How about you ?
June 19 , 2008  --
IT staff routinely snoop on users , riffling through their e-mails and personal files , a newly released survey has found .
One IT administrator laughingly said : " Why does it surprise you that so many of us snoop around your files , would n't you , if you had secret access to anything you can get your hands on ? "
Few ordinary users realize that one in three of their IT work colleagues are snooping through company systems , peeking at confidential information such as your private files , wage data , personal e-mails , and HR background , using admin privileges .
These are the findings of a survey released today by digital vaulting specialist Cyber - Ark Software , which carried out the research at last month 's Infosecurity Exhibition as part of its annual survey into " Trust , Security and Passwords . "
What 's more , the survey found that more than one - third of IT professionals admit they could still access their company 's network once they 'd left their current job , with no one to stop them .
More than 200 IT professionals participated in the survey with many revealing that although it was n't corporate policy to allow IT workers to access systems after termination , over one - quarter of respondents knew of another IT staff member who still had access to sensitive networks even though they 'd left the company long ago .
More than half of people still keep their passwords on a Post - It note , in spite of all the education and reminders from the IT security industry to do it differently .
Even IT pros do it too : over half of respondents admitted to using Post - It notes to store passwords to administrator accounts .
One IT administrator said : " Sure , it 's easy for an employee to update the personal password to their laptop , but to change the administrator password on that same machine ?
It would take days for IT to do them all by hand .
In the end , we just pick one password for all the systems and write it down . "
One - fifth of all organizations admitted that they rarely changed their administrative passwords with seven percent saying they never change administrative passwords .
This may explain why one - third of all people questioned would still have access to their network even if they 'd left the company .
Eight percent of IT professionals said that the manufacturer 's default admin password on critical systems had never been changed .
This remains the most common way for hackers to break into corporate networks .
Gary McKinnon , dubbed " the most profligate military hacker of all time " for gaining entry to 90 US military computer systems computers by scanning for blank administrator accounts , said : " The easiest way to infiltrate a company 's network is to look for administrative passwords which are left blank , still have the manufacturer 's default password or just use obvious names .
Once you find these , which are unbelievably simple and common to find , you 're into the system and have the highest level of authority -- bingo you 've got control of the company 's system . "
The survey also showed that most companies mismanage the storage of administrative passwords by keeping them in unsecured locations and not controlling access to these critical codes .
Just over half ( 57 percent ) of companies store their administrative passwords manually , 18 percent store them in an Excel spreadsheet , and 82 per ent of IT professionals store them in their heads -- hindering security efforts , business continuity , as well as the auditing , controlling and managing of passwords .
In the event that the keeper of these critical administrative passwords is unavailable or loses the location of the passwords , it can cause massive disruption and hours of lost productivity .
Fifteen percent of companies interviewed had experienced insider sabotage .
According to a recent study by Carnegie Mellon University , the most common insider attack is by a disgruntled IT employee using anonymous access from a privileged account .
Calum Macleod , European Director for Cyber - Ark , said : " It 's surprising to find out how rife snooping is in the workplace .
Gone are the days when you had to break into the filing cabinet in the personnel department to get at vital and highly confidential information .
Now all you need to have is the administrative password and you can snoop around most places , and it appears that is exactly what 's happening .
" Companies need to wake up to the fact that if they do n't introduce layers of security , tighten up who has access to vital information , and manage and control privileged passwords , then snooping , sabotage and hacking will continue to be rife . "
The moral of the story is that if you do n't want anyone from the besuited senior IT director to the newest IT admin poking about in your personal data , do n't bring it to work .
Paris , France : The Board of ICANN today approved a recommendation that could see a whole range of new names introduced to the Internet 's addressing system .
" The Board today accepted a recommendation from its global stakeholders that it is possible to implement many new names to the Internet , paving the way for an expansion of domain name choice and opportunity " said Dr Paul Twomey , President and CEO of ICANN .
A final version of the implementation plan must be approved by the ICANN Board before the new process is launched .
It is intended that the final version will be published in early 2009 .
" The potential here is huge .
It represents a whole new way for people to express themselves on the Net , " said Dr Twomey .
" It 's a massive increase in the ' real estate ' of the Internet . "
Presently , users have a limited range of 21 top level domains to choose from — names that we are all familiar with like .com , .org , .info .
This proposal allows applicants for new names to self - select their domain name so that choices are most appropriate for their customers or potentially the most marketable .
It is expected that applicants will apply for targeted community strings such as ( the existing ) . travel for the travel industry and .cat for the Catalan community ( as well as generic strings like . brandname or . yournamehere ) .
There are already interested consortiums wanting to establish city - based top level domain , like .nyc ( for New York City ) , . berlin and .paris .
" One of the most exciting prospect before us is that the expanding system is also being planned to support extensions in the languages of the world , " said Peter Dengate Thrush , ICANN 's Chairman .
" This is going to be very important for the future of the Internet in Asia , the Middle East , Eastern Europe and Russia . "
The present system only supports 37 Roman characters .
Upon approval of the implementation plan , it is planned that applications for new names will be available in the second quarter of 2009 .
Frequently asked questions on the process
1 . Are you selling these new names ?
ICANN is not " selling " new top level domain names .
There will be a limited application period where any established entity from anywhere in the world can submit an application that will go through an evaluation process .
It is anticipated that there will be additional rounds relatively soon after the close of the first application round .
2 . What 's to stop others registering my brand name ?
Trademarks will not be automatically reserved .
But there will be an objection - based mechanism for trademark owners where their arguments for protection will be considered .
3 . How did this proposal get developed ?
ICANN has a multi-stakeholder policy development process that served as the foundation for the process design .
It involved consultation with domain name industry , trade mark attorneys , the business sector , users , governments and technicians .
4 . How will offensive names be prevented ?
Offensive names will be subject to an objection - based process based on public morality and order .
This process will be conducted by an international arbitration body utilizing criteria drawing on provisions in a number of international treaties .
ICANN will not be the decision maker on these objections .
5 . When will all this happen ?
ICANN is working towards accepting the first applications in the second quarter of 2009 .
About ICANN :
ICANN is responsible for the global coordination of the Internet 's system of unique identifiers like domain names ( like .org , . museum and country codes like .uk ) and the addresses used in a variety of Internet protocols that help computers reach each other over the Internet .
Careful management of these resources is vital to the Internet 's operation , so ICANN 's global stakeholders meet regularly to develop policies that ensure the Internet 's ongoing security and stability .
ICANN is an internationally organized , public benefit non-profit company .

This could result in Microsoft losing some of its market share with pre-loaded Windows Vista on new PCs .
This looks like the tide is changing and it could be good for all consumers PCs become cheaper with Linux preloaded instead of Windows Vista .
On Tuesday , IBM put its reputation and strength behind Linux distributors Canonical , Novell , and Red Hat in building Microsoft free PCs for business .
Also at the LinuxWorld conference in San Francisco , IBM announced its first certified package of open source software for Linux - based supercomputers .
In the Microsoft - related announcement , IBM and its partners said there ’s market demand for less expensive PCs than those that ship with the Windows operating system and Microsoft ’s Office suite of applications .
The four companies see Vista , the latest version of Windows , as opening the door for OS rivals .
Among the complaints of Vista is that it requires more powerful computers than those running XP , the previous version of Windows .
As a result , many businesses have delayed upgrading to Vista until the end of their hardware life cycle .
IBM said this gives it and the Linux distributors the opportunity to work with hardware partners to offer PCs preloaded with Linux and IBM ’s Open Collaboration Client Solution , which includes Lotus Notes , Lotus Symphony , and Lotus Sametime .
George Orwell was Wrong
George Orwell 's 1984 loomed over my childhood .
Years prior to the prevalence of futuristic fiction portraying post - nuclear wastelands , 1984 seemed the most horrifying future possible , one of complete regimentation , hypocrisy , cruelty and the denial of human dignity .
While schoolteachers assigned 1984 presumably to give us an impression of what life was like under Soviet communism , the effort backfired : the world portrayed in the book seemed like a reflection of my own public school , P.S. 193 , in a distorted mirror , with the principal 's office substituting for the torture room described as the " place where it is always light . "
The disturbing premise for which 1984 stands is that human beings can be brainwashed .
If you revise history enough to serve your purposes , and shout at them in classrooms and from loudspeakers , sealing the one - sided social contract with violence against the independent , humans will fall into line , Orwell said , like so many sheep .
People will believe whatever they are told , and are no better than automatons .
Reading 1984 can make you feel depressed and suicidal , as if there is no hope for the race and we may as well end it now .
In retrospect , 1984 itself is a revision of history , and the school 's use of it to influence us against communism itself seems a form of attempted brainwashing .
I do not know enough about Orwell to know whether , in writing it , he was most concerned about the evils of Soviet society or of his own , but the portrait he gives both in 1984 and of Animal Farm of shifting allegiances certainly shows that he knew that realpolitik ultimately ignores all moral issues and will sit down to breakfast with a murderer -- or commit murder -- when that suits its purposes .
A story worthy of Orwell is the one which describes the Nixon administration effort to find a rationale for the bloody U.S. - supported coup in Chile .
One adviser suggested the strategic geographical importance of Chile .
Kissinger , barely able to keep a straight face , replied , " Yes .... Chile is a dagger pointed at the heart of Antarctica . "
The schools I attended made a show of democracy and of justice without any substance .
We held student elections , but the opinions the candidates were allowed to utter came from a cookie cutter , as we discovered in 1968 when a candidate campaigning against the Vietnam war was removed from the ballot .
" Another nail in your coffin , " the dean observed when this individual made his last defiant speech before the school assembly .
At a meeting held to explain to parents this and certain other repressive measures , the principal observed , " What ?
And let them vote for anyone they want ? "
Smiling , urbane Dean
Wolf would call you into his office and make you understand that you were a piece of shit , beyond redemption .
President Nixon , nervous and shaky , would appear on television to describe acts of murderous madness in a vocabulary so technically and morally indirect and obtuse that it was hard not to draw the parallel to the official explanations of the endless strategic repositionings of the great powers in 1984 .
The difference , as I came to understand , between 1984 and reality was not the behavior of leadership , which easily slides into lies , torture and empty words , but the nature of human beings , who cannot easily be led or changed .
While all of the torments human beings inflict on one another derive from this feature , so do human resilence and persistence .
Rather than there being an endless variety of human natures , as the ethical relativists say , there is only one , with relatively trivial local variations .
Or , to put it another way , the human heart varies much less than human custom does .
An article in yesterday 's New York Times , reporting on Islamic African women , described how much they hate polygamy , though they have lived with it for centuries .
Sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson , quoting an earlier work of sociology in his book On Human Nature , lists the things all human cultures have in common :
Age - grading , athletic sports , bodily adornment , calendar , cleanliness training , community organization , cooking , cooperative labor , cosmology , courtship ....
And so on , including ethics , government , and law .
We were taught in school that the Soviet people were not like us , a preliminary demonization of the other that is the necessary prelude to war or murder .
But when the Soviet system was dismantled in the 1980's , we found out that , contrary to Orwell , seven decades of Soviet rule had not succeeded at all in changing human nature .
The worst and the most beautiful part of human beings , both of which had been threatened and suppressed by the Soviets , had simply behaved like the insect described by Thoreau :
Everyone has heard the story , which has gone the rounds of New England , of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple - tree wood , which had stood in a farmer 's kitchen for sixty years , first in Connecticut , and afterwards in Massachusetts , -- from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still , as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it ; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks , hatched perchance by the heat of an urn ....
Who knows what beautiful and winged life , whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society , deposited at the first in the alburnum of the green and living tree , which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well - seasoned tomb , -- heard perchance gnawing out now for many years by the astonished family of man , as they sit round the festive board , -- may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society 's most trivial and handselled furniture , to enjoy its perfect summer life at last !
Thus , people who had been born under Soviet rule , and who never had known anything else , who had been taught that property is theft and that common ownership of the means of production is the solution , that democracy is oligarchy and that dictatorship of the proletariat is the remedy , emerged from the Sovet collapse desiring material things and with an urging for democracy .
But Communist rule in eastern Europe had also damped down hatred and murderous impulses , and the slaughter in Yugoslavia represents the return of the repressed just as much as elections in Russia do .
From this point of view , Thoreau was an optimist .
The human heart is strong and resilient , and completely recalcitrant .
You can make laws or exercise terror to make people mute , but you cannot make them want to give up their voices .
You can make people refrain from murder , but it appears you cannot make them love their neighbor , or even make them not murderous .
When the Soviet snows melted away , all life , it seems , went on before .
Orwell was a hysteric .
He believed that government can instill fanaticism .
Perhaps it can for a short time , but humans bend back to their original shape , like the grass after the hound has arisen from its sleep .
It seems more likely , if you look around the world today , that fundamentalisms arise in opposition to government , not because of it .
Like democracy and capitalism , government of any kind and fundamentalism follow different rulebooks .
Fundamentalism , like capitalism , is a means to an end ; fundamentalists believe that the kingdom of heaven , whatever that represents to them , will reign on earth , or that the millenium will arrive and end everything and we will live in heaven .
But all governments , even autocratic ones , obey a law of permanence which contradicts all fundamentalism .
Once fundamentalists conquer , as they did in Iran , the bureaucrats and pragmatists come to the fore .
Running around , screaming and seizing embassy buildings is all very well , but someone must make sure the milk is delivered and the trains run .
1984 represented a world of constantly organized alarms and diversions , show trials , and other spectacles to keep people diverted , frightened and obedient ; but the Soviet , Iranian and Chinese experiences all prove that you can only keep that up for so many decades .
Not only are the people not convinced , but after a while even the leaders tire and cannot continue .
The experiment , as T.S. Eliot said , ends " not with a bang but a whimper . "
A bittersweet article in the Times described Iranian teenagers , born under the government of the mullahs , sneaking up into the mountains where the girls can take off the chador and everyone behaves like teenagers everywhere , while Iranian politicians try to convince the West that the fatwa against Salman Rushdie , though it can never be rescinded , will not be " enforced " .
In China , everyone knows it is just a matter of time until the promise made by and to the young man who stood in front of the tank -- the most moving image of the late twentieth century -- is fulfilled .
The French have a typically cynical saying , " tout casse , tout passe , tout lasse " -- everything breaks , everything passes , everything wears out .
While , as Robert Frost told us , " nothing gold can stay , " it also seems to be true that evil wears out eventually .
While the murder in Bosnia represents all human irrationality -- pride , hypocrisy , covetousness , hate , and the willingness to demonize and kill -- the decision by the PLO and Israel to lay down arms also demonstrates that humans cannot keep up this business of killing for many decades before they desire to stop and become better , different and quieter than they were .
Shakespeare 's words ,
Our revels now are ended .
These our actors ,
As I foretold you , were all spirits and
Are melted into air , into thin air ;
And , like the baseless fabric of this vision ,
The cloud - capped towers , the gorgeous palaces ,
The solemn temples , the great globe itself ,
Yea , all which it inherit , shall dissolve ,
And , like this insubstantial pageant faded ,
Leave not a rack behind ...
apply to evil structures as well as to good ones .
Long before I married , thinking about the oft - repeated statistics that one or even two out of three marriages ended in divorce , I imagined that there should be nothing easier in the world than for a man and woman to live together happily , mixing mutual recognition and love , making life sweet for one another .
For the same reasons , there is nothing simpler than for men to live in peace with one another as well .
The desire for quiet , for good cheer , for comfort , is as deeply rooted within us as the contradictory desire for ownership , dominance and adventure .
Philip K. Dick portrayed in The Man in the High Castle a vision of Nazi Germany triumphant , forty years after the war .
A moderate faction is coming to the fore , struggling for dominance , renouncing the excesses of its forebears .
It is easy to imagine , for it has happened in so many other places and times in the world .
One imagines German children playing games of " SS and Jews " , then a gradual turnabout revealed , forty or fifty years after the event , by the growth of a literature and cinema idealizing the murdered Jews and yearning for them , culminating in an award - winning film starring matinee idol Karl Kostner , Dances with Jews ....
Moderation is what we achieve in a state of rest , while fundamentalism represents the results of motion and disturbance .
The Second Law of Thermodynamics , as represented in the French saying , " tout lasse " , reassures us that , contrary to Orwell , there is no such thing as a malevolent structure in a steady state .
Evil always recurs but always wears out .
Exhaustion is our best guarantee of moral , if not technological progress .
Dawn comes after sleep .
Thoreau concluded Walden , immediately after telling the story of the bug , with these words :
Only that day dawns to which we are awake .
There is more day to dawn .
The sun is but a morning star .
Platonic Solids and the Quaternions
While you 're pondering that , let me tell you another way to get some of the 4d regular polytopes .
This method involves quaternions , which are a souped - up version of the complex numbers with three square roots of - 1 , called i , j , and k .
A typical quaternion looks like this :
a + bi + cj + dk
where a , b , c , and d are real numbers .
To multiply the quaternions , you need to use these rules , invented by Hamilton back in 1843 :
i2 = j2 = k2 = - 1
ij = - ji = k
jk = - kj = i
ki = - ik = j
Let 's start with the 24 - cell , since this guy has no analog in other dimensions .
Since the vertices of the 24 - cell lie on the unit sphere in 4 dimensions , we can think of its vertices as certain unit quaternions .
The 24 - cell happens to have , not only 24 faces , but also 24 vertices !
We can take them to be precisely the unit ' Hurwitz integral quaternions ' , which are quaternions of the form
a + bi + cj + dk
where a , b , c , d are either all integers or all integers plus 1 / 2 .
One can check that the Hurwitz integral quaternions are closed under multiplication , so the vertices of the 24 - cell form a subgroup of the unit quaternions .
A regular polytope that 's a symmetry group in its own right - ponder that while you cross your eyes and gaze at it spinning around !
Similarly , the 600 - cell has 120 vertices , which we can think of as certain unit quaternions .
We can take them to be precisely the unit ' icosians ' .
These are quaternions of the form
a + bi + cj + dk
where a , b , c , d all live in the ' golden field ' - meaning that they 're of the form x +
√ 5 y where x and y are rational .
Since the icosians are closed under multiplication a group under multiplication , the vertices of the 120 - cell also form a group !
The vertices of the 4 - dimensional cross-polytope also form a subgroup of the unit quaternions .
But this one is a little less exciting .
We just take the quaternions of the form
a + bi + cj + dk
where one of the numbers a , b , c , d is 1 or - 1 , and the rest are zero .
This 8 - element subgroup is sometimes called ' the quaternion group ' .
Those are all the 4 - dimensional regular polytopes that are also groups .
Three out of six ain't bad !
But we can get most of the rest using duality .
In general , the ' dual ' of a regular polytope is another polytope , also regular , having one vertex in the center of each face of the polytope we started with .
The dual of the dual of a regular polytope is the one we started with ( only smaller ) .
So polytopes come in mated pairs - except for some ' self - dual ' ones .
In 2 dimensions , every regular polytope is its own dual .
In 3 dimensions , the tetrahedron is self - dual .
The dual of the cube is the octahedron .
And the dual of the dodecahedron is the icosahedron .
In 4 dimensions , the 4 - simplex is self - dual .
The 24 - cell is also self - dual - that 's why it had 24 faces and also 24 vertices !
The dual of the hypercube is the 4 - dimensional cross-polytope .
The dual of the 120 - cell is the 600 - cell .
In higher dimensions , the n-simplex is self - dual , and the dual of the n-cube is the n-dimensional cross-polytope .
But what is so special about 4 dimensions , exactly ?
Well , there are very few dimensions in which the unit sphere is also a group .
It happens only in dimensions 1 , 2 , and 4 !
In 1 dimensions the unit sphere is just two points , which we can think of as the unit real numbers , - 1 and 1 .
In 2 dimensions we can think of the unit sphere as the unit complex numbers , exp ( iθ ) .
In 4 dimensions we can think of the unit sphere as the unit quaternions .
Only in these dimensions do we get polytopes that are also groups in a natural way .
In 2 dimensions all the regular n- gons correspond to groups consisting of the unit complex numbers exp ( 2πi /n ) .
In 4 dimensions things are more subtle and interesting .
It 's especially interesting because the group of unit quaternions , also known as SU ( 2 ) , happens to be the ' double cover ' of the rotation group in 3 dimensions .
Roughly speaking , this means that there is a nice function sending 2 elements of SU ( 2 ) to each rotation in 3 dimensions .
This gives a slick way to construct the 600 - cell , or hypericosahedron .
Take the icosahedron in 3 dimensions .
Consider its group of rotational symmetries .
This is a 60 - element subgroup of the rotation group in 3 dimensions .
Now look at the corresponding subgroup of SU ( 2 ) - its ' double cover ' , so to speak .
This is a 120 - element subgroup of the unit quaternions .
These are the vertices of the hypericosahedron !
So in a very real sense , the hypericosahedron is just the symmetries of the icosahedron !
This trick does n't work in higher dimensions .
This is one thing that 's very cool about 4 dimensions - it inherits the hypericosahedron and the hyperdodecahedron from the the fact that the icosahedron and dodecahedron happen to exist in 3 dimensions .
Similarly , the 24 - cell comes from the symmetries of the tetrahedron !

Do you remember the failure of MediaMax / TheLinkUp ?
These two startups had an idea of offering online storage with social networking .
Wuala is a new service that pairs a similar plan with some unique technologies and capabilities .
One reason Wuala is a head of the rest is that it ’s based on Java .
This gives it some of the advantages of desktop applications and of Web apps .
It can perform tasks such as encryption using the local machine ’s hardware , rather than remotely on a server .
Like a Web application , it can be launched from a browser , and requires no installation , meaning it will work on public Internet stations .
Wuala ’s creators made security a priority : Users ’ passwords are not even stored on the service .
But there ’s a corresponding drawback , however ; if the user forgets his password , even Wuala employees cannot retrieve the data .
“ After more than three years of development and ten months of testing in closed alpha , we are very proud to release Wuala to the public ” , said Dominik Grolimund , Wuala ’s chief executive .
“ Our alpha users , who are storing and sharing millions of files , have given us tremendous feedback … .
We believe that Wuala is the right tool for millions of people to securely manage and share their files online . ”
Wuala offers it all , from storage to social networking !

Do n’t miss it .
If you ’re watching the Olympics , TiVo it or look for a repeat . ]
To the problem of an overstretched , over - toured military , there is but one answer in Washington .
Both presidential candidates ( along with just about every other politician in our nation ’s capital ) are on record wanting to significantly expand the Army and the Marines .
In his remarkable new book , The Limits of Power , The End of American Exceptionalism , Andrew Bacevich suggests a solution to the American military crisis that might seem obvious enough , if only both parties were n’t so blinded by the idea of our “ global reach , ” by a belief , however wrapped in euphemisms , in our imperial role on this planet , and by the imperial Pentagon and presidency that go with it : reduce the mission .
It ’s a particularly timely observation to which Bacevich returns in part two of his TomDispatch series , adapted from his new book .
( Click here for part one . )
Unfortunately , the mission looks all - too - ready to expand , no matter who makes it to the White House in January .
Just last week , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , increasingly being mentioned in the media as a possible carry - over appointment for either candidate , endorsed a $ 20 billion down payment on our future role in Afghanistan  to be used to double the size of the Afghan army  and a restructuring of the U.S. and NATO commands in that country .
All of this is meant as preparation for a new president ’s agreement to consign yet more American troops to our war there .
This , in a phrase Bacevich has used in another context , is no less “ the path to perdition ” for the globe ’s former “ sole superpower ” than was the decision of a small country in the Caucasus to essentially launch a war , no matter the provocation , against its energy - superpower neighbor .
This way to the madhouse , ladies and gentlemen .
Consider , in this context , the immodest lessons our leaders have chosen to learn from the Bush era , and then , with Bacevich , what lessons we might actually learn if we seriously ( and far more modestly ) considered the real limits of American power .

Is Perpetual War Our Future ?
Learning the wrong lessons from the Bush era
by Andrew Bacevich
To appreciate the full extent of the military crisis into which the United States has been plunged requires understanding what the Iraq War and , to a lesser extent , the Afghan War have to teach .
These two conflicts , along with the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , will form the centerpiece of George W. Bush ’s legacy .
Their lessons ought to constitute the basis of a new , more realistic military policy .
In some respects , the effort to divine those lessons is well under way , spurred by critics of President Bush ’s policies on the left and the right as well as by reform - minded members of the officer corps .
Broadly speaking , this effort has thus far yielded three distinct conclusions .
Whether taken singly or together , they invert the post - Cold War military illusions that provided the foundation for the president ’s Global War on Terror .
In exchange for these received illusions , they propound new ones , which are equally misguided .
Thus far , that is , the lessons drawn from America ’s post - 9/11 military experience are the wrong ones .
According to the first lesson , the armed services  and above all the Army  need to recognize that the challenges posed by Iraq and Afghanistan define not only the military ’s present but also its future , the “ next war , ” as enthusiasts like to say .
Rooting out insurgents , nation - building , training and advising “ host nation ” forces , population security and control , winning hearts and minds  these promise to be ongoing priorities , preoccupying U.S. troops for decades to come , all across the Islamic world .
Rather than brief interventions ending in decisive victory , sustained presence will be the norm .
Large - scale conventional conflict like 1991 ’s Operation Desert Storm becomes the least likely contingency .
The future will be one of small wars , expected to be frequent , protracted , perhaps perpetual .
Although advanced technology will retain an important place in such conflicts , it will not be decisive .
Wherever possible , the warrior will rely on “ nonkinetic ” methods , functioning as diplomat , mediator , and relief worker .
No doubt American soldiers will engage in combat , but , drawing on the latest findings of social science , they will also demonstrate cultural sensitivity , not to speak of mastering local languages and customs .
As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it in October 2007 , “ Reviving public services , rebuilding infrastructure , and promoting good governance ” had now become soldiers ’ business .
“ All these so - called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking , planning , and strategy  where they must stay . ”
This prospect implies a rigorous integration of military action with political purpose .
Hard power and soft power will merge .
The soldier on the ground will serve as both cop and social worker .
This prospect also implies shedding the sort of utopian expectations that produced so much confident talk of “ transformation , ” “ shock - and - awe , ” and “ networkcentric warfare ”  all of which had tended to segregate war and politics into separate compartments .
Local conditions will dictate technique , dooming the Pentagon ’s effort to devise a single preconceived , technologically determined template applicable across the entire spectrum of conflict .
When it comes to low - intensity wars , the armed services will embrace a style owing less to the traditions of the Civil War , World War II , or even Gulf War I than to the nearly forgotten American experiences in the Philippines after 1898 and in Central America during the 1920s .
Instead of looking for inspiration at the campaigns of U. S. Grant , George Patton , or H. Norman Schwarzkopf , officers will study postwar British and French involvement in places like Palestine and Malaya , Indochina and Algeria .
In sum , an officer corps bloodied in Iraq and Afghanistan has seen the future and it points to many more Iraqs and Afghanistans .
Whereas the architects of full - spectrum dominance had expected the unprecedented lethality , range , accuracy , and responsiveness of high - tech striking power to perpetuate military dominion , the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan know better .
They remain committed to global dominance while believing that its pursuit will require not only advanced weaponry but also the ability to put boots on the ground and keep them there .
This , in turn , implies a plentiful supply of soldiers and loads of patience on the home front .
Were the Civilians of the Defense Department Responsible ?
Viewed from another perspective , however , the post - 9/11 wars teach an altogether different lesson .
According to this alternative view , echoing a similar complaint during the Vietnam era , the shortcomings of U.S. policy in Iraq and Afghanistan have little to do with the actual performance of American forces in the field and everything to do with the meddling of bumbling civilians back in Washington .
In its simplest form , fault lies not with the troops themselves , nor with their commanders , but with the likes of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , and Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith , who prevented the troops from doing their jobs .
The charges leveled by Maj. Gen. John Batiste , who served in Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon but subsequently retired in disgust and became one of the defense secretary ’s loudest military critics , are representative of this view .
“ Rumsfeld ’s dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of American servicemen and women , ” Batiste declared in September 2006 .
The former general held Rumsfeld personally “ responsible for America and her allies going to war with the wrong plan . ”
But that was just for starters .
Rumsfeld also “ violated fundamental principles of war , dismissed deliberate military planning , ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of Saddam Hussein , set the conditions for Abu Ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency , disbanded Iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most , [ and ] constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive de-Ba’athification policy . ”
Nor was the problem limited to Rumsfeld himself .
It included his chief lieutenants .
According to Batiste , Rumsfeld surrounded himself “ with like - minded and compliant subordinates who [ did ] not grasp the importance of the principles of war , the complexities of Iraq , or the human dimension of warfare . ”
The overall effect was tantamount to murder : Rumsfeld “ tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy . ”
Here lies the second preliminary lesson drawn from Iraq and Afghanistan , one that appeals to disgruntled military officers like Batiste , but also to Democrats eager to blame the Bush administration for any and all sins and to neoconservatives looking to absolve themselves of responsibility for botched wars that they had once cavalierly promoted .
The corrective to civilian arrogance and misjudgment is obvious :
It requires tilting the civil - military balance back in favor of the generals , untying the hands of senior commanders .
From this perspective , the most important lesson to take away from Iraq and Afghanistan is the imperative to empower military professionals .
The Petraeus moment of 2007 , when all of official Washington from President Bush to the lowest - ranking congressional staffer waited with bated breath for Gen.
David Petraeus to formulate basic policy for Iraq , offers a preview of how this lesson might play itself out .
Is a Draft the Answer ?
There is also a third perspective , which blames the failures of Iraq and Afghanistan on a problematic relationship between soldiers and society .
According to this view , the all - volunteer force itself is the problem .
As the military historian Adrian Lewis observed , “ The most significant transformation in the American conduct of war since World War II and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological , but cultural , social , and political  the removal of the American people from the conduct of war . ”
Only after 9/11 , with the Bush administration waging war on multiple fronts , have the implications of this transformation become fully evident .
A reliance on volunteer - professionals places a de facto cap on the army ’s overall size .
The pool of willing recruits is necessarily limited .
Given a choice , most young Americans will opt for opportunities other than military service , with protracted war diminishing rather than enhancing any collective propensity to volunteer .
It is virtually inconceivable that any presidential call to the colors , however impassioned , any PR campaign , however cleverly designed , or any package of pay and bonuses , however generous , could reverse this disinclination .
Furthermore , to the extent that an army composed of regulars is no longer a people ’s army , the people have little say in its use .
In effect , the professional military has become an extension of the imperial presidency .
The troops fight when and where the commander in chief determines .
Finally , a reliance on professional soldiers eviscerates the concept of civic duty , relieving citizens at large of any obligation to contribute to the nation ’s defense .
Ending the draft during the waning days of the Vietnam War did nothing to heal the divisions created by that conflict ; instead , it ratified the separation of army from society .
Like mowing lawns and bussing tables , fighting and perhaps dying to sustain the American way of life became something that Americans pay others to do .
So the third lesson of the Iraq War focuses on the need to repair the relationship between army and society .
One way to do this is to junk the all - volunteer force altogether .
Rather than rely on professionals , perhaps it makes sense to revive the tradition of the citizen - soldier .
Proposals to restore this hallowed tradition invariably conjure up images of reinstituting some form of conscription .
In place of a system based on the principle of individual choice , those unhappy with the AVF advocate a system based on the principle of state compulsion .
The advantages offered by such a system are hardly trivial .
To the extent that Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed the operational , political , and moral problems produced by relying on a small professional force , a draft seems to offer one obvious way to alleviate those problems .
For those who worry that the existing army is overextended , conscription provides a mechanism for expansion .
Triple the size of the army  in essence restoring the structure that existed during much of the Cold War  and the personnel shortages that constrain the prosecution of ground campaigns will disappear .
Sustaining the military commitment to Iraq for 10 or 20 years , or even a century as Sen .
John McCain and many neoconservatives are willing to contemplate , then becomes a viable proposition .
War planners will no longer find themselves obliged to give short shrift to Contingency A ( Afghanistan ) in order to support Contingency B ( Iraq ) .
The concept of “ surge ” will take on a whole new meaning with the Pentagon able to dispatch not a measly 30,000 reinforcements to Iraq or another few thousand to Afghanistan , but 100,000 or more additional troops wherever they might be needed .
Was the problem with Operation Iraqi Freedom too few “ boots on the ground ” for occupation and reconstruction ?
Reconstitute the draft , and that problem goes away .
Creating a mass army might even permit the United States to resuscitate the Weinberger - Powell Doctrine with its emphasis on “ overwhelming force . ”
For those distressed by the absence of a politically meaningful antiwar movement despite the Iraq War ’s manifest unpopularity , the appeal of conscription differs somewhat .
Some political activists look to an Iraq - era draft to do what the Vietnam - era draft did : animate large - scale protest , alter the political dynamic , and eventually shut down any conflict that lacks widespread popular support .
The prospect of involuntary service will pry the kids out of the shopping malls and send them into the streets .
It will prod the parents of draft - eligible offspring to see politics as something other than a mechanism for doling out entitlements .
As a consequence , members of Congress keen to retain their seats will define their wartime responsibilities as something more than simply rubber - stamping spending bills proposed by the White House .
In this way , a draft could reinvigorate American democracy , restore the governmental system of checks and balances , and constrain the warmongers inhabiting the executive branch .
For those moved by moral considerations , a draft promises to ensure a more equitable distribution of sacrifice in war time .
No longer will rural Americans , people of color , recent immigrants , and members of the working class fill the ranks of the armed forces in disproportionate numbers .
With conscription , the children of the political elite and of the well - to - do will once again bear their fair share of the load .
Those reaping the benefits of the American way of life will contribute to its defense , helping to garrison the more distant precincts of empire .
Perhaps even the editorial staffs of the Weekly Standard , National Review , and the New Republic might have the opportunity to serve , a salutary prospect given the propensity of those magazines to argue on behalf of military intervention .
Reconfigure the armed services to fight “ small wars ” ; empower the generals ; reconnect soldiering to citizenship  on the surface each of these has a certain appeal .
But upon closer examination , each also has large defects .
They are the wrong lessons to take from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Drawing the Right Lessons From the Bush Era
If gearing up to fight “ small wars , ” deferring to the brass , and scrapping the all - volunteer force are the wrong lessons to be drawn from our recent military experience , then what are the right ones ?
The events of the recent past offer several lessons that illuminate these questions .
The first concerns the nature of war .
Iraq and Afghanistan remind us that war is not subject to reinvention , whatever George W. Bush and Pentagon proponents of the so - called Revolution in Military Affairs may contend .
War ’s essential nature is fixed , permanent , intractable , and irrepressible .
War ’s constant companions are uncertainty and risk .
“ War is the realm of chance , ” wrote the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz nearly two centuries ago .
“ No other human activity gives it greater scope : no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder ”  a judgment that the invention of the computer , the Internet , and precision - guided munitions has done nothing to overturn .
So the first lesson to be taken away from the Bush administration ’s two military adventures is simply this :
War remains today what it has always been  elusive , untamed , costly , difficult to control , fraught with surprise , and sure to give rise to unexpected consequences .
Only the truly demented will imagine otherwise .
The second lesson of Iraq and Afghanistan derives from the first .
As has been the case throughout history , the utility of armed force remains finite .
Even in the information age , to the extent that force “ works , ” it does so with respect to a limited range of contingencies .
Although die - hard supporters of the Global War on Terror will insist otherwise , events in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated definitively that further reliance on coercive methods will not enable the United States to achieve its objectives .
Whether the actual aim is to democratize the Islamic world or subdue it , the military “ option ” is not the answer .
The Bush Doctrine itself provides the basis for a third lesson .
For centuries , the Western moral tradition has categorically rejected the concept of preventive war .
The events of 9/11 convinced some that this tradition no longer applied : old constraints had to give way .
Yet our actual experience with preventive war suggests that , even setting moral considerations aside , to launch a war today to eliminate a danger that might pose a threat at some future date is just plain stupid .
It does n’t work .
History has repeatedly demonstrated the irrationality of preventive war .
If the world needed a further demonstration , President Bush provided it .
Iraq shows us why the Bush Doctrine was a bad idea in the first place and why its abrogation has become essential .
For principled guidance in determining when the use of force is appropriate , the country should conform to the Just War tradition  not only because that tradition is consistent with our professed moral values , but also because its provisions provide an eminently useful guide for sound statecraft .
Finally , there is a fourth lesson , relating to the formulation of strategy .
The results of U.S. policy in Iraq and Afghanistan suggest that in the upper echelons of the government and among the senior ranks of the officer corps , this has become a lost art .
Since the end of the Cold War , the tendency among civilians  with President Bush a prime example  has been to confuse strategy with ideology .
The president ’s freedom agenda , which supposedly provided a blueprint for how to prosecute the Global War on Terror , expressed grandiose aspirations without a serious effort to assess the means required to achieve them .
Meanwhile , ever since the Vietnam War ended , the tendency among military officers has been to confuse strategy with operations .
Here we come face - to - face with the essential dilemma with which the United States has unsuccessfully wrestled since the Soviets deprived us of a stabilizing adversary .
The political elite that ought to bear the chief responsibility for crafting grand strategy instead nurses fantasies of either achieving permanent global hegemony or remaking the world in America ’s image .
Meanwhile , the military elite that could puncture those fantasies and help restore a modicum of realism to U.S. policy fixates on campaigns and battles , with generalship largely a business of organizing and coordinating matériel .
The four lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan boil down to this : Events have exposed as illusory American pretensions to having mastered war .
Even today , war is hardly more subject to human control than the tides or the weather .
Simply trying harder  investing ever larger sums in even more advanced technology , devising novel techniques , or even improving the quality of American generalship  will not enable the United States to evade that reality .
As measured by results achieved , the performance of the military since the end of the Cold War and especially since 9/11 has been unimpressive .
This indifferent record of success leads some observers to argue that we need a bigger army or a different army .
But the problem lies less with the army that we have  a very fine one , which every citizen should wish to preserve  than with the requirements that we have imposed on our soldiers .
Rather than expanding or reconfiguring that army , we need to treat it with the respect that it deserves .
That means protecting it from further abuse of the sort that it has endured since 2001 .
America does n’t need a bigger army .
It needs a smaller  that is , more modest  foreign policy , one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities .
Modesty implies giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the Cold War and then 9/11 gave rise .
It also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions .
When it comes to supporting the troops , here lies the essence of a citizen ’s obligation .

While Nintendo is out showing off the likes of Wii Sports : Resort and Wii Music , Capcom has decided to take on the task of satisfying fans of more traditional games .
The latest issue of Famitsu has revealed that the Wii will be seeing a port of the Xbox 360 hit Dead Rising .
The game , which was originally released back in 2006 , will be neither a spin - off nor a sequel .
Instead it will be a direct port of the 360 version , with what looks to be added motion controls .
This is somewhat of an unexpected move , but given success of Resident Evil 4 : Wii Edition , Capcom 's logic seems obvious .
Let 's hope that the transition from the 360 to the Wii is a smooth one .
The Swine Before Perl
In November 2001 I gave an invited talk at the inaugural Lightweight Languages conference that has since become somewhat notorious ( in netspace , it is said to be kickassing genial ) .
DrDobb's Journal was kind enough to record the conference and professionally edit the tracks .
They unfortunately misplaced the audio track , and said they were unable to locate the backups .
In cyberspace , however , nothing is ever lost ; as Linux Torvalds said , “ Real Men do n't make backups .
They upload it via ftp and let the world mirror it . ”
So , here are the slides ( PPT , PDF ) , and here is the audio .
Many thanks to Leo Comerford and Edi Weitz for their help and persistence .
There is also an expository paper that elaborates on the example developed in this talk .
Finally , if you enjoy this kind of material , you may be interested in my free textbook on programming languages .
N.B. : The copyright of the audio track is presumably owned by Dr. Dobb's , and they have n't given me permission to mirror it here .
Contacting their editors has , however , yielded no response , and I expect they would rather it be available somewhere than nowhere at all .
Their original page , which includes a rather dramatic photograph , ostensibly has a link to the audio track , but the link does n't work .
I will never cease to be amazed at how fast things change and how quickly people forget .
Today ’s example is a Slashdot posting with the title , “ Why Buy a PC Preloaded with Linux ? ”
Specifically , the dotter — slasher really does n’t give the right tone — wants to know “ ‘ Why should I buy a PC preloaded with Linux ? ’
They are more expensive , and it ’s not hard just to reformat the PC with Linux .
I hate paying the Microsoft Tax as much as anybody else , but if paying that ‘ tax ’ allows companies to reduce my price by bundling with my PC products that I will never use , why would n’t I just buy a Windows - loaded PC and reformat ? ”
Oh dear .
Let ’s start at the top .
Sometimes Linux computers are more expensive than their otherwise identical brothers with XP .
But , they ’re not always more expensive .
This kind of statement of ‘ fact ’ in a question always makes my FUD detector start to beep .
For example , the Dell Ubuntu Linux laptop I lust for the most is the Dell 1420N .
Right now , May 27th 2008 , the basic , no - frills model goes for $ 599 .
The same model with XP … oh !
Wait !
You wo n’t be able to get it , or any other computer , with XP after the next few weeks .
In fact , since the Dell 1420 currently comes with Vista Home Premium , you may not have the option of getting it with XP at all .
You see Dell will only let you downgrade from Vista Business or Vista Ultimate to XP Pro .
The cheaper XP Home ?
It really is well on its way to becoming history .
Even , if you ordered a Dell 1420 with Windows as fast as you can , the 1420 with the closest stats to the Ubuntu - powered 1420N — 1GB of RAM ; 14.1 inch display with 1280 ×800 resolution ; Intel Pentium Dual Core 1.73GHz T2370 CPU ; and 120 GB hard - drive — will cost you , drum roll please , $ 649 .
Advantage : Linux .
So , first things first , Linux PCs may not be more expensive than Windows PCs .
Let ’s stomp this Microsoft - sponsored urban legend into the mud right now .
Got it ?
Good .
Next , “ It ’s not hard just to reformat the PC with Linux . ”
Yes and no .
I can install Linux on any PC even if I ’m half - asleep .
Many power - users can do the same .
But , can most people install Linux on a PC ?
No , no they can’t .
That was the whole reason why getting Dell and other vendors like , to pre-install Linux was a big deal .
People , who could never install Linux by themselves , no matter how easy you made it , could finally get to use Linux .
This is n’t just Linux though .
How many people can actually install Vista ?
I mean , I work with operating systems for a living and it took me — no lie — 16 - months and SP1 before I could get Vista working properly .
Note , I did n’t say well , I just said , ‘ properly . ’
Most people buy a computer with an operating system , and they ’re probably more likely to have it stolen they are to change the operating system .
In other words , if desktop Linux was to ever start moving it had to be pre-installed on the hardware .
OK , let ’s say you can do it yourself .
Should you ?
Well , if you already own a PC and want to upgrade it to Linux from Windows , of course , you should .
I ’ve updated over a hundred systems to one Linux or the other , and I was always able to get more work done more safely and for less money when I was done .
With a score of PCs in my office the savings on anti-virus software alone is n’t small .
But , for a new machine , if you buy a Windows PC , you ’re not only paying the Microsoft tax and helping the rich get richer ; you ’re telling the world that you prefer Windows .
No one does accurate counts on Linux desktops .
The closest we come to accurate desktop operating system surveys are probably those from IDC .
And what does IDC measure ?
It measures , not what people use , but what people buy , on their PCs .
That ’s why I can now predict that when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer start talking about Vista sales over this coming summer , he ’s going to say how they really started picking up starting in July .
He ’ll be able to do that because after June 30th , it will officially become much harder to buy a PC with XP .
Now , it appears most business buyers will actually be ‘ buying ’
Vista only to have their vendor switch them to XP Pro even before they leave the factory ( http://blogs.computerworld.com/vista_selling_well), but Ballmer will be able to spin those numbers into making it look like Vista suddenly got a sales kick in the pants .
So , if you buy Windows , you ’re not only putting money into Microsoft ’s hands , you ’re continuing the myth that Windows , especially Vista , sales are stronger than ever .
If you buy Linux , though , you ’re not only keeping money away from Microsoft , you ’re telling OEMs ( original equipment manufacturers ) , that you really do want Linux .
And , if enough people do that , the OEMs will support Linux on more of their systems , their vendors will make drivers for Linux components , and the entire Linux desktop world will be the stronger for it .

It ’s that simple .
Sen . Barack Obama , edging away from a long - held position , tacitly acknowledged the success of the Iraq troop - surge strategy during an appearance Tuesday before the country ’s largest organization of combat veterans .
“ Let ’s be clear , our troops have completed every mission they ’ve been given , ” Mr. Obama said at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Orlando , Fla. , where the likely Democratic presidential nominee courted military voters who are expected to play a pivotal role in several swing states .
“ They have created the space for political reconciliation . ”
It was the closest Mr. Obama - who has long opposed the surge - has come to agreeing with President Bush or likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain on the Iraq strategy .
But he stressed that he opposed the Iraq war in 2002 and still views the five - year - old mission as a waste of U.S. lives and money .
Mr. Bush said the goal of the surge , which beginning in early 2007 boosted the number of U.S. troops in Iraq from about 140,000 to more than 160,000 , was to quell rampant sectarian attacks and give the fledgling government in Baghdad “ breathing room ” to forge national reconciliation .

Mr. Obama of Illinois said the U.S. should turn its attention to winning the war in Afghanistan and hunting down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
He also stressed his support for more health and education benefits to veterans .
Appealing to military families is a key component to Mr. Obama ’s strategy to win states such as Virginia and North Carolina , which have not elected a Democrat for president in decades but which the campaign thinks it can pick off along with a few others in the solidly Republican South .
The challenge confronting Mr. Obama as he reaches out to military votes was apparent at the convention , where large crowds milled about outside the auditorium with no interest in hearing the speech .
“ Lies , lies , lies , ” Betty Morris , 71 , an auxiliary grand president from Charlotte , N.C. , shouted at Mr. Obama ’s visage on the jumbo screen as she walked out of the hall .
“ I do n’t want to watch that sorry rascal .
He wo n’t do nothing for the veterans . ”
Miss Morris , sporting American flag earrings and a top trimmed with red , white and blue , said the only Democrat for whom she ever voted was John F. Kennedy .
She called the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee , Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts - a decorated Vietnam veteran - a “ scumbag . ”
The crowd of about 3,000 people was dwarfed by the cavernous convention hall .
Rows of seats were empty because attendees left the convention early ahead of Tropical Storm Fay .
Mr. Obama said the reduced violence in Iraq was only partly because of the surge .
He said a cease - fire by Shi’ite militants and Sunni tribes turning against al Qaeda contributed to a dramatic drop in the number of attacks .
Whatever the cause , he said , the relative calm in Iraq bolstered his plan for a 16 - month pullout timetable .
“ It ’s time to press the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ The best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades , carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground . ”
Mr. McCain of Arizona , who early in the war championed a surge strategy , had criticized Mr. Obama for ignoring its success tamping down violence in Iraq .
The McCain campaign also criticized Mr. Obama for now embracing the surge .
A day earlier , Mr. McCain told the convention that Mr. Obama ’s recent vacillation on the surge reflected his “ ambition to be president [ but ] what ’s less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief . ”
Mr. Obama said his opponent was “ suggesting , as he has so many times , that I put personal ambition before my country . ”
He said Mr. McCain had stooped to an old - style campaign of personal attacks .
“ I will let no one question my love of this country .
I love America , so do you and so does John McCain , ” he said , prompting applause .
The McCain campaign said the candidate never questioned Mr. Obama ’s patriotism .
“ Barack Obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in Iraq is more important to him than victory in Iraq , ” McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
“ That ’s not a criticism of his patriotism .
That ’s a criticism of his judgment . ”
On the vice - presidential front , the Obama camp announced it will hold an event Saturday in Springfield , Ill. , at the old State Capitol where he announced his candidacy 18 months ago - a move that is ramping up speculation about it being used to announce his running mate .
Obama aides said the event “ will begin the roll - in ” to the Democratic National Convention , which starts Monday in Denver .
“ What better place to do this than the place where he launched his historic candidacy and campaign in February of ‘ 07 , ” Obama campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass said .
She would not confirm the report by the Chicago Sun -Times on Tuesday afternoon that the event would be to showcase his vice - presidential selection , but the timing indicates that the No. 2 pick would be in attendance .
Whoever accepts the No. 2 spot on the ticket will formally accept the nomination Aug. 27 at the convention .

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 07 - Regexes ( also called " rules " )
2015-02-25
grammar URL { token TOP { < schema > '://' [ < ip > | < hostname > ] [ ':' < port > ] ? '/' < path >?
} token byte { ( \d** 1..3 ) <?{ $ 0 < 256 }> } token ip { < byte > [ \. < byte > ] ** 3 } token schema { \w+ } token hostname { ( \w+ ) ( \. \w+ ) * } token port { \d+ } token path { <[ a ..z A..Z 0..9 \-_.!~*'( ) :@&=+$ ,/ ]>+ } } my $ match = URL.parse ( ' http://perl6.org/documentation/'); say $ match < hostname > ; # perl6.org
Regexes are one of the areas that has been improved and revamped most in Perl 6 .
We do n't call them regular expressions anymore because they are even less regular than they are in Perl 5 .
There are three large changes and enhancements to the regexes
Syntax clean up Many small changes make rules easier to write .
For example the dot .
matches any character now , the old semantics ( anything but newlines ) can be achieved with \ N .
Modifiers now go at the start of a regex , and non-capturing groups are [...] , which are a lot easier to read and write than Perl 5 ( ?:... ) .
Nested captures and match object
In Perl 5 , a regex like this ( a ( b ) ) ( c ) would put ab into $ 1 , b into $ 2 and c into $ 3 upon successful match .
This has changed .
Now $ 0 ( enumeration starts at zero ) contains ab , and $ 0 [ 0 ] or $ / [ 0 ] [ 0 ] contains b .
$ 1 holds c .
So each nesting level of parenthesis is reflected in a new nesting level in the result match object .
All the match variables are aliases into $ / , which is the so - called Match object , and it actually contains a full match tree .
Named regexes and grammars
You can declare regexes with names just like you can with subs and methods .
You can refer to these inside other rules with < name > .
And you can put multiple regexes into grammars , which are just like classes and support inheritance and composition
These changes make Perl 6 regexes and grammars much easier to write and maintain than Perl 5 regexes .
All of these changes go quite deep , and only the surface can be scratched here .
Letter characters ( ie underscore , digits and all Unicode letters ) match literally , and have a special meaning ( they are metasyntactic ) when escaped with a backslash .
For all other characters it 's the other way round - they are metasyntactic unless escaped .
literal metasyntactic a b 1 2 \a \b \ 1 \ 2 \* \ : \. \? * : . ?
Not all metasyntactic tokens have a meaning ( yet ) .
It is illegal to use those without a defined meaning .
There is another way to escape strings in regexes : with quotes .
m /'a literal text : $ #@ !!'/
The change in semantics of .
has already been mentioned , and also that [...] now construct non-capturing groups .
Character classes are <[... ]> , and negated char classes <-[... ]> . ^ and $ always match begin and end of the string respectively , to match begin and end of lines use ^^ and $ $ .
This means that the /s and /m modifiers are gone .
Modifiers are now given at the start of a regex , and are given in this notation :
if " abc " ~~ m:i/B/ { say " Matched a B. " ; }
... which happens to be the same as the colon pair notation that you can use for passing named arguments to routines .
Modifiers have a short and a long form .
The old /x modifier is now the default , i.e. white spaces are ignored .
short long meaning
------------------------------- :i :ignorecase ignore case ( formerly / i ) :m :ignoremark ignore marks ( accents , diaeresis etc. ) :g : global match as often as possible ( /g ) :s : sigspace Every white space in the regex matches ( optional ) white space : P5 : Perl5 Fall back to Perl 5 compatible regex syntax : 4 x :x ( 4 ) Match four times ( works for other numbers as well ) :3rd :nth ( 3 )
Third match : ov :overlap Like :g , but also consider overlapping matches :ex : exhaustive Match in all possible ways : ratchet Don't backtrack
The : sigspace needs a bit more explanation .
It replaces all whitespace in the pattern with < .ws > ( that is it calls the rule ws without keeping its result ) .
You can override that rule .
By default it matches one or more whitespaces if it 's enclosed in word characters , and zero or more otherwise .
( There are more new modifiers , but probably not as important as the listed ones ) .
The Match Object
Every match generates a so - called match object , which is stored in the special variable $ / .
It is a versatile thing .
In boolean context it returns Bool : : True if the match succeeded .
In string context it returns the matched string , when used as a list it contains the positional captures , and when used as a hash it contains the named captures .
The .from and .to methods contain the first and last string position of the match respectively .
if ' abcdefg ' ~~ m/(.(. ) ) ( e | bla ) $ < foo > = (. ) / { say $ / [ 0 ] [ 0 ] ; # d say $ / [ 0 ] ; # cd say $ / [ 1 ] ; # e say $ /< foo > # f }
$ 0 , $ 1 etc are just aliases for $ / [ 0 ] , $ / [ 1 ] etc. Likewise $ / < x > and $ /{'x'} are aliased to $ < x > .
Note that anything you access via $ /[...] and $ /{...} is a match object ( or a list of Match objects ) again .
This allows you to build real parse trees with rules .
Regexes can either be used with the old style m/.../ , or be declared like subs and methods .
regex a { ... } token b { ... } rule c { ... }
The difference is that token implies the : ratchet modifier ( which means no backtracking , like a ( ?> ... ) group around each part of the regex in perl 5 ) , and rule implies both : ratchet and : sigspace .
To call such a rule ( we 'll call them all rules , independently with which keyword they were declared ) you put the name in angle brackets : < a > .
This implicitly anchors the sub rule to its current position in the string , and stores the result in the match object in $ / < a > , ie it 's a named capture .
You can also call a rule without capturing its result by prefixing its name with a dot : <.a > .
If you want to refer to a rule outside of a Grammar , you need to call them with a routine sigil , like < &other > .
A grammar is a group of rules , just like a class ( see the SYNOPSIS for an example ) .
Grammars can inherit , override rules and so on .
grammar URL ::HTTP is URL { token schema { ' http ' } }
Perl 5 regexes are often rather unreadable , the grammars encourage you to split a large regex into more readable , short fragments .
Named captures make the rules more self - documenting , and many things are now much more consistent than they were before .
Finally grammars are so powerful that you can parse about every programming language with them , including Perl 6 itself .
That makes the Perl 6 grammar easier to maintain and to change than the Perl 5 one , which is written in C and not changeable at parse time .

An ancient waterway in the southern highlands of Mars breaks through the wall of a giant crater , flooding a huge lake with water and clay minerals .
The spread of deposits across the base of the 25 - mile - wide Jezero crater shows that extensive water must have persisted in the lakebed for thousands of years , suggesting the planet was once host to vast lakes and flowing rivers that could perhaps have supported life .
" The big surprise from these new results is how pervasive and long - lasting Mars ' water was , " said Scott Murchie at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland .
The image , published in Nature and Nature Geosciences , is among several taken recently by a camera on Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The maps will help Nasa officials decide on landing sites for future missions , including the Mars Science Laboratory , due to launch late next year .
" If life ever existed in this region , there 's a chance of its chemistry being preserved in the delta , " said Bethany Ehlmann at Brown Univeristy in Rhode Island .
The clay - like minerals preserve a record of between 4.6bn and 3.8bn years ago , the earliest years of the solar system , when the Earth and Mars sustained a cosmic bombardment by comets and asteroids .
" In a few locations a great deal of water must have flushed though the rocks and soil , " said John Mustard , a co-author at Brown University .
" We 're finding dozens of sites where future missions can land to understand if Mars was ever habitable and if so , to look for signs of past life . "
What the colours mean
Scientists say this proves water flowed freely on Mars between 4.6bn to 3 bn years ago .
The colours come from an instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite looking for water : the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars .
CRISM takes a picture of all kinds of light , from visible to infrared and ultraviolet .

The Ubiquity 0.1 Command Tutorial
The great power of Ubiquity — from a developer standpoint — is how easy it is to create commands .
With only a couple of lines of Javascript , Ubiquity enables even casual web developers to drastically enhance the features of the browser .
From an 8 - line command to insert a contact 's email address in any text field , to a 50 - line Twitter integration , this tutorial walks you through the process of being generative with Ubiquity .
WARNING : Ubiquity is still in flux .
This is a 0.1 release .
The API is likely to change drastically in later revisions .
While this means that what you write today might not work next week , it also means that by writing commands and giving us your feedback , you 'll be able to directly influence the direction that Ubiquity goes .
The rest of this page documents the command developer API as it currently stands in the latest released version of Ubiquity , 0.1.1 .
However , if you have the latest source checkout , then you 'll have a newer API with some additional features not in 0.1.1 .
You can read about the latest and greatest source - tip API on Ubiquity Source Tip Author Tutorial .
Real Time Development
Ubiquity does n't require you to restart Firefox as you develop .
That 's a barbaric act , and we want none of it .
Instead , Ubiquity reloads the commands every time it is summoned .
When you are using the built - in editor then you do n't even need to save !
To open the Ubiquity command editor , summon Ubiquity ( control / alt + space ) and use the " command - editor " command .
Throughout this tutorial , when we want you to run a command in Ubiquity , we 'll say Ubiq it .
For instance , to open the editor , just Ubiq " command -editor " .
In the following examples , just type in this editor .
Updates happen the next time you summon Ubiquity .
Hello World : The First Command
Just a Function : As Simple as it Gets
Let 's start with the standard programing trope : printing " Hello , World ! " .
In Ubiquity , commands are simply functions with various attributes tacked on .
We 'll start by manually making a function to define a command , but we 'll quickly move to using a more elegant method .
In the command editor type the following :
function cmd_hello_world ( ) { displayMessage ( " Hello , World ! " ) ; }
Now try Ubiq-ing " hello - world " .
You 'll see that " Hello , World ! " is immediately displayed on the screen .
If you are on Mac OSX with Growl installed the message will appear as a Growl notification .
If you are on Windows , then it will appear as a standard " toaster " notification in the bottom right - hand corner of the screen .
In Ubuntu 8.04 ( Hardy Heron ) this appears thus :
If you do n't have Growl installed on OSX , or are n't on a Windows XP / Vista or Ubuntu Hardy / Intrepid , then you wo n't get any sort of notification .
That 's something to be worked on in future released of Ubiquity .
There 's not much in this command , so let 's dive straight in .
Any function that starts with cmd_ automatically becomes a Ubiquity command .
It 's a little bit of namespace magic that makes development super - simple .
There are other prefixes that have other effects , like running code on page load ( pageLoad_ ) , and startup ( startup_ ) , but that 's for a different tutorial .
Back to the example .
The meat of the command is in the function displayMessage ( ) , which displays the message in whichever way the operating system can .

You may be wondering why there is a hyphen in the name , instead of a space .
That 's because the Ubiquity natural language parser is n't yet smart enough to handle commands that are multiple words and arguments that are multiple words .
It 's something we 'll be working on in the future .

Using CreateCommand
For commands that are more complicated than our simple " hello - world " command , you can use the helper function CmdUtils.
CreateCommand ( ) , which takes an options dictionary .
To redo the " hello - world " command using the convenience function , we 'd write :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " hello - world " , execute : function ( ) { displayMessage ( " Hello , World ! " ) ; } } )
This may not seem to be much of a win ( and it is n't for simple commands ) but as the commands become more complex , you 'll see that it helps a lot .
For one , you can name the command more freely with the method — unicode non-English characters are now fair game .
There are a number of other useful functions in the CmdUtils namespace .
We do n't yet have full documentation for these commands , but you 'll get a sense of the useful ones in this tutorial .
For more detailed information , take a look at the automatically generated documentation or cmdutils.js .
Adding a Preview
Let 's add a preview to our new command .
Previews give the user feedback about what a command does before it 's executed .
Previews are great for providing rich visual feedback like displaying a graphical representation of atmospheric conditions when using the weather command as shown above .
Previews have the full expressive power of HTML , including animations , so there 's a lot you can do with them .
One point of design : Preview code should never have side - effects .
That is , a preview should never ( without user interaction ) change the state of the system .
For the " hello - world " command , we do n't need anything fancy : just some help text that is more descriptive than the default " Executes the hello - world command . "
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " hello - world " , preview : " Displays a < i>salutary < / i > greeting to the planet . " , execute : function ( ) { displayMessage ( " Hello , World ! " ) ; } } )
Here the preview is an HTML - formatted string .
The preview can also be a function .
We 'll get to that in the next section .
Setting the Selection
I often forget what day it is .
That may be because I need to go outside more often , but , like any programmer , I generally solve my problem 's symptoms with technology rather then addressing the root cause .
My solution is to create a command that inserts the date at the location of the cursor .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " date " , execute : function ( ) { var date = new Date ( ) ; CmdUtils.setSelection ( date.toLocaleDateString ( ) ) ; } } )
The new function here is setSelection ( ) .
This inserts the passed - in text onto the page at the location of the cursor .
If the cursor is in an editable text or rich - text fields , the text gets dumped there .
If the cursor is n't in an editable area , setSelection ( ) will still be able to insert the date .
( Even when it is n't displayed , Firefox always keeps track of a cursor position .
To see it , type F7 . )
Try going to a page , selecting some non-mutable text , and using the command .
See , it works !
This is particularly useful for commands like " translate " , where you want to replace non-editable text with its translation .
The toLocaleDateString ( ) function is native to Javascript , so if you 're not familiar with it check out the documentation for the Javascript Date object .
A Better Preview
It 's time to add a better preview to the date command .
Let 's have the preview show the date , so that the user will know what to expect when they execute the command .
( As a side benefit the user does n't even need to execute the command to do a quick check of the day . )
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " date " , _date : function ( ) { var date = new Date ( ) ; return date.toLocaleDateString ( ) ; } , preview : function ( pblock ) { var msg = ' Inserts todays date : " < i> $ {date} </i > " ' ; pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate ( msg , {date : this ._date ( ) } ) ; } , execute : function ( ) { CmdUtils.setSelection ( this._date( ) ) ; } } )
We 've done two things here .
The first was to factor out the code for getting the date into the _date ( ) function .
This way we do n't break DRY by repeating code across the preview and execute functions .
Notice that to access the _date ( ) , we use the this keyword .
The second thing we 've done is to add a preview function .
The first argument is the DOM element that gets displayed as the preview for your command .
Modify pblock and you modify the preview .
In this case , we set the innerHTML of the preview block to be the message we want .
The other thing I 've done is to do some string formatting using the renderTemplate ( ) function .
This takes a template string and performs the appropriate substitution given the passed - in JSON object .
Templates can handle a wide range of functionality , as we are currently using TrimPath 's JavascriptTemplates .
You should read their site for more documentation .
Although JavascriptTemplates has some nice properties , we are contemplating moving to MJT sometime soon .
Previews display something meaningful to the user immediately .
If you have a preview that requires an AJAX request — say , to fetch some search results — that call might take a while to return .
In the meantime , your command should display a placeholder preview giving the user feedback .
preview : function ( pblock ) { pblock.innerHTML
= " This will show until the AJAX request returns " ; // AJAX request pblock.innerHTML = getFromServer ( ) ; } ,
In the future , we may work on streamlining this process .
Documentation and Metadata
Before you share your command with the world , you should consider adding some attributions to the code :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " date " , homepage : " http://azarask.in/ " , author : { name : " Aza Raskin " , email : " aza@mozilla.com "} , contributors : [ " Atul Varma " ] , license : " MPL " , /* THE REST OF THE CODE HERE */ } )
And you should definitely add some documentation :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " date " , homepage : " http://azarask.in/ " , author : { name : " Aza Raskin " , email : " aza@mozilla.com "} , contributors : [ " Atul Varma " ] , license : " MPL " , description : " Inserts today 's date . " , help : " If you 're in an editable text area , inserts today 's date , formatted for the current locale . " , /* THE REST OF THE CODE HERE */ } )
The .description and .help attributes are both automatically displayed alongside your command 's name on the command - list page .
( The user can get to this page at any time by issuing the " command - list " command . )
HTML tags can be used in both of these strings .
Description is a one - line summary of what the command does , while Help is a longer description that can include examples , caveats , and so on .
If your command is simple enough that all you have to say about it fits in one line , it 's OK to use a description alone and leave out the help .
Sharing it with the World
Now that we 've got our awesome new " date " command , let 's share it with the world .
All you have to do is put it the javascript file on the web somewhere , and make an html page linking to it with " link rel " .
< link rel= " commands " href = " http://path-to-js " name = " Title Goes Here " />
Note : your webserver must serve .js files as ' application/x-javascript ' .
The mime - type ' text / javascript ' is silently ignored .
Anyone with Ubiquity who visits will get a message offering them the choice of subscribing to your command .
If the user chooses to subscribe to a command from an untrusted source , they will get a security warning message before they can install the command .
( And in Ubiquity 0.1 , ALL sources are considered untrusted , so do n't take it personally ! )
Because Ubiquity commands can execute arbitrary javascript with chrome privileges , subscribing to a command from a website means allowing that site full access to do whatever it wants to your browser .
We want to make sure people understand the dangers before subscribing to commands , so we made the warning page pretty scary .
In the future , we 're going to have something set up that we call a " trust network " .
When you try out a Ubiquity command from a website , and determine that the command is safe ( or unsafe ) , you 'll be able to leave an approval ( or a warning ) .
When your friends with Ubiquity installed visit the same site , they 'll see the approval or the warning that you left .
In this way , users will be able to rely on the judgement of other people they already know and trust in order to help them make decisions about whether a command is safe to install or not .
By the way , the reason we call it " subscribing " to a command , rather than " installing " a command , is that if the javascript file changes -- if the site owner adds new commands , removes old commands , or updates existing commands -- all users subscribed to that URL will automatically get the updates .
This will be very convenient for both users and developers , but it will also introduce another type of security risk : just because you decided a command was safe at one point in time does n't mean that the command will always remain safe .
For this reason , we 'll need to make sure that the trust network keeps track of when commands have been modified , and notifies users of changes that may make a command unsafe .
Map Me! Location , Snapshots , and Inserting HTML
The " map " command that comes with Ubiquity is fairly powerful .
It 's also fairly complicated — well , comparatively .
It 's still only a couple hundred lines of code .
The command , though , can get even more useful .
Imagine being able to select some houses on Craigslist , or a list of restaurant names , and Ubiq " map these " to get just the map you want .
The concept of " these " puts the power of mashups into the users hands .
But I digress .
Let 's make a simple command that inserts a map of your current location .
In this command , we use the Google static map API and the Ubiquity function CmdUtils.getGeoLocation ( ) to insert a map of your current location .
Ubiquity currently uses the MaxMind API for trying to guess your location from your IP .
That will probably change in the future .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " map-me " , _getMapUrl : function ( ) { var loc = CmdUtils.getGeoLocation ( ) ; var mapUrl = " http://maps.google.com/staticmap? " ; var params = { center : loc.lat + " , " + loc.long , size : " 500x400 " , zoom : 14 , key : " ABQIAAAAGZ11mh1LzgQ8-8LRW3wEShQeSuJunOpTb3RsLsk00-MAdzxmXhQoiCd940lo0KlfQM5PeNYEPLW-3w " } ; return mapUrl + jQuery.param ( params ) ; } , preview : function ( pblock ) { var msg =
" Inserts a map of your current location : < br / > " ; msg += " < img src= ' %s '/>" .replace ( /%s/ , this._getMapUrl( ) ) ; pblock.innerHTML
= msg ; } , execute : function ( ) { CmdUtils.getImageSnapshot ( this._getMapUrl( ) , function ( imgData ) { CmdUtils.setSelection ( " < img src= ' " + imgData + " '/> " ) ; } ) } } )
There are three new things here : CmdUtils.setSelection to set HTML ( yep , it can do that ) ; the use of CmdUtils.getGeoLocation ( ) ; and using CmdUtils.getImageSnapshot ( ) to capture the bits for the image .
I find getting the location — as imprecise as IP - based location can be —useful for doing sensible defaults for location - based commands , like Yelp. CmdUtils.getGeoLocation ( ) returns an object which has the following properties : city , state , country , lat , and long .
Why do we need to use CmdUtils.getImageSnapshot ( ) ?
Because the Google Maps API requires a key that is tied to a particular URL .
If we naively inject the image tag into a random web page , the image wo n't load because the key does n't match that random web page 's URL .
Thus , we use the snapshotImage ( ) function to convert the image into a data url .
There 's also a CmdUtils.getWindowSnapshot ( ) function , which allows you to get the image data for any tab / window .
The function takes a window as the first paramater , and a callback for the second .
Commands with Arguments
Echo
We 'll be working towards making some fun and useful commands — commands that let you control the seething tendrils of the internet with your little pinky .
But , let 's start by making a simple command to echo back whatever you type .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " echo " , takes : { " your shout " : noun_arb_text} , preview : function ( pblock , the Shout ) { pblock.innerHTML
= " Will echo : " + the Shout.text ; } , execute : function ( the Shout ) { var msg = the Shout. text + " ... " + the Shout.text + " ...... " ; displayMessage ( msg ) ; } } )
This says that the command " echo " takes one argument which is arbitrary text .
Whatever text the user enters will get wrapped in an input object and passed into both the preview and execute function .
Ubiquity takes care of parsing the user 's input , so you do n't need to worry about handling prounoun substitution or any of the other natural - language - like features of the Ubiquity parser .
Try selecting some text on a page , and Ubiq " echo this " .
Ubiquity should now echo the selected text .
The Input Object
The input object that your execute and preview functions receive has the following attributes :
inputObject.text // a string of the input in plain text , without formatting inputObject.html // a string of the input in formatted html , including tags inputObject.data // for non-text input types , an arbitrary data object inputObject .
summary // for very long inputs , an abbreviated display string
Our example command only cares about the . text attribute of the input , because it simply wants plain text .
Often , when the user invokes your command by typing a few short words into the input box , . text , .html , and . summary will all have exactly the same value , and .data will be null .
Many , if not most , commands that you write will only care about the text value .
Nevertheless , the other versions of the input data are provided to you in case they differ from . text and in case your command has a use for them .
Introduction to Noun Types
Notice that we specified the type of argument to expect by passing in an object — in this case , the predefined noun_arb_text object , which accepts any arbitrary text as a valid argument .
If we had wanted to restrict the inputs that our command could take , we could have used a more specific noun - type object to restrict the scope of the argument : for instance , noun_type_date to accept only dates ( like the " check - calendar " command ) or noun_type_language to accept only names of languages ( like the optional modifiers for the " translate " command ) .
The benefit of specifying a more restrictive noun - type is that it helps the Ubiquity parser generate better suggestions and auto - completions based on user - input .
For instance , if the user has a date selected , commands that operate specifically on dates are more likely to be apropos than commands that take arbitrary text , so Ubiquity can suggest the date - specific commands first .
There are many types of nouns that a command could conceivably take : people , dates , places , tabs , etc .
Many of these noun - types are n't implemented yet , and most of the them currently have a lack - luster implementation .
This is one of the areas where Ubiquity could use the greatest help .
Noun - types enable creating compelling user experiences , with minimal amounts of code .
It also allows for code - reuse across numerous commands .
Once you are familiar with writing commands , you should check out the nountypes.js , which has the implementation for most of the noun - types .
You can see what noun types are already available for your commands to use , what still needs to be written , and where the existing implementations could use improvement — and then come get involved to help us improve them .
For Those Who Like Regular Expressions ...
If you 're a fan of regular expressions , as of Ubiquity 0.1.7 you can just put a regular expression in place of a noun type object , and Ubiquity will take care of the rest .
Make sure you specify the regular expression as either a regular expression literal or a RegExp object .
For example :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ({ name : " digits " , takes : { " some digits " : /[ 0 - 9 ] +/} , execute : function ( digits ) { displayMessage ( " You entered " + digits. text ) ; } } ) ;
Insert Email : Commands with Specific Argument Types
Let 's take a look at one of the special noun- types : noun_type_contact .
This lets Ubiquity know to expect a person ( either by name or email address ) .
By using the noun - type , Ubiquity will also autocomplete to known people while the user is entering the command .
This is what the built - in Ubiquity command " email " uses .
At the moment , Ubiquity figures out what people you know through reading your Gmail contacts .
In this prototyped version , you 'll need to use Gmail and be logged in for for Ubiquity to know who you know .
Eventually , we 'd like to be able to interface with all major web - mail sites , as well as desktop software like Thunderbird .
Enough rambling .
It 's time for a command .
I constantly find that I need to fetch someone 's email address to paste into a text field because I do n't know it off - hand .
This command solves that by letting you insert someone 's email address using autocomplete .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " insert- email " , takes : { " person " : noun_type_contact} , preview : " Inserts someone 's email address by name . " , execute : function ( email ) { CmdUtils.setSelection ( email.text ) ; } } )
This one command sums up what I love about Ubiquity .
In 8 lines of code , I can fundamentally enhance the browser 's functionality .
Doing the same thing using a normal Firefox extension methodology takes pages and pages of code — and the interface would take more thought still .
Doing the same thing using a bookmarklet would require a server - side component ( to get around cross - site Ajax request ban ) as well as forcing the user to give up their email password .
Ubiquity increases the surface area of innovation for the browser many - fold , by making anyone who can write simple Javascript into an agent for bettering the browser and the open Web .
TinyURL : Network Calls and jQuery
Often while writing emails , I 'll discover that I 've pasted in a URL long enough to be used for unfortunate analogies .
I 'd like to be able to quickly turn that into a TinyURL — but the process of making a TinyURL involves lots of fiddly steps .
Ubiquity to the rescue .
Because we include jQuery with Ubiquity , it is simple to perform Ajax calls as well as parse returning data .
TinyUrl.com provides an easy to use RESTful API where you pass a URL and it returns its shortened form .
We use that API in this command .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " tinyurl " , takes : { " url to shorten " : noun_arb_text} , preview : " Replaces the selected URL with a TinyUrl. " , execute : function ( urlToShorten ) { var baseUrl = " http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php " ; var params = {url : urlToShorten.text} ; jQuery.get ( baseUrl , params , function ( tiny Url ) { CmdUtils.setSelection ( tinyUrl ) ; } ) } } )
Although I used the noun_arb_text command noun- type , I should have used the noun_type_url — if such a thing existed .
It does n't yet .
j Query is a powerful tool .
With it , you can fairly effortlessly cherry - pick the data you need from RSS feeds , XML , and all sorts of other data formats .
It also makes doing in - preview animations a breeze .
Color : Creating Bounded Noun Types
Suppose you 're writing a set of commands for artists and web designers , and you know that several of the commands will operate on colors .
You 'd like to be able to specify that certain commands expect names of colors as arguments .
Since there are a finite number of named colors , you can define a custom noun type for them based on a list of strings , like so :
noun_type_color = new CmdUtils.NounType( " Color " , [ " red " , " orange " , " yellow " , " green " , " blue " , " violet " , " black " , " white " , " grey " , " brown " , " beige " , " magenta " , " cerulean " , " puce " ] // etc ... ) ;
Note that we gave the new object a name starting with " noun_ " .
The Ubiquity command loader automatically detects objects starting with " noun_ " as custom noun - types , in the same way as it auto - detects functions starting with " cmd_ " as custom commands .
Once you 've defined a custom noun - type , you can use it in as many commands as you like , thus :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " get - color - code " , takes : { " color " : noun_type_color} , preview : " Inserts the HTML hex - code for the given color . " , // etc ...
One benefit of creating the custom color noun - type is that if the user has entered " get - color bl " , for instance , Ubiquity will be able to suggest " black " and " blue " as the two valid completions based on the input .
Of course , not every type of noun you'd be interested in can be represented as a finite list .
If you want to be able to accept or reject input based on some algorithmic test , you can do so by creating your own noun - type implementation instead of instantiating CmdUtils .
NounType .
There is an example of this in the section on the tab commands , below .
Replace : Commands With Multiple Arguments
Commands , like the translate command , can take multiple ( and possibly optional ) arguments .
Ubiquity takes care of the parsing — you do n't have to worry about what order the user types them in , you 'll just get passed a dictionary with the appropriate entries .
To illustrate that , let 's make a simple regular - expression - based " replace " command .
It will take three arguments : the thing to replace , the replacement , and the scope - text to do the replacing in .
Here 's the command :
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " replace " , takes : { " what " : noun_arb_text} , modifiers : { " with " : noun_arb_text , " in " : noun_arb_text} , preview : function ( pblock , what , mods ) { // args contains . with and .in , both of which are input objects .
var msg = ' Replaces " $ {whatText} " with $ {withText} in $ {inText} . ' ; var subs = {whatText : what .
text , withText : mods [ " with " ]. text , inText : mods [ " in " ] . text} ; pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate ( msg , subs ) ; } , execute : function ( what , mods ) { //
If the scope text is n't specified , use the current selection .
var text = mods [ " in " ]. text || CmdUtils.getSelection ( ) ; var newText = text .
replace ( what .
text , mods [ " with " ] . text , " i " ) ; CmdUtils.setSelection ( newText ) ; } } ) ;
( In earlier prototypes , modifier arguments could only accept a single - word value , but this has now been fixed . )
The modifiers argument takes a dictionary , where the key is the name of the argument and the value is the noun - type of the argument .
In later releases we may include further options , like the ability to specify an argument as required / optional , etc .
The translate command is a good place to learn more about modifiers and the noun_type_language .
Twitter : Putting It All Together
We 've now covered everything we need to cover in order to write a command that allows us to Twitter from Ubiquity .
Many thanks to Blair McBride for writing this command .
This is a fully functioning command : the browser takes care of the odd edge cases , like not being logged in .
// max of 140 chars is recommended , but it really allows 160 const TWITTER_STATUS_MAXLEN = 160 ; CmdUtils.
CreateCommand ( { name : " twitter " , takes : {status : noun_arb_text} , homepage : " http://theunfocused.net/moz/ubiquity/verbs/ " , author : {name : " Blair McBride " , homepage : " http://theunfocused.net/ "} , license : " MPL " , preview : function ( previewBlock , statusText ) { var previewTemplate =
" Updates your Twitter status to : < br / > " + " < b>${status} </b>< br />< br /> " +
" Characters remaining : < b>$ {chars} </b> " ; var truncateTemplate = " < br /> The last < b >$ {truncate} < / b > " + " characters will be truncated ! " ; var previewData = { status : statusText.text , chars : TWITTER_STATUS_MAXLEN
- statusText.text.length } ; var previewHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate( previewTemplate , previewData ) ; if ( previewData.chars < 0 ) { var truncateData = { truncate : 0 - previewData.chars } ; previewHTML += CmdUtils.renderTemplate( truncateTemplate , truncateData ) ; } previewBlock.innerHTML
= previewHTML ; } , execute : function ( statusText ) { if( statusText.text.length < 1 ) { displayMessage ( " Twitter requires a status to be entered " ) ; return ; } var updateUrl = " https://twitter.com/statuses/update.json " ; var updateParams = { source : " ubiquity " , status : statusText.text } ; jQuery.ajax ( { type : " POST " , url : updateUrl , data : updateParams , dataType : " json " , error : function ( ) { displayMessage ( " Twitter error - status not updated " ) ; } , success : function ( ) { displayMessage ( " Twitter status updated " ) ; } } ) ; } } ) ;
Switching Tabs
The final command in this tutorial is for switching between tabs .
The end goal is this : type a few keys to that matches the title of an open tab ( in any window ) , hit return , and you 've switched to that tab .
We 'll write this command in two steps .
The first step is creating a tab noun - type .
The second step is using that noun - type to create the tab - switching command .
Switching : Writing your own Noun- Types
A noun - type needs to only have two things : A name and a suggest function .
Soon , we 'll probably move to having a convenience CmdUtils. CreateNounType( ) , which will simplify things even more .
The name is what shows up when the command prompts for input .
Suggest returns a list of input objects , each one containing the name of a matching tab .
We 're using FUEL to interact with the browser , which is where the " Application " variable comes from .
var noun_type_tab = { _name : " tab name " , // Returns all tabs from all windows .
getTabs : function ( ) { var tabs = {} ; for ( var j=0 ; j < Application.windows.length ; j++ ) { var window = Application.windows[j ] ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < window.tabs.length ; i++) { var tab = window.tabs[ i ] ; tabs[tab.document.title ] = tab ; } } return tabs ; } , suggest : function ( text , html ) { var suggestions = [ ] ; var tabs = noun_type_tab.getTabs ( ) ; //TODO : implement a better match algorithm for ( var tabName in tabs ) { if ( tabName.match ( text , " i " ) ) suggestions .
push ( CmdUtils.makeSugg(tabName ) ) ; } //
Return a list of input objects , limited to at most five : return suggestions .
splice ( 0 , 5 ) ; } }
The suggest method of a noun type always gets passed both text and html .
If the input is coming from a part of a web page that the user has selected , these values can be different : they are both strings , but the html value contains markup tags while the text value does not .
The Tab noun type only cares about the plain text of the tab name , so we ignore the value of html .
We use the convenience function CmdUtils.makeSugg ( ) to generate an input object of the type that the Ubiquity parser expects .
The full signature of this function is
CmdUtils.makeSugg ( text , html , data ) ;
but html and data are optional and need be provided only if they differ from text .
If the text or html input is very long , makeSugg ( ) generates a summary for us , and puts it in the .summary attribute of the input object .
We could have accomplished mostly the same thing without calling makeSugg ( ) by returning a list of anonymous objects like these :
{ text : tabName , html : tabName , data : null , summary : tabName } ;
The input objects that our . suggest ( ) method generates are the same objects that will eventually get passed in to the execute ( ) and preview ( ) methods of any commands that use this noun type .
Switching Tabs : The Command
Now that we are armed with the tab noun - type , it is easy to make the tab - switching command .
Again , we use FUEL to focus the selected tab .
CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " tab " , takes : { " tab name " : noun_type_tab} , execute : function ( directObj ) { var tabName = directObj.text ; var tabs = noun_type_tab.getTabs ( ) ; tabs[ tabName]._window.focus ( ) ; tabs[ tabName ].focus ( ) ; } , preview : function ( pblock , directObj ) { var tabName = directObj.text ; if ( tabName.length > 1 ) { var msg = " Changes to < b style= \ " color : yellow\ " >%s</b> tab. " ; pblock.innerHTML
= msg.replace(/%s/ , tabName ) ; } else pblock.innerHTML
= " Switch to a tab by name . " ; } } )
Development Hints
You now know all you need to know to get started developing useful Ubiquity commands of your own .
Here are some miscellaneous tips that did n't fit elsewhere on this page , that may make development easier for you .
The Source Code of Built - In Commands
Looking at the source code of built - in commands and built - in noun types can be a very useful aid to development .
If you have the source checkout of Ubiquity ( see the development tutorial to find out how to get this ) , the source code can be found in the files and directories :
ubiquity / standard - feeds / ubiquity / builtin- feeds/en/builtincmds.js ubiquity/feed-parts/header/en/nountypes.js
If you do n't have a checkout of the source code , you can view the latest version on the web here :
Interacting with Other Extensions
There is n't much to say here besides that it 's easy .
For example , here 's a command ( thanks to Abimanyu Raja for writing this code ) that finds the lyrics for a song .
You can simply Ubiq something like " get- lyrics wild international " but the command will also interface with the FoxyTunes extension ( if it is installed ) and add the currently playing song to the suggestion list .
Interfacing with other extensions , too , is easy because you can view the source code for every Firefox extension .
var noun_type_song = { _name : " song name " , suggest : function ( text , html ) { var suggestions = [ CmdUtils.makeSugg( text ) ] ; if ( window.foxytunesGetCurrentTrackTitle ) { suggestions.push ( CmdUtils.makeSugg(window.foxytunesGetCurrentTrackTitle( ) ) ) ; } return suggestions ; } } CmdUtils.
CreateCommand ( { name : " get - lyrics " , takes : {song : noun_type_song} , preview : function ( pblock , directObject ) { searchText = jQuery.trim( directObject.text ) ; if( searchText.length < 1 ) { pblock.innerHTML
= " Searches for lyrics of the song " ; return ; } var previewTemplate =
" Searches for the lyrics of < b > $ {query} < /b > " ; var previewData = {query : searchText} ; pblock.innerHTML = CmdUtils.renderTemplate( previewTemplate , previewData ) ; } , execute : function ( directObject ) { var url = " http://www.google.com/search?q={QUERY} " var query = directObject.text + " lyrics " ; var urlString = url.replace ( " {QUERY} " , query ) ; Utils.openUrlInBrowser(urlString ) ; } } ) ;
Implementing Asynchronous Noun Suggestions
The noun types we 've seen so far in this tutorial have all worked synchronously , returning their suggestions right away .
However , Ubiquity also supports asynchronous noun suggestions .
These are useful for when a noun type needs to do some potentially time - consuming work before it can make suggestions — most commonly when it needs to call an external service .
Implementing asynchronous suggestions is simple .
Whenever the Ubiquity parser calls a noun type 's suggest function , it includes a callback function that may be used to send suggestions back to the parser as they become available .
In the most typical case , the noun type 's suggest function makes an AJAX request , invoking the parser 's callback function from within the callback function for the AJAX request .
Here 's a simple example : a noun type that suggests Freebase topics based on the text the user has typed or selected , and a barebones freebase - lookup command that uses the noun type .
var noun_type_freebase_topic = { _name : " Freebase topic " , suggest : function suggest ( text , html , callback ) { jQuery.ajax ( { url : " http://www.freebase.com/api/service/search " , dataType : " json " , data : { prefix : text , limit : 5 } , success : function suggestTopics ( response ) { var i , results , result ; results = response .
result ; for ( i = 0 ; i < results .
length ; i++ ) { result = results [ i ] ; callback ( CmdUtils.makeSugg ( result.name , result.name , result ) ) ; } } } ) ; return [ ] ; } } CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " freebase - lookup " , takes : { topic : noun_type_freebase_topic } , preview : function preview ( container , topic ) { var text = topic.
text || " any topic " ; container.innerHTML
= " Go to the Freebase topic page for " + text + " . " ; } , execute : function goToFreebase ( topic ) { if ( topic ) { Utils.openUrlInBrowser ( " http://www.freebase.com/view " + topic.data.id ) ; } } } ) ;
A few notes :
The parser 's callback function expects only one suggestion ( not an array of suggestions ) , so it must be called one time for each suggestion , even if the noun type has multiple suggestions available at the same time ( as in the Freebase example above ) .
This is a bit different from the synchronous case , in which the suggest function is expected to return an array .
function is expected to return an array .
A noun type 's suggest function typically returns an empty array when it intends to make asynchronous suggestions , but it can return one or more suggestions synchronously if it has them available .
function typically returns an empty array when it intends to make asynchronous suggestions , but it can return one or more suggestions synchronously if it has them available .
Because the work being done to generate asynchronous suggestions is generally somewhat expensive , and because a noun type 's suggest function may be called for every keystroke the user makes , you should probably consider implementing a delay before starting the work and / or caching the work at some level .
Ubiquity currently leaves this up to each noun type individually .

Ubiquity currently leaves this up to each noun type individually .
A much more robust implementation of Freebase - derived noun types can be found here .
Running on page load and startup
In order to run some code on page load , you simply have to prefix your function with pageLoad_ .
For example , if you want to say " Hi " every time a page is loaded , your code would look like this :
function pageLoad_hi( ) { displayMessage ( " hi " ) ; }
If you modify the function and want to see the changes , remember to first invoke Ubiquity .
Although your function like above , might not be a Ubiquity command , this is necessary to refresh the cached code .
Similarly , if you want to run some code everytime Firefox starts up , you just have to prefix the function with startup_ .
The awesome thing about these functions is the ability to develop whole Firefox extensions ( that require minimal UI ) as Ubiquity plugins in lesser lines of code .
You do n't need to worry about chrome .
manifest or install.rdf .
Another added benefit is that you never have to restart your Firefox during development unless of course , you are running code on Firefox startup .
Here 's the code for Keyscape which is a Ubiquity command that makes use of pageLoad and startup to recreate the functionality of the Search Keys extension by Jesse Ruderman .
In line with Ubiquity 's aim to let you do things quicker using your keyboard , this command lets you go to search results on Google by just pressing a number .
It 'll add hints to show the number of each link .
//A lot of this code is borrowed from the Search Keys extension // Many thanks to Jeese Ruderman function startup_keyscape ( ) { window.addEventListener(" keydown " , keyscape_down , true ) ; } function pageLoad_keyscape( doc ) { var uri = Utils.url(doc.documentURI ) ; // If we are on about : or chrome :// , just return if ( uri.scheme != " http " ) return ; // Check if the page we are on is google if ( keyscape_isGoogle ( uri ) ) { for ( var num=1 ; num < =10 ; num ++) { var link = j Query ( doc.body ) .find ( ' a.l ' ) [ num - 1 ] ; if ( link ) { var hint = doc.createElementNS ( " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " , " span " ) ; hint.style.color = " blue " ; hint.style.background = " white " ; hint.style .padding = " 1px 2px 1px 2 px " ; hint.style.marginLeft = " .5 em " ; hint.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(num == 10 ? 0 : num ) ) ; link.parentNode.insertBefore(hint , link.nextSibling ) ; } } } } function keyscape_isGoogle ( uri ) { return uri.host.indexOf ( " google " ) != - 1 && ( uri.path.substr ( 0,8 ) == " / search ? " || uri.path.substr( 0,8 ) == " / custom ? " ) ; } function keyscape_down ( event ) { var doc = Application.activeWindow.activeTab.document ; var uri = Utils.url(doc.documentURI ) ; if ( keyscape_isGoogle( uri ) ) { var key = parseInt ( event.keyCode || event.charCode ) ; var num ; if ( 48 <= key && key <= 57 ) // number keys num = key - 48 ; else if ( 96 <= key && key <= 105 ) //numeric keypad with numlock on num = key - 96 ; else return ; // Do n't do anything if we are in a textbox // or some other related elements var elt = window.document.commandDispatcher.focusedElement ; if ( elt ) { var ln = new String ( elt.localName).toLowerCase ( ) ; if ( ln == " input " || ln == " textarea " || ln == " select " || ln == " isindex " ) return ; } // Get the link url from the search results page var url_dest = j Query ( doc.body ) .find ( 'a.l ' ) .eq ( num - 1 ) .attr ( ' href ' ) ; if(event.altKey ) { // Open in new tab Application.activeWindow.open(Utils.url( url_dest ) ) ; }else { // Open in same tab doc.location .href = url_dest ; } } }
If Ubiquity does indeed become ubiquitous , a lot of extensions can be re-written as Ubiquity commands .
This is much nicer for the end - user , as well , because the Ubiquity command installation process is a lot easier .
In the future , Ubiquity is also likely to have the ability to convert your Ubiquity commands into proper Firefox extensions .
Look here to check on the progress of this functionality .
Firebug
You should enable Chrome Errors and Warnings if you want the errors in your code to appear in the Firebug console .
Use CmdUtils.log ( ) rather than console.log ( )
Note : For now , you can only pass one argument to log ( )
Adding Commands Programmatically
Here is a snippet of code that shows how a developer can programmatically register a command included in a Firefox extension .
// Helper function used to determine the local directory where the // extension which contains the command is installed .
This is used // to create the URL of the js file which includes the implementation // of the list of commands you want to add .
function getExtensionDir ( ) { var extMgr = Components.classes [" @mozilla.org/extensions/manager;1 " ] .getService( Components.interfaces.nsIExtensionManager ) ; return extMgr.getInstallLocation ( " feedly@devhd " ) .getItemLocation ( " feedly@devhd " ) ; } function getBaseUri( ) { var ioSvc = Components.classes [" @mozilla.org/network/io-service;1 " ] .getService( Components.interfaces.nsIIOService ) ; var extDir = getExtensionDir( ) ; var baseUri = ioSvc.newFileURI( extDir ) .spec ; return baseUri ; } // your extension needs to call the addUbiquity command each time a new browser // session is create and your extension is loaded .
function addUbiquityCommands ( ) { // url of the file which contains the implementation of the commands // we want to add .
var url = getBaseUri( ) + " content/app/ubiquity/commands.js " // link to the ubiquity setup module .
var jsm = {} ; Components.utils.import ( " resource://ubiquity/modules/setup.js " , jsm ) ; // look up the feed manager and add a new command .
Note : we are using the // isBuiltIn=true option so that the command is only added for the duration // of the browser session .
This simplifies the overall lifecycle : if the // extension is disabled or un-installed , it will be automatically // " removed " from ubiquity .
jsm.UbiquitySetup.createServices().feedManager.addSubscribedFeed(
{ url : url , sourceUrl : url , canAutoUpdate : true , isBuiltIn : true } ) ; }
Inside your command implementation , you can use importing modules or looking up a singleton XPCOM component to link your command back to the functionality encapsulated by your extension .
Here is a sample command which does that :
var StreetsUtils = function ( ) { var that = {} ; that .lookupCore = function ( ) { return Components.classes [" @devhd.com/feedly-boot;1 " ] .getService( Components.interfaces.nsIFeedlyBoot ) .wrappedJSObject .lookupCore ( ) ; } ; return that ; }( ) ; CmdUtils.CreateCommand ( { name : " my-extension - test " , takes : { " message " : noun_arb_text} , icon : " chrome://my-extension-test/skin/icon-16x16.png " , modifiers : {to : noun_type_contact} , description : " Testing the feedly + ubiquity integration " , help : " This is a test help message " , preview : function ( pblock , direct Obj , modifiers ) { var html = " Testing my - extension - test " ; if ( modifiers.to ) { html += " to " + modifiers.to.text + " " ; } if ( directObj.html ) { html += " with these contents : " + directObj.html ; } else { html += " with a link to the current page . " ; } pblock.innerHTML
= html ; } , execute : function ( directObj , headers ) { CmdUtils.log ( " >>> my - extension core ? " + ( StreetsUtils.lookupCore ( ) != null ) ) ; } } ) ;
Note :
If you command file needs to include / load other JS files included in your extension , you can use the following piece of code at the top of the command js file you are adding to ubiquity .
function include ( partialURI ) { //
Load JS libraries var u = " chrome://feedly / content/app/ " + partialURI ; var jsl = Cc [ " @mozilla.org/moz/jssubscript-loader;1 " ] .getService( Ci.mozIJSSubScriptLoader ) ; jsl.loadSubScript( u ) ; } include ( " ubiquity/templates.ubiquity.js " ) ;
Closing Ubiquity Programmatically
Here is the line of code that a developer can use in order to programmatically close Ubiquity ( from the preview for example ) :
context.chromeWindow.gUbiquity.closeWindow( ) ;
Conclusion
To reiterate a point I made before : Ubiquity increases the surface area of innovation for the browser many - fold , by making anyone who can write simple Javascript into an agent for bettering the browser and the open Web .
You are one of those agents .

Usually , Dana Milbank ’s column in the Washington Post is a snarky take on Washington politics and politicians .
Not today .
He writes about Gina Gray , who got fired from her job at Arlington Cemetery .
It ’s a must read about the continuing disrespect shown to the men and women who gave their lives for this country in the Iraq war .
After more than five years , the Bush administration still tries to hide the dead from Iraq — refusing to let the families fully honor the soldiers who died .
Right across the Potomac River from the White House , in a city crawling with press and t.v. cameras , the funerals of the fallen are conducted in a news blackout — even when the families want the coverage .
Gina Gray , who tried to change the procedures , got fired .
If it ’s not the deplorable conditions at Walter Reed , which is just down 16th Street , from the White House , it ’s dishonoring the dead at Arlington .
Yet , George Bush still claims to support the troops .
It ’s beyond appalling :
When Gina Gray took over as the public affairs director at Arlington National Cemetery about three months ago , she discovered that cemetery officials were attempting to impose new limits on media coverage of funerals of the Iraq war dead — even after the fallen warriors ’ families granted permission for the coverage .
She said that the new restrictions were wrong and that Army regulations did n’t call for such limitations .
Six weeks after The Washington Post reported her efforts to restore media coverage of funerals , Gray was demoted .
Twelve days ago , the Army fired her .
“ Had I not put my foot down , had I just gone along with it and not said regulations were being violated , I ’m sure I ’d still be there , ” said the jobless Gray , who , over lunch yesterday in Crystal City , recounted what she is certain is her retaliatory dismissal .
“ It ’s about doing the right thing . ” Army Secretary Pete Geren , in an interview last night , said he could n’t comment on Gray ’s firing .
But he said the overall policy at Arlington is correct .
“ It appears to me that we ’ve struck the right balance , consistent with the wishes of the family , ” the secretary said .
They ’ve struck the balance ordered by the Bush administration .
To the newbie following examples , who has not poured through the docs , and is not a ruby expert ( me ) , Hpricot does give some surprises .
I spent a lot of time figuring this out .
check= trrow.search("//td[@width='30']//img[@alt='Winner ' ] " )
I need to see if the html row contains this image or not .
On some rows check is blank , on some it has the entire html as expected .
However , if i do as follows : if check != " " then this always evaluates to true .
I looked everywhere else before i found this out .
There was no way for me to differentiate between the check which was blank , and the check which contained the td .
In the case of the blank check , print " # {check} " always printed nothing .
Finally i had to do this , which I do n’t like : if " #{check} " != " " then .
Reminds me of unix shell scripting .
I had problems cleanly separating text inside nested html such as ( see source , search Rafael ) :
< td width = " 268 " align = " left " valign = " middle " >& nbsp ; & nbsp ; < a href = " /en_US/bios/overview/atpn409.html " class = " alt2 " >< b > Rafael Nadal</ b ></ a > & nbsp ; ESP& nbsp ; ( 1 ) </ td >
inner_text on the entire element gives me both Rafael Nadal and ESP with “ ? ” inside .
inner_text on the a block gives me the name , but no way to extract just ESP .
There are lots of “ ?? ” ‘s that come in the text .
So in some cases , I just had to parse the inner_text and split on the “ ? ” ‘s .
Finally , I did get my program running .
It is extremely dependent on the html , the slightest change will make this program inoperable .
However , i was able to transform a difficult to visually process format to an easy one .
My output comes out like this :
Rafael Nadal ESP ( 1 ) def. Ryler DeHeart USA 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 4 James Blake USA ( 9 ) def. Steve Darcis BEL 4 - 6 6 - 3 1-0 ( Retired ) Mardy Fish USA def. Paul - Henri Mathieu FRA ( 24 ) 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 Gael Monfils FRA ( 32 ) def. Evgeny Korolev RUS 6 - 2 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 4 Stanislas Wawrinka SUI ( 10 ) def. Wayne Odesnik USA 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 6 - 2

It 's fun when you see major companies really begin to understand the nature and cultural ins ands outs of your particular subculture .
Despite the fact that YouTube has grown over the last couple years and is a little large to be called a subculture , the majority of corporations out there would n't know what to do or where to begin if they saw something with the potential to turn into negative publicity surface on YouTube .
We 're starting to see more companies that do , though , and Electronic Arts is one we can add to the list .
A user took some video screen capture of a glitch in the Tiger Woods golf title from EA showing how the ball could be played by walking over a water hazard and swinging as if the pond were dry land .
The savvy folks at EA noticed the video , then produced and posted the following as a video response .
Tracking Twitter and running Google Alerts for negative press from the blogosphere and the general populace of the social media set is one thing , but if you want to live the Chinese cliche of turning danger into opportunity , this is the way to do it .
EA has successfully navigated what could become a negative demerit amongst the hardcore fans of the game franchise into a widely talked about marketing move .
It 's all about caring what your customers think and being smart about how you respond .
All of us , myself included , can learn something here .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - U.S. forces shot dead the 17 - year - old son and another relative of the governor of northern Iraq ’s Salahuddin province in a raid on Sunday , local officials said .
The U.S. military said it shot two armed , adding it was later found they were both related to the governor .
Governor Hamad al - Qaisi ’s brother , Lieutenant - Colonel Saad al - Qaisi , said American troops stormed a family house in the town of Beiji , where the governor ’s son Hussam and his cousin were staying .
“ They shot dead Hussam and wounded three others .
This is barbaric and inhuman , ” he said .
A statement from the U.S. military said its forces had wounded and captured an al Qaeda financer in the house .
“ As they entered the target building , coalition forces encountered two armed men .
Perceiving hostile intent ... they shot and killed the men .
It was subsequently determined that the two ... were related to the governor , ” the statement said .
Local officials said Governor al - Qaisi had cut short a visit to Turkey because of the shooting .
“ We demand an investigation into this incident , ” Deputy Governor Abdullah Jabara said .
Everybody needs beauty as well as bread , places to play in and pray in where nature may heal and cheer and give strength to the body and soul .
Keep close to Nature ’s heart … and break clear away , once in awhile , and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods .
Wash your spirit clean . ~
John Muir
To care for their health and well - being , many men carefully watch their diet , take supplements , exercise , and go for regular check - ups at the dentist and the doctor .
Some even supplement this routine with visits to a masseuse or a therapist .
But many men are skipping out on something essential to their manly vigor - spending time in the great outdoors .
Great men from Theodore Roosevelt to Ralph Waldo Emerson loved to tear out into nature .
Yet today men see activities like hiking , fishing , hunting , and camping as hobbies to be enjoyed by some and not by others .
They ’ve become just another recreational opportunity : you can take it or leave it .
But spending time in the outdoors is essential for every man .
It will strip off the stale , sissified patina that civilization has covered you in and renew your soul in 5 crucial ways :
1. Nature gives you a chance for unstructured exploration
Surely all God ’s people , however serious or savage , great or small , like to play .
~ John Muir
Most men ’s lives are tightly scheduled and routine .
Wake up , shower , commute , work , home , sleep .
Each day you drive the same route , sit in the same cubicle , and sleep in the same bed .
Yet within each man is a strong urge to set out and explore , to start out a day with only the faintest outline of an agenda , and to discover things never seen before .
Scrambling over rocks , hiking up mountains , and fording streams will make you feel like a kid again .
2 . Nature gets you in touch with the basic elements and your primal self
In God ’s wildness lies the hope of the world – the great fresh unblighted , unredeemed wilderness .
The galling harness of civilization drops off , and wounds heal ere we are aware .
~ John Muir
The modern man is subject to all sorts of rules , expectations , and constraints .
Buttoned up and buried in paper work , he must act polite , follow the traffic laws , and refrain from throttling the a -hole who prolongs the company meeting with asinine questions .
His spirit his constantly hemmed in .
And everything modern man touches , lives in , and uses has been modified from its original form : sanded , molded , and packaged for consumption .
Almost every sound he hears , from the car engine to the ringing cell phone , originates from an artificial source .
It ’s enough to render every man with a mild form of insanity .
Here at AoM , we encourage men to have manners , but the primal side of man should not be completely suffocated .
Men must periodically tear themselves away from civilization and interact with things in their natural state .
Touch real dirt , sit by a real fire , sharpen real wood , and listen to the pure sounds of running streams and the wind in the trees .
Surround yourself with matter that does n’t exist solely for human consumption .
Experience things that just are .
Listen to our podcast about awakening your senses to the outdoors :
3 . Nature gives you space to think and puts your problems in perspective
Walk away quietly in any direction and taste the freedom of the mountaineer .
Camp out among the grasses and gentians of glacial meadows , in craggy garden nooks full of nature ’s darlings .
Climb the mountains and get their good tidings , Nature ’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees .
The winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy , while cares will drop off like autumn leaves .
~ John Muir
In the cities and suburbs , it is easy to lose what is truly important .
The world begins to seem as if it really does revolve around your tiny world .
And there are few truly quiet moments in this madcap life .
In the car you are listening to music or talk radio , at work you ’re focused on the task at hand , and when you get home you turn on the TV and zone out .
Getting lost in nature allows quiet , unstructured space in which to sort out your problems , think through what ’s been going on in your life , and plan goals for the future .
Under the stars and beneath the trees , it is easier to see what really matters .
Mountain peaks , rolling rivers , and radiant sunsets will make you and your problems seem properly small .
4. Invigorates your body
I know that our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air , and the scenes in which pure air is found .
~ John Muir
Every now and again men must tear themselves away from the clogged air of the streets and the recycled air of corporate buildings .
Your lungs yearn to breathe the fresh air in the forests and mountains .
Hiking will invigorate your body .
While all exercise is beneficial in alleviating depression , outdoor exercise is particularly useful .
The sunlight , physical activity , and inspiring scenery will combine to rejuvenate your spirit and leave you ready to once more take on the world .
Wander a whole summer if you can .
Thousands of God ’s blessings will search you and soak you as if you were a sponge , and the big days will go by uncounted .
If you are business - tangled and so burdened by duty that only weeks can be got out of the heavy laden year , give a month at least .
The time will not be taken from the sum of life .
Instead of shortening , it will indefinitely lengthen it and make you truly immortal .
~ John Muir

A Nuclear Family Vacation : Travels in the World of Atomic Weaponry
Nathan Hodge and Sharon Weinberger
Bloomsbury , 336 pp , £ 12.99
It seems a law of modern life that there is no crucible of human suffering so horrific that it will not eventually have a heritage order slapped on it and a gift shop attached .
Now that the struggles of the Second World War have been memorialised to death , it is the turn of the atomic age to attract its share of the tourist trade .
In the US , nuclear weapons - once the terrible cancellers of life on earth - have been turned into a kitsch slice of 1950s Americana , to be treasured alongside Chuck Berry and cars with tail fins .
In A Nuclear Family Vacation , the husband - and - wife team of Nathan Hodge and Sharon Weinberger , both defence analysts , eschew the charms of Disneyland to follow this new heritage trail across the research labs , missile silos and nuclear shelters of the United States , Russia and Kazakhstan .
Here , tourists can queue up to turn the launch keys in decommissioned Cold War missile bunkers and visit the first plutonium plant in the US - now proudly trademarked as " the most contaminated place in North America " .
On their road trip , Hodge and Weinberger encounter the Special Atomic Demolition Munition - a suitcase bomb , to be carried on suicide missions behind enemy lines , that seems cartoonish enough to belong in a Roger Moore Bond film .
They visit a ravaged mock - up of a 1950s town , built in the desert outside Las Vegas , where cellars and picket fences were tested to see how they would survive a nuclear onslaught .
And they see a mock - up of the nuclear family in the well - stocked nuclear shelter - with mannequin Fifties housewives cheerfully serving dinner to the kids .
It 's no surprise that the National Atomic Museum in Albuquerque has become a popular venue to hire out for children 's birthday parties .
But this trip is a much more conventional journey than the gonzo title suggests .
We see little of the couple 's travels on the open road and the nuclear family suggested by the punning title is nowhere to be seen .
But we do get a fascinating series of vignettes about an under - reported , vastly expensive nuclear - industrial complex intact but still groping for a role 20 years after the end of the Cold War .
The sense that the west has forgotten how to fear nuclear weapons seeps through A Nuclear Family Vacation .
Even the hallowed laboratory at Los Alamos that spawned the first atomic weapon can no longer attract talented graduates .
Nuclear war seems irrelevant to the American Ivy- Leaguers who were still in diapers when the Berlin Wall fell .
The exaggerations that accompanied the war in Iraq - particularly Dick Cheney 's notorious claim that Saddam Hussein was developing a nuclear programme - have made the fear of the atom seem ridiculous for the MoveOn.org generation .
Nukes are now ridiculed as a convenient Aunt Sally , used by politicians to hide their real agenda .
The poet Robert Lowell wrote " Fall , 1961 " at the height of the Berlin crisis , complaining that " we have talked our extinction to death " .
Now nuclear weapons are barely mentioned at all .
When Hillary Clinton said during the Democratic Party primaries that , as commander - in - chief , she would " totally obliterate " Iran in retaliation for an attack on Israel , it was only a few pundits in the left - wing blogosphere who were fazed that a presidential candidate was threatening a first strike .
And when we think of the foreign policy events of the past decade , how many people remember that India and Pakistan came perilously close to nuclear war in 2002 ?
The startling effect of this silence and amnesia is that , according to Hodge and Weinberger , 61 per cent of Americans believe that Ronald Reagan 's fanciful Star Wars system actually exists - and that the US has a working system to protect them from nuclear attack .
No one now below their mid-thirties will be able to remember the terror that nuclear weapons evoked as late as the mid-1980s - the era of When the Wind Blows and Threads : a time when Martin Amis wrote short stories about after the inevitable nuclear holocaust .
" They distort all life and they subvert all freedoms , " he wrote - a sentiment that has been transferred wholesale to his latest enemy , Islamism - although , like the rest of the intelligentsia , he has gone silent on nukes .
In the Armageddon league table , it is now global warming , with its biblical floods and hurricanes , that disturbs our sleep and fills the current affairs shelves at Borders , rather than the mushroom cloud .
It is left to ancient Cold War hawks to remember .
Robert McNamara flies around the world in a never - ending think - tank seminar warning how close we still are to annihilation .
And even that atomic cheerleader , Margaret Thatcher , coolly predicted in her 2002 book Statecraft that battlefield nukes would be used in the " foreseeable future " .
Hodge and Weinberger do n't exactly provide many reasons to challenge their pessimism .
They impart the sobering knowledge that , even though Russia no longer targets its arsenal at western cities , the programming of missile guidance systems means that they will automatically home in on their old targets if they are misfired .
The University of Chicago 's doomsday clock was advanced by two minutes last year to stand at five to midnight .
A combination of Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions , loose nuclear materials around the world and potential nuclear terrorism make this the most dangerous time since the Cold War .
But it is unclear how the vast US nuclear - industrial complex can protect Americans against these threats .
This is where A Nuclear Family Vacation is best , in describing how the nuclear weapons industry staggers on in a kind of superannuated half - life .
The US signed up to a ban on testing in the early 1990s and the last nuclear weapons designer with actual experience of designing a thermonuclear weapon is due to retire soon .
But because of the industry 's shrewd lobbying , it receives more public funds than it did at the height of the Cold War , largely for its " stockpile stewardship work " .
The political price for the Clinton administration of getting warhead reductions through Congress was that the testing and manufacturing facilities would continue to be funded lavishly .
The result of all this pointless activity , however , is an industry plunged into " despair and desperation " about its ill - defined role , with office politics replacing geopolitics .
Disgruntled scientists , unable to engage in their passion for designing weapons , expend their energy writing blogs criticising management .
As in the tendentious recent debates about Trident in Britain , none of the PowerPoint warriors whom Hodge and Weinberger encounter in upper echelons of the military can articulate a purpose for their weapons .
" We came away less convinced than ever that there was any strategy to speak of .
The infrastructure exists because no one can come up with a compelling reason to shut it down , " they conclude .
This mission fuzz reaches a comic climax when the couple visit the Global Innovation and Strategy Centre , a new , Pentagon - funded military think tank , run along the lines of a Silicon Valley dotcom - with bottles of peach - flavoured water , Scandinavian wood tables and a " storytelling room " .
Here , generals talk about " knowledge discovery " , " the wired generation " and quote the globalisation proselytiser Thomas Friedman .
The icy clarity of nuclear deterrence has been replaced by " military psychobabble " , in which the think tank " looks at anything that can change an adversary 's mind " - which can be anything from instant messaging to a nuclear weapon .
For all its insights and comic moments ( including a safety announcement about turkey barbecues being piped to workers on the warhead production line ) , A Nuclear Vacation can be heavy going .
Monochrome installations and perimeter fences , whether in windswept corners of Wyoming , Nevada or Kazakhstan , make for a dull backdrop .
The writers are policy - wonks rather than raconteurs , and their descriptions - by - numbers betray the way this book has been stitched together from articles already published in the online magazine Slate .
At least three people are described as having " salt and pepper hair " .
More importantly , it is a glaring omission in the writers ' travel itinerary that they do not travel to India and Pakistan - which is surely the odds - on killing field for the world 's third nuclear holocaust .
Yet the book should at least be required deck - chair reading for one man : Barack Obama .
He has called for the US to further reduce its nuclear stockpile and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons from the world .
The constant invo cation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by the US when dealing with the " axis of evil " lacks all legitimacy when neither the Americans nor the other declared nuclear powers have stuck to a commitment to make " tangible efforts " towards disarmament .
Hodge and Weinberger 's chronicle of the trillions of wasted nuclear dollars might stiffen Obama 's resolve to take the moral high ground - and put this expenditure to better use .
Then again , its portrait of a powerful military - industrial complex , desperate to preserve its nukes at all costs , might , in time - honoured Cold War fashion , deter him from making a first strike .
Rob Blackhurst writes for the Financial Times
And as we approach Valentine 's Day , we thought we'd offer up some tempting bacon - flavored treats to show that special someone in your life how much they care .
I mean , you COULD always go for the easy " I Love You " option of the Bacon Of The Month club , but where 's the romance in that ?
Take it from us , a custom gift basket of bacony goodness is the way to any man or woman 's heart .
If it 's one thing we love here at YesButNoButYes - even more than free chocolate - it 's bacon .
MMMMMMMMM .
# 1. Bacon Flavored Coffee
This almost sounds too good to be true - Boca Java make a coffee named Maple Bacon Morning .
What a way to start the day .
# 2. Bacon Scented Candles
Not just bacon - but the whole package you need for a BLT flavor - bacon , tomato and lettuce candles .
And do n't let the aroma stop when you leave the house - fill your car with flavor with the bacon - scented air freshener .
# 3 . Bacon Flavored Ice Cream
Or , if you 're exceptionally lazy , you can also buy bacon ice cream premade
# 4 . Bacon Salt
The description of this just about sums up everything you need to know : " Bacon Salt is a zero - calorie vegetarian , kosher certified seasoning salt that makes everything taste like real bacon " .
Image to be included in Wikipedia next to the entry describing Nirvana ( the state of mind , not the band ) .
Almost as good as Bacon - Flavored Spray .
# 5. Bacon-flavored Mints
If you 're out with your lover , slip one of these in your mouth after eating to retain that luscious bacon scented breath that drives them wild .
# 6 . Bacon Flavored Chocolate
You 've probably heard about Mo's Bacon Bar - the bacon flavored chocolate which has been blogged about extensively ( and having tried it myself , I can confirm that it 's a wondrous miz of chocolate and bacon goodness )
So for an alternative , try Zotter Bacon Bits , caramelized crispy bacon , coated with chocolate and hazlenut nougat .
# 7 . Bacon Scented Bubbles
Be a friend to your doggy , watch the kids go wild .
all the fun you can have with a bubble maker that dispenses bacon - scented bubbles .
# 8 . Bacon-flavored Beer
It 's not actually advertised as such , but apparently Rauchbier tastes an awful lot like our favorite food group .
# 9 . Bacon-flavored Water
I 've searched high and low for bacon - flavored soda ( seems like something Jones Soda should make , right ? ) but until that comes along , here 's the next best thing , bacon - flavored water .
So , OK , it 's meant for your dog , but whatever .
# 10 . Bacon Flavored Toothpicks
I see no reason why , after you 've eaten a plateful of bacon , washed down with bacon beer , and finished with bacon flavored ice cream and chocolate , the porky goodness should end there .
So even as you leave the restaurant , dig for those last morsels of goodness with these bacon - flavored toothpicks .
Breastfeeding is natural .
So when my daughter Zinnia was born , I was surprised at how UNNATURAL it felt to me .
Babies must have proper mouth , and nose placement in order for the “ latch on ” to be successful and productive .
It took me a lot of trial and error to establish a good nursing relationship .
I attended my first La Leche League meeting when Zinnia was a week old .
I silently gaped at all the seasoned moms calmly discussing parenting techniques as they nursed babies of all ages .
Some of the children were really tucking into their evening meal , but others were just “ checking in ; ” breastfeeding was an intimate , nurturing bond that comforted them and made mother and child feel connected .
At Zinnia ’s one week check - up , she showed a slight weight gain , which is almost unheard of , since most babies actually lose weight during their first week .
I was one proud mama !
Like most new moms , the first two months hurt .
A lot .
I cringed at the thought of the next feeding .
I was a slave to Lansinoh , the lanolin nipple cream that was supposed to smooth the way and ease the pain of cracked , tender , or otherwise harassed nipples that were relentlessly utilized every four hours or so .
Most days , nursing made me feel like I donated blood .
I was exhausted , and no one was there to hand me juice and cookies at the end of a session .
The calories I burned did cause me to lose 30 pounds the first month , but after that the weight loss slowed way down .
My sex drive stalled , too .
It ’s a good thing my daughter was benefiting from my milk implants ( I went from B cup to D ) , because my husband sure as heck was n’t .
But finally , magically , one day the pain went away .
It was suddenly a nice thing .
I never felt a hormone rush or deliciously sleepy or orgasmic , but I could take the time to read a book or stare down at The Doll ’s face and marvel at how my milk and body had done all this ( on a vegetarian diet , too ! )
Sometimes as I sat there , baby held loosely in my arms , I could imagine myself as a gorilla in the forest , feeling the lush foliage grow up around me and the sun on my skin as I became one with nature .
Breastfeeding was such a primitive , natural thing , and it was good .
I refused to nurse in a public bathroom .
Would you want to eat lunch in there ?
I did n’t smother Zinnia under a blanket as she ate , either .
I was discreet and matter - of - fact about my nursing , never apologized or made an issue of it .
I wanted to show the world how normal it is .
No one ever reacted .
My mother - in - law kindly provided me with a deluxe Medela Pump InStyle double pump for when I went back to work part - time .
As fortunate as I was to have such a great machine , lugging it into work was like dragging along luggage for a week - long vacation .
About six months into our breastfeeding relationship , I suddenly had a burning , itching sensation in my nipples .
They turned bright pink and flaky .
Soon it felt like shards of glass were in my breasts .
Panicked , I called La Leche again , and checked my reference books .
I had thrush , a yeast infection .
Treatment had to be aggressive , medicine for both Zinnia and myself .
Even though she had none of the symptoms , she could easily pass it back to me .
For two weeks I had to put an antifungal cream on my nipples after we nursed , and wash it off before we nursed again .
It took the lovely spontaneity out of it .
I put her on a rigid breastfeeding schedule in order to keep up with the medicine .
I had to sterilize everything she put in her mouth .
It was also recommended that I stop eating sweets , even fruit , that I throw away all my makeup and buy anew , take acidopholus , and boil my bras .
Things were blissful again for a couple of weeks .
And then one night , as I rolled over in my sleep - POW .
My left breast , my best producer , suddenly got hot and hard .
I immediately got the chills and had a fever of 102 .
Mastitis had snuck up on me .
By the next afternoon I was on antibiotics .
I tried everything La Leche suggested –steam , massage , frequent nursing .
I popped Tylenol in vain .
The antibiotics took care of the fever , but my breast was becoming more and more painful .
After a few days , I dragged myself into a doctor ’s office , begging for something to dry them up , amputation , whatever .
She suggested that maybe I was on the wrong antibiotic .
She gave me some strong pain pills , and a new antibiotic .
Thankfully , it worked .
After a second bout of mastitis , I decided that I would wean Zinnia on August 1 , her first birthday .
It was also the day we moved to another city .
I figured she might realize that she had nursing privileges at the old small house , but that we were n’t moving the cow to the new location .
Anyway , I wanted my body back .
With mixed feelings , I cut her off cold turkey .
She fussed for a day or two , but quickly forgot about sucking on my breasts .
I ca n’t say the same for myself .
The word “ engorged ” echoed in my head the next two weeks .
My breasts swelled up rock hard , and large .
I could n’t do a thing without bumping one , setting off bolts of pain and milk dripping .
I called the doctor to beg for help , and she suggested warm wet compresses , tight bras and Advil .
Finally my boobs got the hint and started settling down , albeit grumpily .
Slowly they began shrinking , along with the rest of my body , which realized I did n’t need those extra pounds around my hips as baby food back up , and reluctantly let most of it go .
My little soldiers served me well .
They put in their active duty , put up a good fight and gave their all .
For all they went through , I wanted to give them a medal of honor .
Maybe even a Purple Heart .

Breastfeeding Experience from a First Time Mom
Breastfeeding Is Better for the Environment
Breastfeeding Saves Lives !
[ This post was written by Kendra Holliday . ]
Farhat Chishty pushes her son's wheelchair into the shade of an oak tree and sits down with a sigh .
It 's a calm spring morning at Denton State School , the largest institution for people with mental retardation in Texas , and she has come for her morning visit .
She puts a knit cap on her son's head and adjusts a blanket over his bony knees .
A gentle gust of wind blows across campus .
Spread out over 200 acres of wooded , rolling hills , the school has the bucolic feel of a summer camp .
It has been described as a place of systematic abuse and torture — an Abu Ghraib for the retarded — but it hardly seems that way this morning .
Not far from the park bench where she sits , a man in a wheelchair is motoring around the leafy campus , headed perhaps to the chapel or the Wooden Nickel restaurant to get an ice cream cone .
This is a school in name only .
The median age of its 630 residents is 49 .
The only thing they have in common is the need for around - the - clock supervision .
Some have Down syndrome , some are autistic and some lack the ability to walk or talk .
Chishty 's son falls in the last category .
Every day she comes here to be with him — to wash his wiry hair and clip his yellowed nails and rub his calloused feet .
The boy has no control over his body .
His head rolls from side to side , his eyes dart from one thing to another and drool pools out of his mouth .
His name is Haseeb , and he is 34 .
He was n't always like this .
For most of his life , he has been profoundly mentally retarded , but there was a time when he could sing and dance and communicate with his mother , in broken English and Urdu .
There was a time when he ate cheeseburgers with his family and bopped his head to his brother 's hip - hop .
And then something happened .
Six years ago , not far from where Chishty sits , a nurse 's aide found Haseeb in bed , soaking in his own blood and urine .
No one at the school could explain what happened .
For six months he lay in intensive care , suffering from massive internal injuries that triggered toxic shock and then paralysis .
His mother insisted someone at the school was to blame — she had seen a bruise in the shape of a footprint near his groin on the morning they found him .
But no one had reported any abuse , so her claims went ignored .
For two and a half years , she told this story to anyone who would listen , and then the unexpected happened .
Kevin Miller , a former caregiver at the school , admitted he had abused Haseeb in a drug - induced rage , punching and kicking him more than a dozen times .
He said his supervisors knew about the attack and helped him cover it up .
Even more alarming , he said abuse at the school was rampant .
He knew his confession , which he first offered at a drug rehab clinic in Houston , might send him to prison , but he felt it was worth the risk if it sparked reforms .
More than three years have passed since then , and none of the changes Miller envisioned have taken place .
Yet largely thanks to Chishty 's efforts , her son has become the face of a movement .
For the first time in nearly a decade , advocacy groups for the mentally retarded are pushing for the closure of the 13 state schools in Texas .
These facilities , which house nearly 5,000 people , represent the largest institutionalization of mentally retarded in the nation .
The alternatives — smaller , community - based group homes — are cheaper , safer and more humane , mental health rights advocates say .
The trend across the country is toward this model of care , and other states , including California and New York , have either shuttered their institutions or are in the process of doing so .
Jeff Garrison - Tate , who heads Community Now , an Austin - based advocacy group , cites the Chishty tragedy as a defining example of why Texas should close all its state schools .
" Haseeb is the tip of the iceberg , " he says .
" By their very nature , these are places where abuse is rife to occur . "
While officials with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services — the state agency charged with overseeing state schools — say Haseeb 's case represents an isolated incident , the agency 's own records paint a different picture .
In April , the Associated Press reported that in the last three years , more than 800 state school employees have been fired for causing serious injury to residents .
That followed a July 2007 review of records by The Dallas Morning News and the Houston Chronicle that found disturbing cases of abuse and neglect statewide .
Most devastating , however , was an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department , which in 2006 documented neglect , cover - up and 17 deaths in 18 months at the Lubbock State School .
A review by the Dallas Observer , a sister paper of the Houston Press , of more than 800 pages of disciplinary records covering 11 state schools over the last five years reveals a widespread pattern of abuse and neglect throughout the system .
These records are littered with incidents of staffers choking , punching and whipping clients .
They also indicate that staffers often say injuries to residents , which they caused , were self - inflicted or the result of accidents ; threats and intimidation of residents were tactics regularly employed by staff to ensure their abuse went unreported .
The Observer also spoke with nearly a dozen former and current employees at the Denton State School .
These workers — nurses , direct - care aides , investigators and others — have never before spoken to the press , worried that doing so would cost them their jobs .
They are speaking now because they say they are overburdened and near the breaking point , often being asked to work back - to - back shifts .
Turnover at Denton State School , according to the Texas State Employees Union , is an astronomical 54 percent .
The reasons are obvious : low pay , a largely unskilled staff and an increasingly dangerous patient population .
Says one employee , " No one really trains you in how to deal with a person who comes up to you and says , ' The devil wants me to kill you . ' "
None of this surprises Farhat Chishty .
For the last six years , she has been a constant presence at the Denton State School .
She passes between the buildings , almost ghostlike , pushing her son's heavy wheelchair along the shaded walkways .
Her eyes are black , ringed in shadows ; her cheeks are sunken and hollow .
She walks hunched over , as if she is carrying a thousand sorrows .
While most staff steer clear of her , others feed her information .
They slip notes in her car , or call after hours to report abuse they have seen .
Thanks in part to her efforts — she is a fixture at public hearings regarding state schools — the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is investigating the school .
What she has found , she says , is worse than anyone knows .
" It 's not one person .
It 's the system .
They think I 'm evil for being here , but the system is evil .
They can't admit that because if they do , they admit that the system is wrong . "
_____________________
It 's a warm Sunday afternoon in April , and Chishty is at her small Richardson home after a morning visit to Denton State School .
She sits in the shadows of her front room with her shoes off , her bare feet curled up beneath her .
Much of her youthful beauty — her high cheekbones , her striking dark eyes — is still present in her face .
Two of her sons — handsome young men with college degrees — are also here , as is her daughter , who through this ordeal has become her closest confidant .
They catch up on jobs and kids and Haseeb , and then Farhat disappears for a moment and comes back with a box full of pictures .
Here is Haseeb as a boy in Iran , wearing a lavender vest of velvet .
Here is Haseeb and his brother Saad , clowning for the camera .
Here is Haseeb at Denton State School , a week before the attack .
He is standing against a picnic bench , his face toward the sun .
He looks unhappy , agitated .
The oldest of her four children , Haseeb was born in Saudi Arabia in 1973 .
At ten months , on a trip to Pakistan , he contracted pneumonia , and the complications of the disease , which nearly killed him , caused permanent damage to his brain .
After that , he never functioned like other children .
They had never wanted to put him in an institution , Farhat says .
And in 1990 , when his family moved to Norman , Oklahoma , Haseeb began taking special education classes .
But at 21 , state law said he could no longer go to school .
The loss of structure and meaningful activities was difficult for him , and he often grew bored at home .
" He would just get up and walk outside , go in the street , " she says .
" On more than one occasion I had to call the police .
I did n't know where he was . "
Because the family could n't afford to keep him at home with a full - time caregiver , they placed Haseeb in a state - run facility five minutes from their Norman home .
It seemed like a good fit .
She visited him nightly , and on weekends he came home .
But in 1995 , after the state of Oklahoma consolidated its mental health and mental retardation services , Haseeb was moved to a facility three hours away , and his mother began looking for a new place for him to live .
She eventually settled on Denton State School , which at the time was the highest - rated public institution in Texas for people with mental retardation .
After visiting the campus , she felt reassured .
Haseeb 's apartment would be as nice as anything she would find in the private sector .
The apartment was his home , she was told ; the school was n't an institution , it was a community .
She saw residents freely roaming the sidewalks .
Others were on their way to work in one of the school factories .
Some were headed to the gym , which featured basketball courts and a swimming pool .
The school 's medical equipment appeared state - of - the - art ; the school even had an on - site wheelchair factory .
It reassured her that the school went to such lengths to ensure its residents were not only cared for , but comfortable .
Chishty , who at the time was pursuing a second bachelor 's degree at the University of Central Oklahoma , took a three - month leave of absence from work and moved in with her daughter in McKinney , Texas , to help Haseeb settle in .
She visited him every day , staying until the staff asked her to leave at night , often bringing him his favorite Middle Eastern food .
There were some things about the school that worried her .
Like the time she found a resident wandering along Interstate 35 , not far from the campus .
But she decided not to say anything .
If she expected top - notch care — and she did — she needed to be on good terms with the staff .
On the morning of September 26 , 2002 , she says she phoned Haseeb 's apartment to check on him and was told he had not eaten his breakfast .
Haseeb could be a picky eater .
She suggested the caregiver feed him a banana , but that had n't worked , she was told .
Then in a low voice , the staffer whispered , " Ms. Chishty , it 's not good . "
By the next morning , Haseeb 's heart rate had risen to near critical levels , and his breathing was reduced to a labored pant .
No one could explain what had ­happened .
Recalls Chishty , " When we got to the emergency room [ at Denton Community Hospital ] the doctor asked me , ' Can you ask him where he hurts , does he speak ? '
I said , ' Yes , he speaks . ' "
Haseeb told her his stomach hurt and when the doctor lifted Haseeb 's shirt , she saw bruising from his stomach to his groin .
" And then I sat down on the floor . "
Doctors at the hospital said his injuries were consistent with someone who had suffered a traumatic car accident , but that did n't seem possible .
He had only been at the school for four weeks , and during that time his family had n't heard about any ­accidents .
For six months Haseeb lay in the ICU , during which time he had three major surgeries .
The family pressed school officials for an explanation , but none came .
In January 2003 , Chishty got a vaguely worded letter that raised her suspicions .
She says the letter said a former employee had admitted to beating a resident who could have been Haseeb .
She says she expected some kind of an investigation , but nothing happened .
School officials would not give her any additional information .
She called State Representative Myra Crownover more than a dozen times , asking for help , but was ignored .
( Crownover , who represents the district where the school is located , is a staunch supporter of state schools .
She told the Observer that she was traveling when Chishty called , but that her director of constituent services met with her .
" I did n't want to get involved in a legal matter , " Crownover says . )
Chishty says she also called staff at the governor 's office and was told there was nothing they could do .
Figuring she had no other recourse , she hired Dallas attorney Kelly Reddell , who on September 23 , 2004 , filed a federal civil rights suit against the school , seeking monetary damages that would cover Haseeb 's in - home care for the rest of his life .
What followed could have come from the pages of a John Grisham novel .
Reddell hired a private investigator , who tracked down Miller , finding him in California through his unemployment checks .
When Miller was served with the suit , he called Reddell and told her he had found Jesus , and said he was ready to come clean .
Six months later , he hitchhiked to Dallas and gave Reddell a two - and - a - half - hour videotaped deposition .
For the school , Miller 's admissions were damning .
He said he had come to DSS looking for a purpose in life in August of 2001 , but before long he was witnessing abuse .
" There was the way we were trained to do things , and there was the way it worked in the real world , " he said .
" ... There were techniques for everyone ; different things worked for different people . "
To keep one resident under control , Miller said , he and other staff members used a large metal serving spoon .
Sometimes they tapped it on the floor as a warning , and sometimes they beat the resident on the head with it .
" It got to the point where it was fun beating them and hitting them and torturing them . "
He also said he and other staffers regularly used drugs on the job , often slipping into the bathroom to snort cocaine or smoke methamphetamines .
His supervisor was not only aware of drug use on the night shift , Miller said , he was also a user who bought painkillers from one of his employees .
( The state has denied these charges , and the supervisor has said in a sworn affidavit that he never used drugs on the job or witnessed anyone else doing so .
A nurse , who also worked during that time at the building where Haseeb lived , told the Observer none of Miller 's claims are true . )
Once Miller had been fully " brought into the fold , " he said , he began to see the sorts of abuse from which he had previously been shielded .
Now , sitting on a couch stoned with other staffers , he watched as residents " ran into walls . "
Sometimes , he and his co-workers would throw balls at the residents as they passed by .
" Basically , what it came down to was systematic torture of residents to get them to change their behavior , " Mil­ler said .
Like other residents , Haseeb could be difficult , Miller said .
Haseeb sometimes hit , scratched and pulled hair .
He often refused to sit down for meals , to eat or to work in one of the school 's workshops , according to court records .
Occasionally , Haseeb grabbed him around the neck and dug his nails into Miller 's skin .
On the evening of September 25 , 2002 , Haseeb did not want to go to bed .
Miller was irritable and angry , coming down off a high .
He told Haseeb to go to bed several times , and then , when Haseeb did n't listen , he punched him in the stomach .
He had done this before to control Haseeb , and other staffers had done it as well , he said .
" He kept coming up to me , and he kept coming up to me , and I kept punching him , and I kept punching him , and he would n't stop , " Miller said .
" I ca n't recall how many times . "
There was no way Haseeb could ward off the blows .
He weighed just 116 pounds , and Miller stood 6 - foot - 1 and weighed 265 pounds .
When he was done , Miller was sweating profusely .
He said he shut the door and walked away .
Most damaging to the school was Mil­ler 's claim that his supervisors were aware of what he had done and had concocted a story of a seat - belt injury , claiming Haseeb had struggled against being restrained during his transportation from his previous residence to Denton State School .
" I 'm not saying we all huddled up and said , ' This is going to be the story . '
It was something management came up with . "
With the tape rolling , Miller claimed he was n't trying to get even with the school , but rather hoped to right a wrong .
" What happened there goes against every fiber of my being . "
The next morning Miller turned himself in .
Prosecutors at the Denton County District Attorney 's Office charged him with injury to a disabled person , a first - degree felony .
On August 11 , 2006 , Miller was sentenced to 15 years in prison .
Despite the confession , the Texas Attorney General 's Office , which represented the school in the Chishty suit , maintained that Haseeb 's injuries — perforations to his intestines — were caused by a seat - belt injury on the trip from his previous residence to the school .
True , Haseeb did not like being restrained , but his mother says she saw him immediately after the trip and did n't notice any injuries .
In April 2007 , Reddell and Chishty took their findings to Austin , where each testified before the House Civil Practice Committee .
They asked lawmakers to give the Chishty family a waiver from sovereign immunity , a legal defense which can protect the state from civil suits .
Marianne Reat , an attorney with the Department of Aging and Disability Services , told the committee that an investigation into the matter had not found any evidence of abuse or neglect .
The House unanimously approved the request , but the Senate never acted on the bill .
The lawsuit was dismissed last year after the state successfully defended on grounds of sovereign immunity .
Back in their home , the Chishty family says they still have a hard time believing what happened .
" We took all the avenues we could , " says Haseeb 's younger brother Saad .
" Like any huge , overblown bureaucracy , they are designed to protect the institution instead of the people they serve . "
His sister nods and talks about the toll this has taken on their mother .
" Every day she is there ; she 's afraid to leave him alone for half an hour .
It 's taken over her life . "
Their mother sits slumped on the sofa in their living room , listening .
As her children talk , she thumbs through the pictures on her lap , and tears begin to stream down her face .
She tells them how guilty she feels for the time she spends at the school .
She has lost her job and her car , and now her oldest son helps support her financially .
She is separated from her husband , who lives in Houston .
Still , her deepest regret is that in some way she failed to protect Haseeb .
" The hardest thing for me , " she says , recalling the scene of the crime , " is to think of him lying there all night , soaking in his own blood . "
_____________________
When Chishty is not at the Denton State School tending to Haseeb , she is often on the road , tending to his cause .
Two legislative study groups are investigating the issues surrounding the state schools , and in February she testified in Dallas before one of them .
If either committee introduces legislation during the 2009 legislative session , she plans on lobbying lawmakers to ensure they understand her position : that the large , cumbersome state schools are fraught with the potential for abuse and should be shuttered in favor of smaller , community - based facilities .
Her fight is one with a long history , one that began more than 30 years ago when a man named John Lelsz filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son , alleging that Richmond State School used inhuman methods to control its charges , including the use of cattle prods to administer electric shock therapy .
The suit languished in the Dallas federal courts for years until Judge Barefoot Sanders , now retired , forged a settlement in 1991 .
Two state schools — in Fort Worth and Travis — were shut down as a result .
Then - Governor Ann Richards considered closing others , but intense opposition , fueled largely by the Texas State Employees Union , killed the effort .
" It 's kind of like closing a military base , " says mental health rights advocate Garrison - Tate .
" A lot of these places are in more rural areas — Brenham , San Angelo , Abilene — and they are an economic boon of that town . "
The Mexia State School , for example , employs one in four residents , adds Cecilia Fedorov , a spokesperson with the Department of Aging and Disability Services .
" If you represent one of those districts , and you close down a place like that , you 're committing political suicide , " says Garrison - Tate .
Although advocacy groups continued their push to get people with cognitive disabilities into community - based facilities , nothing stoked the prospect of change more than the December 2006 report of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of the Lubbock State School .
" It was more horrific than we ever imagined , " says ­Garrison - Tate .
The 43 - page report revealed that the Lubbock school was severely understaffed and was providing its residents an alarmingly low level of care .
The report noted that the school had almost no training for medical emergencies and had one full - time psychiatrist , who had a caseload of 180 residents .
Some of the observations noted in the report seemed like something straight out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest .
On June 5 , 2005 , for example , a male resident was told he could take a shot from the nurse " the hard way or the easy way . "
Opting for the hard way , staffers grabbed , choked and threw him to the ground , slamming his face in the floor .
The report sent shock waves through the Texas Department of Aging and Disabilities .
During tough questioning from a state Senate committee last year , DADS commissioner Addie Horn broke down in tears .
This was her life 's work , she said , and she took great pride in it .
The agency did everything it could to identify , prevent and stop abuse , and would continue to do so .
Officials at DADS went on a public relations offensive , asserting that the problems in Lubbock were not occurring elsewhere and that , as the report pointed out , the main problem was funding .
But subsequent media reports — in The Dallas Morning News , the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express - News — revealed that conditions were just as bad , and possibly worse , at other state schools .
Perhaps emboldened by the press reports , employees and family members of residents at the Corpus Christi State School started to come to the offices of state Representatives Solomon Ortiz Jr. and Abel Herrero last fall , telling them their own stories of abuse .
" People would bring pictures — ' Here is my loved one severely bruised .
Here is my loved one with a broken arm , ' " Ortiz recalls .
" And there was no explanation from the school as to how these things had happened . "
Then , in May 2007 , a resident at Corpus Christi hung herself by her shoelaces , the first suicide at a state school in years .
Ortiz says he was told the suicide was due at least in part to staffers who had not made their rounds .
" We started to talk to mid-­management - type people , and they started telling us about how understaffed they were , the back - to - back shifts , about the drug use among employees and that they were seeing a new [ criminal ] element being sent to state schools : people who were found not mentally competent to stand trial . "
The Observer 's own review of disciplinary records for 11 state schools ( Denton and Lubbock were not included because of pending litigation ) also supports the view that what happened to Haseeb Chishty was not a unique event .
While most of the disciplinary violations the Observer reviewed , for incidents reported from 2002 to 2007 , were for minor rules violations and accidents , dozens more raise serious concerns .
There are also disturbing episodes of exploitation , sometimes sexual , and humiliation .
Some mirror the environment Miller said existed at Denton State School .
At Abilene State School in the spring and summer of 2006 , for example , staffers regularly threw balls at residents as they passed by .
The same group of employees also forced a resident to sit while one of their co-workers punched him in the arm , chest and stomach .
These abuses went on for six months before any staffers were disciplined , even though their supervisor had been aware of the problems for months .
It is hard to reconcile these reports with what one sees touring Denton State School .
During a recent visit , the facility appeared clean , the staff cheerful .
" It really is a community here , " says recently appointed Denton State School superintendent Randy Spence , who has held management positions at other state schools .
" I never would have stayed for 29 years in a situation where what 's been portrayed in the media is the truth .
It 's very hard to read things and know they just are n't true . "
Still , employees say there are problems that must be addressed .
Because starting pay for an entry - level job as a direct - care aide is a relatively low $ 1,522 a month , roughly $ 9 an hour , finding applicants with relevant work experience is difficult .
The only requirement for the job is a high school diploma .
It is a stressful job , and over the years it has only become more difficult .
Thanks to advances in medical science , residents in state care facilities are living longer , which brings a whole set of new problems .
" It means more medications , more shots , more room for medical error , " one nurse says .
The population has also become more dangerous .
As Texas has cut overall funding for mental health , state schools have been asked to pick up the slack and have seen a steady increase in the number of residents with the dual diagnosis of mental retardation and mental illness .
In places such as Corpus Christi and San Angelo , state schools also take court referrals , meaning part of their populations are now accused criminals .
Because of high turnover — 2,138 state school employees quit last year — experienced staff are stretched thin while new workers must manage a situation that is often chaotic and frequently dangerous .
As a result , staffers say that accidents happen and occasionally tempers flare .
" Most of the people I work with are compassionate and really care about their jobs , " another employee says .
" But we do have people not cut out for the job , and sometimes bad things happen . "
DADS spokesperson Fedorov argues that state schools are open to visitors 24 hours a day , making rampant and systematic abuse nearly impossible .
She says that while abuse allegations are high — investigators have confirmed 1,266 instances of abuse systemwide in the last three years — that does not tell the full story .
Ninety - one percent of all abuse allegations come back unconfirmed .
The future of state schools now lies in the hands of the state Legislature .
Over the past year , a mostly Democratic legislative study group , led by Representatives Ortiz and Herrero of Corpus Christi and Garnet Coleman of Houston , has held hearings in Corpus Christi and Dallas , and plans to hold more .
They expect to issue a report in November .
A second legislative committee appointed by House Speaker Tom Craddick has also hosted a hearing in Austin and plans to release a report before the start of the 2009 legislative session .
The chairman of this committee , State Representative Larry Phillips from Sherman , believes that reports of abuse and neglect have been exaggerated in the press .
What has been lost , he says , is the number of people who are pleased with the facilities .
" You hear from families who say , ' I do n't think my loved one would be able to make it if it were n't for state schools , ' " Phillips says .
" And then you hear from those who say it should all be closed .
It 's very difficult when you have two sides who are very adamant about things . "
As far as community - based facilities are concerned , Phillips says , " There will always be abuse in the alternative as well .
You can't say that just doing away with this parameter , you 're going to do away with abuse . "
Fedorov maintains that when residents capable of existing outside state school facilities request to leave , they are allowed to do so , provided there is space for them in state - run group homes .
Since 2005 , there has been a steady increase in the number of state school residents transferred to these facilities , from 76 in 2005 to 97 in 2006 to 118 last year .
Already this year , 144 state school residents have gone into the ­community .
But Garrison - Tate says this is far from enough .
He points to a July state audit report that said of the 644 residents at state schools who asked to leave in fiscal year 2007 , 449 — or 70 percent — were denied .
Each state school has an interdisciplinary team — made up of a psychologist , a nurse , a guardian and others — that decides which residents are allowed to leave .
" There 's an inherent conflict of interest when the people deciding whether you can leave are those whose livelihood depends on the continued existence of these facilities , " Garrison - Tate says .
" We would love to see the state close these facilities down , as other states have done , and move to community - based care .
That 's the trend across the country , but we know it can't happen today , or tomorrow .
So what we want to see is a right - sizing .
How many of these [ schools ] do we actually need to have ?
The people who want to get out should be able to leave , and we should n't put any more people in . "
So far , the legislative response has been to increase funding for additional employees .
In the 2007 session , the Legislature appropriated $ 49 million for state schools to hire additional employees .
While DADS officials say the money has already made a difference , Denton State School employees say they are n't seeing much of a difference .
The quality of training is going down , says one staffer , and new workers are often thrown into situations they are n't ready for .
Representative Coleman says things must change .
" For too long the answer has been to ignore these problems and to act like they do n't exist , and we 've done nothing , " he says .
" Well , doing nothing has got to stop .
These are our most vulnerable citizens .
It 's a measure of our worth as a government , and as a society , how we take care of them . "
Just how well the Denton State School takes care of its residents is somewhat obscured by DADS 's refusal to provide relevant documents related to the facility , citing pending litigation .
But Chishty says what she has found suggests the school is just as bad as , if not worse than , other facilities in the system .
Over the last year , Chishty says she has uncovered several mysterious deaths at the school .
One involved Manuel Lopez , a 17 - year resident of the school who died in January .
His family members told the Observer that they regularly saw bruises on his legs and face .
Now they wonder if what they were told was an accident that caused permanent paralysis more than 13 years ago was actually the result of abuse .
The family says the state has refused to release an autopsy report , and DADS declined the Observer 's request for the same report , citing confidentiality concerns .
The Texas State Attorney General is currently reviewing that decision .
While Chishty refuses to reveal what role she has played in the pending U.S. Justice Department investigation of the school , she had advance knowledge of the arrival of federal investigators at the school and the resignations within the last year of the superintendent of the school , its director of nursing and its director of incident investigations .
One Denton State School employee who spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity blamed the federal investigation on Chishty .
The employee also said abuse allegations at the school have dramatically spiked over the past two years .
For Chishty , this is good news .
" It means somebody is getting the message .
They know I am there and that I am watching . "
_____________________
She knows the answers now .
For so long , they told her she was crazy , that what she said happened to her boy could n't be true .
And then they found the man who did it , and he confessed and is in prison .
Everything that has come out since has only confirmed what she has always believed .
The prison is in the middle of nowhere , at a far west corner of the state in Fort Stockton .
It is a bleak and foreboding place — a cluster of tan buildings surrounded by razor wire — and on hot days it bakes in the sun .
It 's the perfect spot to shelve a man the state would just as soon forget about .
In July , Kevin Miller agreed to a visit with the Observer , saying he was ready to talk again .
He knew the school , despite his confession , had never taken responsibility for its role in the matter .
He wanted to talk , he said so in a letter , but what difference would it make ?
After all he had said , so little had been done .
He 'd gained nothing by confessing , other than to give the Chishty family some semblance of justice , and they still wanted him dead .
And so , not long ago , weighed down by what he had done , he tried to kill himself .
It was his second attempt .
There was so much about him he wanted people to know — the abuse he had suffered as a child , his habitual bouts with drug addiction , his bipolar disorder .
Not that any of that was an excuse for what he had done .
" The above is not intended to put the blame on others and somehow reduce mine , " he wrote .
" I just feel now that it would have never happened if there were n't a hostile work environment , chronic drug abuse and a system of abuse of residents already in place . "
Chishty says she knows all this , has known it for years , but it 's still good to hear again , to revalidate what she 's been fighting for .
Because he is now a danger to himself , Miller has been transferred to a mental health unit .
Both he and her son have become victims of the same act , and now both reside in institutions for the mentally challenged .
In October , the state agreed to let Haseeb come home and to provide a nursing assistant to help Chishty with his care .
She says she expects Haseeb to be home within a month or two , but considering the history of her battle with the state , she would n't be surprised if it takes longer .
Back on the grounds of Denton State School , she pushes her son in his heavy wheelchair , as she does most days .
They cross the grass that leads to the edge of the campus and stop under a grove of trees .
Off in the distance , at the top of a small hill , is the cemetery , surrounded by a white picket fence .
Every year , the residents of this school who have no family end up there .
The school will not say how many they bury , but she knows that last winter 11 died in one month alone .
She thinks of the many residents who have no family , and she says a silent prayer for them .
" Whatever happens , I will keep fighting , " she says .
" Not just for Haseeb , but for the other people here .
I have to make sure what happens to him never happens again . "
TIJUANA , Mexico 
With a bingo hall , a dog track and a vast room of slot machines , Casino Caliente has a fair share of shrieks and groans any night of the year .
But when a team of heavily armed men dressed in black barged in and ordered everyone to the floor on a Friday night this month , the outbursts rose to an entirely different level .
“ Everybody down ! ” the masked men shouted , adding expletives to make their point and urgently directing their automatic weapons this way and that .
Panic filled the bingo hall , for no one knew what was to come next .
Gone are the days when Mexico ’s drug war was an abstraction for most people , something they lamented over the morning papers as if it were unfolding far away .
Reminders are everywhere , like the radios blasting drug ballads that romanticize the criminals and the giant banners that drug cartels hang from overpasses to recruit killers and threaten rivals .
The Mexico - based traffickers that ship narcotics from South America to the United States are in a pitched battle with President Felipe Calderón ’s government , which has sent the army to trouble spots around the country to shut them down .
Police agencies , infiltrated by the drug traffickers and lacking training , have not shown themselves to be up to the job .
The results have been mixed : there have been huge drug seizures and arrests of some kingpins , but also violent retaliation by the heavily armed traffickers , who have been killing law enforcement officers and many noncombatants as well .
Let 's face it : Social media has become one of the hot buzzwords in tech circles .
It used to be Web 2.0 and social networking , but now we have moved on to a broader term that encompasses not only social networking , but blogs , podcasts , user - generated content , social bookmarking , microblogging , and lifestreams .
The rise of all these forms of new media has also created demand for people who can help companies position and market themselves within this new realm .
Jeremiah Owyang of Forrester Research has been compiling a list of people who hold social media jobs .
The list is nowhere near comprehensive , but the company hiring social media marketers , community managers , strategists , specialists , and consultants is impressive .
Microsoft , IBM , Intel , GM , Cisco , AMD , Nationwide , MTV , and Google are only the beginning of this list .
Companies big and small are hiring people at a rapid pace for social media roles .
But a year or three from now , will companies still be hiring for these positions ?
Should you be adding to your credentials so you can market yourself as a social media expert ?
Are social media jobs a fad or are they here to stay ?
To answer that question , you really to have ask a different question :
What 's the point of a social media job ?
Read the job description for any social media job listing and you 'll come across evangelist , community , marketing , engagement , and viral quite often .
The jargon , though , can be summed up in two words : retention and growth .
Companies generally have one overarching goal : to increase profits .
And anyone can tell you that keeping current customers ( or users ) and adding new ones is directly related to that single goal .
These two things , keeping current users happy and adding new users , are the purposes of social media jobs .
And that 's why these jobs are here to stay .
Social media allows people to spread their message to hundreds , if not thousands , of friends , followers , and strangers .
Some companies can only dream of that kind of reach , while others pay millions in advertising for the same effect .
Digg allows a website to emerge from obscurity to prominence and Twitter allows a company to respond to customer complaints quickly ( I 've had personal experience with Comcast 's Twitter account ) .
As more social media tools pop up and current ones expand , the need to respond and promote to a growing online community will only grow .
Companies that simply ignore the blogs and social media risk huge public debacles and lost revenue ( just ask Sony how bad it can get ) .
Even if the title changes , the role of the social media marketer or manager is not going anywhere .
Building community , reaching out to potential customers , building stronger relationships , creating buzz - they are fundamental goals to every company .
So long as people use social media to share their thoughts and their complaints , the need for people to fill social media jobs will continue to grow .
And the companies that fill those roles now will be ahead of the game .
Remember when the first President George Bush went to a grocery store for a photo op and proclaimed himself amazed at the scanners used to ring up purchases ?
To 99 percent of the country , scanners were not news .
His cluelessness about one of the basic elements of daily life — buying food — defined the senior Bush as out of touch .
A few months back , the second President Bush appeared equally disconnected when asked by a reporter if he was worried about the likelihood of the price of gas rising to $ 4 a gallon .
" Four dollars a gallon ?
Huh , had n't heard that , " Bush replied .
Well , he 's heard about it now , as we all have .
We have created a system where we are ruled by the rich .
Some of our leaders , like the Bushes , were rich before they got on the government payroll .
Others , like the Clintons , got rich as a result of being elected , using the perks of book contracts , speech fees , insider deals , etc. that come with higher office .
When our senators and presidents and Supreme Court justices stop driving , pumping gas , and buying groceries , they lose touch .
( That 's why it 's always reassuring to me when I see Shelby County mayor A C Wharton wheeling a grocery cart around Schnucks .
The man knows about the price of milk — and scanners . )
This disconnect between our high officials and the average Joe was never made clearer than it was this week when John McCain 's economic adviser Phil Gramm declared : " This is a mental recession .
...
We have sort of become a nation of whiners . "
Oh , really ?
This , coming from the lips of the man who , as senator , created the financial loophole that enabled the Enron crisis , was particularly galling .
McCain wisely and quickly distanced himself from Gramm 's remarks .
But really , when do you think was the last time McCain pumped gas or W. bought a loaf of bread ?
Cindy McCain has charged as much as $ 500,000 in a single month on one American Express card and $ 250,000 on another .
One of the McCains ' two dependent children had an AmEx card with a monthly balance of $ 50,000 — about the median annual U.S. household income .
The McCains own seven houses .
Oh well , at least they 're not whiners .

Constitutional expert Turley on FISA bill : ' The fix is in ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008
Print This Email This The United States Senate is about to vote on a FISA bill that would not only expand the president 's powers of surveillance over American citizens but would also forestall civil suits against the telecoms that illegally participated in past surveillance .
MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow , substituting for Keith Olbermann on Countdown , expressed amazement at the sweeping victory that is being handed to President Bush .
" I 'm betting that his wildest dreams did not include the prospect that Congress -- a Democratic - led Congress -- would help him cover up his crimes , " she stated .
" That is exactly what the US Senate is poised to do . "
In Senate debate , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) argued strongly against telecom immunity , because it would make it almost impossible to ever find out what really happened and " the American people ought to know who in the White House said , ' Go break the law . ' "
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) noted that , " We 're considering granting immunity when roughly 70 members of the Senate still have not been briefed on the president 's wiretapping program .
The vast majority of this body still does not even know what we 're being asked to grant immunity for . "
Maddow spoke with Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley , who explained , " What the Democrats are doing here with the White House is they 're trying to conceal a crime that is hiding in plain view .
...
Nobody wants to have a confrontation over the fact that the president committed a felony .
...
That 's a very inconvenient fact right now in Washington . "
" The Democrats have learned well from Bush , " Turley said in amazement .
" They 're just going to change the rules .
...
It 's otherworldly .
...
I am completely astonished by Senator Obama 's position -- and obviously disappointed .
All of these senators need to respect us enough not to call it a compromise .
It 's a cave - in . "
" It 's like all those stories where someone is assaulted on the street and a hundred witnesses do nothing , " continued Turley .
" In this case , the Fourth Amendment is going to be eviscerated tomorrow , and a hundred people are going to watch it happen because it 's just not their problem .
...
There 's not an ounce of principle , not an ounce of public interest in this legislation . "
Turley added that even though the telecoms could still be prosecuted criminally , it 's unlikely to happen .
" The fix is in , " he concluded .
" Tomorrow night , there 's going to be a lot of celebrating among telecom lobbyists .
...
What we will lose tomorrow , it 's something very precious . "

McCain campaign backs off ' cameras ' charge
McCain 's camp , accused in the New York Times and the Washington Post this morning of distorting Obama 's canceled trip to a military hospital in German , seems to have backed off the core of the charge :
That he canceled the trip because " the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . "
" It does now seem that Barack Obama snubbed the troops for reasons other than a lack of photo - op potential , " writes McCain blogger Michael Goldfarb this morning , contradicting his campaign 's televised ads and his candidate 's statements .
But as the media swings around to contradict McCain 's story , the campaign is trying to stay on offense , blaming the press for the confusion :
" [ T ] he initial reports were less clear , " Goldfarb writes .
" The early explanations from the Obama campaign were vague and contradictory , with David Axelrod blaming the Pentagon ( Lynn Sweet now says she misreported and misunderstood Axelrod 's statement , though she provides no further context for the quote that might change the meaning ) , Robert Gibbs saying Obama himself felt the trip would be inappropriate , and Scott Gration saying the Pentagon had discouraged the visit by dubbing it ' a campaign event . ' "
The accurate story , which the Obama campaign never told particularly clearly because it is n't all that flattering , seems to be that they were afraid the trip would be criticized as political .
Fox host predicts GOP ' mayhem ' when Obama accepts nomination David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama announced on Monday that he would accept the presidential nomination at Denver 's Invesco Field -- a stadium which can seat 76,000 people in the stands and more on the field -- rather than at the much smaller Pepsi Center where the rest of the Democratic convention will be held .
At Fox & Friends , this announcement set off frenzied speculation about all the ways in which something might go wrong with this gesture by Obama to recognize the legion of small donors who have been the driving force in his campaign .
" On that day in August in Denver , there 's a 30 % chance of rain , " Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano began .
" What will they do ! " " I 'll tell you who this is causing the biggest headache for , " acknowledged co-host Alisyn Camerota .
" Our bosses , the news media , that has been checking the audio and testing lights and building sets at ... the convention center ... for the past year .
And now , if they have to scramble ... "
However , host Steve Doocy offered the most dramatic scenario .
" They 're apparently going to make huge blocks of tickets available just for -- run -of - the - mill Coloradans , " he stated , somewhat dismissively .
" All the tickets are free -- although a lot of party insiders are going to be there .
You 've got to figure that Republicans and noisemakers and troublemakers are going to do their best to get in there in a large block , so the moment that Barack Obama is there , they 're going to try to do a -- little mayhem . "
" I do n't know if you even have to show ID to get in , " Napolitano agreed .
" These guys have to pack this place , because if they do n't , it 's going to be a letdown . "
" The big question , " concluded Doocy , " is , of course , if there are a bunch of people with John McCain signs out there , will the mainstream media even show those dissenters ?
Probably not . "
With that image -- of supporters of John McCain as " dissenters , " equivalent to left - wing anti-war demonstrators , who might suffer the fate of being ignored by " mainstream media " like Fox News -- Doocy ended .

Here 's a news story guaranteed to provoke a fusillade of indignant spluttering , courtesy of your inner Clarkson : German politicians are reportedly planning to ban Kinder Surprise eggs on the grounds that they 're a safety hazard .
In case you 're not familiar with the concept , the " surprise " inside each Kinder egg is a cheapo little toy housed within a plastic shell .
Anyway , the Germans are worried that hungry , gurgling kiddywinks might mistake the gifts for food and wind up choking to death .
" Children ca n't differentiate between toys and nutritional items , " said Miriam Gruss , a member of the German parliamentary children 's committee .
What , really ?
Do n't get me wrong - I think children are idiots .
But even I find that statement a tad unfair and sweeping .
I used to have a spud gun when I was a kid .
In case you 're not familiar with that concept either , it was a small metal pistol that fired chunks of potato .
Not once did I aim the potato at anyone .
Or try to deep - fry the gun .
And I was thick as shit .
I guess it was luck .
In fact my run of luck was pretty impressive .
Other toys I failed to ingest include a Scalextric , several boxes of space Lego , the board games Operation and Mousetrap , and a complete collection of Paul Daniels ' TV Magic Tricks - even though the latter included an egg - shaped gizmo called The Magic Egg .
Somehow , miraculously , my conker - sized kiddywink brain managed to differentiate it from a real egg .
Thus my life was saved by a whisker .
Gruss wo n't countenance such a slapdash approach to child safety .
Not on her watch .
" It 's a sad fact , " she said .
" Kinder Surprise eggs have to go . "
As you can imagine , the committee 's proclamation has already caused a fair bit of outraged huffing , not least from the manufacturer , Ferrero , which until now has perhaps been best known for providing the catering at badly dubbed ambassadors ' receptions in the late 1980s .
" There is absolutely no evidence that the Kinder Surprise eggs , as a combination of toy and foodstuff , are dangerous , " said Ferrero 's spokeswoman .
Then she snatched a golden - foil - wrapped nobbly chocolate bollock from a nearby silver platter and added , " Monsieur , with these Rocher , you are really spoiling us . "
Now I 'm no fan of Ferrero chocolate , which vaguely tastes like regurgitated icing sugar to me , but I can't help thinking that it would be hugely unfair on the company if an unsubstantiated link between Kinder eggs and danger began to form in parents ' minds and sales suffered accordingly .
Let 's face it , even though Kinder eggs are generally bought for the gift rather than the sickly chocolate shell , and even though many of the toys are so ingeniously designed they could easily be sold on their own , munching through the outside to get at the inedible inside is half the fun .
What 's more , jittery , neurotic parents do n't need any more false scares to piss their pants over .
They 're already raising their twatty little offspring like mollycoddled prisoners : banned from playing outdoors in case a paedophile ring burrows through the pavement and eats them , locked indoors with nothing but anti-bacterial plasma screens for company , ferried to and from school in spluttering rollcaged tanks .
. .
Christ , half these kids would view choking to death as a release .
No wonder they grow up to become tiresome whooping advocates for extreme sports .
If I 'd spent the first 18 years of my life doing time in a joyless cotton - wool cell , listening to some angsty bloody parent banging on about how precious and special I was every pissing day , I 'd snowboard off a 300 ft cliff at the first opportunity too .
Under those circumstances , tumbling down a rockface and cracking your skull open must feel like a declaration of independence crossed with an orgasm .
How did we get to this point ?
Our sense of self grew too strong .
We gazed up our own bums for so long , we each became the centre of the universe .
We 're not mere specks of flesh , jostled by the forces of chance .
We 're flawless deities , and goddammit we deny - deny !
- the very existence of simple bad luck .
If we trip on the pavement , someone else is to blame .
Of course they are .
And we 'll sue them to prove it if necessary .
In a bid to pre-empt our self - important litigiousness , armies of risk assessors scan the horizon , dreaming of every conceivable threat .
You could bang your head on that branch .
Crack a rib on that teaspoon .
Choke to death on that chocolate egg .
Well , it stops here .
And it stops now .
Next week , I 'm launching my own range of Kinder eggs .
They 're called Unkinder Eggs .
And they do n't contain sweets .
They contain specially designed hazards .
Spiked ball bearings .
Spring - loaded razor - blade traps .
Flimsy balloons filled with acid .
Miniature land mines powerful enough to punch holes in your cheeks and embed your teeth in the wall .
The idea is to carefully nibble away all the chocolate without incurring a serious injury .
Thrills !
Tension !
Chocolate !
It 's the confectionery equivalent of extreme sports .
You 'll love it .
And hey - that 's not just cocoa butter and milk solids you 're savouring .
It 's better than that .
It 's the great taste of risk .

"
The Federal Government will provide $ 50 million to the geothermal industry to help it begin making the technology viable for baseload energy production .
Speaking to Alexandra Kirk on ABC Radio's AM program , the Minister for Resources and Energy , Martin Ferguson , said there was huge potential for geothermal energy in Australia .
New figures from Geoscience Australia show just 1 per cent of Australia 's hot rocks supply could produce 26,000 times the country 's current annual energy use .
Mr Ferguson says encouraging the development of geothermal energy is important in tackling climate change and ensuring national energy security .
The $ 50 million Geothermal Drilling Program , to be officially announced by the Minister at an industry conference today , will be used to give grants to cover the cost of drilling geothermal wells .
" The industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry , " Mr Ferguson said .
Mr Ferguson said if drilling proves successful geothermal energy could provide a " significant " contribution to the Government 's target of 20 per cent renewable energy use by 2020 .
" The geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what you 're effectively doing is pumping water below ground where it 's heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station , " he said .
However , director of the research institute for sustainable energy at Perth 's Murdoch University , Professor David Harries , has told AM's Anne Barker the huge cost of drilling five kilometres into the earth and the vast distance of sites from the national electricity grid may just prove exorbitant .
" If you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the cost could be comparable to coal , " he said .
" If on the other hand you 're talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central Australia and then building large transmission lines to Adelaide and Sydney the costs are going to be too expensive . "
Professor Harries also says there are unknown environmental risks in bringing radioactive water to the earth 's surface .
Retired Adelaide scientist Dennis Matthews agrees and says Government is backing the wrong industry .
" In theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and they 've got to move onto another field , " he said .
" Then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field .
" It 's often claimed these are renewable energy projects but 100 years renewable is not a renewable industry in my book , " he added .
What to Expect When You 're Expecting Assassins
( CNN ) -- Mrs. Allen had it all .
CNN 's Dionne
Hill is optimistic she 'll marry , even though 45 percent of black women have never married .
A career she enjoyed , a nice home , two adorable children and a husband .
She shared her tools for success with me at an early age .
She went to college , got married and waited until she was 26 to have her first child .
The perfect life .
The perfect plan .
It was one I decided to model .
My aspirations for both a career and family were set at the age of 12 .
I knew I could accomplish what Mrs. Allen , my fifth - and seventh - grade teacher , had .
But as I approach 30 and measure the goals I had at 12 against the reality of life , the only thing I can check off that list is a college education .
I am a statistic .
And there are millions more like me .
Forty - five percent of black women in America have never been married , compared with 23 percent of white women , according to the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey in 2006 .
Articles like the one published in the Washington Post two years ago could lead me to believe that it 's because " Marriage is for White People . "
Black men respond about love and families »
The difference between Mrs. Allen and me :
She was white .
The numbers , undeniably , are not in my favor .
But they have never been .
Born black , raised in a single - parent home and primarily educated in low - performing public schools , I am not supposed to be a success story .
But giving weight to statistics in my personal life only contributes to a culture of fear surrounding marriage .
Black men and women keep it real about relationships »
Black in America CNN 's Soledad O'Brien examines the successes , struggles and complex issues faced by black women and families -- 40 years after the death of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Watch tonight , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
This fear causes some women to make hasty decisions like staying in unfulfilling relationships that lead to unsuccessful marriages , which end in divorce ( another dismal statistic ) .
Or just the opposite : Women become so fearful of making the wrong choice , they find themselves surrounded by a moat with no bridge to their final destination : marriage .
For the past year , I have researched , read and conducted several interviews on this topic for the " Black in America " series .
Producing a segment on the low marriage rates in black America was not without its challenges .
I wore my " black and single " crown proudly , withstanding jokes and heckles from coworkers and questions from fellow singles like Kriss Turner , a black woman profiled for the " Black Woman & Family " documentary who asked me , " You 're in Atlanta ; what 's your problem ? "
Why are you still single ?
I hate that question .
Yet I am forced to confront it .
What 's the state of your relationship ?
One reason : personal responsibility .
Among the men I have dated , there were definitely some who were ready for something a little more significant than I was willing to give .
Did I drag my feet because I was n't ready ?
Or was it because those men were n't right for me ?
It 's debatable and probably a combination of the two .
Mrs. Allen was white , but she was also part of a generation of people , like my parents , who married at an earlier age .
Today , black women outnumber black men almost 2 - to - 1 in higher education .
But white women are also surpassing white men in college enrollment and completion , according to the National Center on Education Statistics .
What is a rooted example in the black community is also sprouting legs among America 's other racial groups .
I am part of a generation of Americans who are choosing to postpone marriage while they pursue their careers .
My outlook : optimistic .
My honest fear :
It may never happen .
If it does n't happen , it wo n't be because of a widening gap in the education , employment and ambitions of black men and women .
I will not attribute it to a lack of options , intra- or interracially .
I know the numbers .
On a macro level , the horizon is grim , but my personal experience reflects stories of black women and men who are married or very seriously considering it .
Social and economic conditions are very strong influences , but so is the desire for love .
If I remain in my current statistical category , a single black woman , it will be because I missed someone while gazing at the ancient obelisks of Egypt 's Karnak Temple , partying with expats in Hong Kong or simply spending time with family and friends in America .
It 's more likely that the proverbial " The One " and I will find each other somewhere along the way .
My life is not lived on a timetable or measured by how much sand has fallen in an hourglass .
So check back in with me in 2018 .
I may have a different story to share then .
Ted Stevens , the longest - serving Republican senator in US history , was indicted today on criminal charges for concealing gifts he received from oil executives seeking to curry favour with him .
The indictment sent shock waves through Washington , where the 84 - year - old Stevens is a legendary figure and Congress 's strongest advocate for oil drilling in protected wilderness areas .
Stevens has been under investigation by the FBI for more than a year for his ties to Veco , an Alaskan oil company , and his delivery of $ 50 m in US federal money to a non -profit group run by his former aide .
The senator was charged with seven counts of making false statements on government financial disclosure forms .
Stevens " willfully engaged in a scheme to conceal " more than $ 250,000 in gifts he got from Veco , including furniture , vehicles and a barbecue grill .
" Stevens could and did use his official position on behalf of Veco " while receiving the gifts , according to the indictment .
Prosecutors said the senator helped Veco win a $ 170 m government contract for Arctic research as well as help with projects in Pakistan and Russia .
Seven Alaska state legislators - who dubbed themselves the Corrupt Bastards Club for their cosy relations with Veco - have been indicted in the government 's probe of public corruption in Alaska .
The former chief executive of Veco , Bill Allen , pleaded guilty to bribery last year .
Allen admitted to paying for a lavish remodelling of Stevens 's house and giving the senator 's son more than $ 240,000 in sham " consulting fees " to help secure favourable treatment .
Republicans already face an uphill battle in the November election , poised to lose as many as 40 seats in Congress as John McCain struggles to gain traction against Barack Obama .
Stevens 's indictment makes matters worse for his party , as he is facing re-election and already trailing in the polls to Democratic opponent Mark Begich , the popular mayor of Anchorage , Alaska .
The state has not sent a Democrat to Washington since 1974 .
Political analysts were beginning to acknowledge this summer that Stevens , a fixture in Congress for 40 years , could lose to Begich .
After federal prosecutors announced the indictment , some prognosticators questioned whether the man Alaskans still call Uncle Ted could lose to a little - known Republican foe in the party primary on August 26 .
Stevens is famous through the US for his quest to unlock Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling .
He fought for decades to lift government protections on the refuge , estimated to hold more than 6bn barrels of oil , but never surmounted Democratic opposition .
Stevens solidified his power during eight years in control of the Senate committee that sets federal spending .
He remains adept at securing government money for his home state without public approval , a process known as " earmarking " .
The Alaskan is also famous for his temper , often delivering tirades against critics while wearing a tie printed with the comic - book character known as Incredible Hulk .
Despite Stevens 's irascible persona , Democrats and Republicans alike respect his experience and refrained from criticising him publicly today .
The senator 's office in Washington was not responding to calls on the indictment .
Matthew Friedrich , assistant US attorney general , told reporters that Stevens would be allowed to turn himself in to authorities .
He declined to comment on the possibility of a plea agreement that could spare the senator prison time .

ABC : Obama candid about disagreements with commanders in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 22 , 2008
Print This Email This ABC's Terry Moran interviewed Barack Obama in Baghdad on Monday , pressing him hard on both his support of a timetable for withdrawal and his previous opposition to the surge .
Moran suggested that many of the commanders in Iraq have " deep concerns " about Obama 's plan to withdraw troops on a 16 - month timetable , but Obama cautioned , " I would characterize the concerns differently . "
" I do n't think that they 're deep concerns about the notion of a pullout per se , " he stated .
" There are deep concerns about , from their perspective , a timetable that does n't take into account what they anticipate might be some sort of change in conditions . "
" My job is to think about the national security interests as a whole , " Obama continued , " and to weigh and balance risks in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Their job is just to get the job done here , and I completely understand that .
" What I refuse to do , " Obama insisted , " is to get boxed in to what I consider two false choices .
Which is either I have a rigid timeline of such - and - such a date , come hell or high water ... or , alternatively , I am completely deferring to whatever the commanders on the ground says -- which is what George Bush says he 's doing -- in which case I 'm not doing my job as commander - in - chief . "
Obama added that " Prime Minister Maliki stated that he very much believes that there has to be a timeframe built into whatever agreements are set up between the United States and Iraq but , again , I think his view is that he wants some flexibility in terms of how that 's carried out . "
Moran pointed out that Obama opposed the troop surge when it was announced in February 2007 , saying he did n't think it would make a significant difference .
" Would you say , based on what you see here , that you were wrong ? " asked Moran .
" I did not anticipate ... the convergence of not only the surge but the Sunni Awakening , in which a whole host of Sunni tribal leaders decided they'd had enough with al Qaeda , in the Shia community the militias standing down to some degree , " Obama acknowledged .
" So what you had was a combination of political factors inside of Iraq that then came right at the same time as terrific work by our troops . "
" Had those political factors not occurred , I think my assessment would have been correct , " he insisted .
He pointed out that even without the surge , " the Sunnis might have made the same decision at that time , the Shias might have made similar decisions .
... Nobody has a crystal ball . "
" But it is a question of judgment , is n't it ? " asked Moran .
McCain says his judgment was correct . "
" Except for the fact that in the meantime we 've spent an additional $ 200 - 300 billion dollars , " Obama replied .
" The situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated by every measure .
Al Qaeda is still running loose . "
" If you focus narrowly on the tactics inside of Iraq , then you get one perspective , " Obama emphasized .
" If , on the other hand , your job ... is to make a serious of difficult choices and calculations about what is going to lead to our long - term security , then you get a different perspective .
What I 've been trying to push throughout this campaign is for that broader view . "
" Knowing what you know now , would you support the surge ? "
Moran asked .
" No , " Obama replied firmly , adding that " these kinds of hypotheticals are very difficult . "
" What I am absolutely convinced of is that at that time we had to change the political debate , " Obama concluded .
" We have to win the broader war against terror that threatens American and its interests .
I think that Iraq is one front on that war .
But I think that the central front is in Afghanistan and in the border regions of Pakistan . "

A federal appeals court has overruled a lower court ruling that , if sustained , would have severely hampered the enforceability of free software licenses .
The lower court had found that redistributing software in violation of the terms of a free software license could constitute a breach of contract , but was not copyright infringement .
The difference matters because copyright law affords much stronger remedies against infringement than does contract law .
If allowed to stand , the decision could have neutered popular copyleft licenses such as the GPL and Creative Commons licenses .
The district court decision was overturned on Wednesday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
The copyright holder in the case is Robert Jacobsen , the lead developer of the Java Model Railroad Interface , a software package used by model railroad enthusiasts .
A firm called Kamind Associates downloaded parts of Jacobsen 's project , stripped out the copyright notice and other identifying information , and began redistributing the modified version without Jacobsen 's approval .
JMRI was released under version 1.0 of the Artistic License , which is also widely used in the Perl community .
While not not technically a copyleft license , it gives users broad freedom to use , modify , and redistribute the JMRI software provided that certain conditions are met .
Jacobsen argued that Kamind 's failure to comply with the terms of the license deprived it of any permission to redistribute the software and made it guilty of copyright infringement .
The District Court for the Northern District of California disagreed , holding that the Artistic License granted an " intentionally broad " license to the JMRI software , and that violations of the license terms should be viewed as mere breaches of contract rather than copyright infringement .
Used under GNU Free Documentation License v1.2 Image credit : Daniel Case Used under GNU Free Documentation License v1.2
That matters because copyright holders can typically obtain injunctions against continued use of their works , whereas the winning party in a contract dispute more commonly receives monetary damages .
That 's problematic for free software because it 's difficult to compute the monetary value of software that is given away free of charge .
As a result , many violations of copyleft licenses could have been punished with small fines that would amount to little more than a slap on the wrist .
The decision outraged the free software community and the broader free culture movement .
In December , a broad coalition of organizations that rely on copyleft licenses , including Creative Commons , the Software Freedom Law Center , and the Wikimedia Foundation , filed an amicus brief urging that the ruling be overturned .
The brief , authored by lawyers at Stanford 's Center for Internet and Society , pointed out that there are now hundreds of millions of works released under licenses similar to the Artistic License and suggested that the district court had failed to appreciate the potential consequences of neutering them .
It made the case that the decision could " disrupt settled expectations on which literally millions of individuals , including award winning producers , firms such as IBM , educational institutions such as MIT and Harvard , and even governments have built businesses , educational initiatives , artistic collaborations , and public service projects . "
The Federal Circuit appears to have been heavily influenced by the Stanford brief , as it specifically cited Creative Commons , MIT , Wikipedia , and various free software projects as examples of organizations that benefit from copyleft licenses .
In a short , clearly - reasoned opinion , the Federal Circuit summarized the public benefits of public licensing and found that the district court had dismissed its terms too lightly .
Unlike the lower court , the appeals court seemed to understand that reciprocity lay at the heart of free software licenses .
Just as traditional software firms thrive on the exchange of code for money , free software projects thrive on the exchange of code for code .
The Federal Circuit recognized that " there are substantial benefits , including economic benefits , to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties . "
Allowing those rules to be flaunted undermines the free software model .
Larry Lessig , who founded both Creative Commons and Stanford 's Center for Internet and Society , called the decision " huge and important . "
His reaction is likely to be shared by other advocates of free software , who have long worried about the enforceability of copyleft licenses .
It 's important to distinguish between this case and the other cases on software licensing that Ars has covered recently .
Like this week 's decision , those cases were focused in part on whether copyright licenses would be enforced via contract law or copyright law .
However , there was a crucial difference between those cases and this one : the first - sale doctrine , which says that selling a given copy of a work exhausts the copyright holder 's rights with respect to that copy .
In the previous cases , the dispute was over a single copy of the work — a promo CD in one case and a box of software in the other .
The courts held that no license was needed in those cases because under the first sale doctrine , the lawful owners of those copies did n't need any further permission to use them .
This week 's case , on the other hand , involves a firm that was creating and distributing new copies of a work , a situation in which the first - sale doctrine simply does n't apply .
In keeping with the frenetic , rhetorical ping - pong that has marked virtually every moment of this young general election , Barack Obama gave a big energy policy speech in Las Vegas last month to counter the big energy speech John McCain gave just prior to it .
Obama proposed a substantial federal investment in alternative energy sources , including wind power , solar power and biofuels , and he promised to hike fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks ( though he did n't say by how much ) .
He has already proposed a cap - and - trade scheme with auctions for emissions permits , which are key to making any such scheme work .
( John McCain 's version of cap - and - trade does not include auctions . )
Nuclear power , however , does not figure into Obama 's proposed alternatives to reliance on petroleum .
On the contrary , he used the Las Vegas setting to hammer home , literally , his objection to McCain 's proposal for the construction of 45 new nuclear power plants - a touchy subject in Nevada , given that the only site the US department of energy has designated for the storage of nuclear waste in the continental US ( under the Clinton administration , incidentally ) is the repository at Yucca Mountain , about 130 km from metropolitan Las Vegas .
Now , to be clear , Obama 's energy programme on the whole is a sound and long - overdue , if not terribly ambitious , adjustment in the US approach to fuelling its economy .
McCain 's programme , by contrast , is a counterproductive , incoherent mash .
But on the specific issue of nuclear power , McCain is exactly right , and Obama is badly wrong .
Nuclear power is green in multiple senses .
The most important criterion by which to judge any viable alternative to petroleum is the magnitude of its contribution to global warming .
Well , uranium or petroleum fission produces no carbon emissions whatsoever , since there is no carbon involved .
The cooling process does produce water vapour , but water vapour and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse gases in the same sense that Roger Federer and I are both tennis players ( and water vapour emissions , moreover , can be controlled ) .
The environmental downsides of nuclear power are therefore not any more severe than other alternative energy sources , such as wind or solar power , and are arguably less severe than biofuels like the ethanol that Obama heartily supports .
These energy sources all entail waste heat , produce solid waste and have other drawbacks - but the environmental drawbacks of all of them , nukes included , are quite modest .
From a fiscal perspective , nuclear power enjoys enormous advantages over other environmentally friendly energies .
At their present state of technological development , nuclear reactors can already power large industrial societies .
Wind and solar power are not there yet , and biofuels ( particularly ethanol ) are something of an embarrassing racket , being extraordinarily inefficient and requiring huge government subsidies to be propped up .
The case for nuclear power is even stronger when considering the weakness of the case against it , which rests largely on a series of panics 20 to 30 years old .
For example , the Chernobyl disaster was the product of horrific Soviet mismanagement over the many years prior to the meltdown , followed by equally abysmal crisis management .
It simply had nothing to do with the upkeep challenges of a modern nuclear plant .
Worries about the impact of radioactive waste , by contrast , are at least marginally connected to real features of current nuclear plants , but they are wildly overblown .
For one thing , the vast majority of nuclear waste - as much as 95 % or more - can be reprocessed and reused , making it a truly renewable resource .
For another , the technology required to render radioactive waste inert and harmless already exists , and it ought to be largely perfected by the time any new plants go online .
Then there are the silly and borderline mystical grounds for opposition to nuclear power , about which the less said the better ( but let 's be indulgent ) .
Nuclear power plants , as the anti-nuclear movement frequently points out , use the same fuel sources and much of the same science as nuclear weapons .
But that makes them as much like nuclear weapons as heart medications containing nitroglycerin are like dynamite .
Alternatively , some anti-nuclear activists treat all nuclear technology as some sort of inherent transgression against nature .
That argument relies on deeply reactionary concepts of " naturalness " and " unnaturalness " that also form the basis of opposition to any number of technologies that improve the quality of human life in countless ways .
The argument against nuclear power as unnatural deserves no more or less respect than the arguments against childhood vaccination and stem - cell research as unnatural .
Whatever else can be said about them , such sentiments have precious little to do with environmentalism .
Obama , however , brushed aside nuclear power as a policy option in approximately one half of one sentence in his speech , on grounds different from and even worse than any of the foregoing .
McCain's " proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at Yucca Mountain " makes no sense , Obama told the Las Vegas crowd .
But did Obama propose some other site for storing nuclear waste or offer some further argument against nuclear power ?
No , he just dropped the subject .
In other words , even as he rightly mocked the risible gimmicks McCain has cobbled together as an ersatz energy policy , Obama 's opposition to nuclear energy , in its entirety , is nothing more than a naked pander for Nevada 's five electoral votes .
For a politician ostensibly committed to environmentalism in general and curbing global warming in particular , omitting nuclear power from his energy programme - let alone doing so on no principle higher than grabbing votes - is irresponsible .
