Colbert : ' How dare you ' ask questions of a POW ?
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 16 , 2008

This " Folks , I 've never been a fan giving answers , " a satirical Stephen Colbert opened .
" And you want to know why ?
... Too bad . "
The Bush administration , he said , has " avoided giving answers to the American people by claiming executive privilege , ignoring subpoenas , feigning ignorance , and mesmerizing critics with the power of dance .
But now there is so much talk of change in the air these days that my fear is that the next administration will have to give answers .
Luckily , John McCain and Sarah Palin are bringing the best possible kind of change .
They 're not only saying they wo n't give answers -- they 're saying you can't ask questions . "
" McCain himself is famously reticent about his Vietnam experience , " Colbert added .
" He only mentions it when people ask unrelated questions . "
A helpful " Mad Lib , " as provided by the McCain campaign , reads : " How dare you question John McCain on ( noun that 's bothering you ) .
When he was a POW , he did n't have ( same noun ) . "
A new dimension to McCain 's " unquestionability " has been added to his campaign now that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has joined the ticket , with pundits and anchors calling " sexism . "
" It is sexist , " Colbert said of questioning the Governor .
" And we should know -- we 've been feminists for over two weeks now ! "
The entire segment is available to view below , as broadcast on Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report on September 15 , 2008 .

Autopsies usually point to a cause of death but now a study of brain tissue collected during these procedures , may explain an underlying cause of major depression and suicide .
The international research group , led by Dr. Michael O. Poulter of Robarts Research Institute at The University of Western Ontario and Dr. Hymie Anisman of the Neuroscience Research Institute at Carleton University , is the first to show that proteins that modify DNA directly are more highly expressed in the brains of people who commit suicide .
These proteins are involved in chemically modifying DNA in a process called epigenomic regulation .
The paper is published in Biological Psychiatry .
The researchers compared the brains of people who committed suicide with those of a control group who died suddenly , from heart attacks and other causes .
They found that the genome in depressed people who had committed suicide was chemically modified by a process that is normally involved in regulating the essential characteristics of all cells in the body .
As Poulter explains , " We have about 40,000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on .
The remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called DNA methylation . "
The rate of methylation in the suicide brains was found to be much greater than that of the control group .
Importantly , one of the genes they studied was shown to be heavily chemically modified and its expression was reduced .
This particular gene plays a major role in regulating brain activity .
" Interestingly , the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse , and this fits with depression , " says Poulter .
" The whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising .
Finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual , " says Poulter , who is also a professor in the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Western 's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry .
" These observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions . "
The research was funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
Desiree Rogers Named White House Social Secretary ( PHOTOS )
Desiree Rogers , 49 , is President - elect Barack Obama 's pick for White House Social Secretary .
A Chicago friend of the Obama family , she is currently chief of online community development for Allstate Financial , serving as president of social networking .
The Wellsley College graduate previously served as CEO of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas in Chicago and before that she directed the Illinois State Lottery .
Rogers ' former husband , John W. Rogers , has also been tapped by the President - elect and will serve as Co-chair of Obama 's Inauguration .
He is a former team mate of Michelle Obama 's brother Craig Robinson on the Princeton University basketball team .
UPDATE : Rogers was at the center of a controversy that erupted after the White House State Dinner on November 24 , 2009 .
Michaele Salahi and Tariq Salahi crashed the event by slipping through security , even though they were not on the guest list .
A subsequent congressional hearing held on December 2 , 2009 was called to look into the allegations .
The White House refused to send Rogers to testify .
Things heated up during a December 3rd press briefing when the discuss turned to Rogers and the public 's perception that she is acting like the ' belle of the ball ' , completely overshadowing Michelle Obama at the State Dinner .
April Ryan , White House correspondent for American Urban Radio got into a war of words with press secretary Robert Gibbs over the subject - check out the video here .

Less than a day on IE8 I ’m really getting frustrated .
It ’s not IE8 ’s fault of course , but the majority of sites I visit have problems rendering ( my own included ) .
Yes , it is up to the site owners to fix their sites , and yes they should have been more standards compliant in the first place , etc , etc , but hey , then there ’s reality !
Anyway , I ’m going to try and stick with IE8 ( at least for longer than I did last time ) – let ’s see how long I last .
One thing that will help is to turn on Compatibility mode for all sites by default .
It ’s under the Tools menu :
Turn it on here :
There are other quirks I ’m experiencing ( eg my own site hangs in IE8 when switching between pages , even in Compatibility mode ) which I need to investigate .
Minimising and then restoring seems to fix the hang – bizarre .
Happiness rating so far : 1/10
In " AIG Is A Fracking BLACK HOLE , " we noted that AIG CEO Edward Liddy has admitted that the company may need even more than the $ 123 billion US taxpayers have already promised to provide collateral for its credit default insurance bets .
We wondered lightheartedly whether AIG 's losses were potentially infinite .
Well , are they ?
Has anyone out there had a good look at AIG 's gambling book ?
Our understanding of credit default swaps is rudimentary , but here 's what we 're wondering about :
AIG was free to write as many insurance contracts as it wanted on the same company 's debt , right ?
It was n't subject to , say , regulations or anything .
So let 's say the company in question goes bankrupt or defaults on its debt .
If AIG has written 1,000 contracts insuring the same $ 1,000 bond against default , it will be out $ 1 million , right ?
No biggie .
But what if 10 companies go bankrupt , each with $ 10 billion of debt , and AIG has written 1,000 contracts on each company 's debt ?
That would be $ 10 trillion of losses , right ?
That 's getting close to the size of the US economy .
We hope ( pray ) that AIG's " risk control " people considered not this eventuality ( because we know AIG could n't care less about the " system " ) but the eventuality that its own shareholders would have to cover some big losses ... and therefore put some limits on how much exposure it could take to any one company .
But did they limit the exposure AIG was taking to the entire economy ?
What likelihood did AIG's " risk models " place on the possibility that , say , 25 major financial companies would go bust ?
Can any AIG or CDS aficionados out there enlighten us ?
( While you 're at it , please explain why Hank Paulson does n't just rip all those insurance contracts up ) .

In the last few days , employees of Lehman Brothers have wrung their hands as the value of their stock evaporated before their eyes .
Now , many fear losing their jobs , too .
In scenes eerily reminiscent of the final days of Bear Stearns , the megawatt energy within Lehman Brothers has dimmed to a hum as employees focus on the fate of the firm and what it might mean to them .
To make matters worse , pink slips for previously announced layoffs were being handed out this week .
“ Everyone is walking around like they have just been Tasered , ” said one Lehman employee , who , like many interviewed for this article , declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk publicly .
“ Everyone was always hoping we would pull through .
Now , that is not really an option . ”
On Lehman ’s third - and fourth - floor trading floors overlooking Broadway ’s lights in Midtown Manhattan , traders continued working at their terminals , or at least were giving the appearance of doing so .
At the same time , many polished their résumés and contacted recruiters .

A month after asteroid 2008 TC3 hit the Earth ’s atmosphere , the first ground - based image of the event has surfaced on the Internet .
Admittedly , it ’s not the fireball everyone has been waiting to see , but it is visual evidence that something hit us above Sudan on October 7th .
The image above was taken from a frame of video that was being recorded by Mr. Mohamed Elhassan Abdelatif Mahir in the dawn following the asteroid impact with the atmosphere .
The smoky feature is the remnant of the fireball as the 3 meter - wide asteroid blasted through the upper atmosphere , eventually exploding .
The long - lasting persistent train is seen hanging in the air , high altitude winds causing it to twist in the morning sunlight .
We may not have a dazzling fireball re-entry video of 2008 TC3 , but this striking image provides the first ground - based evidence of the direct hit , and may help refine the search for any meteorites from the disintegrated asteroid …
Although details are sketchy , it would appear that a person on the ground observed the skies of Sudan shortly after 2008 TC3 exploded in the upper atmosphere .
It is unclear whether the observer was part of a meteorite - hunting team , or a Sudanese resident videoing the scene , but it is very fortunate he captured this footage .
Dr. Muawia H. Shaddad of the University of Karthoum communicated this single frame , and the picture is being showcased as the November 8th NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day .
It is currently the only ground - based evidence that something hit the Earth at the right time and right location as predicted by scientists using the Mount Lemmon telescope in Arizona as part of the NASA - funded Catalina Sky Survey for near - Earth objects .
However , as Nancy reported on October 13th , indirect support for an atmospheric fireball came from a webcam on a beach in Egypt .
Also , at 02:43 UTC on that Tuesday morning , an infrasound array in Kenya detected an explosion in the atmosphere ( with an energy equivalent of 1.1 –2.1 kT of TNT ) .
These observations were backed up by the European weather satellite METEOSAT - 8 , capturing the fireball from orbit .
The pilot of a KLM airliner also witnessed a bright flash , 750 miles from the impact location .
This was the first time that an asteroid has been discovered before it hit the Earth , thereby proving an early - warning system for future asteroid impacts is possible .
Although there are 5 - 10 space rock collision events per year , this is the first time we knew something about it before it happened .
This is an amazing achievement as 2008 TC3 was only 3 meters in diameter .
To aid the search for any 2008 TC3 debris , SpaceWeather.com is hoping this image of the aftermath of the October 7th impact will jog any potential witness memories of the African skies a month ago :
Readers , were you in Sudan on Oct. 7th ?
Send your fireball reports and photos to meteor expert Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute .
Your data could improve the chances of recovering meteorites .

In the wake of the launch of Ubuntu 8.10 , Mark Shuttleworth - the founder of the Ubuntu project and the chief executive officer of Canonical , the commercial entity behind Ubuntu - hosted a conference call with the press and analyst community .
And in that call , Shuttleworth , who is not afraid to shell out money for a good cause - such as the $ 20 m he paid to be the second tourist in space , via a Russian Soyuz mission - made it clear that he is perfectly happy to fund Ubuntu until it gets on its own financial two feet .
Canonical is a private company , one that was founded in 2004 , after Shuttleworth came back down to earth .
While most of you know this , many of you may not know that Shuttleworth is the founder of Thawte , a South African company that became the biggest seller of digital certificates and was sold to VeriSign for $ 575 m in stock in 1999 .
Shuttleworth 's net worth is not known , but he clearly can afford to indulge in the Ubuntu effort , and he made no apologies for where the company is at in terms of growth and sales and his continuing personal investments in Ubuntu .
" We continue to require investment .
I can continue to be careful with my pennies as I make what I consider to be a good investment , " Shuttleworth said in the call .
He explained that Canonical - which has more than 200 employees in Europe , North America , and Taiwan - was not cash flow positive .
But he said it could be if the company focused on its core desktop and server products and did not make investments that Shuttleworth and his Canonical team as well as the larger Ubuntu community deem necessary for the long - term success of Ubuntu .
It is clear that Shuttleworth wants to make these investments .
He said that Canonical had " several million dollars " in annual revenues derived from support and related services for the Ubuntu distribution , but that he had " no objection to funding the business for the next three to five years . "
Shuttleworth added that the company could be positive in two years , but that it will probably take longer than that , given the investments that needed to make Ubuntu more pervasive on both the server and the desktop .
So , what metrics does Shuttleworth use to gauge his investments ?
More human ones than perhaps we are used to hearing about .
" We have customers coming back and new customers knocking on the door , " Shuttleworth explained .
While the exact numbers for Ubuntu adoption are unclear , adoption rates - which Canonical gets anecdotally and from numbers it gets from application software vendors like Alfresco Software or IT box counters like IDC - are on the rise , and this is a key metric .
( This is the same metric that Sun Microsystems ' president and chief executive officer Jonathan Schwartz cites as Sun 's success for Solaris 10 and Java .
But as a public company , Sun has a duty to actually get revenues and make money - unlike privately held Canonical , which is on a mission that is cultural more than economic ) .
The uptake of Ubuntu by third - party makers of IT gear in Asia is another key metric Shuttleworth is using , and Canonical is working with the top ten ODMs in Asia , although not all of them have Ubuntu - based products .
Yet .
Precise Ubuntu installed base numbers are impossible to obtain , but Shuttleworth said the most recent estimate is about 8 million users for the Linux variant .
Ubuntu does not have any call - home features to help Canonical count installations .
That 's because Shuttleworth does not want to violate users ' privacy or put up any barriers to adoption for the software .
" We actually have no idea , " Shuttleworth admitted .
On the server front , IDC did a survey in 2007 that showed that 20 per cent of large US companies had Ubuntu installed .
Other IDC estimates give Ubuntu about a 3 per cent share of the server operating system racket , by box count ( certainly not revenue ) .
A survey that Canonical did as part of the 8.04 LTS release this year - which had over 100,000 responses - indicated that about 25 per cent of those polled had Ubuntu supporting production applications .
This is pretty good for a Linux variant that was really aimed at the desktop when it launched in 2004 and a server platform that is only a little more than two years old .
With the launch of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS ( Long Term Support ) - which gives servers support for five years and desktops for three years instead of the normal 18 - month support life for an Ubuntu release and the kicker 8.04 LTS release earlier this year - Canonical has done a pretty good job getting its foot in the data center door .
" We see a surprising amount of non-LTS releases on servers , " said Shuttleworth , and that is because the quicker release cycle of the normal Ubuntu releases allows it to run on the latest - greatest iron and deliver the most current practical support for virtualization features .
The final metric Shuttleworth is using as he guides the Ubuntu distribution and pushes the Canonical business is the happiness and satisfaction users have with the distro .
It is hard to put a dollar value on this , unless you count the software that companies do n't buy when they are happy with the Ubuntu distribution .
When asked if anyone can make money selling a desktop Linux , Shuttleworth was blunt and candid .
" No . I do n't think anybody can .
And that is a good thing . "
The revenue model that Shuttleworth had when he created the Ubuntu project and the Canonical support organization was to give away the software and patches and rely on tech support and other services that are required by some users and businesses to generate the revenues that give people at Canonical their jobs .
" It is at the heart of our philosophy to not make money on the desktop . "
And in this , Shuttleworth believes that Canonical is on the leading edge of the software industry , and that all software suppliers - including Microsoft - will have to shift away from licensing bits to selling services to make their daily bread . ®

Malaysia 's top Islamic body fresh from banning tomboys has issued an edict that prohibits Muslims from practicing yoga , saying that elements of Hinduism in the ancient Indian exercise could corrupt them .
The National Fatwa Council 's chairman , Abdul Shukor Husin , said on Saturday many Muslims fail to understand that yoga 's ultimate aim is to be one with a god of a different religion — an explanation disputed by many practitioners who say yoga need not have a religious element .
" We are of the view that yoga , which originates from Hinduism , combines physical exercise , religious elements , chanting and worshipping for the purpose of achieving inner peace and ultimately to be one with god , " Abdul Shukor said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
News of the yoga ban prompted activist Marina Mahathir to wonder what the council will ban next : " What next ?
Gyms ?
Most gyms have men and women together .
Will that not be allowed any more ? "
The edict reflects the growing influence of conservative Islam in Malaysia , a multiethnic country of 27 million people where the majority Muslim Malays lost seats in March elections and where minority ethnic Chinese and mostly Hindu ethnic Indians have been clamoring for more rights .
Recently , the council said girls who act like boys violate Islam 's tenets .
The government has also occasionally made similar conservative moves , banning the use of the word " Allah " by non-Muslims earlier this year , saying it would confuse Muslims .

Voter Protection Nutshells :
These publications are part of a series intended to distill complex election law for lawyers , advocates , voter registration campaigns and " Get Out the Vote " campaigns .
They combine state election law with state regulations , rules , attorney general opinions and other election materials to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the law and practices that impact elections .
While these publications do not cover every provision of state election law , they highlight those provisions , which , in our experience , have most impacted the voting rights of minority voters .
Advancement Project publishes these nutshells with local law firms and lawyers as part of our " Voter Protection Program " project .
We encourage our partners to use these legal guides in support of local , on the ground voter protection efforts in advance of Election Day . [ 20 ]

Python is a very - high - level language .
That makes it easy to write code quickly , but the program may not be as fast as a program compiled from a lower - level language .
For this reason , many scientific programs are written in Fortran or C ++.
However , it has always been my experience that the majority of time on a project is spent in writing , modifiying , and debugging code , rather than executing .
Fortunately , if written correctly , the time - critical parts of Python code can execute almost as fast as compiled software .
Here is an example of a collision - detection algorithm which achieved almost a ten - fold increase in speed when written to use Numpy .
# Oldest , slowest method for j in range ( 0,i ) : if ( ( x- self.x[j ] ) *( x - self.x[j ] ) + ( y - self.y[j ] ) *( y - self.y[j ] ) + ( z - self.z[j ] ) *( z - self.z[j ] ) )
< R_squared : return True for j in range ( i+1, len( self.x ) ) : if ( ( x- self.x[j ] ) *( x - self.x[j ] ) + ( y - self.y[j ] ) *( y - self.y[j ] ) + ( z - self.z[j ] ) *( z - self.z[j ] ) )
< R_squared : return True return False
This code starts with lists of the coordinates ( self.x , self.y , self .z ) of identical spheres in three - dimensional space .
A sphere “ i ” is moved to a new location ( x , y,z ) , and we need to know if it collides with any of the other spheres .
This algorithm uses the Pythagorean Theorem to compute the center - to - center distance between spheres .
If this distance is less than twice the sphere radius , then the new sphere intersects with one of the old ones , so we return “ True , ” otherwise return “ False . ”
We loop through every sphere in the list ( except for the current one ) and test for a collision .
Now , we will perform the same operation using Numpy :
if i>0 : d2 = ( x - self .x [ 0 :i ] ) *( x - self . x [ 0:i ] ) + ( y - self .y [ 0 : i ] ) *( y - self .y [ 0:i ] ) + ( z - self . z [ 0 : i ] ) *( z - self . z [ 0 :i ] ) if min( d2 ) < R_squared : return True if i+1 < len( self.x ) : d2 = ( x - self.x[i+1:len( self.x ) ] ) *( x - self.x[i+1:len( self .x ) ] ) + ( y - self.y[i+1:len( self.x ) ] ) *( y - self.y[i+1:len( self .x ) ] ) + ( z - self.z[i+1:len( self.x ) ] ) *( z - self.z[i+1:len( self.x ) ] ) if min( d2 ) < R_squared : return True
The basic collision detection test remains the same , but now the math is implemented using Numpy operaters on Numpy arrays .
Notice that the loops are gone–Numpy operators can operate element - by - element on an array so that an entire “ for ” loop can be written in one line .
Not only is the syntax cleaner , but it in this case , it sped up the code by almost a factor of ten !
Numpy is written in C and carefully optimized to perform fast operations on arrays .
When you need to operate on a whole array , the operations take place at the speed of compiled C. Note that I had to add some “ if ” statements to avoid creating zero-element arrays for the cases i=0 and i=len( array ) - 1 .
I ’m going to speculate on another reason why Numpy might be so much faster : the compiled Numpy code can take advantage of parallel execution in the CPU .
Modern CPUs have some level of instruction - level parallel execution , even within a single core .
A good compiler will find sections of code that do n’t have to run sequentially , and compile them in a way that takes advantage of this .
The collision detection is great example of code that can be executed in parallel–whether or not sphere “ i ” collides with sphere “ i - 1 ” has nothing to do with whether or not it collides with sphere “ i+1 . ”
Here is an extensive example of how to optimize numerical operations in Python .
Fathers and husbands who openly hire assassins on the streets of the city are going unpunished
Authorities in the southern Iraqi city of Basra have admitted they are powerless to prevent ' honour killings ' in the city following a 70 per cent increase in religious murders during the past year .
There has been no improvement in conviction rates for these killings .
So far this year , 81 women in the city have been murdered for allegedly bringing shame on their families .
Only five people have been convicted .
During 2007 the Basra security committee recorded 47 ' honour killings ' and three convictions .
One lawyer in the city described how police were actively protecting perpetrators and said that a woman in Basra could now be murdered by hired hitmen for as little as $ 100 ( £ 65 ) .
The figures come despite international outrage which followed The Observer 's coverage of the death of 17 - year - old Rand Abdel - Qader , who was murdered by her father last April in an ' honour killing ' after falling in love with a British soldier in Basra .
The 4,000 British troops stationed in the city since the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 withdrew to the airport last September .
Rand Abdel - Qader was killed after her family discovered that she had formed a friendship with a 22 - year - old infantryman whom she knew as Paul .
She was suffocated by her father then hacked at with a knife .
Abdel - Qader Ali was subsequently arrested and released without charge .
Rand 's mother , Leila Hussein , who divorced her husband after the killing , went into hiding but was tracked down weeks later and assassinated by an unknown gunman .
Her husband had told The Observer that police had congratulated him for killing his daughter .
Seven months after the murders , the problem of these killings in Basra has become worse , according to lawyers .
Ali Azize Raja'a , an Iraqi prosecutor who has represented the victims of 32 ' honour killings ' since 2004 , said that , despite accumulating sufficient evidence to prove who was responsible in each murder , he had won only one case .
He said that the greatest issue was the decision by police to release suspects .
Seven in 10 of those thought to be responsible for such a killing have left the city , with little attempt made to track them down .
The father of Rand is also understood to have left Basra .
He was held by police in connection with his daughter 's murder for only two hours .
A local businessman who described the actions of Rand 's father as ' courageous ' is believed to have given a considerable sum of money to him and his two sons , who disowned their mother after she objected to Rand 's killing .
Raja 'a said that when he was approached by Leila over Rand 's case , his family was threatened by relatives .
Another Iraqi lawyer , who requested anonymity , said that some fathers had started to hire professional hitmen to carry out ' honour killings ' which were then covered as ' sectarian murders ' .
He said : ' The life of these women is n't higher than $ 100 .
You can find a killer standing in any coffee shop of Basra , discussing prices of a life as if he was buying a piece of meat . '
Mariam Ayub Sattar , an activist in Basra , said that any woman caught speaking to a man in public who was not her husband or a relative was considered a prostitute and punished .
A fortnight ago three women were burned with acid while walking through a market in Basra after stopping to speak to a male friend , Sattar said .
Nine of the 12 voluntary organisations helping women in Basra have closed down since the US - led invasion .
The Women 's Rights Association in Basra was forced to close down after death threats were made following the murder of Rand 's mother last May .
Two women from a voluntary organisation who had been helping her to hide from her husband were also injured .
Alia 'a Obeidi , the organisation 's president , said that one of her colleagues was killed while driving to work and , fearing for her family 's safety , she later moved to the Kurdish region in northern Iraq .
The Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights said that it was working on new projects to end gender discrimination in the country .
' We try to make a difference by teaching students at schools about gender equality , but it only will be possible when parents do n't teach the opposite at home , ' said Hameed Walled , senior official in the Ministry of Human Rights .
Gunmen have launched co-ordinated attacks at several sites in the Indian city of Mumbai , killing scores of people .
Warning : Some of the following images contain graphic content .
Among the targets were two of the city 's luxury hotels , taken over by gunmen who entered shooting indiscriminately , witnesses said .
At the Taj Mahal Palace , fire engulfed part of the top floor .
As the injured were taken to hospital following the attacks , an explosion was heard inside the second hotel , the Oberoi - Trident .
Some people trapped in the hotels were forced to climb down using curtains or jump to safety .
On Thursday , police placed snipers on the rooftops of surrounding buildings and there were reports of continuing exchanges of fire .
Security forces managed to free some people from the hotels , but the stand - off continued throughout the day .
As the commandos combed through the hotels , people on the street looked on .
Meanwhile , relatives of victims of the attacks grieved as they waited to pick up bodies from a hospital .
Mumbai 's main railway station was also hit .
People fled the huge terminus leaving their luggage when gunmen opened fire .
Ten people were killed .
A previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility , but correspondents say this could be a hoax or an assumed name for another group .
The attacks were condemned by governments around the world , including the US and UK , whose citizens were among those apparently targeted by the gunmen .
Security forces declared the siege at the Taj Mahal Palace over , although the sound of explosions was still being reported .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Freddie Mac is considering raising capital by selling as much as $ 10 billion in new shares to investors , the Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter .
The move , which comes as emergency regulatory actions have triggered a two - day rebound in its stock , would have the potential to avoid a full - blown government rescue for Freddie FRE , - 0.64 % and Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % .
Richard Syron , Freddie 's chief executive , told the Journal : " We 're considering the full array of options before us ...
We 're not at the stage of talking about the exact when . "

First , Deborah Landvik - Fellner ’s hair started falling out .
Then her speech began to slur and her memory grew unreliable .
Her heart started fluttering , and her hands shook .
One day she walked out of the supermarket and woke up surrounded by a crowd of people .
She ’d collapsed in the parking lot for no apparent reason .
Landvik - Fellner , then 45 , went to one doctor , then another , and another .
None could figure out what was wrong .
Finally , in 2004 , after five years of weird symptoms , her husband Mike saw a TV show about a man who was poisoning his business partner with mercury , a potent toxin that can damage the heart , nervous system , and kidneys .
The business partner ’s symptoms — shaky hands , staggering gait — reminded Mike of his wife ’s .
On a lark , he suggested that she have her blood tested .
When the results came back , they were both stunned : 48 parts per billion of mercury , nearly 10 times what the Environmental Protection Agency says is safe .
A few Google searches later , the Fellners , who own an auto shop in Rockaway , New Jersey , had solved Deborah ’s health mystery .
For some 12 years , she ’d been eating a can of albacore tuna every day , because it was one of the few foods that did n’t exacerbate her Crohn ’s disease .
( Her family , of Norwegian extraction , consumed a lot of fish anyway .
“ We ’d think nothing of putting a piece of cod on a piece of flatbread for breakfast . ” )
She ’d never realized that most tuna sold in the United States is contaminated with the toxic heavy metal — some up to double the epa ‘s safety benchmark .
Landvik - Fellner stopped eating tuna , and within about a year , her symptoms began to subside .
But by now she was angry , and confused .
If eating tuna could make your hair fall out , should n’t the label tell you so ?
In 2006 , she filed a lawsuit against Tri-Union Seafoods , parent company of Chicken of the Sea , alleging that the company had violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud
Act by failing to disclose that its product contained mercury .
“ Toxic tort ” cases are notoriously hard to win , and Landvik - Fellner faced long odds against the deep - pocketed industry .
That much she knew .
What she did n’t anticipate was that her biggest obstacle would turn out to be the US Food and Drug Administration — the very agency responsible for protecting the public from mercury in the first place .
tuna is big business .
Americans eat nearly three pounds of canned tuna per capita every year , making it the nation ’s second most popular seafood ( behind shrimp ) .
The government promotes it via school lunch programs , wic ( the federal food program for poor women and children ) , and even in the fda and US Department of Agriculture dietary recommendations .
It ’s a staple of low - carb diets .
Bodybuilders binge on it .
Low in fat , high in protein , canned tuna contains lots of omega - 3 fatty acids that are thought to protect against heart disease and boost brain development early in life .
Some tuna cans come stamped with the American Heart Association seal of approval .
But thanks to emissions from power plants and garbage incinerators , tuna also absorbs significant amounts of methylmercury , a form of mercury that concentrates in the fatty tissues of big fish and humans .
Fatal in high doses , mercury at lower levels has been linked to heart disease in older men and developmental problems in babies .
Tuna is not the highest - mercury fish we eat — that honor belongs to swordfish and tilefish — but it is by far the most widely consumed .
“ Tuna is the largest source of mercury in the diet because people eat so much of it , ” says Edward Groth , a scientist who has written a report on mercury in fish for the environmental groups Oceana and Mercury Policy Project .
None of this is news to federal regulators .
In 1970 , a New York chemistry professor tested a can of tuna in his pantry and discovered that it contained significantly more mercury than what the fda then considered safe .
After running tests of its own , the agency recalled nearly 1 million cans of tuna .
It also issued an “ action level ” under which fish with more than 0.5 parts per million ( ppm ) of methylmercury could be pulled from the market .
An action level is not a regulation .
It does n’t require anyone to do anything .
Even so , the fishing industry found the new benchmark so intolerable that it sued the fda .
In 1979 , drawing mostly on a National Marine Fisheries Service assessment that relaxing the guideline would “ provide economic benefit ” to industry , the fda doubled the level to 1 ppm , making it twice as high as what the epa ( which issues mercury advisories for anglers ) and the European Union consider safe .
The action level in China is 0.3 ppm—more than three times more stringent than the fda ‘s .
( Tuna often exceeds even the weak US standard :
In 2006 , for instance , the group Defenders of Wildlife tested cans of tuna straight out of grocery stores and found that 1 in 20 , particularly those imported from Latin America , had mercury above the fda action level and could , in theory , be pulled from the shelves . )
After its initial burst of activity in the 1970s , the fda seemed to lose interest in tuna .
In the 1990s , it even stopped its occasional tests of store - bought fish .
But after years of criticism from environmental groups and scientists , it drafted an advisory in 2000 that warned pregnant women about mercury .
The original draft listed canned tuna as a high - mercury product .
But then , fda officials met privately with representatives of the country ’s three largest tuna companies ( Bumble Bee , Tri-Union , and StarKist ) , the US Tuna Foundation , and the National Food Processors Association .
The companies were very worried .
The Tuna Foundation had warned the agency in private meetings that including canned tuna in the mercury advisory could cause sales to plummet nearly 25 percent , and that seafood producers “ would face the distinct possibility of numerous class action lawsuits . ” fda focus groups also suggested that tuna consumption would fall .
Sure enough , the final advisory — released after President Bush had taken office — did n’t include canned tuna .
When the fda failed to come through on tougher regulations , some states stepped up with more stringent warnings .
Washington , for example , warns that children under six should eat no more than half a can of albacore a week .
Scientists , doctors , and environmental groups also continued to urge the fda to adopt more stringent federal warnings based on the epa ‘s reference dose for safe mercury exposure .
In 2003 , the fda did revise the mercury advisory for several kinds of fish , but again it bent the science to accommodate the industry ’s interests .
Clark Carrington , an fda official , told the agency ’s Food Advisory Committee that in drawing up three categories for fish — high , medium , and low mercury — agency staffers had crafted the boundaries so that canned light tuna would end up in the low mercury group “ in order to keep the market share at a reasonable level . ”
( Canned light represents some 75 percent of the US tuna market ; the rest is albacore , or white tuna , which tends to be higher in mercury . )
The new fda advisory warned pregnant and nursing women to eat no more than 6 ounces of albacore , and no more than 12 ounces of chunk light tuna , per week .
The fda recommended following the same guidelines for children , with the vague suggestion that they eat “ smaller portions . ”
A 44 - pound preschooler who follows the fda guideline would consume four times the mercury the epa considers safe .
The fda relayed its advisory mostly through brochures in doctors ’ offices , never requiring warnings in stores or on tuna cans .
Still , the industry has blamed the advisory for a 10 percent drop in sales within a year , and it ’s worked hard to mute the message .
In 2005 , the tuna companies launched a $ 25 million campaign to counteract the fda ‘s advisory , with full - page newspaper ads touting the brain - building benefits of omega - 3 fatty acids ( “ Tuna : A Smart Catch ” ) and reassuring women that “ No government study has ever found unsafe levels of mercury in women or young children who eat canned tuna . ”
( True , but none has ever looked . )
David Burney , then the executive director of the US Tuna Foundation , told the New York Times in 2005 that his wife ate a can of albacore tuna almost every day while pregnant , and that his nine - year - old triplets ate several cans of albacore a week .
The US Tuna Foundation ( which recently merged with the National Fisheries Institute ) also enlisted spokespeople such as celebrity pediatrician Dr. Lillian Beard , who earned $ 6,000 a month for two days of work promoting canned tuna , plus $ 10,000 to serve on a nutrition advisory council for six months .
In October 2004 , Beard wrote a column in Pediatric News that suggested giving children “ a little warm milk or tuna fish before bedtime ” to help make them sleepy .
She made no mention of her industry ties .
The US Tuna Foundation also underwrote science to help make its case , in one instance picking up nearly the entire $ 500,000 cost of a 2005 Harvard Center for Risk Analysis study and using the results to suggest that Americans were n’t eating enough fish .
The Center for Consumer Freedom , a nonprofit founded by the tobacco industry to fight restaurant smoking bans , similarly rose in tuna ’s defense , creating a website , FishScam.com , that claims the fda standards are actually overcautious .
Meanwhile , reporters who have written about mercury in tuna have found themselves in hot water with the industry .
The National Fisheries Institute and the US Tuna Foundation have waged aggressive and public attacks on people like Marian Burros at the New York Times ( who earlier this year published a story warning of mercury in sushi tuna ) and Larry Wheeler at USA Today .
When I contacted the Fisheries Institute , its spokesman , Gavin Gibbons , first grilled me about whether this story had been prompted by an environmental group ( it was n’t ) and then warned that all our conversations would be recorded and the transcripts posted on the organization ’s website , along with any correspondence .
In response to my specific questions , Gibbons emailed that linking high blood mercury levels to any kind of symptoms “ is an unproven assertion that flies in the face of independent and proven scientific knowledge about canned tuna and all seafood ’s proven benefits
…
It is irresponsible to perpetuate anecdotal tales of high seafood consumption causing health concerns when those types of stories contradict published science showing the health benefits of eating fish at least twice per week . ”
luke lindley is one of the people Gibbons says it would be irresponsible to write about .
As an undergrad at Stanford , the now - 24 - year - old medical student was “ deeply immersed ” in bodybuilding , so he ate “ tuna for breakfast , tuna for lunch , tuna for dinner ” for years .
In 2003 , he began having trouble with his memory .
His hair fell out and he suffered gastrointestinal problems so severe he ended up taking a year off med school .
Finally — after seeing a news report on mercury in tuna — he asked his doctor to test a sample of his hair .
According to another doctor who reviewed the records , it had mercury levels higher than in any patient the doctor had ever seen .
“ I thought I was eating a low - fat , healthy diet , ” says Lindley .
“ As it turned out , I was ingesting enough mercury to make my hair fall out . ”
Dr. Jane Hightower has made something of a cottage industry out of treating fish consumers suffering from elevated mercury levels .
In 2003 the San Francisco physician published a paper in Environmental Health Perspectives after surveying her entire patient load and testing more than 100 people whose questionnaires suggested they consumed a lot of fish .
The majority had blood mercury levels well above what the epa considers safe .
One was a 10 - year - old named Matthew Davis who suffered serious neurological problems his doctors suspected were from the three to six ounces of canned albacore he ate daily .
His fingers curled involuntarily , and his hands shook when he tried to write .
The problems mostly resolved after he quit eating tuna .
Dr. Michael Gochfeld , a professor in environmental and occupational health sciences at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey , says that mercury poisoning from fish is probably underreported because doctors do n’t know to look for it .
His clinic at the medical school , he says , has been seeing more cases — at least half a dozen a year .
People come in complaining of slurred speech , clumsiness , and vision problems .
“ It is usually related to fish , ” he says .
Yet , like the tuna industry , the fda says there ’s nothing to worry about .
“ There are no confirmed cases of adverse effects from methylmercury in commercial fish in the United States , ” says Stephanie Kwisnek , an fda spokeswoman .
“ There are infrequent anecdotal reports in the media that are virtually impossible to confirm .
The fda does not track them on any kind of a formal basis . ”
deborah landvik - fellner ’s Chicken of the Sea lawsuit should have been fairly straightforward .
That she ate a lot of canned tuna is indisputable , as is the fact that she had steeply elevated levels of mercury in her blood .
Whether mercury caused all of her symptoms , whether Tri-Union ought to be held responsible for the effects of what they call her “ abnormal consumption , ” even the definition of “ abnormal , ” are the kind of disputed facts usually left to a jury .
But so far , Landvik - Fellner has n’t come anywhere near a jury — in good part because the Bush fda has worked to protect industry from claims like hers .
In the Landvik - Fellner case , Tri-Union has used an increasingly popular legal strategy , arguing that her claim was “ preempted ” by federal law .
The argument goes like this :
If a product is regulated by the federal government , however weakly , consumers should n’t be allowed to sue — and states should be prohibited from passing regulations or issuing health and safety warnings more stringent than the feds ’ .
But Tri-Union went one step further .
It argued that Landvik - Fellner ’s case was preempted because the fda had refused to require warning labels on tuna — in other words , when the feds fail to regulate a product , that , too , can preempt state law .
It was an argument familiar to top officials at the fda .
In fact , Daniel Troy , the agency ’s chief counsel from 2001 to 2004 , was a lawyer who ’d spent most of his career in the private sector suing the fda on behalf of drug and food companies .
Troy , who was a leading proponent of the preemption doctrine , essentially ran the agency for more than a year before President Bush appointed Lester Crawford , a former vice president of the National Food Processors Association , as fda commissioner .
During his tenure , Troy invited big companies to bring him cases in which the agency could help defeat anti-industry lawsuits using the preemption argument .
One of those cases involved a suit by the California attorney general ’s office seeking to force tuna companies to disclose their product ’s mercury content on the label .
A lawyer representing the companies suggested to Troy that a letter from Crawford might help the industry ’s preemption argument .
The lawyer helpfully enclosed a lengthy memo outlining the points the commissioner should include .
In August 2005 , a letter precisely hitting all of the tuna lawyer ’s points arrived on the desk of California attorney general Bill Lockyer .
Tuna companies quickly introduced it in court .
Barely a month later , Crawford resigned from the fda in connection with criminal charges that he ’d misreported his ownership of stock in fda - regulated companies .
But his letter lived on in the courts :
In the California case , a lengthy trial featuring various industry spokespeople — including pediatrician Beard , who was paid $ 5,000 to testify that if people got worried about mercury in tuna , they might eat more junk food — ended with the judge citing Crawford ’s letter as a key factor in ruling for the tuna companies .
And the letter made another appearance in Landvik - Fellner ’s case : Tri-Union ’s lawyers have brought it up as evidence that her lawsuit is preempted by federal regulations .
After a year of legal wrangling , in January 2007 a US District Court judge agreed with the industry — and once again the ruling cited what the judge called Crawford ’s “ persuasive ” letter .
Fellner appealed the case to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals , and on August 19 , just after this story was published in our print edition , the court handed down a remarkable decision in her favor .
A three - judge panel agreed with her arguments that a letter from the FDA commissioner written at the behest of the tuna company ’s lawyers was not the sort of federal action that could trump the state law .
The court also scoffed at the notion that the FDA ’s advisory on mercury in fish qualified as a federal regulation , which requires formal proceedings , public criticism , and other serious vetting .
“ [ W ]e fail to see how an educational campaign might preempt Fellner ’s lawsuit , ” the panel wrote .
In fact , the court found that the New Jersey laws that Fellner sued under complemented , rather than conflicted with , the federal guidelines on mercury .
And in a conclusion that is no doubt giving the tuna industry fits , the court noted that contrary to the industry ’s pleas , it would be fairly simple to come up with a warning label that would comply with both the FDA and New Jersey law .
That last point may have implications beyond Fellner ’s case .
The original Proposition 65 litigation in California , brought by the state attorney general to force the tuna companies to put warning labels on tuna cans , is currently on appeal in the California state courts .
Oral arguments have n’t been scheduled yet , but lawyers in the attorney general ’s office have already alerted the appellate court of the decision in the Fellner case .
The California courts do n’t have to follow the federal ones , but they usually give them quite a bit of deference .
If the California courts do align with the 3rd Circuit , they could open the door to states requiring warning labels about mercury on tuna cans .
Fellner , for her part , is thrilled with the outcome .
“ People are feeding their children tuna fish .
There are still a lot of people out there who do n’t know , ” she says .
Green Leader Elizabeth
May released her party 's platform on Wednesday , promising tax breaks for low - income earners and industries that cut carbon emissions , as well as annual federal surpluses .
Speaking to supporters in Halifax , May said her party 's proposals offer a realistic approach to dealing with climate change and economic instability while closing the gap between rich and poor , improving crumbling infrastructure and helping Canadian students pay for their loan debts .
The platform , entitled " Looking Forward : a fresh perspective on Canada 's future , " calls for a $ 50 - a - tonne carbon tax on fossil fuels to help reduce income taxes .
May insisted her programs are cost- negative , despite charges by Conservative Leader Stephen Harper that other parties ' spending proposals would result in a deficit .
" For every item of cost , there 's an item of revenue , and the bottom line is a surplus , " she said .
GST hike would pay for infrastructure
May said the proposal differs from Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion 's Green Shift plan in that it would hike the GST by one percentage point to generate $ 3 billion a year for municipalities to pay for improvements to crumbling infrastructure and public transit .
It also calls for cutting subsidies to nuclear and fossil fuels .
" Mr. Dion and the Liberal party have adopted our approach partially , so of course I must support our approach when adopted partially , " she said .
" Our approach is better . "
But May insisted she did n't fault Dion for adopting portions of the environmental proposal , instead offering praise for his daring .
" When the leader of the Official Opposition goes out on a limb and takes a position that involves more political courage than any other previous leader of a mainstream party , then I 'm not going to take cheap shots , " she said .
May will be the party 's first leader to participate in the federal leaders ' debates after securing a spot despite objections from the Conservatives , NDP and the Bloc Québécois .
The parties had objected to May 's participation over what they said was an established partnership between the Greens and the Liberals , citing an agreement between May and Dion not to run opposing candidates in the leaders ' respective ridings .
The Greens ' previous leader , Jim Harris , was left out of the debates in the run-up to the 2006 federal election .
At the time , the television consortium determined the party did not have enough public support to justify an invitation to participate .
In August , the Green party gained its first ever member of Parliament — Blair Wilson — a Vancouver - area Independent who quit the Liberal party last year .
We 're releasing Merb 1.0.2 today , which is just a small number of patches that address some of the most urgent issues :
Some of the built - in rake tasks were deleting some gems that were in the specs as fixtures .
This only affected people building Merb from the git sources , and is now resolved .
The Merb source code hardcoded in certain versions in multiple places .
We have removed another such case , and created Merb : : DM_VERSION to specify what version of DataMapper the merb stack shipped with .
We now use that variable when generating the merb gemspec .
Merb was truncating the log file with each start .
It now opens the file in append mode .
Many people reported that they accidentally overrode a core Merb : : Controller method in their controllers , and received only an obscure warning .
Merb now raises an error when you attempt to override a non-overridable method in your controller .
If you want to override something anyway , call override !
: your_method before doing so .
merb - i was silently failing for users who did not have webrat installed .
We now print a warning and allow merb - i to load .
Webrat is required for some advanced features that allow you to emulate the browser in the console .
An issue with numeric routes ( ticket 1036 ) is now resolved .
An issue with cookies ( ticket 1022 ) is now resolved .
In case people were wondering , we are working on 1.0.x in parallel with 1.1 .
The 1.0.x will continue to provide bugfixes for the 1.0 release , while 1.1 will add additional features in the march toward 2.0 .
You can get the nightlies of both the latest 1.0.x release and the 1.1 release at the edge.merbivore.com gem server .

Iraqi police conduct joint patrols with US forces near Tikrit
The body of a 20 - year - old Iraqi girl turned up recently in a small Sunni town south of Tikrit .
Her own family had killed her .
She had been having an affair with her cousin , but that was not the problem : cousins often marry in this part of the world .
But they had decided to have sex and he had persuaded her to let him film this " just for us " .
Of course , he could not resist showing the tape to his friends , to boast .
The pictures started to circulate in this small town and her family found out the couple had been sleeping together .
Honour demanded that they murder her - not him , naturally .
The US army officer telling me this story said his soldiers had wanted to find the boy involved and give him a good beating .
The officer , too , was furious , but also resigned to the situation .
After more than a year here , he knew only too well that Salahaddin province was never going to be Kansas .
From hunted to hunters ?
In the same way , the US government has come to accept it is never going to implant Jeffersonian democracy in Baghdad .
So goals have been adjusted , compromises made .
The US forces know they have to be pragmatic if they are ever going to leave this place .
Take Sheikh Sabah al - Shamari .
He was once an insurgent , he told me .
But I met him as he laid on a lavish lunch for the Americans .
Huge metal dishes of lamb and rice were set down on the floor .
We sat cross -legged to eat with our hands .
Grabbing a particularly fatty hunk of meat - the best bit - and pressing it into my palm , the sheikh told me how the Americans were paying him to provide militiamen loyal to the coalition .
We like the coalition .
They brought security here ; if they do n't stay we 'll have the Iranians and al - Qaeda
Sheikh Sabah al - Shamari
Tribal Awakening leader
This is the so - called Tribal Awakening , known to some as the Sons of Iraq movement but also dubbed , rather absurdly , the Concerned Local Citizens - a name thought up by some PR genius in the US military .
Whatever the title , the Tribal Awakening has brought relative peace to the Sunni areas of Iraq .
The sheikh told me - with the American officer next to him in full agreement - that 60 % of his men were former insurgents .
Once they had tried to kill the Americans , now they were helping them , he said .
Flashing a charming smile at the US soldiers , the sheikh added : " We like the coalition .
They brought security here ; if they do n't stay we 'll have the Iranians and al - Qaeda .
We still need them . "
The American officer with me quietly explained that the sheikh had been accused of embezzling the money for Tribal Awakening militiamen and had been briefly jailed .
But the coalition needed all the friends it could get and the sheikh had risked his life to help , surviving more than one assassination attempt .
So he was released .
All this meant that there had not been a bomb attack against this particular unit of the 101st Airborne for months .
There was a time when they used to get blown up or shot at by snipers every couple of days .
Islamic Army remnants
The coalition believes it has broken the back of the insurgency in Sunni areas of Iraq .
It says it has won over the local population , jailing or killing those insurgent leaders who can not be persuaded to change sides .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Some insurgents are left .
In the local police station we meet a group introduced to us as what remained , in this particular small town , of the feared Islamic Army of Iraq .
They were kids .
Five young men , all shackled together , were ushered into the police chief 's office .
One told me he was 15 years old .
He explained how they had planted a bomb to murder an informer .
But it had gone off early , killing an innocent bystander .
Facing a long jail sentence , he said he wanted to co-operate with the police and the US forces .
His friend , aged 18 , said he had joined the group because a senior insurgent leader had convinced him it was his duty as a Muslim to kill Americans .
But he was sorry about that now .
The group 's leader , a 19 - year - old called Gazwan , proved a tougher nut to crack .
He was facing the death sentence .
A good word from the US military could save him .
But , sitting handcuffed on the floor , he still refused to tell the Americans what they wanted to know .
Reconciliation process A US intelligence officer also in the room said the young man 's cousin was a senior leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) who was now in Camp Bucca , the coalition 's jail for insurgents .
His father had also been a leading member of the so - called resistance .
When the local leader of the Islamic Army in Iraq was arrested , Gazwan had assumed leadership of the group .
US soldiers said Gazwan had been caught with bombs twice before " Right about the time we hear about Jaish al - Islami [ the Islamic Army ] coming back together , we get this IED [ roadside bomb ] , " said the intelligence officer about the only attack the US unit here had suffered in months .
Captain Mike Gacheru , the commander of this unit - part of the 101st Airborne Division - told me Gazwan had been caught with bombs twice before , but released by the US under the process of reconciliation designed to re-integrate former insurgents into society .
Each time , Gazwan had promised the Americans his fighting days were over and that he would give them any other explosives he might have .
The Americans asked him why he had n't told them about the bomb meant for the informer .
" It was only a small bomb , " said Gazwan .
" So do you have any more small bombs at your house ?
This might help you , " said Captain Gacheru .
" If I have more bombs I will give them to you , " he responded .
This was met with general disbelief .
" Was that bomb for me ? " Gacheru pressed on .
" You 're in some deep water now , Gazwan .
I keep throwing you a line , but you keep letting my line go . "
Dime a dozen Gazwan limped out ( a sign , perhaps , of a beating by the Iraqi police ) .
Others in his group told the Americans he did indeed have a stash of weapons and bombs .
But , even staring at the hangman 's noose , the 19 - year - old insurgent leader had refused to give it up .
A night - time search for weapons came under attack " He has attacked my soldiers on numerous occasions and it is only a matter of time before it catches up to you , " said Captain Gacheru outside .
He added : " We went after the big fish , now all these guys [ whom we had just seen ] are just direct action guys , the guys who put the bombs , shoot the AKs , throw the grenades .
" They are a dime a dozen , if you try to go after them you 'll spend the rest of the deployment doing that . "
That night , the Americans continued their search for hidden weapons .
They had received a tip that some were buried in a children 's playground in the nearby town .
It was pitch black .
Under green " tactical " flashlights , they started digging up the playground .
After 15 minutes , they had found nothing .
The Iraqi police officers with them were starting to get nervous .
There was a gunshot , and then a flash and a loud bang : the patrol was under attack .
Sprayed with shrapnel
The explosion might have been a booby trap , or a mine .
It might have been a hand grenade thrown from the shadows .
Nobody could tell .
The Americans have no illusions that they can end the violence in Iraq .
They just hope to reduce it enough to hand the whole problem to the Iraqis
As soldiers ran around looking for cover , there were yells of " where is it coming from ? "
No one knew if this was the start of an ambush .
Amid the confusion , it quickly became clear that one soldier had been injured .
A sergeant was lying on the ground .
His face and legs had been sprayed with shrapnel .
He was yelling for the medic .
The patrol 's leader got him - and everyone else - into the vehicles and headed back to base .
The evening had been a lesson in the kind of reduced expectations the coalition has for Iraq .
This is what " victory " looks like and it is not pretty .
The Americans have no illusions that they can end the violence in Iraq .
They just hope to reduce it enough to hand the whole problem to the Iraqis .

Palin church : Alaska will be a ' refuge ' for Armageddon David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin has attended a number of different churches over the years , but for most of her adult life , she belonged to the Wasilla Assembly of God , which has attracted attention for its unorthodox beliefs and practices .
In June , Palin addressed graduates of a youth ministry program at that church , telling them , " It was so cool growin ' up in this church and gettin ' saved here . "
CNN 's Jessica Yellin looked into the church 's beliefs and reports that it practices speaking in tongues and also " teaches that Alaska will be a shelter at the end of the world . "
A video produced by the church proclaims with apocalyptic imagery that " God has a destiny for the state of Alaska ! " and in another clip someone from the church affirms , " I believe that Alaska 's one of the refuge states . "
Yellin acknowledged that " whether Palin shares these beliefs is unclear " but noted that " during her June visit , she described the Iraq War and a natural gas pipeline she is trying to build as part of God 's plan . "
Palin herself has not spoken publicly about her faith , but one Wasilla parishioner told Yellin that Palin 's years at the Assembly of God had shaped her beliefs , saying , " She has a better idea of what God is wanting her to do and guiding her and leading her . "
Since 2002 , Palin has attended the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church , which " has more traditional practices , " according to Yellin .

JEDDAH , Saudi Arabia ( Reuters ) -
A new science and technology university in Saudi Arabia will house one of the world ’s largest supercomputers and it is helping lure top researchers to the conservative desert state .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ( KAUST ) is due to open next year on the Red Sea coast near Jeddah , the most liberal city in a country where religious conservatives have extensive control over society .
Inside the campus , male and female students will be able to mingle freely , contrary to strict gender segregation enforced in most of the country .
The university is part of a series of reforms by King Abdullah aiming to open the country up .
“ The supercomputer is the cornerstone of this knowledge - based economy that we are seeking , ” said Majid Al - Ghaslan , in charge of the acquisition , design and development of the “ Shaheen ” supercomputer .
Named after the peregrine falcon , which reaches speeds of up to 340 kilometers per hour , Shaheen is expected to reach 222 teraflops , a measure equaling a trillion floating point operations per second , Ghaslan said .
This will make it sixth most powerful computer in the world .
Shaheen will be able to simulate the Red Sea environment and model oil fields in three dimensions .
Although Saudi Arabia has immense financial resources as the world ’s biggest oil exporter , the parameters of school and university education are governed by religious strictures and many subjects are even off - limits for women to study .
The new university will offer research in biosciences and bioengineering , material sciences and engineering , applied mathematics and computational sciences .
With a $ 10 billion donation to its endowment from King Abdullah , it is able to lure experts from around the globe with the promise of almost unlimited funding for research work .
“ KAUST is a remarkable addition to the world ’s resources in high - end computing , ” said David Keyes , Chair of the Mathematical and Computer Sciences and Engineering Division , who is moving from Columbia University in the United States .
“ The machine that is being purchased here is one of the main attractions to me , ” he said .
The supercomputer will be used by KAUST and its partners including Cornell University , the University of Oxford , Stanford University , and Texas A&M University .
WASHINGTON  The White House has backed away from using American commandos for further ground raids into Pakistan after furious complaints from its government , relying instead on an intensifying campaign of airstrikes by the Central Intelligence Agency against militants in the Pakistani mountains .
According to American and Pakistani officials , attacks by remotely piloted Predator aircraft have increased sharply in frequency and scope in the past three months .
Through Sunday , there were at least 18 Predator strikes since the beginning of August , some deep inside Pakistan ’s tribal areas , compared with 5 strikes during the first seven months of 2008 .
At the same time , however , officials said that relying on airstrikes alone , the United States would be unable to weaken Al Qaeda ’s grip in the tribal areas permanently .
Within the government , advocates of the ground raids have argued that only by sending Special Operations forces into Pakistan can the United States successfully capture suspected operatives and interrogate them for information about top Qaeda leaders .

Historical Introduction
Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations Research ( O.R. ) , a
strategic and tactical methodology developed under the military management
in England during World War II .
The original purpose of Operations Research
was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense
with the objective of effective use of limited military resources against
foreign enemies ( i.e. logistics ) .
It was soon recognized by those in positions of power that the same methods
might be useful for totally controlling a society .
But better tools were
necessary .
Social engineering ( the analysis and automation of a society ) requires the
correlation of great amounts of constantly changing economic information
( data ) , so a high speed computerized data processing system was necessary
which could race ahead of the society and predict when society would arrive
for capitulation .
Relay computers were too slow , but the electronic computer , invented in 1946
by J. Prosper Eckert and John W. Mauchly filled the bill .
The next breakthrough was the development of the simplex method of linear
programming in 1947 by mathematician George B. Dantzig .
Then in 1948 , the transistor , invented by J. Bardeen , W. H. Brattain , and W .
Shockley , promised great expansion of the computer field by reducing space
and power requirements .
With these three inventions under their direction , those in positions of
power strongly suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole
world with the push of a button .
Immediately , the Rockefeller Foundation got in on the ground floor by
making a four year grant to Harvard College , funding the Harvard economic
research project for the study of the structure of the American economy .
One
year later , in 1949 , the United States Air Force joined in .
Side note " Project Grundge + Sign "
In 1952 the original grant period terminated , and a high level meeting of
the elite was held to determine the next phase of social operations
research .
The Harvard project had been very fruitful as is borne out by the
publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting the feasibility of
economic ( social ) engineering .
( Studies in the Structure of the American
Economy -- copyright 1953 by Weenily Leontief , International Sciences Press
Inc. , White Plains , New York . )
Engineered in the last half decade of the 1940's , the now Quiet War machine
stood , so to speak , in sparkling gold plated hardware on the showroom floor
by 1954 .
With the creation of the maser in 1954 , the promise of unlocking unlimited
sources of fusion atomic energy from the heavy hydrogen in sea water and the
consequent availability of unlimited social power became a possibility only
decades away .
The combination was irresistible .
The Quiet War was quietly declared by the international elite at a meeting
held in 1954 .
Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later , the
evolution of the new weapon system has never suffered any major setbacks .
Side note ( Bolsheviks U.S. NFS Policies )
This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War .
Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout
the world .
POLITICAL INTRODUCTION
In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that it
was only a matter of time , only a few decades , before the general public
would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power , for the very elements
of the new silent weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopia
as they were for providing a private utopia .
The issue of primary concern , that of dominance , revolved around the subject
of the energy sciences .
Side note ( 1954 -6 USAEC reports )
ENERGY
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth .
Natural science is
the study of the sources and control of natural energy , and social science ,
theoretically expressed as economics , is the study of the sources and
control of social energy .
Both are bookkeeping systems : mathematics .
Therefore , mathematics is the primary energy science .
And the bookkeeper can
be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the
bookkeeping .
All science is merely a means to an end .
The means is knowledge .
The end is
control .
Beyond this remains only one issue , " who will be the beneficiary ? " .
In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern .
Although the so - called " moral
issues " were raised , in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed
that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no
better than animals who do not have intelligence .
Such people are beasts of
burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent .
CONSEQUENTLY , in the interest of future world order , peace , and tranquility ,
it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public
with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural social energy
( wealth ) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the
self - disciplined , responsible , and worthy few .
In order to implement this objective , it was necessary to create , secure ,
and apply new weapons which , as it turned out , were a class of weapons so
subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public
appearance as to earn for themselves the name " silent weapons " .
In conclusion , the only objective of economic research , as conducted by the
magnates of capital ( banking ) and the industries of commodities ( goods ) and
services , is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable
and manipulatable ( sic ) .
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy , the lower class elements
of the society must be brought under total control , i.e. , must be
house - broken , trained , and assigned a yoke and long term social duties from
an early age , before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of
the matter .
In order to achieve such conformity , the lower class family unit
must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the
parents and the establishment of government operated day care centers for
the occupationally orphaned children .
The quality of education to the lower class must be of the poorest sort , so
that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior
class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class .
With such an
initial handicap , even bright lower class individuals have little if any
hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life .
This form of
slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order , peace , and
tranquility for the ruling upper class .
DESCRIPTIVE INTRODUCTION
OF THE SILENT WEAPON
Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a
silent weapon by its creators , but only in its manner of functioning .
It shoots situations , instead of bullets ; propelled by data processing ,
instead of a chemical reaction ( explosion ) ; originating from bits of data ,
instead of grains of gun powder ; from a computer , instead of a gun ; operated
by a computer programer ( sic ) , instead of a marksman ; under the orders of a
banking magnate , instead of a military general .
It makes no obvious explosive noises , causes no obvious physical or mental
injuries , and does not obviously interfere with anyone 's daily social life .
Yet it makes an unmistakable ' noise ' , causes unmistakable physical and
mental damage , and unmistakably interferes with daily social life , i.e. ,
unmistakable to the trained observer , one who knows what to look for .
The public cannot comprehend this weapon , and therefore cannot believe that
they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon .
side note ( i.e. , the food
weapon )
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong , but because of
the technical nature of the silent weapon , they cannot express their feeling
in a rational way , or handle the problem with intelligence .
Therefore , they
do not know how to cry for help , and do not know how to associate with
others to defend themselves against it .
When a silent weapon is applied gradually to the public , the public
adjusts / adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on
their lives until the pressure ( psychological via economic ) becomes to great
and they crack up .
Therefore , the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare .
It attacks the
vitality , options , and mobility of the individuals of society by knowing ,
understanding , manipulating , and attacking their sources of natural and
social energy , and their physical , mental , and emotional strengths and
weaknesses .
THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION
" Give me control over a nation 's currency , and I care not who makes its
laws . "
Mayer Amschel Rothschild ( 1743-1812 )
Today 's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea
discovered , succinctly expressed , and effectively applied by the quoted
Mayer Amschel Rothschild .
Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing component of
economic theory known as economic inductance .
He , of course , did not think
of his discovery in these 20th century terms , and , to be sure , mathematical
analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution , the rise of the
theory of mechanics and electronics , and finally , the invention of the
electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control of
the world economy .
GENERAL ENERGY CONCEPTS
In the study of energy systems , there always appear three alimentary
concepts .
These are potential energy , kinetic energy , and energy
dissipation .
And corresponding to those concepts , there are three idealized ,
essentially pure physical counterparts , called passive components .
(1) In the science of physical mechanics , the phenomenon of potential energy
is associated with a physical property called elasticity or stiffness , and
can be represented by a stretched spring .
In electronic science , potential energy is stored in a capacitor instead of
a spring .
This property is called capacitance instead of elasticity or
stiffness .
(2) In the science of physical mechanics , the phenomenon of kinetic energy
is associated with a physical property called inertia or mass , and can be
represented by a mass or a flywheel in motion .
In electronic science , kinetic energy is stored in an inductor ( magnetic
field ) instead of a mass .
This property is called inductance instead of
inertia .
(3) In the science of physical mechanics , the phenomenon of energy
dissipation is associated with a physical property called friction or
resistance , and can be represented by a dash pot or other device which
converts system energy into heat .
In electronic science , dissipation of energy is performed by an element
called either a resistor or a conductor , the term ' resistor ' being the one
generally used to express the concept of friction , and the term ' conductor '
being generally used to describe a more ideal device ( i.e. wire ) employed to
convey electric energy efficiently from one location to another .
The
property of a resistance or conductor is measured as either resistance or
conductance , reciprocals .
In economics these three energy concepts are associated with : ( 1 ) Economic
Capacitance -- Capital ( money , stock / inventory , investments in buildings and
durables , etc. ) ( 2 ) Economic Conductance -- Goods ( production flow
coefficients ) ( 3 ) Economic Inductance -- Services ( the influence of the
population of industry on output )
All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of one energy system ,
( e.g. , mechanics , electronics , etc. ) can be immediately applied in the
study of any other energy system ( e.g. , economics ) .
MR. ROTHSCHILD'S ENERGY DISCOVERY
What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power ,
influence , and control over people as applied to economics .
That principle
is " when you assume the appearance of power , people soon give it to you " .
Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the
required appearance of power that could be used to induce people
( inductance , with people corresponding to a magnetic field ) into
surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth
instead of real compensation ) .
They would put up real collateral in
exchange for a loan of promissory notes .
Mr. Rothschild found that he could
issue more notes than he had backing for , so long as he had someone 's stock
of gold as a persuader to show to his customers .
Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individuals and to
governments .
these would create over - confidence .
Then he would make money
scarce , tighten control of the system , and collect the collateral through
the obligation of contracts .
The cycle was then repeated .
These pressures
could be used to ignite war .
Then he would control the availability of
currency to determine who would win the war .
That government which agreed to
give him control of its economic system got his support .
Collection of debts
was guaranteed by economic to the enemy of the debtor .
The profit derived
from this economic methodology made Mr. Rothschild all the more wealthy and
all the more able to extend his wealth .
He found that the public greed would
allow currency to be printed by government order beyond the limits
( inflation ) of backing in precious metal or the production of goods and
services ( gross national product , GNP ) .
APPARENT CAPITAL AS " PAPER " INDUCTOR
In this structure , credit , presented as a pure circuit element called
" currency " , has the appearance of capital .
Hence , it has the appearance of
service , but is , in fact , indebtedness or debt .
It is therefore an economic
inductance instead of an economic capacitance , and if balanced in no other
way , will be balanced by the negation of population ( war , genocide ) .
The
total goods and services represents real capital called the gross national
product , and currency may be printed up to this level and still represent
economic capacitance ; but currency printed beyond this level is subtractive ,
represents the introduction economic inductance , and constitutes notes of
indebtedness .
War is therefore the balancing of the system by killing the
true creditors ( the public which we have thought to exchange true value for
inflated currency ) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources of
nature and the regeneration of those resources .
Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency gave him the power to rearrange
the economic structure to his own advantage , to shift economic inductance to
those economic positions which would encourage the greatest economic
instability and oscillation .
The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient
data and high speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic
oscillations created by price shocking and excess paper energy credits --
paper inductance / inflation ) .
BREAKTHROUGH
The aviation field provide the greatest evolution in economic engineering by
way of the mathematical theory of shock testing .
In this process , a
projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the
recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe and
wired to chart recorders .
By studying the echoes or reflections of the
recoil impulse in the airframe , it is possible to discover critical
vibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations of the
engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings , or a combination of the two ,
might reinforce resulting in resonant self - destruction of the airframe in
flight as an aircraft .
From the standpoint of engineering , this means that
the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in terms of
vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated .
APPLICATION IN ECONOMICS
To use this method of airframe shock testing in economic engineering , the
prices of commodities are shocked , and the public consumer reaction is
monitored .
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted
theoretically by computers and this psycho economic structure of the economy
is thus discovered .
It is by this process that the partial differential and
difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and make
possible its evaluation as an economic industry ( dissipative consumer
structure ) .
Then the response of the household to future shocks can be
predicted and manipulated , and society becomes a well regulated animal with
its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer regulated social
energy bookkeeping system .
Eventually every individual element of the structure comes under computer
control through a knowledge of personal preferences , such knowledge
guaranteed computer association of consumer preferences ( universal product
codes on packages ) with identified consumers ( identified via association
with the use of a credit card and later a permanent ' tattooed ' body number
invisible under normal ambient illumination .
SUMMARY
Economics is only a social extension of a natural energy system .
It , also ,
has its three passive components .
Because of the distribution of wealth and
the lack of communication and consequent lack of data , this field has been
the last energy field for which knowledge of these three passive components
have been developed .
Since energy is the key to all activity on the face of the earth , it follows
that in order to attain a monopoly of energy , raw materials , goods , and
services and to establish a world system of slave labor , it is necessary to
have a first strike capability in the filed of economics .
In order to
maintain our position , it is necessary that we have absolute first knowledge
of the science of control over all economic factors and the first experience
at engineering the world economy .
In order to achieve such sovereignty , we must at least achieve this one end :
that the public will not make either the logical or mathematical connection
between economics and the other energy sciences or learn to apply such
knowledge .
This is becoming increasingly difficult to control because more and more
businesses are making demands upon their computer programers to create and
apply mathematical models for the management of those businesses .
It is only a matter of time before the new breed of private
programmer / economists will catch on to the far reaching implications of the
work begun at Harvard in 1948 .
The speed with which they can communicate
their warning to the public will largely depend upon how effective we have
been at controlling the media , subverting education , and keeping the public
distracted with matters of no real importance .
THE ECONOMIC MODEL
Economics as a social energy science has as a first objective the
description of the complex way in which any given unit of resources is used
to satisfy some economic want .
( Leontief Matrix )
This first objective ,
when it is extended to get the most product from the least or limited
resources , comprises that objective of general military and industrial
logistics known as Operations Research . ( See simplex method of linear
programming . )
The Harvard Economic research Project ( 1948 - ) was an extension of World War
II Operations Research .
Its purpose was to discover the science of
controlling an economy : at first the American economy , and then the world
economy .
It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation and data ,
it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of an economy as
to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile .
Such has proven to be
the case .
Moreover , the economy has been transformed into a guided missile
on target .
The immediate aim of the Harvard project was to discover the economic
structure , what forces change that structure , how it can be manipulated .
What was needed was a well organized knowledge of the mathematical
structures and interrelationships of investment , production , distribution ,
and consumption .
To make a short story of it all , it was discovered that an
economy obeyed the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical
theory and practical computer know - how developed for the electronic field
could be directly applied in the study of economics .
This discovery was not
openly declared , and its more subtle implications were and are kept a
closely guarded secret , for example that in an economic model , human life is
measured in dollars , and that the electric spark generated when opening a
switch connected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous to the
initiation of a war .
The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was the accurate
description of the household as an industry .
This is a challenge , because
consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influenced by
income , price , and other economic factors .
This hurdle was cleared in an indirect and statistically approximate way by
an application of shock testing the current characteristics , called current
technical coefficients , of household industry .
Finally , because problems in theoretical economics can be translated very
easily into problems in theoretical electronics , and the solution translated
back again , it follows that only a book of language translation and concept
definition needed to be written for economics .
The remainder could be gotten
from standard works on mathematics and electronics .
This makes the
publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary , and greatly
simplifies project security .
INDUSTRIAL DIAGRAMS
An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from other
industries in several forms and converts it into one specific product for
sales and distribution to other industries .
It has several inputs and one
output .
What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really an
industrial complex where several under one roof produce one or more
products .
A pure ( single output ) industry can be represented over simply by a circuit
block .
side note : ( Diagram and mathematical formula not shown in this
version for the purposes of internet publication at this time . )
THREE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES
Industries fall into three categories or classes by type of output .
Class # 1 - Capital ( resources )
Class # 2 - Goods ( commodities or use - dissipative )
Class # 3 - Services ( action of population )
Class # 1 industries exist at three levels ; ( 1 ) Nature - sources of energy
and raw materials .
( 2 ) Governmental - printing of currency equal to the
gross national product ( GNP ) , and extension * of currency in excess of GNP .
(3) Banking - loaning of money for interest , and extension *( counterfeiting )
of economic value through deposit loan accounts .
*- inflation .
Class # 2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer ( dissipated )
products .
This sort of activity is usually recognized and labeled by the
public as an `industry ' .
Class # 3 industries are those which have service rather than a tangible
product as their output .
These industries are called ( 1 ) households , and ( 2 )
governments .
Their output is human activity of a mechanical sort , and their
basis is population .
AGGREGATION
The whole economic system can be represented by a three industry model if
one allows the names of the outputs to be ( 1 ) capital , ( 2 ) goods , and ( 3 )
services .
The problem with this representation is that it would not show the
influence of , say , the textile industry or the ferrous metal industry .
This
is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metal industry would be
contained within a single classification called the `goods industry ' and by
this process of combining or aggregating those two industries under one
system block they would lose their economic individuality .
THE E-MODEL
A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production ,
distribution , consumption , and investment .
If all of these elements
including labor and human functions are assigned a numerical value in like
units of measure , say , 1939 dollars ,
Then this flow can be further
represented by a current flow in an electronic circuit , and its behavior can
be predicted and manipulated with useful precision .
The three ideal passive energy components of electronics , the capacitor , the
resistor , and the inductor correspond to the three ideal passive energy
components of economics called the pure industries of capital , goods , and
services , resp ..
Economic capacitance represents the storage of capital in one form or
another .
Economic conductance represents the level of conductance of materials for
the production of goods .
Economic inductance represents the inertia of economic value in motion .
This
is a population phenomenon known as services .
ECONOMIC INDUCTANCE
An electrical inductor ( e.g. , a coil of wire ) has an electric current as its
primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon
( inertia ) .
Corresponding to this , an economic inductor has a flow of
economic value as its primary phenomenon of inertia .
When the flow of
economic value ( e.g. money ) diminishes , the human population field collapses
in order to keep the economic value ( money ) flowing ( extreme case - war ) .
This public inertia is a result of consumer buying habits , expected standard
of living , etc. , and is generally a phenomenon of self - preservation .
INDUCTIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER
( 1 ) population ( 2 ) magnitude of the economic activities of the government .
(3) The method of financing these government activities ( Peter Paul
Principle -- inflation of the currency )
TRANSLATION
( A few examples will be given . )
CHARGE -- coulombs -- dollars ( 1939 ) .
FLOW / CURRENT -- amperes ( coulombs per second ) .
-- dollars of flow per year .
MOTIVATING FORCE -- volts -- dollars ( output ) demand .
CONDUCTANCE -- amperes
per volt .
-- dollars of flow per year per dollar demand .
CAPACITANCE --
coulombs per volt .
-- dollars of production inventory / stock per dollar
demand .
TIME FLOW RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF -DESTRUCTIVE OSCILLATIONS
As ideal industry may be symbolized electronically in various ways .
The
simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by a
current .
When this is done , the relationship between the two becomes what is
called an admittance , which can result from three economic factors : ( 1 )
hindsight flow , ( 2 ) present flow , and ( 3 ) foresight flow .
Foresight flow is the result of that property of living entities to cause
energy ( food ) to be stored for a period of low energy ( e.g. , a winter
season ) .
It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period
of low energy ( winter season ) .
In a production industry it takes several
forms , one of which is known as production stock or inventory .
In electronic
symbology this specific industry demand ( a pure capital industry ) is
represented by capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a
stored charge .
Satisfaction of loading effect of inventory priorities .
Present flow ideally involves no delays .
It is , so to speak , input today for
output today , a `hand to mouth ' flow .
In electronic symbology , this specific
industry demand ( a pure use industry ) is represented by a conductance which
is then a simple economic value ( a dissipative element ) .
Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia .
In electronics , this phenomenon
is the characteristic of an inductor ( economic analog - a pure service
industry ) in which a current flow ( economic analog = flow of money ) creates
a magnetic field ( economic analog = active human population ) which , if the
current ( money flow ) begins to diminish , collapses ( war ) to maintain the
current ( flow of money energy ) .
Other large alternatives to war as economic inductors or economic flywheels
are an open - ended social welfare program , or enormous ( but fruitful )
open - ended space program .
The problem with stabilizing the economic system is that there is too much
demand on account of ( 1 ) too much greed and ( 2 ) too much population .
This creates excessive economic inductance which can only be balanced with
economic capacitance ( true resources or value - e.g. in goods or services ) .
The social welfare program is nothing more than an open - ended credit balance
system which creates a false capital industry to give non-productive people
a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs .
This can be useful ,
however , because the recipients become state property in return for the
`gift ' , a standing army for the elite .
For he who pays the piper , picks the
tune .
Those who get hooked on the economic drug , must go to the elite for a
fix .
In this , the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing
capacitance is borrowing on the future " credit " of the world .
This is the
fourth law of motion -- onset , and consists of performing an action and
leaving the the system before the reflected reaction returns to the point of
action - a delayed reaction .
The means of surviving the reaction is by
changing the system before the reaction can return .
By this means ,
politicians become popular in their own time and the public pays for it
later .
In fact the measure of such a politician is the delay time .
The same
thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the
gross national product , an economic process called inflation .
This puts a
large quantity of money into the hands of the public and maintains a balance
against their greed , creates a false self - confidence in them and , for a
while , stays the wolf from the door .
They must eventually resort to war to balance the account , because war
ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor , and politicians are
the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility
and blood off the public conscience .
( See section on consent factors and
social economic structuring . )
If people really cared about their fellow man , they would control their
appetites ( greed , procreation , etc. ) so that they would not have to operate
on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy
the bum .
Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint , there are only
two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system .
( 1 ) Let
the population bludgeon each other to death in war , which will only result
in a total destruction of the living earth .
( 2 ) Take control of the world by
the use of economic `silent weapons ' in a form of `quiet warfare ' and reduce
the economic inductance of the world to a safe level by process of
benevolent slavery and genocide .
The later option has been taken as the obviously better option .
At this
point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about
silent weapons is necessary .
The general public refuses to improve its own
mentality and its faith in its fellow man .
It has become a herd of
proliferating barbarians , and so to speak , a blight on the face of the
earth .
They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have
not been able to avoid war despite religious morality , and their religious
or self gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the
solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them .
It is left to those few
who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive , to
solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care , Otherwise ,
exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope of preserving the
seed of future true humanity .
INDUSTRY EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
side note : Diagrams and mathematical formulas are not included for ease of
getting this document published on the net at the present time .
THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY
The industries of finance ( banking ) , manufacturing , and government , real
counterparts of the pure industries of capital goods , and services , are
easily defined because they are generally logically structured .
Because of
this their technical coefficients can be easily deduced .
This , however , is
not the case with the service industry known as the household industry .
HOUSEHOLD MODELS
side note : Diagrams and mathematical formulas are not included for ease of
getting this document published on the net at the present time .
The problem which a theoretical economist faces is that the consumer
preferences of any household is not easily predictable and the technical
coefficients of any one household tend to be a non-linear , very complex , and
variable function of income , prices , etc. .
Computer information derived from the use of the universal product code in
conjunction with credit card purchases as an individual household identifier
could change this state of affairs .
But the U.P.C. method is not yet
available on a national or even a significant regional scale .
{ side note it
is now}
To compensate for this data deficiency , an alternative indirect
approach of analysis has been adopted known as economic shock testing .
This
method , widely used in the aircraft manufacturing industry develops an
aggregate statistical sort of data .
Applied to economics , this means that all of the households in one region or
in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than
individually , and the mass behavior rather than individual behavior is used
to discover useful estimates of the technical coefficients governing the
economic structure of the hypothetical single household industry .
Notice in the industry flow diagram that the values for flows A , B , C , etc. ,
are accessible to measurement in terms of selling prices and total sales of
commodities .
One method of evaluating the technical coefficients of the household
industry depends upon shocking the prices of a commodity and then noting the
sales of all of the commodities .
ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING
In recent times , the application of Operations Research to the study public
economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles of schock
testing .
In shock testing of an aircraft airframe , the recoil impulse of firing a gun
mounted on that airframe causes shock waves in that structure which tell
aviation engineers the conditions under which parts of the airplane or the
whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutter like a guitar
string , a flute reed , or a tuning fork , and disintegrate or fall apart in
flight .
Economic engineers achieve the same result in studying the behavior of the
economy and the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity
such as beef , coffee , gasoline , or sugar and then causing a sudden change or
shock in its price or availability , thus kicking everybody 's budget and
buying habits out of shape .
They then observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes in
advertising , prices , and sales of that and other commodities .
The objective of such studies is to acquire know - how to set the public
economy into a predictable state of motion which will convince the public
that certain " expert " people should take control of the money system and
reestablish security ( rather than liberty and justice ) for all .
When the
subject citizens are rendered unable to control their financial affairs ,
they of course , become totally enslaved , a source of cheap labor .
Not only the price of commodities , but also the availability of labor can be
used as the means of shock testing .
Labor strikes deliver excellent test
shocks to an economy , especially in the critical services areas of trucking
( transportation ) , communication , public utilities ( energy , water , garbage
collection ) , etc. .
By shock testing , there is found that there is a direct relationship between
the availability of money flowing in an economy and the psychological
outlook and response of masses of people dependent upon that availability .
For example , there is a measurable quantitative relationship between the
price of gasoline , and the probability that a person would experience a
headache , feel a need to watch a violent movie , smoke a cigarette , or go to
a tavern for a mug of beer .
it is most interesting that , by observing and measuring the economic modes
by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from
reality , and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Research , it
is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination of
created events ( shocks ) which will bring about a complete control and
subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy ( by
shaking the plum tree ) .
INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING

INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERS
Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering .
The
basic characteristic of any amplifier ( mechanical , electrical , or economic )
is that it receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an
independent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable
relationship to that input control signal .
The simplest form of economic amplifier is a device called advertising .
If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve year
old , then , due to suggestibility , he will , with certain probability , respond
or react to that suggestion with the uncritical response of a twelve year
old and will reach into his economic reservoir and deliver its energy to buy
that product on impulse when he passes it in the store .
An economic amplifier may have several inputs and outputs .
Its response
might be instantaneous or delayed .
Its circuit symbol might be a rotary
switch if its options are exclusive , qualitative , `go ' or `no go ' , or it
might have its parametric input / output relationship to an input control
signal .
For this reason , it is called an active circuit element or
component .
Whatever its form might be , its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from
a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control
signal .
For this reason , it is called an active circuit , element or
component .
Economic amplifiers fall into classes called strategies , and , in comparison
with electronic amplifiers , the specific internal functions of an economic
amplifier are called logistical instead of electrical .
Therefore , economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain , but also , in
effect , are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry .
In the design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least
five functions , which are ( 1 ) the available input signals , ( 2 ) the desired
output control objectives , ( 3 ) the strategic objective , ( 4 ) the available
economic power sources ( 5 ) the logistical options .
The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating the
economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called game
theory .
The design of an economic amplifier begins with a specification of the power
level of the output , which can range from personal to national .
The second
condition is accuracy of response , i.e. , how accurately the output action is
a function of the input commands .
High gain combined with strong feedback
helps to deliver the required precision .
Most of the error will be in the
input data signal .
Personal input data tends to be specific , while national
input data tends to be statistical .

TABLE OF STRATEGIES
side note :
Tables to be added later for ease of getting this document onto
the net
DIVERSION , THE PRIMARY STRATEGY
Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon
and gaining control of the public is to keep the public undisciplined and
ignorant of basic systems and principles on the one hand , while keeping them
confused , disorganized , and distracted with matters of no real importance on
the other hand .
This is achieved by : ( 1 ) disengaging their minds , sabotaging their mental
activities , by providing a low quality program of public education in
mathematics , logic , systems design , and economics , and by discouraging
technical creativity .
( 2 ) engaging their emotions , increasing their
self - indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities ,
by : ( a ) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks ( mental and
emotional rape ) by way of a constant barrage of sex , violence , and wars in
the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers .
( b ) giving them what
they desire - in excess -- `junk food for thought ' -- and depriving them of
what they really need .
( 3 ) rewriting history and law and subjecting the
public to the deviant creation , thus being able to shift their thinking from
personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities .
These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of
social automation technology .
The general rule is that there is profit in
confusion ; the more confusion , the more profit .
Therefore , the best approach
is to create problems and then offer the solutions .
DIVERSION SUMMARY
MEDIA : keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social
issues , and captivated by matters of no real importance .
SCHOOLS : Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics , real economics ,
real law , and real history .
ENTERTAINMENT : Keep the public entertainment below a sixth grade level .
WORK : Keep the public busy , busy , busy , with no time to think ; back on the
farm with the other animals .
CONSENT THE PRIMARY VICTORY
A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by
legal ( but not always lawful ) force .
Much information is made available to
silent weapons systems programers through the Internal Revenue Service .
( See
studies in the structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source list . )
This information consists of the enforced delivery of well organized data
contained in the federal and state tax forms collected , assembled , and
submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers .
Furthermore ,
the number of such forms submitted to the IRS is a useful indicator of
public consent , an important factor in strategic decision making .
Other data
sources are given in the Short list of inputs .
Consent Coefficients --
numerical feedback indicating victory status .
Psychological basis :
When the
government is able to collect tax and seize private property without just
compensation , it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and
is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment .
A good indicator of
harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite an
obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from government .
AMPLIFICATION ENERGY SOURCES
The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is
discovering the energy sources .
The energy sources which support any
primitive economic system are , of course , a supply of raw materials , and the
consent of the people to labor and consequently assume a certain rank ,
position , level , or class of in the social structure ; i.e. , to provide labor
at various levels in the pecking order .
Each class , in guaranteeing its own
level of income , controls the class immediately below .
Hence preserves the
class structure .
This provides stability and security , but also government
from the top .
As time goes on and communication and education improve , the lower class
elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable of energy
systems and the ability to enforce their rise through the class structure .
this threatens the sovereignty of the elite .
If the rise of the lower
classes can be postponed long enough , the elite can achieve energy
dominance , and labor by consent no longer will hold a position of an
essential economic energy source .
Until such energy dominance is absolutely
established , the consent of the people to labor and let others handle their
affairs must be taken into consideration , since failure to do so could cause
the people to interfere in the final transfer of energy sources to the
control of the elite .
It is essential to recognize this at this time , public consent is still an
essential key to the release of energy in the process of economic
amplification .
Therefore , consent as an energy release mechanism will now be
considered .
LOGISTICS
The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of inputs ,
outputs , the strategy connecting the inputs and the outputs , and the
available energy sources to fuel the strategy .
The study is called
logistics .
A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first ,
and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of
elementary factors .
This means that a given system is analyzed , i.e. broken
down into its sub-systems , and these in turn are analyzed , until , by this
process , one arrives at the logistical `atom ' , the individual .
This is where
the process of synthesis properly begins , and at the time of the birth of
the individual .
THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB
From the time a person leaves its mother 's womb , its every effort is
directed toward building , maintaining , and withdrawing into artificial
wombs , various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells .
The
objective of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for
both stable and unstable activity ; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary
processes of growth , and maturity - i.e. , survival ; to provide security for
freedom and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity .
This is
equally true of both the general public and the elite .
However , there is a
definite difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution
of problems .
THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A NATION - DEPENDENCY -
The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a
political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their own
dependency relationship of childhood .
Simply put , they want a human god to
eliminate all risk from their life , pat them on the head , kiss their
bruises , put a chicken on every dinner table , clothe their bodies , tuck them
into bed at night , and tell them that everything will be all right when they
wake up in the morning .
The public demand is incredible , so the human god ,
the politician , meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the
world and delivering nothing .
So who is the bigger liar ?. the public ? , or
the `godfather ' ?
This public behavior is surrender born of fear , laziness ,
and expediency .
It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon ,
useful against a disgusting public .
ACTION / OFFENSE
Most people want to be able to subdue and / or kill other human beings which
disturb their daily lives , but they do not want to have to cope with the
moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might
raise .
Therefore , they assign the dirty work to others ( including their own
children ) so as to keep the blood off their own hands .
They rave about the
humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from
a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight .
But even more
hypocritical , they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit
men collectively called politicians , and then complain about corruption in
government .
RESPONSIBILITY
Again , most people want to be free to do things ( to explore , etc. ) but they
are afraid to fail .
The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility ,
and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to others where
success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities ( law ) which
the person is not prepared to accept .
They want authority ( root
word - `author ' ) , but will not accept responsibility or liability .
They hire
politicians to face reality for them .
SUMMARY
The people hire the politician so that the people can : ( 1 ) obtain security
without managing it .
( 2 ) obtain action without thinking about it . ( 3 )
inflict theft , injury , and death upon others without having to contemplate
either life or death .
( 4 ) avoid responsibility for their own intentions . ( 5 )
obtain the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in
the discipline of facing or learning either of these things .
They give politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to : ( 1 )
provide for the survival of the NATION / WOMB .
( 2 ) prevent encroachment of
anything upon the NATION / WOMB .
( 3 ) destroy the enemy who threatens the
NATION / WOMB .
( 4 ) destroy those citizens of their own country who do not
conform for the sake of stability of the NATION / WOMB .
Politicians hold many quasi military jobs , the lowest being the police which
are soldiers , the attorneys and the C.P.A.s next are spies and saboteurs
( licensed ) , and the judges who shout the orders and run the closed union
military shop for whatever the market will bear , .
The generals are
industrialists .
The `presidential ' level of commander - in - chief is shared by
the international bankers .
The people know that they have created this force
and financed it with their own taxes ( consent ) , but they would rather
knuckle under than be the hypocrite .
Thus , a nation becomes divided into two
very distinct parts , a DOCILE SUB NATION and a POLITICAL SUB NATION .
The
political sub nation remains attached to the docile sub nation , tolerates
it , and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself
and devour its parent .
SYSTEM ANALYSIS
In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war , the
primary economic flywheel , it is necessary to assign concrete logistical
values to each element of the war structure -- personnel and materiel alike .
This process begins with a clear and candid description of the sub-systems
of such a structure .
THE DRAFT ( As military service . )
Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more
effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft .
A
primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill , by
intimidation , in young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the
government is omnipotent .
He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse
what a bullet can do in an instant .
Thus , a man trained in a religious
environment for eighteen years of his life can , by this instrument of the
government , be broken down , be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a
matter or mere months .
Once that conviction is instilled , all else becomes
easy to install .
Even more interesting is the process by which a young man 's parents , who
purportedly love him , can be induced to send him off to war to his death .
Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in
full detail , nevertheless , a coarse overview will be possible and can serve
to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a
computer analysis of a social and war systems .
We begin with a tentative
definition of the draft .
The draft ( selective service etc. ) is an institution of compulsory
collective sacrifice and slavery , devised by the middle aged and the elderly
for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work .
It
further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders , thus making
criticism of the elders by the young less likely ( Generational Stabilizer ) .
It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of " patriotic *
national " service .
Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved , that definition
is used to outline the boundaries of structure called a Human Value System ,
which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory .
The value of such
a slave laborer is given in a table of Human Values , a table broken down
into categories by intellect , experience , post service job demand , etc. .
Some of these categories are ordinary and can be quantively ( sic ) evaluated in
terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists .
Some jobs
are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social
subversion , for an extreme example : the value of a mother 's instruction to
her daughter causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a
future husband , ten or fifteen years hence , thus , by suppressing his
resistance to a perversion of a government , making it easier for a banking
cartel to buy the State of New York in , say , twenty years .
Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations of wartime espionage and
many types of psychological testing .
But crude mathematical models
( algorithms , etc. ) can be devised , if not to predict , at least to
predetermine these events with maximum certainty .
What does not exist by
natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion .
Human beings
are machines , levers which may be grasped and turned , and there is little
real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory .
These derived values are variable .
( It is necessary to use a current Table
of Human Values for computer analysis . )
These values are given in true
dollars rather than U.S. dollars , since the latter is unstable , being
presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and services ,
tends to give the economy a false kinetic energy ( `paper ' inductance ) .
The
silver value is stable , it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram
of silver today as could be bought in 1920 .
Human value measured in silver
units changes slightly due to changes in production technology .
ENFORCEMENT
FACTOR I
As in every social system approach , stability is achieved only by
understanding and accounting for human nature ( action / reaction patterns ) .
A
failure to do so can be , and usually is , disastrous .
As in other human
social schemes , one form or another of intimidation ( or incentive ) is
essential to the success of the draft .
Physical principles of action and
reaction must be applied to both internal and external sub-systems .
To
secure the draft , individual brainwashing / programing ( sic ) of both the family unit
and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control .
FACTOR II FATHER
The man of the household must be house - broken to assure that junior will
grow up with the right social training and attitudes .
The advertising media ,
etc. , are engaged to see to it that father - to - be is pussy wiped before or by
the time he is married .
He is taught that he either conforms to the social
notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender
companionship will be zero .
He is made to see that women demand security
more than logical , principled , or honorable behavior .
By the time his son
must go to war , father ( with jelly for for a back bone ) will slam a gun into
junior 's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers , or make a
hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal
opinion or self - esteem .
Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed .
So junior will go to war , the true purpose of the war notwithstanding .
FACTOR III MOTHER
The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic
second .
In the battle between logic and imagination , imagination always
wins , fantasy profile , maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes
first and the future comes second .
A woman with a newborn baby is too
starry - eyed to see a wealthy man 's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave
labor .
A woman must ; however , be conditioned to accept the transition to
" reality " when it comes , or sooner .
As the transition becomes more difficult
to manage , the family unit must be carefully disintegrated , and state
controlled public education and state operated child care centers must
become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the
child from the mother and father at an earlier age .
Inoculation of
behavioral drugs can speed the transition for the child ( mandatory ) .
CAUTION : A woman 's impulsive anger can override her fear .
An irate woman's
power over a pussy wiped husband must likewise never be underestimated .
It
got women the vote in 1920 .
FACTOR IV JUNIOR
The emotional pressure for self - preservation during time of war and the
self - serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the
battlefield -- if junior can be persuaded to go -- is all of the pressure
finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war .
Their quiet blackmailing of
him are the threats : " No sacrifice , no friends ; no glory , no girlfriends . "
FACTOR V SISTER
And what about junior 's sister ?
She is given all the good things of life by
her father , and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless
of the price .
FACTOR VI CATTLE
Those who will not use their brains are no better off then those who have no
brains , and so this mindless school of jellyfish , father , mother , son , and
courtier , become useful beasts of burden .

document .

Updated , 7:30 p.m. |
After a spirited , emotional and at times raucous debate , the New York City Council voted , 29 to 22 , on Thursday afternoon to extend term limits , allowing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to seek re-election next year and undoing the result of two voter referendums that had imposed a limit of two four - year terms .
The vote was a major victory for Mayor Bloomberg — a billionaire and lifelong Democrat who was elected mayor as a Republican in 2001 , won re-election in 2005 , became an independent last year , and decided just weeks ago that he wished to seek a third term for himself in 2009 — and for the Council ’s speaker , Christine C. Quinn .
But the intense acrimony surrounding the decision left a sharply divided Council and could ultimately damage the mayor ’s popularity .
The new law , which earlier on Thursday sailed through a committee vote , limits elected officials to three consecutive terms and applies to all of the city ’s elected officials .
It has already begun to upend municipal politics , reshaping the dynamics of next year ’s races .
Of the Council ’s 51 members , 35 would have been barred by term limits from seeking re-election next year .
On Thursday , 23 of those members voted in favor of extending term limits , and 12 voted against .
The Council has 48 Democrats and three Republicans .
All three Republicans — James S. Oddo and Vincent M. Ignizio , of Staten Island , and Anthony Como of Queens — voted no .
Over two days of public hearings lasting 19.5 hours last week , and in the floor debate on Thursday , both sides argued that their position was in the best interests of the people .
Opponents of the bill accused the mayor and his supporters on the Council of flouting the will of the people — as expressed in a 1993 voter initiative that established a limit of two consecutive terms and a 1996 referendum in which voters rejected a Council - led effort to change the limit to three terms .
They said that democratic procedure demanded a public vote on the issue , no matter what one thinks of Mr. Bloomberg or term limits .
Supporters of the bill said the dire economic situation confronting the city — and the possibility of multibillion - dollar budget shortfalls — demanded continuity of leadership .
They said term limits deprived voters of the opportunity to return dedicated politicians to office .
They argued that it would be too costly and difficult to put the matter back before the people by holding a special election early next year .
Most experts agreed that the Council had the legal authority to amend the City Charter and override a law created by a referendum , but opponents said lawmakers had no moral right to do so .
Two council members had gone to court , arguing that it was a conflict of interest for lawmakers to extend their own terms , but a judge refused to block the vote .
After Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum , who presides over the Council , announced the final result at 4:35 p.m. , the balcony erupted in shouts of “ The city ’s for sale ! ” and “ Shame on you ! ”
Mayor Bloomberg ’s office issued a statement minutes after the Council ’s vote :
Today , the majority of the City Council decided to give the people of New York a fuller choice in the November 2009 election .
I believe that was the right choice , and I want to thank Speaker Quinn for her leadership .
Those of us who work on both sides of City Hall must now move forward with the important decisions that face us , particularly finding ways to soften the fallout from the economic downturn and balancing our budget as revenues decline .
We have a lot of work to do together to get New York through these tough times .
But the city comptroller , William C. Thompson Jr. , condemned the vote , calling it “ an affront to New Yorkers . ”
“ It says that their votes and their voice do not matter , that bullying and heavy - handed threats are more powerful than democratic ideals , ” said Mr. Thompson , a Democrat who had planned to run for mayor next year .
“ I am saddened that our mayor and majority of City Council members have put individuals before principles .
Today our government chose to empower itself rather than the people it serves . ”
Representative Anthony D. Weiner of Queens and Brooklyn , who sought the Democratic nomination for mayor in 2005 , said outside City Hall , “ Today is a sad day for New York ’s democracy , and I ’m disappointed . ”
He added : “ I ’m running for mayor .
The middle class and those struggling to make it in this city deserve to have a voice .
They had their voice taken away from them today , and I ’m going to fight to be that voice . ”
Earlier , at 3:22 p.m. , the Council rejected , 28 to 22 , a key amendment that would have called for a public referendum on term limits by summoning a Charter Revision Commission , which would schedule a special election .
One member , James Sanders Jr. of Queens , abstained on the amendment .
Opponents of the bill to extend term limits saw the amendment as their best chance of stopping the mayor .
When Ms. Gotbaum announced the vote count on the amendment , groans erupted from the balcony , which was packed with members of the public opposed to extending term limits without a public vote .
( See the end of this article for the full roll calls on the amendment and the bill , and a related map showing the council members voted . )
The Council immediately turned its attention to the mayor ’s bill , and so began the main floor debate .
The Floor Debate
Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn , who supported the amendment , warned his colleagues that the Council ’s legitimacy would be forever tarnished .
“ The people of the city will long remember what we have done here today , and the people will be unforgiving , ” Mr. de Blasio said .
“ We are stealing like a thief in the night their right to shape our democracy . ”
Councilman David Yassky of Brooklyn , one of three members who had introduced the amendment , announced that despite its defeat , he would vote for the underlying bill .
He said that term limits were bad public policy and that a limit of 12 years , instead of 8 , would help strengthen future lawmakers in the face of strong mayors .
Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn adamantly disagreed .
“ The city of New York has never , ever in the history of our nation postponed a transfer of power , regardless of the circumstances , ” she said , citing an editorial in The New York Times in 2001 , when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sought , without his success , to extend his term by three months in the aftermath of 9/11 .
“ My constituency wants the opportunity to vote for this , ” and if they do not have that opportunity , “ they want me to vote no , ” Councilwoman Rosie Mendez of Manhattan said .
Councilman Tony Avella of Queens called the term limits bill “ an absolute disgrace , ” and warned sternly : “ You ’re not conning anybody .
The public of this city knows that the fix was in from the beginning . ”
He added : “ You should all be voted out of office for voting for this .
Vote this down ! ”
Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr. of Brooklyn urged his colleagues to extend term limits , citing the economic crisis .
He paraphrased Abraham Lincoln , who ran for re-election in 1864 during the Civil War , as saying , “ When crossing a river you do n’t swap horses halfway . ”
Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn said he would vote to extend term limits because he had always believed they were a bad idea .
“ I ’m pleased that the billionaires have finally come around to my point of view , ” he said to laughter , adding that he did not care about any of the three billionaires who have inserted themselves into the debate : Mayor Bloomberg , Ronald S. Lauder and Tom Golisano .
Councilman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx said the Council was acting within its full authority to amend the City Charter , which was amended in 1993 by a voter initiative that imposed a two - term limit .
“ The Charter can be amended in different ways for different things , ” he said .
“ We ’re acting within the rules . ”
Councilman John C. Liu of Queens denounced what he called the “ arrogance ” of Mayor Bloomberg , who promised Mr. Lauder that he would convene a charter revision commission in 2010 to revisit the issue of term limits .
Such a commission should be convened next year instead , he said .
Councilman Eric N. Gioia of Queens urged his colleagues to preserve the existing term limits , saying , “ It ’s no wonder that people no longer trust politics or politicians . ”
‘ An Ethical Bind ’
Councilman Alan J. Gerson of Manhattan , one of the three authors of the amendment , drew hisses from the balcony when he announced he would support the underlying bill :
The possibility of a referendum is now impossible — unfortunately , in my opinion .
We are therefore left with two stark alternatives : either we decide not to extend term limits , or we decide to extend term limits .
The same democratic principles which led me to support a referendum compels me , under this choice before us , to vote yes on this bill .
While a public vote would have been preferable , Mr. Gerson said , “ it would set a terrible precedent to raise a referendum result to the level of absolute constitutional principle . ”
He said New Yorkers deserved to have “ a debate ” about the merits of continuity in leadership .
As the main roll call got under way at 4 p.m. , Councilman Charles Barron , a firebrand on the Council , attacked Mr. Recchia by name , saying , “ We ’ve got to prioritize the will of the people over the fish of your aquarium , ” a reference to the New York Aquarium , which is in Mr. Recchia ’s southern Brooklyn district and has received city financing .
Mr. Barron told Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. , who earlier had quoted Thomas Jefferson .
“ If you ’re gong to quote somebody , do n’t quote Jefferson , a slave - holding pedophile , ” Mr. Barron thundered .
Mr. Barron concluded , “ Even though the mayor will win today , he is the big loser , because he lost democracy , he lost the favor of the people . ”
Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer of Manhattan said she was in an “ ethical bind ” and said she felt she was open to “ accusations of hypocrisy . ”
She decided to vote no on extending term limits .
“ This is a defining moment , a game - changing moment , that marks not the end of a process , but the beginning of a process , ” Ms. James said as she cast her dissenting vote .
“ If my constituents are not satisfied with the work I ’ve done on the City Council , they will vote me out , ” Councilman Miguel Martinez of Manhattan said as he voted yes .
“ Yes , we will ! ” came a cry from the balcony , as Ms. Gotbaum banged the gavel , calling for order .
Similarly , as Councilman James Vacca of the Bronx announced that he was voting yes , a voice from the balcony cried out , “ Sell - out ! ”
Councilman Thomas White Jr. of Queens was in an unusual position :
He was forced out by term limits after the 2001 elections but came back to the Council after defeating his successor , Allan W. Jennings Jr. , who was censured by the Council for sexually harassing subordinates .
Mr. Yassky tried to preserve his image as a reformer .
“ I do n’t think that the throw - the - bums - out policy that is embodied in term limits and in Ron Lauder ’s campaign to maintain it is reform , ” Mr. Yassky said before voting yes .
Councilman James S. Oddo , the leader of the three - member Republican minority on the 51 - member Council , said jokingly that he was hesitant about giving a speech because “ I ’ve had enough YouTube exposure for two lifetimes . ”
( A video of Mr. Oddo cursing loudly at a Borat - style prankster was widely circulated on YouTube . )
Mr. Oddo warned , “ When the gods wish to punish us , they answer our prayers . ”
He voted no .
Debating the Amendment
The Council meeting began at 2:22 p.m. , nearly an hour after the scheduled start time of 1:30 p.m. , and began with a speech from the Council speaker , Ms. Quinn .
“ This is a difficult vote in very difficult times , ” she said .
Reiterating arguments she made hours earlier , at a news conference , Ms. Quinn argued that continuity of leadership was essential , saying the city faces its gravest crisis since the Depression .
She added :
Make no mistake : I believe that our great city will get through these challenges and emerge stronger than ever before .
I also believe that in challenging times like these , the voters should have the choice — the choice to continue their current leadership .
They should have the right to vote for the current mayor , or a new one , for their current City Council member , or a new one .
That is exactly what is at stake today .
When Ms. Quinn said it was “ ludicrous ” for critics to suggest the bill was the product of a “ back - room deal , ” a chorus of boos and jeers erupted from the balcony .
Ms. Quinn said the bill had been the subject of vigorous discussion , including “ two , well - attended public hearings , 20 hours of public hearings and a vigorous debate . ”
“ Support for this bill is broad and deep , ” she said , citing union officials and former elected officials like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Edward I. Koch .
“ From Floyd Flake to Felix Rohatyn , the brightest minds with the deepest understanding of the crisis this impact could have in our neighborhoods have come forward in support of extending term limits from two terms to three , ” she said .
In one year , she said , “ voters will have the right to re-elect us , or defeat us , in the voting booth . ”
“ The debate today is an important one , but ultimately it is a debate about process , ” she said , adding , “ By passing this bill , we are increasing voter choice . ”
She added , “ None of us are arrogant enough to believe we are indispensable .
But we are confident enough and secure enough in our ability to help this city we love that we are willing to stand before voters on Election Day and ask them to re-elect us . ”
Ms. Quinn tried to preempt criticism that the bill represents “ a deal between billionaires , with no one else having a say , ” by arguing that she and other supporters of the bill are far from billionaires .
Mr. Yassky , of Brooklyn , spoke next .
He rose and proposed an amendment that would require a public referendum on term limits , by convening a Charter Revision Commission .
He said the commission could call a special election on term limits for early next year .
Mr. Yassky said he opposed term limits but that the Council ’s legitimacy as a democratic body was at stake .
“ Voters have approved term limits twice , including once when they specifically chose to keep the two - term limit rather than go to three terms .
For us to reject those votes and those voters will , without question , make New Yorkers more cynical about politics , ” he said .
Mr. Yassky cited a Quinnipiac University poll showing that 89 percent of voters supported a referendum .
“ That should tell you that a referendum is the right way to go , ” he said , to scattered applause from the balcony .
“ The only serious objection I have heard to a referendum is that it might lose , ” he said .
Mr. Yassky said that with an “ extraordinarily popular mayor , ” newspaper editorial pages and lawmakers on its side , a measure to extend term limits would pass a popular vote .
Mr. de Blasio agreed .
“ By voting yes on the amendment , we are saying to the people of New York City that we respect what they require of us as public servants , ” he said .
Councilman Charles Barron , of Brooklyn , assailed Ms. Quinn ’s logic .
“ If we are talking about a direct democracy , where the people rule , and a representative democracy , where those who represent the people come to vote — if you do this , you ’re undermining the very people who vote you in to represent them , because their voices were already heard , ” he said .
Mr. Barron , a fiery critic of Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg , added , “ The bottom line : Mayor Bloomberg has not been the best person to run this city .
It was under this watch we got into this economic mess .
He came in worth $ 5 billion .
He ’s now worth $ 20 billion .
And he comes to this Council wanting to cut the budget . ”
Mr. Barron noted that voters in Venezuela in 2007 rejected a proposal by President Hugo Chávez that would have allowed him to run for re-election indefinitely .
“ Mayor Bloomberg , be like Hugo , and let the people decide , ” Mr. Barron said .
“ I personally am against term limits , but I am against a process that does n’t go back to the voters , ” said Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens .
‘ Let ’s Have a Backbone ’
Mr. Gerson , of Manhattan said , “ We are left with selecting among alternatives which each have significant flaws , ” and called it “ a difficult , wrenching decision . ”
He noted that the amendment was structured so that if a special election could not be held early enough for next year ’s election cycle , the Council could revisit the issue .
Councilman Lewis A. Fidler , a Brooklyn Democrat , called the amendment “ a cure that ’s worse than the disease . ”
Because of the need for a Justice Department voting rights review and the time to convene a Charter Revision Commission , Mr. Fidler said , there was little realistic chance that a special election could be held before nominating petitions will be circulated in June for the November 2009 election .
Council members Letitia James and Vincent J. Gentile of Brooklyn argued that extending term limits would damage the body ’s legitimacy .
“ From the very beginning , the process has been the problem , ” Mr. Gentile said .
“ The amendment will let the public know that their voices are being heard as clearly as ever . ”
Councilman Robert Jackson of Manhattan said he had always been an implacable opponent of term limits .
“ Let ’s have a backbone , ” he said , saying his colleagues had been elected to represent their constituents .
Councilman Anthony Como of Queens said it would cost $ 15 million to hold a special election “ and we know what the answer is going to be . ”
Mr. Como urged his colleagues to vote no on both the amendment and the underlying bill .
Councilwoman Rosie Mendez of Manhattan disagreed .
“ It does n’t matter if the cost is $ 5 million , $ 15 million or $ 15 billion , ” she said .
“ The people have a right to vote . ” Council members Annabel Palma of the Bronx and Vincent M. Ignizio of Staten Island said they agreed .
Councilman John C. Liu , of Queens , said he opposed term limits , but argued that to abolish them without a popular vote would foster cynicism .
“ Term limits were not enacted in New York City as the result of a rich man ’s ad campaign , as has been suggested , but were born out of a deep cynicism for politics , for elected officials , not only here in New York City , but all across America , ” he said .
Councilman Tony Avella of Queens gave a stirring speech :
The people voted twice for term limits .
Their message could not have been clearer .
for this body to overturn that without going back to the people is undemocratic and disgraceful .
There is no excuse for this .
Pass the amendment .
Put it back to the people .
Anything less than that just goes to the heart of what people say about politicians .
Do you want to be remembered as the politicians who voted to ignore the will of the people ?
A Packed Chamber
Even before the meeting started , as members took their red leather seats , throngs of journalists had assembled on both sides of the Council ’s dais .
The Council ’s sergeants - at - arms restricted access to the main floor of the chamber to lawmakers , their staffs and the press ; ordinary members of the public were directed to the balcony , which was standing - room - only .
But many people who tried to enter the chamber were turned away by the sergeants - at - arms .
One was Gene Russianoff , the senior attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group , a government watchdog group that has been opposed to the mayor ’s effort to extend term limits .
He made several attempts to plead with the Council ’s doorkeepers to get access and was rebuffed each time .
Finally , he said , he threw himself on the mercy of one of the Council staff members whom he had known for some time .
In the end , he was able to get a seat in the balcony .
“ I was able to get in because of the relationship I have with some people on the staff here , ” Mr. Russianoff said .
“ But the average New Yorker would not have fared as well as I did .
That ’s a problem for the average New Yorker who wants to participate in the process . ”
Dan Cantor , the executive director of the Working Families Party , was not so fortunate .
He got as far as the hallway outside of the Council Chamber but was told that he could n’t enter the large meeting room .
“ It ’s outrageous that they are keeping people out of the meeting , ” said Mr. Cantor , whose organization has also been a leading opponent to the Council extending term limits .
“ They know that this meeting would draw a lot of interest from the public , ” Mr. Cantor said .
“ And they should have made some provisions to accommodate the public . ”

How the Council Members Voted [ Chart and Map ]
Imagine losing control over everything .
You can't move on your own .
You can't scratch an itch .
And worse still , you can't tell anyone around you that you have an itch .
You can feel pain , hunger , loneliness , and fear , but you can't react to those sensations .
You are totally aware of your surroundings , but you can't communicate your feelings or desires , or even your basic needs .
The term for this horror is locked - in syndrome .
Someone with locked - in syndrome suffers from paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for those that move the eyes .
This can be caused by neurological disease such as ALS , strokes , injuries to the brain stem , or drug overdose .
The term locked - in syndrome has only been in use since the 1960s .
Before that , people who suffered such traumatic injuries generally died from them , or else they were considered to be brain damaged .
Here are the stories of eight people who have lived this nightmare .
Julia Tavalaro
One of the dangers of locked in syndrome is the possibility of misdiagnosis .
No one knows how many people lived for years and died unable to tell anyone around them that they were conscious and aware .
Julia Tavalaro was a 27 - year - old housewife and mother in 1967 when she suffered multiple strokes that left her completely paralyzed .
Doctors thought she was brain dead .
Tavalaro was sent to a custodial institution where she lived for six years without anyone knowing she was aware of her surroundings .
She was fed through a tube and cared for physically , but had no real interaction with her caretakers .
In 1973 , a speech therapist noticed Tavalaro 's eyes moving in reaction to her words .
Afterward , Tavalaro was given physical therapy and an opportunity to communicate , first by a letter board , then later by operating a computer by tapping a switch with her cheek .
She also learned to control her wheelchair by head movements .
Tavalaro wrote a book about her experiences , Look Up For Yes , and became a renowned poet .
She died in 2003 , at the age of 68 .
Nick Chisholm
New Zealander Nick Chisholm was 23 when he had a rugby accident in 2000 .
A resulting series of strokes left him paralyzed and unable to communicate .
For the first three months , he could n't even open his eyes .
During this time , he was fully conscious and heard medical personnel discussing his imminent death and asking his mother if she wanted to remove life support .
After several months , his mother and girlfriend convinced doctors that he was aware and thinking .
Chisholm could move his eyes , and communicated by staring at letters on a letter board .
His story is told in his own words , with medical explanations added .
Words can't describe the situation I have been left in — but this is as close as I can get it : an extremely horrific experience that I would n't wish on my worst enemy .
When you 're like this ( despite having 24 hour care ) it 's an incredibly lonely existence at times .
It 's amazing how much time I have to think about things now since the accident .
There 's heaps of thoughts that I do n't bother even expressing .
Chisholm writes about contemplating suicide , although he did n't have the ability to carry it out .
He has since regained some movement , and can pronounce some words .
Chisholm is working toward a full recovery .
Bob Veilette
Bob Veilette was a Connecticut journalist and an accomplished jazz pianist in 2006 when a stroke left him with locked - in syndrome .
After six months in a hospital , his family elected to care for him at home instead of putting him in a nursing home .
That decision meant that Connecticut 's Medicaid program would not cover the costs of his care , even though a nursing home would have been much more expensive .
Veilette joined a movement to reform the system , although the changes they are working for will not benefit him personally for years .
Private fundraisers support the family , but Veilette has had no speech or occupational therapy , and only limited physical therapy due to expenses .
Veilette communicates with a letter board held by an assistant .
He had no luck with a computer that tracks eye movements , because fluctuations in the size of his pupils upset the tracking .
Catherine O'Leary
31 - year - old Catherine O'Leary suffered from hiccups for three years before the cause was discovered to be a brain tumor .
During surgery to remove the tumor , a series of strokes left her completely paralyzed .
She communicates by blinking ; one blink for yes , two blinks for no .
Eight months after the surgery , she can move her facial muscles somewhat , but still cannot speak due to a tracheotomy that allows her to breathe .
Her brother is working to raise enough money to send her to America for medical treatment .
Jean - Dominique Bauby
French journalist Jean- Dominique Bauby was 43 when he suffered a massive stroke in 1995 .
He was left with only the ability to blink his left eye .
Bauby died less than two years later , but managed to write his memoir by waiting for an assistant to recite the French alphabet .
He would blink when the right letter was pronounced .
Using this method , he had to construct and edit each sentence and chapter in his head .
The resulting book was The Diving Bell and The Butterfly ( Le scaphandre et le papillon ) .
Bauby died of pneumonia only ten days after the book was published .
It was made into a film released in 2007 .
Gary Griffin
Air Force veteran Gary Griffin is immobile due to ALS ( Lou Gehrig 's disease ) .
He uses a device called the NeuroSwitch to control a computer and communicate with his family .
Sensors are attached to the skin over a patient 's muscles and signals are sent to an interface that translates the slightest muscle contractions into usable code .
The company 's website says even muscles that are considered non-functional may be used .
Johnnie Ray
Advances in assistive technology gives new hope to those with disabilities , including locked - in syndrome .
Johnny Ray suffered a brain stem stroke in 1997 that left him unable to move .
In 1998 , he volunteered for an experimental procedure developed by by Philip Kennedy , Roy Bakay , and the team at the Neural Interfacing Research Institute .
Sensors were implanted in Ray 's brain that allowed him to move a cursor on a computer with his thoughts .
" We simply make a hole in the skull right above the ear , near the back end of the motor cortex , secure our electrodes and other hardware to the bone so they do n't migrate , and wait for a signal , " Bakay says .
The implant is an intriguing hybrid of electronics and biology - it physically melds with brain tissue .
After implantation , the research team calibrated the interface by asking ray to think about certain movements , and the software was programmed to respond to such signals .
Ray used the cursor to spell words and even generate musical tones on a computer .
Erik Ramsey
Dr. Kennedy is taking that technology a step further for his latest patient .
Erik Ramsey was seriously injured in a car wreck in 1999 when he was 16 years old .
A blood clot lodged in his brain stem and caused a stroke .
Erik lost all voluntary muscle function , except for the ability to move his eyes up and down .
He learned to communicate with his family using a letter board .
In 2001 , he inexplicably lost the ability to spell when he was hospitalized for pneumonia .
Since then , he communicates only by rolling his eyes up for yes , and down for no .
In 2004 , Dr. Kennedy and his team implanted sensors in Ramsey 's brain that can convert thoughts into speech .
So far , he can think of the movements that produce vowel sounds and the computer recreates those sounds .
The team hopes to program the interface to achieve consonant sounds within a year .

My husband and I visit the Katy area often , as we are in the process of opening a business in Katy , Texas .
We have stayed at this hotel several times in the last year with no problems .
During our last stay in July , we checked into the hotel for two nights .
When I got to my vehicle the morning of the second day it had been broken into .
The passenger side window of my Ford F - 150 truck was broken and over $ 5,000 worth of items were stolen .
I ran back inside and asked the desk clerk to call 911 .
Of course I was crying and she stood there just looking at me .
I asked her again to call the police .
She said , I will have to get a manager .
I yelled at her to just call the police .
They finally agreed to call the police .
When the police officer arrived , a report was filled .
The manager , Stephanie , proceeded to tell the police officer that this has happened a lot recently .
The police officer told her that they need to hire an officer or security guard to protect there patrons vehicles and belongings .
A cleaning lady who had worked that evening , who spoke no english , starting talking to Stephanie .
Stephanie translated to the officer what she was saying .
She told Stephanie , the officer and myself that another guest had come to the front desk very early that morning and said that someone 's vehicle was being broken into out in the parking lot .
The night manager sent this little lady out the front door to see if she could see anything .
The guest who notified the front desk was not questioned and the police were not called .
My complaint is that they did not handle this situation correctly .
They should have immediately notified the police !
When I found my vehicle broken into and the police arrived at the scene it had just started raining , so no finger prints could be taken .
The police officer even said to me that they should have been contacted immediately when the report was made by the other guest .
I have contacted the hotel via email with a list of items that were stolen from my vehicle .
They said that they are not responsible for items that are left in a vehicle .
My auto insurance does not cover for these items either .
All of my business records were stolen .
It ahs taken me over a month to replace some of the items that were stolen .
Many things that were stolen can never be replaced .
I am upset because the hotel did nothing !
I would like to see the hotel install a security system .
I would also like to be reimbursed for the items that were stolen from my vehicle .
If no reports had been made then they should not be liable , but because the had time to stop the violation from occurring or contact the police , they should be liable for the items taken and damage to my vehicle .

They are likely old news to many , but I figure there are at least a few others who have not come across them .
Britney Spears ' much - hyped new album , Circus , is set to drop December 2 and MTV 's documentary on her , " For the Record , " airs on November 30 at 10 p.m .
In an interview for the special , Britney compares her life to Groundhog Day , the movie starring Bill Murray , whose character repeats the same day perpetually :
“ There ’s no excitement , there ’s no passion .
I have really good days , and then I have bad days ...
Even when you go to jail you know there ’s a time when you ’re gonna get out .
But in this situation , it ’s never ending .
It ’s like Groundhog Day every day . ”
Britney Spears continued to philosophize :
“ I think it ’s too in control .
If I was n’t under the restraints I ’m under , I ’d feel liberated .
When I tell them the way I feel , it ’s like they hear but they ’re really not listening .
I never wanted to be one of those prisoner people .
I always wanted to feel free . "
We have no idea what she 's even talking about , to be honest , although we are reminded of The Office quotes in which the Dunder - Mifflin Scranton employees pretend life is better in jail than work ... where they must do the same things every day .
Here 's a new MTV promo for the " For the Record " documentary ...
The five - a- day dunces :
One in ten parents thinks Jaffa Cakes , chips and cola count as your fruit and veg
Perhaps it 's the orangey bit in the middle which fools them .
For although most of us would n't consider a Jaffa Cake a particularly healthy snack , one in ten parents apparently thinks they pass as fruit .
And according to a survey into family eating habits , Jaffa Cakes are n't the only food to cause confusion .
Unbalanced diet : Chips are mistakenly thought to count towards a child 's intake of fruit and vegetables
Cola , chips , spaghetti hoops and orange squash are also mistakenly thought to count towards a child 's intake of fruit and vegetables , researchers found .
Overall , only one in five families ensures their children eat the recommended five portions a day .
And one in 20 children have diets totally free of fruit and veg , according to the poll .
Nutritionist Vanessa McConkey said : ' It is both disappointing and concerning to see that the five - aday message is n't getting through clearly enough to parents .
Good eating habits start at home and British parents need to get their children into the habit of eating more vegetables and fruit . '
Parents with under - 14s were asked about their eating habits for the poll conducted for canned and frozen vegetable firm Green Giant .
One in five thought that fruit - flavoured sweets , spaghetti hoops and orange squash counted towards the daily target .
And although one in ten believed Jaffa Cakes , chips and cola contributedone in 20 thought oranges or bananas did n't .
Meanwhile , 15 per cent of parents said they did n't think it was their job to teach their children about healthy eating .
They believed grandparents , teachers , doctors and celebrity chefs were better qualified to do so .
A university study of the dietary and exercise habits of more than 2,000 nine and ten - year - olds identified a similar trend .
The majority of the boys and girls met Government guidelines of exercising for a least an hour a day , according to the research , carried out by the University of East Anglia and the Medical Research Council .
However , just 41 per cent ate at least one piece of fruit and one serving of vegetables a day , the journal BMC Public Health reports .
Tam Fry , an expert on child health and diet , said the results showed that neither parents nor children knew what constituted a healthy diet .
Mr Fry , of the Child Growth Foundation and the National Obesity Forum , said : ' The major problem - is that we have got a generationof parents and a generation of children who think that a potato is a thin white slither which you take out of the freezer .
' I do n't think anyone would deny that the fruit and vegetable message is anything but the right one to give .
' The problem is that sometimes it does n't taste too nice . '
One apple , two plums or half a grapefruit counts as one of the recommended five a day .
Eight Brussels sprouts , three heaped tablespoons of sweetcorn or two spears of broccoli also count as a serving .
Middle - class families are the most likely to have obese children , officials say .
Although affluent families know all about healthy eating and the importance of exercise , they are in ' denial ' about changes they need to make , the Government study found .
The Department of Health said this group , which it called ' The Treaters ' , was the most to blame for the childhood obesity epidemic .
Wenn Peter Gloor wissen will , wer neuer US - Präsident wird , dann befragt er seinen Computer .
Auf diesem hat der Forscher am renommierten Massachusetts Institute of Technology das von ihm mitentwickelte Programm „ Condor “ installiert .
Die Software ermöglicht ihm den Blick in die Zukunft : Statt auszuzählen , was ein Haufen repräsentativer Wähler meint , sondiert Condor in Sekundenschnelle die Meinungslage im gesamten Web .
Denn Peter Gloor hält nicht viel von Meinungsumfragen .
Was nicht heißt , dass er an der Meinung der Menschen nicht interessiert wäre – ganz im Gegenteil .
Umfragen sind ihm einfach „ zu ungenau , nicht aktuell genug “ , eine veraltete Technik eben .
In Sachen US - Präsidentschaft ähnelt das so errechnete Ergebnis zwar dem der klassischen Umfragewerte – Obama klar vor McCain – , die Methodik ist aber deutlich komplexer .
Analyse von Blog- Kommentaren
Was Gloor mit seinen Kollegen betreibt , ist keine Wahrsagerei , sondern Trendforschung .
Um neue Entwicklungen schon im Ansatz zu erkennen , sollen dabei die Trendsetter ausfindig gemacht werden .
Das Condor - Tool durchsucht Web - Seiten , Foren und Blogs nach positiven und negativen Aussagen über Obama und McCain .
Das Zählen positiver und negativer Äußerungen ist aber nur der Anfang .
Ähnlich wie Suchmaschinen analysiert Condor anschließend , wie relevant die Einträge sind : Führen viele Links zu der entsprechenden Seite ?
Gibt es Antworten auf Foreneinträge , Kommentare zu Blog -Einträgen ?
Alles Indizien dafür , dass die Nachricht nicht nur in der
Welt ist , sondern auch viele Menschen erreicht .
Je wichtiger die erreichten Leute sind , desto höher steigt der Wert dessen , was man in der Netzwerkanalyse „ Betweenness “ nennt .
„ Wer 100 Freunde hat , und alle sind aus dem Kegelverein , hat weniger Einfluss als jemand , der nur zwei Freunde hat , wenn diese Barack Obama und Bill Gates heißen “ , sagt Gloor .
Our oligarchic class is incompetent at governing , managing the economy , coping with natural disasters , educating our young , handling foreign affairs , providing basic services like health care and safeguarding individual rights .
That it is still in power , and will remain in power after this election , is a testament to our inability to separate illusion from reality .
We still believe in “ the experts . ”
They still believe in themselves .
They are clustered like flies swarming around John McCain and Barack Obama .
It is only when these elites are exposed as incompetent parasites and dethroned that we will have any hope of restoring social , economic and political order .
“ Their inability to see the human as anything more than interest driven made it impossible for them to imagine an actively organized pool of disinterest called the public good , ” said the Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul , whose books “ The Unconscious Civilization ” and “ Voltaire ’s Bastards ” excoriates our oligarchic elites .
“ It is as if the Industrial Revolution had caused a severe mental trauma , one that still reaches out and extinguishes the memory of certain people .
For them , modern history begins from a big explosion — the Industrial Revolution .
This is a standard ideological approach : a star crosses the sky , a meteor explodes , and history begins anew . ”
Our elites — the ones in Congress , the ones on Wall Street and the ones being produced at prestigious universities and business schools — do not have the capacity to fix our financial mess .
Indeed , they will make it worse .
They have no concept , thanks to the educations they have received , of the common good .
They are stunted , timid and uncreative bureaucrats who are trained to carry out systems management .
They see only piecemeal solutions which will satisfy the corporate structure .
They are about numbers , profits and personal advancement .
They are as able to deny gravely ill people medical coverage to increase company profits as they are able to use taxpayer dollars to peddle costly weapons systems to blood - soaked dictatorships .
The human consequences never figure into their balance sheets .
The democratic system , they think , is a secondary product of the free market .
And they slavishly serve the market .
Andrew Lahde , the Santa Monica , Calif. , hedge fund manager who made an 870 percent gain last year by betting on the subprime mortgage collapse , has abruptly shut down his fund , citing the risk of trading with faltering banks .
In his farewell letter to his investors he excoriated the elites who run our investment houses , banks and government .
“ The low - hanging fruit , i.e. idiots whose parents paid for prep school , Yale , and then the Harvard MBA , was there for the taking , ” he said of our oligarchic class .
“ These people who were ( often ) truly not worthy of the education they received ( or supposedly received ) rose to the top of companies such as AIG , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government .
All of this behavior supporting the Aristocracy only ended up making it easier for me to find people stupid enough to take the other side of my trades .
God bless America . ”
“ On the issue of the U.S. Government , I would like to make a modest proposal , ” he went on .
“ First , I point out the obvious flaws , whereby legislation was repeatedly brought forth to Congress over the past eight years , which would have [ reined ] in the predatory lending practices of now mostly defunct institutions .
These institutions regularly filled the coffers of both parties in return for voting down all of this legislation designed to protect the common citizen .
This is an outrage , yet no one seems to know or care about it .
Since Thomas Jefferson and Adam Smith passed , I would argue that there has been a dearth of worthy philosophers in this country , at least ones focused on improving government . ”
Democracy is not an outgrowth of free markets .
Democracy and capitalism are antagonistic entities .
Democracy , like individualism , is not based on personal gain but on self - sacrifice .
A functioning democracy must defy the economic interests of elites on behalf of citizens .
This is not happening .
The corporate managers and government officials trying to fix the economic meltdown are pouring money and resources into the financial sector because they only know how to manage and sustain established systems , not change them .
Financial systems , however , are not pure scientific and numerical abstractions that exist independently from human beings .
“ When the elite begin to think that money is real , the crash is coming , ” Saul said in a telephone interview .
“ That is just a given in history .
Because what they ’ve done is pull themselves out of the possibility of looking in the mirror and thinking , this is inflation , speculation , this is fluff .
They ca n’t do it .
And when you say to them , gosh , this is not real .
And they say , oh , you do n’t understand , you ’re so old - fashioned , you still think this is about manufacturing .
And of course , it ’s basic economics .
And that ’s what happens every single time .
“ The difficulty is you have a collapse , you have a loss of face by the people who are there , and it ’s not just George Bush , it ’s very , very deep , ” Saul said .
“ What we ’re talking about is the need to rethink the departments of economics , of political science .
Then you have to rethink the whole analytic method of the World Bank .
If I ’m the secretary of the treasury , and not a guy like [ Henry ] Paulson , but I mean a sort of normal secretary of the treasury or minister of finance , and I say , OK , we ’ve got a real problem , let ’s get the senior civil servants in here .
Gentlemen , ladies , OK , clearly we have to go in another direction , give me some ideas .
Well , those people do n’t have any other ideas because at this point they ’re about the fourth generation of what you might call neoconservative globalist managers , unfairly summarized .
So they then go to the people who work for them , and you work down ; there ’s no one in there with an alternate approach .
I mean they ’ll have little alternatives , but no basic differences in opinion .
And so it ’s very difficult to turn anything around because they ’ve eliminated all opposing ideas inside .
I mean it ’s the problem of the Soviet Union , right ? ”
Saul pointed out that the first three aims of the corporatist movement in Germany , Italy and France during the 1920s , those that went on to become part of the Fascist experience , were “ to shift power directly to economic and social interest groups , to push entrepreneurial initiative in areas normally reserved for public bodies ” and to “ obliterate the boundaries between public and private interest — that is , challenge the idea of the public interest . ”
Sound familiar ?
“ There are a handful of people who have n’t been published in mainstream journals , who have n’t been listened to , who have been marginalized in every way , ” Saul said .
“ There are a couple of them and you could turn to them .
But then who do you give the orders to ?
And the people you give the orders to , they are not going to understand the orders because it has n’t been a part of their education .
So it ’s a real problem of a good general who suddenly finds that his junior generals and brigadiers and corporals , you want them to do irregular warfare and they only know how to do trenches .
And so how the hell do you get them to do this thing which they ’ve never been trained to do ?
And so you get this kind of disorder , confusion inside , and the danger of what rises up there is populism ; we ’ve already had populism in a way , but we could get more populism , more fear and anger . ”
We may elect representatives to Congress to end the war in Iraq , but the war goes on .
We may plead with these representatives to halt Bush ’s illegal wiretapping but the telecommunications lobbyists make sure it remains in place .
We may beg them not to pass the bailout but 850 billion taxpayer dollars are funneled upward to the elites on Wall Street .
We may want single - payer , not - for - profit health care but it is not even discussed as a possibility in presidential debates .
We , as individuals in this system , are irrelevant .
“ I ’ve talked to several Supreme Court justices , several times in several countries , ” Saul told me , “ and I say , look , in your rulings , can you differentiate easily in cases between the social contract and the commercial contract , and to which the answer is , we can no longer differentiate .
And that lies at the heart of the problem .
You do n’t have the concept of the other , and of obligation of the individual leading to individualism .
You ca n’t have that if the whole legal system has slipped over the last , really , 50 years , increasingly , to a confusion between the social contract and the commercial contract .
Because they are two completely different things .
The social contract is about the public good , responsible individualism , imagining the other .
The commercial contract is a commercial contract .
They ’re not supposed to be confused .
They do n’t actually fit together .
The commercial contract only works properly when the social contract works in a democracy . ”
The working class , which has desperately borrowed money to stay afloat as real wages have dropped , now face years , maybe decades , of stagnant or declining incomes without access to new credit .
The national treasury meanwhile is being drained on behalf of speculative commercial interests .
The government — the only institution citizens have that is big enough and powerful enough to protect their rights — is becoming weaker , more anemic and less able to help the mass of Americans who are embarking on a period of deprivation and suffering unseen in this country since the 1930s .
Consumption , the profligate engine of the U.S. economy , is withering .
September retail sales across the U.S. fell 1.2 percent .
The decline was almost double the 0.7 percent drop analysts expected from consumers , whose spending represents two - thirds of U.S. economic activity .
There were 160,000 jobs lost last month and three - quarters of a million jobs lost this year .
The reverberations of the economic meltdown are only beginning .
I do not think George W. Bush or Barack Obama or John McCain or Henry Paulson are fascists .
Rather , they are part of a cabal of naive , mediocre and self - deluded capitalists who are steadily weakening political and economic structures to a point where our democracy will become so impotent that it can be blown aside , probably with broad popular support .
The only question is how this will happen .
Will there be a steady and slow decline as in the late Roman Empire when the Senate ended as a farce ?
Will we see a powerful right - wing backlash from those outside the mainstream political system , as we did in Yugoslavia , and the rise of a militant Christian fascism ?
Will there be a national crisis that allows those in power to instantly sweep away all constitutional rights in the name of national security ?
I do not know .
But I do know that what is coming , as long as our oligarchy remains in charge , will not be good .
We will either recover the concept of the public good , and this means a revolt against our bankrupt elite and the dynamiting of the corporatist structure , or we will extinguish our democracy .
Barack Obama was n’t the only one ticked off by the way the McCain campaign jumped all over his use of the phrase “ lipstick on a pig . ” CBS on Wednesday forced YouTube to yank a John McCain Web ad titled “ Lipstick ” because the commercial used unauthorized footage of CBS anchor Katie Couric .
The ad showed a clip of Obama ’s comments during a campaign event Tuesday in Virginia in which he said , “ You can put lipstick on a pig .
It ’s still a pig . ”
McCain ’s campaign accused him of making a sexist dig at Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a charge Obama heatedly disputed , saying he was referring to McCain ’s policies .
To buttress its argument , the McCain campaign used footage in its ad from a Web commentary Couric did this year on CBSNews.com about the media ’s coverage of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ One of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life , ” Couric said .
By midday Wednesday , viewers looking for the ad on YouTube instead got the message : “ This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by CBS Interactive Inc . ”

In a statement , the network said that “ CBS News does not endorse any candidate in the presidential race . ”
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the campaign thought the Couric footage was allowable under the fair - use exception to copyright laws .

Students from exclusive Melbourne private school Xavier College were " blind drunk " and terrorising the school 's Kew neighbours as " muck - up day " today led to the mass suspension of Year 12 classes and a student taken to hospital .
With only days left in the school year and weeks until final exams , Xavier sent home up to 250 students .
A brief statement by the school this afternoon said " a large number of Year 12 students exhibited unacceptable behaviour " .
Do you know more ?
Email details , photos and video to scoop@theage.com.au
The mass suspension came on " muck - up " day , students who called The Age said , as seniors ' celebrated their final school days before breaking to prepare for exams next month .
A Kew resident told The Age he called the school about 3 pm today because Xavier students were " blind drunk " in the street , drinking from wine casks and " urinating all over the neighbours ' houses " .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
She was just 16 years old , a beautiful girl , straight - A student , with her whole life ahead of her .
She hoped to become a nurse .
Chanel Petro-Nixon , 16 , disappeared in broad daylight and her body was found in a trash bag .
Brooklyn teenager Chanel Petro - Nixon left her family home at 6:30 p.m. on Father 's Day 2006 , to walk to an Applebee 's restaurant a few blocks away .
She 'd planned to meet friends there and fill out an application for a summer job at Applebee's .
Friends say she never showed up .
No one ever saw her alive again .
Four days later , her body was found in another area of Brooklyn , several miles from her home .
She 'd been strangled and stuffed into a large garbage bag left to be collected with the morning trash on the sidewalk in front of a brownstone .
Chanel went missing in broad daylight in an extremely busy area of Brooklyn .
Family , police and community members are certain that someone must have seen something , but no witnesses have come forward .
Watch how the teen 's body was put out with the trash »
Also troubling to police :
The coroner says Chanel died within 24 hours of her body being found on June 22 .
She went missing on June 18 .
So , where was Chanel for the 48 hours she was alive but missing ?
She was strangled , but not sexually assaulted , according to police .
Robbery does not seem to be a motive .
But Chanel 's cell phone and the tennis shoes she was wearing are missing .
Chanel 's father , Garvin Nixon , insists that his daughter would not stay out after dark without calling home .
" When we called , she always answered her phone , or would call back immediately within a few minutes to tell us where she was , " he said .
Nixon tried calling his daughter to check on her within an hour after she 'd left the house .
When he did n't get a return call and could n't reach her , he and Chanel 's mother began calling her friends .
Her friends had not seen or heard from Chanel either , even though they 'd been calling her cell phone repeatedly and leaving urgent messages .
Authorities speculate that perhaps she went with someone she knew and trusted , which could explain why no witnesses observed any struggle between Chanel and her abductor .
Police have investigated Chanel 's MySpace page , searching for clues to whom she may have communicated with before leaving her home the day she disappeared .
One theory is that her slaying is linked to that of another local teenager , Jennifer Moore .
Like Chanel , she was strangled and her partially - clothed body was found in a garbage bag .
But unlike Chanel , Jennifer Moore was raped .
Jennifer Moore 's suspected killer , Draymond Coleman , was arrested and police have not ruled him out as a possible suspect in Chanel 's slaying .
Police are asking anyone who finds Chanel 's cell phone or sneakers to call the anonymous tip line at 1-800 - 577- TIPS .
The cell phone is a Silver Sanyo Sprint phone , model 8200 .
The shoes are size 6½ , white Nike Air Jordan retro sneakers with green trim and the number 14 on them .
A reward of $ 34,000 is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible for Chanel 's death .

[ An RS Encore Presentation ] 
Suppose you give me a million dollars with the instructions , “ Invest this profitably , and I ’ll pay you well . ”
I ’m a sharp dresser — why not ?
So I go out onto the street and hand out stacks of bills to random passers - by .
Ten thousand dollars each .
In return , each scribbles out an IOU for $ 20,000 , payable in five years .
I come back to you and say , “ Look at these IOUs !
I have generated a 20 % annual return on your investment . ”
You are very pleased , and pay me an enormous commission .
Now I ’ve got a big stack of IOUs , so I use these “ assets ” as collateral to borrow even more money , which I lend out to even more people , or sell them to others like myself who do the same .
I also buy insurance to cover me in case the borrowers default — and I pay for it with those self - same IOUs !
Round and round it goes , each new loan becoming somebody ’s asset on which to borrow yet more money .
We all rake in huge commissions and bonuses , as the total face value of all the assets we ’ve created from that initial million dollars is now fifty times that .
Then one day , the first batch of IOUs comes due .
But guess what ?
The person who scribbled his name on the IOU can’t pay me back right now .
In fact , lots of the borrowers can’t .
I try to hush up this embarrassing fact as long as possible , but pretty soon you get suspicious .
You want your million - plus dollars back — in cash .
I try to sell the IOUs and their derivatives that I hold , but everyone else is suspicious too , and no one buys them .
The insurance company tries to cover my losses , but it can only do so by selling the IOUs I gave it !
So finally , the government steps in and buys the IOUs , bails out the insurance company and everyone else holding the IOUs and the derivatives stacked on them .
Their total value is way more than a million dollars now .
I and my fellow entrepreneurs retire with our lucre .
Everyone else pays for it .
This is the first level of what has happened in the financial industry over the past decade .
It is a huge transfer of wealth to the financial elite , to be funded by US taxpayers , foreign corporations and governments , and ultimately the foreign workers who subsidize US debt indirectly via the lower purchasing power of their wages .
However , to see the current crisis as merely the result of a big con is to miss its true significance .
I think we all sense that we are nearing the end of an era .
On the most superficial level , it is the era of unregulated casino - style financial manipulation that is ending .
But the current efforts of the political elites to fix the crisis at this level will only reveal its deeper dimensions .
In fact , the crisis goes “ all the way to the bottom . ”
It arises from the very nature of money and property in the world today , and it will persist and continue to intensify until money itself is transformed .
A process centuries in the making is in its final stages of unfoldment .
Money as we know it today has crisis and collapse built into its basic design .
That is because money seeks interest , bears interest , and indeed is born of interest .
To see how this works , lets go back to some finance basics .
Money is created when somebody takes out a loan from a bank ( or more recently , a disguised loan from some other kind of institution ) .
A debt is a promise to pay money in the future in order to buy something today ; in other words , borrowing money is a form of delayed trading .
I receive something now ( bought with the money I borrowed ) and agree to give something in the future ( a good or service which I will sell for the money to pay back the debt ) .
A bank or any other lender will ordinarily only agree to lend you money if there is a reasonable expectation you will pay it back ; in other words , if there is a reasonable expectation you will produce goods or services of equivalent value .
This “ reasonable expectation ” can be guaranteed in the form of collateral , or it can be encoded in one ’s credit rating .
Any time you use money , you are essentially guaranteeing “ I have performed a service or provided a good of equivalent value to the one I am buying . ”
If the money is borrowed money , you are saying that you will provide an equivalent good / service in the future .
Now enter interest .
What motivates a bank to lend anyone money in the first place ?
It is interest .
Interest drives the creation of money today .
Any time money is created through debt , a need to create even more money in the future is also created .
The amount of money must grow over time , which means that the volume of goods and services must grow over time as well .
If the volume of money grows faster than the volume of goods and services , the result is inflation .
If it grows more slowly — for example through a slowdown in lending — the result is bankruptcies , recession , or deflation .
The government can increase or decrease the supply of money in several ways .
First , it can create money by borrowing it from the central bank , or in America , from the Federal Reserve .
This money ends up as bank deposits , which in turn give banks more margin reserves on which to extend loans .
You see , a bank ’s capacity to create money is limited by margin reserve requirements .
Typically , a bank must hold cash ( or central bank deposits ) equal to about 10 % of its total customer deposits .
The other 90 % , it can loan out , thus creating new money .
This money ends up back in a bank as deposits , allowing another 81 % of it ( 90 % of 90 % ) to be lent out again .
In this way , each dollar of initial deposits ends up as $ 9 of new money .
Government spending of money borrowed from the central bank acts a seed for new money creation .
( Of course , this depends on banks ’ willingness to lend !
In a credit freeze , banks hoard excess reserves and the repeated injections of government money have little effect . )
Another way to increase the money supply is to lower margin reserve requirements .
In practice this is rarely done , at least directly .
However , in the last decade , various kinds of non-bank lending have skirted the margin reserve requirement , through the alphabet soup of financial instruments you ’ve been hearing about in the news .
The result is that each dollar of original equity has been leveraged not to nine times it original value , as in traditional banking , but to 70 times or even more .
This has allowed returns on investment far beyond the 5 % or so available from traditional banking , along with “ compensation ” packages beyond the dreams of avarice .
Each new dollar that is created comes with a new dollar of debt — more than a dollar of debt , because of interest .
The debt is eventually redeemed either with goods and services , or with more borrowed money , which in turn can be redeemed with yet more borrowed money … but eventually it will be used to buy goods and services .
The interest has to come from somewhere .
Borrowing more money to make the interest payments on an existing loan merely postpones the day of reckoning by deferring the need to create new goods and services .
The whole system of interest - bearing money works fine as long as the volume of goods and services exchanged for money keeps growing .
The crisis we are seeing today is in part because new money has been created much faster than goods and services have , and much faster than has been historically sustainable .
There are only two ways out of such a situation : inflation and defaults .
Each involve the destruction of money .
The current convulsions of the financial and political elites basically come down to a futile attempt to prevent both .
Their first concern is to prevent the evaporation of money through massive bankruptcies , because it is , after all , their money .
There is a much deeper crisis at work as well , a crisis in the creation of goods and services that underlies money to begin with , and it is this crisis that gave birth to the real estate bubble everyone blames for the current situation .
To understand it , let ’s get clear on what constitutes a “ good ” or a “ service ” .
In economics , these terms refer to something that is exchanged for money .
If I babysit your children for free , economists do n’t count it as a service .
It can not be used to pay a financial debt : I can not go to the supermarket and say , “ I watched my neighbors kids this morning , so please give me food . ”
But if I open a day care center and charge you money , I have created a “ service ” .
GDP rises and , according to economists , society has become wealthier .
The same is true if I cut down a forest and sell the timber .
While it is still standing and inaccessible , it is not a good .
It only becomes “ good ” when I build a logging road , hire labor , cut it down , and transport it to a buyer .
I convert a forest to timber , a commodity , and GDP goes up .
Similarly , if I create a new song and share it for free , GDP does not go up and society is not considered wealthier , but if I copyright it and sell it , it becomes a good .
Or I can find a traditional society that uses herbs and shamanic techniques for healing , destroy their culture and make them dependent on pharmaceutical medicine which they must purchase , evict them from their land so they cannot be subsistence farmers and must buy food , clear the land and hire them on a banana plantation — and I have made the world richer .
I have brought various functions , relationships , and natural resources into the realm of money .
In The Ascent of Humanity I describe this process in depth : the conversion of social capital , natural capital , cultural capital , and spiritual capital into money .
Essentially , for the economy to continue growing and for the ( interest - based ) money system to remain viable , more and more of nature and human relationship must be monetized .
For example , thirty years ago most meals were prepared at home ; today some two - thirds are prepared outside , in restaurants or supermarket delis .
A once unpaid function , cooking , has become a “ service ” .
And we are the richer for it .
Right ?
Another major engine of economic growth over the last three decades , child care , has also made us richer .
We are now relieved of the burden of caring for our own children .
We pay experts instead , who can do it much more efficiently .
In ancient times entertainment was also a free , participatory function .
Everyone played an instrument , sang , participated in drama .
Even 75 years ago in America , every small town had its own marching band and baseball team .
Now we pay for those services .
The economy has grown .
Hooray .
The crisis we are facing today arises from the fact there there is almost no more social , cultural , natural , and spiritual capital left to convert into money .
Centuries , millennia of near - continuous money creation has left us so destitute that we have nothing left to sell .
Our forests are damaged beyond repair , our soil depleted and washed into the sea , our fisheries fished out , the rejuvenating capacity of the earth to recycle our waste saturated .
Our cultural treasury of songs and stories , images and icons , has been looted and copyrighted .
Any clever phrase you can think of is already a trademarked slogan .
Our very human relationships and abilities have been taken away from us and sold back , so that we are now dependent on strangers , and therefore on money , for things few humans ever paid for until recently : food , shelter , clothing , entertainment , child care , cooking .
Life itself has become a consumer item .
Today we sell away the last vestiges of our divine bequeathment : our health , the biosphere and genome , even our own minds .
This is the process that is culminating in our age .
It is almost complete , especially in America and the “ developed ” world .
In the developing world there still remain people who live substantially in gift cultures , where natural and social wealth is not yet the subject of property .
Globalization is the process of stripping away these assets , to feed the money machine ’s insatiable , existential need to grow .
Yet this stripmining of other lands is running up against its limits too , both because there is almost nothing left to take , and because of growing pockets of effective resistance .
The result is that the supply of money — and the corresponding volume of debt — has for several decades outstripped the production of goods and services that it promises .
It is deeply related to the classic problem of oversupply in capitalist economics .
The Marxian crisis of capital can be deferred into the future as long as new , high - profit industries and markets can be developed to compensate for the vicious circle of falling profits , falling wages , depressed consumption , and overproduction in mature industries .
The continuation of capitalism as we know it depends on an infinite supply of these new industries , which essentially must convert infinite new realms of social , natural , cultural , and spiritual capital into money .
The problem is , these resources are finite , and the closer they come to exhaustion , the more painful their extraction becomes .
Therefore , contemporaneous with the financial crisis we have an ecological crisis and a health crisis .
They are intimately interlinked .
We cannot convert much more of the earth into money , or much more of our health into money , before the basis of life itself is threatened .
Faced with the exhaustion of the non-monetized commonwealth that it consumes , financial capital has tried to delay the inevitable by cannibalizing itself .
The dot - com bubble of the late 90s showed that the productive economy could not longer keep up with the growth of money .
Lots of excess money was running around frantically , searching for a place where the promise of deferred goods and services could be redeemed .
So , to postpone the inevitable crash , the Fed slashed interest rates and loosened monetary policy to allow old debts to be repaid with new debts ( rather than real goods and services ) .
The new financial goods and services that arose were phony , artifacts of deceptive accounting on a vast , systemic scale .
Various pundits have observed that the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme was not so different from the financial industry ’s pyramid of mortgaged - based derivatives and other instruments , which themselves formed a bubble that , like Madoff ’s , could only sustain itself through an unceasing , indeed exponentially - growing , influx of new money .
As such , it is a symbol of our times — and even more than people suppose .
It is not only the Wall Street casino economy that is an unsustainable pyramid scheme .
The larger economic system , based as it is on the eternal conversion of a finite commonwealth into money , is unsustainable as well .
It is like a bonfire that must burn higher and higher , to the exhaustion of all available fuel .
Just as fire breaks existing chemical bonds and frees heat , so does our economy break the bonds of community , nature , and culture , liberating free energy — called money — in the process .
Only a fool would think that a fire can burn ever - higher when the supply of fuel is finite .
To extend the metaphor , the recent deindustrialization and financialization of the economy amounts to using the heat to create more fuel .
According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics , the amount created is always less than the amount expended to create it .
Obviously , the practice of borrowing new money to pay the principal and interest of old debts cannot last very long , but that is what the economy as a whole has done for ten years now .
Yet even abandoning this folly , we still must face the depletion of fuel ( remember , I mean not literal energy sources , but any bond of nature or culture that can be turned into a commodity ) .
Most of the proposals for addressing the present economic crisis amount to finding more fuel .
Whether it is drilling more oil wells , paving over more green space , or spurring consumer spending , the goal is to reignite economic growth ; that is to expand the realm of goods and services .
It means finding new things for which we can pay .
Today , unimaginably to our forebears , we pay even for our water and our songs .
What else is left to convert into money ?
A collapse is coming , unavoidably ; indeed , we are in the midst of it .
The first government response , the bailout , was an attempt to uphold a tower of money that is far beyond the total value of real goods and services it promises to redeem .
Predictably , the bailout was a miserable failure .
The next response , Obama ’s massive stimulus package , will fail for a different and much deeper reason .
It will fail because we are “ maxed out ” : maxed out on nature ’s capacity to receive our wastes without destroying the ecological basis of civilization ; maxed out on society ’s ability to withstand any more loss of community and connection ; maxed out on our forests ’ ability to withstand more clearcuts ; maxed out on the human body ’s capacity to stay viable in a depleted , toxic world .
That we are also maxed out on our credit only reflects that we have nothing left to convert into money .
Do we really need more roads and bridges ?
Can we sustain more of them , and more of the industrial economy that goes along ?
Government stimulus programs will at best prolong the current economic system for two or three years , with perhaps a brief period of growth as we complete the pillage of nature , spirit , body , and culture .
When these vestiges of the commonwealth are gone , then nothing will be able to stop a massive inflationary surge and currency collapse on a global scale .
The present crisis is actually the final stage of what began in the 1930s .
Successive solutions to the fundamental problem of keeping pace with money that expands with the rate of interest have been applied , and exhausted .
The first effective solution was war , a state which has been permanent since 1940 .
Unfortunatly , or rather fortunately , nuclear weapons and a shift in human consciousness have limited the solution of endless military escalation .
Other solutions — globalization , technology - enabled development of new goods and services to replace human functions never before commoditized , and technology - enabled plunder of natural resources once off limits , and finally financial auto - cannibalism — have similarly run their course .
Unless there are realms of wealth I have not considered , and new depths of poverty , misery , and alienation to which we might plunge , the inevitable cannot be delayed much longer .
In the face of the impending crisis , people often ask what they can do to protect themselves .
“ Buy gold ?
Stockpile canned goods ?
Build a fortified compound in a remote area ?
What should I do ? ” I would like to suggest a different kind of question : “ What is the most beautiful thing I can do ? ”
You see , the gathering crisis presents a tremendous opportunity .
Deflation , the destruction of money , is only a categorical evil if the creation of money is a categorical good .
However , you can see from the examples I have given that the creation of money has in many ways impoverished us all .
Conversely , the destruction of money has the potential to enrich us .
It offers the opportunity to reclaim parts of the lost commonwealth from the realm of money and property .
We actually see this happening every time there is an economic recession .
People can no longer pay for various goods and services , and so have to rely on friends and neighbors instead .
Where there is no money to facilitate transactions , gift economies reemerge and new kinds of money are created .
Ordinarily , though , people and institutions fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening .
The habitual first response to economic crisis is to make and keep more money — to accelerate the conversion of anything you can into money .
On a systemic level , the debt surge is generating enormous pressure to extend the commodification of the commonwealth .
We can see this happening with the calls to drill for oil in Alaska , commence deep - sea drilling , and so on .
The time is here , though , for the reverse process to begin in earnest — to remove things from the realm of goods and services , and return them to the realm of gifts , reciprocity , self - sufficiency , and community sharing .
Note well : this is going to happen anyway in the wake of a currency collapse , as people lose their jobs or become too poor to buy things .
People will help each other and real communities will reemerge .
In the meantime , anything we do to protect some natural or social resource from conversion into money will both hasten the collapse and mitigate its severity .
Any forest you save from development , any road you stop , any cooperative playgroup you establish ; anyone you teach to heal themselves , or to build their own house , cook their own food , make their own clothes ; any wealth you create or add to the public domain ; anything you render off - limits to the world - devouring Machine , will help shorten the Machine ’s lifespan .
Think of it this way : if you already do not depend on money for some portion of life ’s necessities and pleasures , then the collapse of money will pose much less of a harsh transition for you .
The same applies to the social level .
Any network or community or social institution that is not a vehicle for the conversion of life into money will sustain and enrich life after money .
Elsewhere I have described alternative money systems , based on mutual credit and demurrage , that do not drive the conversion of all that is good , true , and beautiful into money .
These enact a fundamentally different human identity , a fundamentally different sense of self , from what dominates today .
No more will it be true that more for me is less for you .
On a personal level , the deepest possible revolution we can enact is a revolution in our sense of self , in our identity .
The discrete and separate self of Descartes and Adam Smith has run its course and is becoming obsolete .
We are realizing our own inseparateness , from each other and from the totality of all life .
Interest belies this union , for it seeks growth of the separate self at the expense of something external , something other .
Probably everyone reading this essay agrees with the principles of interconnectedness , whether from a Buddhistic or an ecological perspective .
The time has come to live it .
It is time to enter the spirit of the gift , which embodies the felt understanding of non-separation .
It is becoming abundantly obvious that less for you ( in all its dimensions ) is also less for me .
The ideology of perpetual gain has brought us to a state of poverty so destitute that we are gasping for air .
That ideology , and the civilization built upon it , is what is collapsing today .
Individually and collectively , anything we do to resist or postpone the collapse will only make it worse .
Let us stop resisting the revolution in human beingness .
If we want to survive the multiple crises unfolding today , let us not seek to survive them .
That is the mindset of separation ; that is resistance , a clinging to a dying past .
Instead , let us shift our perspective toward reunion , and think in terms of what we can give .
What can we each contribute to a more beautiful world ?
That is our only responsibility and our only security .
More concretely , let us engage in conscious , purposeful money destruction in place of the unconscious destruction of money that happens in a collapsing economy .
If you still have money to invest , invest it in enterprises that explicitly seek to build community , protect nature , and preserve the cultural commonwealth .
Expect a zero or negative financial return on your investment — that is a good sign that you are not unintentionally converting even more of the world to money .
Whether or not you have money to invest , you can also reclaim what was sold away by taking steps out the money economy .
Anything you learn to do for yourself or for other people , without paying for it ; any utilization of recycled or discarded materials ; anything you make instead of buy , give instead of sell ; any new skill or new song or new art you teach yourself or another , will reduce the dominion of money and grow a gift economy to sustain us through the coming transition .
The world of the Gift , echoing primitive gift societies , the web of ecology , and the spiritual teachings of the ages , is nigh upon us .
It tugs on our heartstrings and and awakens our generosity .
Shall we heed its call , before the remainder of earth ’s beauty is consumed ?
This is an RS Encore Presentation of an article that provoked a lot of comments since it first appeared on October 3 of 2008 .
The author has revised the article with many of our readers ’ comments in mind .
Thanks for the feedback .
The video :
It 's not half as fancy or clever as most of the other films on this list , but Gus Van Sant 's low - budget video for the Chili Pepper 's breakthrough hit ' Under The Bridge ' went some way into propelling the band into the MTV mainstream .
Superimposing images of the band against gritty shots of the city of Los Angeles and its citizens , Van Sant 's homely video fit perfectly with Anthony Kiedis ' lyrics ( " At least I have her love / The city she loves me " ) , although the last shot of the singer sprinting with his shirt off , pecs jiggling hypnotically , is still a mystery to us .
Not far from the blinking casinos of this gambler ’s paradise lies what could be called the Biggest Little Power Plant in the World .
Tucked into a few dusty acres across from a shopping mall , it uses steam heat from deep within the Earth ’s crust to generate electricity .
Known as geothermal , the energy is clean , reliable and so abundant that this facility produces more than enough electricity to power every home in Reno , population 221,000 .
“ There ’s no smoke .
Very little noise , ” said Paul Thomsen , director of policy and business management for Ormat Technologies Inc. , which owns the operation .
“ People do n’t even know it ’s here . ”
Geothermal energy may be the most prolific renewable fuel source that most people have never heard of .
Although the supply is virtually limitless , the massive upfront costs required to extract it have long rendered geothermal a novelty .
But that ’s changing fast as this old - line industry buzzes with activity after decades of stagnation .

Billionaire Warren E. Buffett has invested big .
Internet giant Google Inc. is bankrolling advanced research .
Entrepreneurs are paying record prices for drilling leases in places such as Nevada , where they ’re prospecting for heat instead of metals .
“ This is the new gold rush , ” said Mark Taylor , a geothermal analyst with the consulting firm New Energy Finance in Washington .
He credits high fossil fuel prices and concerns about global warming with jump - starting the U.S. industry , along with federal tax credits and state laws mandating the wider use of renewable energy .
Global investment in geothermal was around $ 3 billion last year , Taylor said .
Although that ’s a blip compared with the estimated $ 116 billion funneled into wind and solar , it ’s still a 183 % increase over investment in 2006 .
In a difficult year for alternative energy funding , the industry snagged $ 600 million through the first six months of 2008 , Taylor said .
A lot of that new investment is in the United States , the world ’s leader in geothermal energy .
More than 80 % of the country ’s 3,000 geothermal megawatts lies in California .
The Geysers , a network of 22 geothermal plants about 75 miles north of San Francisco in the Mayacamas Mountains , is the largest geothermal complex on the planet .
Calpine Corp. owns the largest part of it .

The area around the Salton Sea in Imperial County is another hot spot .
CalEnergy Generation , a subsidiary of Buffett ’s Mid-American Energy Holdings , owns and operates 10 plants there .
It plans three additional facilities in the next few years , CalEnergy President Steve Larsen said .
In October , the Bureau of Land Management said it planned to open more than 190 million acres of federal land in California and 11 other Western states for new geothermal development .
Nevada , the nation ’s No. 2 geothermal producer , has 45 new projects underway , said Lisa Shevenell , director of the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy at the University of Nevada in Reno .
An August lease sale of Nevada lands by the federal bureau brought in a record $ 28.2 million .
“ I ’ve been at this 25 years , and I ’ve never seen anything like it , ” said Shevenell , a research hydrologist .
“ Money is falling out of the sky . ”

Geothermal has been harnessed for industry since at least the 1820s .
Operators tap natural reservoirs of scalding water and steam trapped thousands of feet underground , drilling wells to bring the heat to the surface to power turbines that feed electricity generators .
Costing about 4 to 7 cents a kilowatt - hour , Taylor said , geothermal is competitive with wind power and significantly cheaper than solar .
Geothermal facilities occupy a fraction of the space required by wind and solar farms .
The energy is also more reliable .
Plants crank electricity around the clock , irrespective of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing .
This so - called baseload generation is coveted by power companies , which are under pressure to boost their use of green energy .
California utilities must generate 20 % of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010 .
Nevada utilities must hit that target by 2015 .
Geothermal is a cornerstone of that effort , accounting for about two - thirds of the renewable portfolio of NV Energy , Nevada ’s biggest utility .
“ It ’s a 24/7 predictable supply , ” said Thomas Fair , the company ’s head of renewable energy .
“ That means a lot to a utility . ”

Greenhouse gas emissions are minimal in geothermal operations , and the size of the fuel supply defies imagination .
There is 50,000 times more heat energy contained in the first six miles of the Earth ’s crust than in all the planet ’s oil and natural gas resources , according to the environmental organization Earth Policy Institute .
The challenge is extracting it .
Geothermal energy production requires three things : heat from the Earth ’s core , fractured rock to make it easy to get to and water to transport the heat to the surface .
Traditionally , developers have sought out pockets of hot water and steam hidden underground .
Prime areas lie along continental plate boundaries , which is why California is such a hotbed .
Still , these reservoirs can be tricky to pinpoint .
They ’re also expensive to reach .
A geothermal well can cost $ 5 million or more .
The result : The U.S. currently derives less than 0.5 % of its electricity from geothermal .
Advertisement
Some say the key to harnessing this energy source on a massive scale lies with a technology known as enhanced geothermal systems , or EGS for short .
The idea is to engineer the necessary conditions by pumping water into the Earth ’s crust and fracturing the hot rocks below .
Heat from the Earth warms the water , whose resulting steam is channeled back to the surface , powering turbines to create electricity .
The water is then pumped back underground .
Though still in its infancy , EGS has the potential to open up much of the planet to geothermal development .
Tiny plants are already online in France and Germany .
More than 30 EGS firms are engaged in exploration and development in Australia .
Google.org , the philanthropic arm of the Mountain View , Calif . - based search engine company , is trying to push EGS in the U.S.
It recently gave $ 10 million to Southern Methodist University ’s Geothermal Lab to update the nation ’s geothermal resources map , as well as to two California companies -- Potter Drilling and AltaRock Energy Inc. -- that are working on EGS technologies .
Google is urging the U.S. government to spend big on geothermal R&D ; as part of the company ’s push to encourage utility - scale renewable energy that ’s cheaper than coal .
About half the United States ’ electricity is generated by that dirty fossil fuel .
China , already the world ’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide , is adding coal - fired plants at a swift rate .
Advertisement
EGS “ is indeed the sleeping giant of renewable energy , ” Dan Reicher , director for climate change and energy initiatives at Google.org , said during a recent industry conference in Reno .
“ It ’s the killer ap . ”
Some industry veterans such as Shevenell are miffed that EGS has grabbed the spotlight when there ’s plenty of energy to be extracted quickly using conventional techniques .
Still , she credits Google for helping pump life into a dormant sector .
“ This country is in an energy crisis , ” she said .
“ We need energy now , and this is a proven way to get it . ”

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
To claim the earned income tax credit you must :
File a tax return , even if you did n't make enough in 2007 to be obligated to do so .
Have a valid Social Security number .
Have earned income from employment or self - employment .
Not use the filing status of married , filing separately .
Be a U.S citizen or resident alien all year , or a nonresident alien married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien and filing a joint return .
Not be a qualifying child of another person .
Not file Form 2555 or 2555 - EZ , which are related to foreign earned income .
To claim the credit if you do not have a qualifying child , you must :
Be at least 25 but under age 65 at the end of the year .
Live in the United States more than half the year .
Not qualify as a dependent of another person .
Your 2007 earned income and adjusted gross income must each be less than : $ 37,783 ( $ 39,783 married filing jointly ) with two or more qualifying children .
$ 33,241 ( $ 35,241 married filing jointly ) with one qualifying child .
$ 12,590 ( 14,590 married filing jointly ) with no qualifying children .
Investment income in 2007 must be $ 2,900 or less .
Maximum EITC credit for 2007 : $ 4,716 with two or more qualifying children .
$ 2,853 for one qualifying child .
$ 428 with no qualifying child .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The IRS is making a big push this year to make sure certain taxpayers know they can take the earned income tax credit ( EITC ) , a benefit for lower income workers and working families that goes unclaimed by up to 25 % of those who are eligible .
The EITC is intended to offset a portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes , thus boosting take - home income in low - wage jobs and providing an incentive to work .
It 's a " refundable " credit , meaning that after it is figured against your tax liability , the IRS sends you any money you 're due .
For 2007 tax returns , the maximum credit is worth up to $ 4,716 for people with two or more qualifying children , though it 's also available to some taxpayers without children .
" For families eligible for the maximum it 's almost a quarter of their income , " said David R. Williams , IRS director of Electronic Tax Administration and Refundable Credits .
" That is such a significant amount of money .
It can mean so much for a family . "
But the rules and qualifications can be confusing .
People overlook the credit because they believe it's too complicated , they do n't have children or their income is so low they do n't have a legal obligation to file taxes .
Many are n't native English speakers .
As many as 5 million people are probably eligible for the credit but are not taking it , the IRS says .
To reach out to them , the IRS has " EITC Awareness Day " on Jan. 31 — about the time people get their W - 2 forms from employers and start thinking about income taxes .
The agency also works with 12,000 volunteer tax preparation sites for people who need help with this and other benefits .
The credit is calculated on IRS worksheets , available in English and Spanish : Publication 596 : Earned Income Credit ( pdf- English ) Publication 596 : Earned Income Credit ( pdf - Spanish )
There is also an English - Spanish " EITC Assistant " tool at http://www.irs.gov:
Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) - Should I Apply ?
Many EITC filers can file for free online using the IRS Free File partners , providing they access those partners from the IRS website .
The agency is also reaching out to Native Americans , people with disabilities and those in rural areas who may be eligible for the credit .
Congress originally approved the tax credit legislation in 1975 .
For tax year 2005 , more than 22 million taxpayers received over $ 41 billion through the EITC credit , an average credit of $ 1,797 , the IRS said .
For tax year 2006 , 22.4 million taxpayers received $ 43.7 billion as of last November .
But only about 75 % of those eligible claim this benefit , the agency says .
Most who claim the credit use a paid tax preparer .
The IRS says taxpayers should avoid preparers who offer upfront to qualify them for EITC or ask them to sign a blank 1040 .
They should also avoid preparers who charge high fees for refund anticipation loans , a short - term advance of quick cash using the expected refund as collateral .
Those who can't afford a paid preparer should use volunteer tax prep sites run by community organizations , the IRS says .
To get the earned income tax credit , you must file a tax return , even if you did n't earn enough money to be obligated to file .
If in 2007 you had less than $ 37,783 ( $ 39,783 for married filing jointly ) in income and had two or more qualifying children , you are eligible for the credit .
People with no qualifying child can still be eligible for a credit of up to $ 428 if their income was less than $ 12,590 ( $ 14,590 for joint filers ) .
Those with one qualifying child and income under $ 33,241 ( $ 35,241 for joint filers ) are also eligible .
What 's a qualifying child ?
There are three tests :
• The child 's relationship to you .
A qualifying child can be a son , daughter , stepchild , foster or adopted child , or descendant of any of them ; brother , sister , half brother or sister , stepbrother , stepsister or their descendant .
• Age .
T he child must have been under 19 at the end of 2007 or a full - time student under age 24 .
Someone permanently and totally disabled also qualifies , regardless of age .
• Residency .
The child must have lived with you in the United States for more than half the year .
People claiming the EITC , and their qualifying children , must have valid Social Security numbers .
It 's possible some of those eligible for the credit do n't claim it because they have illegal immigrants in the household and fear the IRS will share their information with immigration authorities .
The IRS says it does n't do that .
" We divulge that information to no one , " Williams said .
" We would not be divulging Social Security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers to other third parties . "
Another reason people may hold back from filing for the credit is fear that the refundable money may adversely affect welfare benefits .
But in most cases , EITC payments are not used to determine eligibility for Medicaid , Supplemental Security Income , food stamps , low - income housing or most Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments .

How the hidden metric space guides communication .
If node A wants to reach node F , it checks the hidden distances between F and its two neighbors B and C. Distance CF ( green dashed line ) is smaller than BF ( red dashed line ) , therefore A forwards information to C. Node C then performs similar calculations and selects its neighbor D as the next hop on the path to F .
Node D is directly connected to F .
The result is path ACDF shown by green edges in the observable topology .

As the global population continues to grow exponentially , our social connections to one another remain relatively small , as if we 're all protagonists in the Kevin Bacon game inspired by " Six Degrees of Separation , " a Broadway play and Hollywood feature that were popular in the 1990s .
In fact , classic studies show that if we were to route a letter to an unknown person using only friends or acquaintances who we thought might know the intended recipient , it would take five or six intermediary acquaintances before the letter reaches its intended destination .
The underlying success of this phenomenon called the " small - world paradigm , " discovered in the 1960s by sociologist Stanley Milgram , recently provided a source of inspiration for researchers studying the Internet as a global complex network .
The result , a study by Marián Boguñá , Dmitri Krioukov , and Kimberly Claffy , published in Nature Physics on November 16 , reveals a previously unknown mathematical model called " hidden metric space " that may explain the " small - world phenomenon " and its relationship to both man-made and natural networks such as human language , as well as gene regulation or neural networks that connect neurons to organs and muscles within our bodies .
For these researchers , the concept of an underlying " hidden space " may also be relevant to their professional interests : how to remove mounting bottlenecks within the Internet that threaten the smooth passage of digital information around the globe .
" Internet experts are worried that the existing Internet routing architecture may not sustain even another decade , " said Krioukov , the study 's principal investigator with the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis ( CAIDA ) , based at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California , San Diego .
" Routing in the existing Internet has already reached its scalability limits ; black holes are appearing everywhere . "
" Discovery of such a metric space hidden beneath the Internet could point toward architectural innovations that would remove this bottleneck , " added Claffy , director of CAIDA and adjunct professor of computer science at UC San Diego .
" Although quite prevalent in the natural world , the idea of routing using only local rather than global knowledge of network connectivity represents a revolutionary change in how to think about engineering communications networks .
It 's clear that the Internet 's current architectural requirements are incompatible with the overwhelming amount of information that 's being transmitted through this now critical global infrastructure . "
According to the researchers , natural networks appear to transmit signals or messages with a high degree of efficiency , even though no single node – whether it's an individual person in a social network or a single neuron in a neural network – can visualize the global structure of the entire network .
How is this possible ?
By constructing a mathematical model of geometry underlying the topology of these networks , the researchers discovered that many complex networks shared a similar characteristic – their global topological structure ( or shape ) maximizes their communication efficiency .
" A vast majority of very different complex networks have similar shapes , " said Krioukov .
" They have similar shapes not just for fun , but perhaps because they all evolved toward structures and shapes that maximize efficiency according to their main common function , and that function is communication . "
Take , for example , the " small - world phenomenon " described earlier .
In this case , the only information people possessed to make their routing decisions was a set of descriptive attributes of the destined recipient – his or her home base and occupations .
People then determined who among their contacts was " socially closest " to the target .
For aficionados of the Kevin Bacon game , the goal was to connect any actor in Hollywood to Bacon through the films he made .
" The success of Milgram 's experiment indicates that social distances among individuals – although they may be difficult to define mathematically – have a role in shaping the network , and may also be essential for efficient navigation , " said Claffy .
Added Krioukov : " When you know the network topology , you merely know the basic layout of a network .
But when you discover its underlying geometry , or hidden space , you may know how this complex network really functions . "
Likewise , neural networks in the body would not function as well if they could not route specific signals to appropriate organs or muscles in the body , although no neuron has a full view of global inter-neuronal connectivity in the brain .
The same can be said for the regulation of genes , which are turned on and off by regulator genes to manufacture proteins .
So , what accounts for this inherent communication efficiency of complex networks ?
The study suggests the existence of an underlying geometric framework that contains all the nodes of the network , shapes its topology and guides routing decisions : a " hidden metric space . "
Distances in this space are akin to social distances in the " small - world phenomenon . "
They measure similarity between people .
The more similar the two persons , the closer they are in the " social space , " and the more likely they are friends , connected in the acquaintance network .
To route a message , a person forwards it to the friend socially closest to the message destination , as illustrated in Figure 1 .
" Such routing allows networks to efficiently find intended communication targets even though they do not have a global view of the system , " said Claffy .
The primary motivation for this study , according to Krioukov , was the constantly increasing size and dynamics of the Internet , leading to increasing incidences of routing bottlenecks .
Discovery of the Internet 's " hidden metric space " would allow messages to be forwarded to destinations based on local measurements of similarities between nodes , their positions in the " hidden space , " rather than on their positions in the network , which requires global measurements of its structure .
Krioukov also suggests that reconstruction of hidden metric spaces underlying a variety of real complex networks may have other practical applications .
For example , hidden spaces in social or communications networks could yield new , efficient strategies for searching for specific individuals or content .
The metric spaces hidden under some biological networks also could lead to powerful tools for studying the structure of information or signal flows in these networks .
" This could be applied to cancer research , for example , whose studies rely heavily on gene regulation , " he said .
" Suppose you were able to find the hidden space here .
One could then figure out what drives gene regulation networks and what drives them to failure .
This would be an important contribution to the field . "

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Monday the U.S. economy was definitely in a recession but he believed it would be fairly moderate in size .
“ We are in a contraction .
Up until the summer it was a fairly mild recession , ” Lacker , who will become a voting member of the Fed ’s interest rate - setting committee next year , told reporters after a speech at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
“ I think it ’s definitely a recession at this point .
How deep , how steep , and long it ’s going to be is uncertain .
We do n’t know if it ’s going to be a garden variety recession or something steeper .
I think it ’s most likely to be of a fairly moderate size , ” he said .
Damian Green 's arrest is a monstrous abuse of power by the same gangsters who hounded Dr David Kelly to death
' Tired and angry ' : Damian Green speaks outside the House of Commons after being released from police custody
An Opposition spokesman is arrested without warning on trumped - up conspiracy charges and thrown into jail .
His home , constituency and parliamentary offices are simultaneously raided by 20 anti-terrorist officers .
It sounds like Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe , or East Berlin before the Wall came down .
But this happened in Britain , in the past 48 hours - the most terrifying manifestation to date of Labour 's Stasi State .
The shadow immigration minister , Damian Green , was taken from his home in Kent to a Central London police station , where he was interrogated for nine hours by officers investigating the leak of sensitive information from the Home Office .
Or , as a Met spokesman put it , in classic Plodspeak : ' A 52 - year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office and aiding , abetting , counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office . '
This risible , catch - all indictment could be levelled at just about any member of the Government , from the Prime Minister downwards , any day of the week .
Labour spent all last weekend leaking details of the emergency Budget .
Gordon Brown 's early career was built on leaked documents .
Green 's ' crime ' was to expose the deceit and incompetence of this government 's shambolic immigration policy and make public a confidential Home Office memo , which revealed that an illegal alien had been working as a cleaner in the House of Commons .
The information made mockery of the Government 's claims to have introduced tough new border controls and laid bare the lies of the past ten years .
Which , I suspect , is the reason the inoffensive Green had to be humiliated in such draconian fashion .
If there 's one thing this government , in general , and this Prime Minister , in particular , hates more than the truth , it 's being ridiculed .
They have become so accustomed to living in a virtual one - party state since 1997 , that any counter - argument or even the mildest of criticism is treated not merely as legitimate dissent , but as an act of treason .
Interviewed by Adam Boulton on Sky News yesterday , the Prime Minister gave not the slightest inclination that he was in any way troubled by this outrageous arrest of a fellow Honourable Member or the invasion of Parliament by the heavy mob .
He merely denied any ' prior ' knowledge and repeated ad infinitum that this was solely a matter for the police .
I 'm surprised he did n't add that this raid began in America .
' Stasi ' state : Gordon Brown speaks in Leeds yesterday after insisting he knew nothing of Mr Green 's arrest
Denial of ' prior ' knowledge was clearly the ' line to take ' .
Jacqui Smith , our gormless Home Secretary , said much the same thing .
Frankly , I refuse to believe that Smith was n't consulted before Green had his collar
felt .
The investigation was mounted on her orders into a leak which occurred in her office .
Is she really expecting us to swallow her claim that Scotland Yard kept her out of the loop ?
And armed with the information that a senior member of the Conservative Party was about to be arrested and treated like a common criminal , Jackboot Jacqui would n't have been able to resist sharing this juicy nugget with her boss , the Prime Minister .
Blaming the Old Bill is typical of the innate cowardice of Gordon Brown .
Believe me , he is a vindictive man who would have savoured every last detail of Green 's embarrassment .
As for this being purely a matter for the police , pull the other one .
Imagine the scene at Scotland Yard , as they pore over the latest reports of stabbings , shootings , armed robberies and terrorism alerts and decide which heinous crime to prioritise .
' What do we do next , guv ? '
' Bring the motor round the front , Bill .
We 're going to nick Damian Green . '
Of course , it may be no coincidence that the arrest took place on the outgoing Met Commissioner Ian Blair 's last day on the job .
The man who put politics into policing was Labour 's favourite copper and had been forced to resign by incoming Tory Mayor of London Boris Johnson .
This whole business smacks of payback time - and not just for Commissioner Blair 's unceremonious dismissal .
Ever since Labour was embroiled in the cash - for - honours inquiry , ministers have been desperate to find something criminal to pin on the Tories .
A police officer removes items from Mr Green 's constituency office after the arrest
You do n't have to be a cynic to suspect that they decided to use Blair 's swansong to even up the score .
It 's no coincidence , either , that the investigation into illegal donations to Labour was also quietly shelved last week .
Deputy Commissioner Paul Stephenson certainly knew about Green 's arrest , since he phoned Boris Johnson to tell him .
But why call London 's mayor ?
This was a national , not a local , matter .
Surely the obvious first call was to the Home Secretary , especially as she 's not only directly responsible for the Met , but will also appoint the next Commissioner .
Stephenson has been running the Yard in the hiatus between Blair 's effective sacking and his leavingdo on Thursday night .
The permanent job was widely considered to be his to lose .
If there is any evidence that there was collusion between the Yard and the Home Office in the arrest of Green and that it was ordered to impress Smith , Stephenson should be ruled out of the contest and sent to spend the rest of his career in Elstree , directing traffic .
After Blair , everyone is looking for his successor to be a ' safe pair of hands ' .
What 's safe about mounting a heavy - handed operation to arrest a senior MP on the flimsiest of evidence ?
I 'm not a lawyer , but it would appear that no crime has even been committed .
At a very minimum , Stephenson should have told the investigating officers that arresting Green was unwise in the extreme and advised that if they wanted to talk to him they should invite him for a quiet chat at the Yard .
What is of equal concern is that the Speaker agreed to let the police search Green 's office at the Commons , declare it a ' crime scene ' , confiscate his files , mobile phone and laptop .
Gorbals
Mick is probably too thick to understand the historical duty of the Speaker to protect the independence of Parliament and its members .
This dates back to 1642 , when Charles I entered the House by force in an attempt to arrest five MPs and was repelled by the Speaker , who refused courageously to hand them over .
Eventually , Charles paid with his head .
Gorbals should pay with his job .
Conspiracy theorists could point to the fact that the raid occurred when Parliament was not sitting , so that no awkward questions could be asked in the Chamber and the traditional protection of MPs ' property had temporarily , technically , been suspended .
It 's difficult to know on which level this affair is most outrageous .
Is it the indifference of the Prime Minister and the culpability of Gorbals Mick in the violation of the sanctity of Parliament ?
Or the overthetop police operation , which involved not only confiscating Damian Green 's bank statements but also forcing him to submit to DNA and fingerprint sampling .
So the shadow immigration minister 's biological details join millions of other innocent people on this government 's sinister , if insecure , DNA database .
There are 6.5 million people on the fingerprint computer system ; the health department is spending £ 12 billion on a NHS database , which will put all our medical records on the internet ; another £ 20 billion is being blown on a useless ID cards scheme , which will be open to forgery and abuse ; and the children 's commissioner has warned about the dangers of the increasing amount of data held on every child from birth .
Britain leads the world in cradle - to - grave surveillance .
Labour has spent the past decade collating , spying , monitoring and carpeting the country with CCTV and speed cameras .
Even the Stasi did n't think of putting microchips in dustbins or using anti-terror laws to mount undercover operations against those suspected of living a few yards outside a school catchment area .
We 've had protesters arrested for exercising their right to free speech , attempts to all but abolish habeas corpus and now we 've had a member of the Shadow Cabinet dragged from his home by counter - terrorism officers , simply for doing his job - namely exposing the venality of the Government .
And never forget , this is the same bunch of sadistic gangsters which hounded scientist Dr David Kelly to his death , for telling the truth about Iraq 's non-existent nuclear weapons .
Millions of our forebears died in a ditch over centuries for freedoms which have been comprehensively trashed in the blink of an eye by a control - freak government - currently run by a quasi-dictator , elected by neither his party nor the country - with no respect for ancient liberties .
Never again will we listen to their pious preaching about Robert Mugabe 's tyranny .
This is Gordon Brown 's Morgan Tsvangirai moment .
Frankly , I found it difficult to contain my rage when I read of Green 's arrest in yesterday 's Mail .
I know I was n't alone .
It 's not enough that ' lessons should be learned ' and heads should roll .
This monstrous , abominable abuse of power should n't just bring down ministers , or police chiefs .
It should bring down this callous , rotten government .
Editor 's note : Lindsay Branham is communications coordinator for Food for the Hungry , an international Christian relief and development organization .
She has lived in the region for more than a year .
The names of the children in this article have been changed to protect them .
Lindsay Branham says armed groups are conscripting children as soliders in the Congo .
( CNN ) --
The border was hauntingly empty .
No military , drenched in green , patrolling .
No AKs slung over shoulders .
No Swahili floating through the air .
Just the pitter - patter of rain falling to the ground and turning the dirt road into a river .
To the right some secondary school students huddled beneath an overhang .
From a village close to Rutshuru in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , they had fled an attack by a rebel group .
The men with guns marched the boys outside and ordered them to file into a line .
" We were so scared , " said Jean , " we ran into the bush . "
Adamant that they did not want to fight , that they did not want to become soldiers , Jean explained how they had to hide themselves in the forest to escape being abducted .
Many of their friends , though , were taken .
See Branham 's view of the turmoil »
Melchisedek is a secondary school teacher in a village close to Rutshuru , an area heavily dominated by clashes between the Congolese government forces and the CNDP .
He said that twice armed groups came to his school to abduct children .
" They look through the windows and count the boys , " he said .
Conflict in Congo
The 11 - year conflict has led to more than 5.4 million deaths , according to a study by the International Rescue Committee .
Fighting between government forces , allied militias and rebels under Laurent Nkunda have forced about 250,000 people to flee since August .
The conflict is an offshoot of the Hutu - Tutsi animosity that led to the 1994 genocide of 800,000 people in neighboring Rwanda .
Rwandan Hutus who fled to Congo were afraid to return home , so they stayed in the jungles of eastern Congo , participating in Hutu militias .
Nkunda , a Tutsi and former Congolese army general , blamed the government for not protecting Tutsis from Rwandan Hutus .
The United Nations has approved 3,000 more troops for its 17,000 - strong force , already the world 's largest peacekeeping mission .
Boys .
Abducted to be soldiers .
The current war in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is marked by the use of child soldiers .
These young boys are abducted from their schools and homes and forced to hold a weapon and use it against their own government .
In Nakivale , a sprawling refugee settlement holding more than 30,000 people in Uganda , up to 600 new Congolese refugees are arriving daily .
Bombarded with hunger , disease and lack of basic essentials , people are suffering .
One man , Bahati , his frame thinned , stood weakly .
He said he is throwing up and having diarrhea nearly every five minutes .
He says sometimes there is blood in his excrement .
His face pale , he asked for medicine .
Watch Branham discuss child soldiers »
I asked a group of men if they had anything to do in the camp -- no , they said .
Then I asked what they did in Congo for a living .
" Cultivator , " " mason , " " teacher . "
One by one they listed their roles as father , provider and protector with pride .
Today they have been stripped of their livelihoods , of their way to take care of their families .
Today they fear they may never get to go back home to the lives they once led .
Melchisedek 's face was set passionately against the backdrop of U.N. relief agency - tarped tents as he told me more about how children are used as weapons in Congo .
He said the rebels give the boys three days of training , which includes an ideological indoctrination .
The boys are then thrown onto the front lines .
If they turn back in fear , they are shot from behind .
I asked if the boys are scared .
" Of course , " Melchisedek said .
In a place so rife with conflict -- more than a decade of war has blanketed the eastern part of the country , surging on and off in intensity -- the toll has multiplied .
At least 250,000 people have been displaced in the last few weeks , adding to the almost 1 million already displaced Congolese .
Jean and his friends pleaded with me for help .
They are in their last year of secondary school and want to complete the year to receive their diplomas .
They 've worked their entire lives for this .
And in the span of a few days , it has been destroyed .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
Jean said they have n't eaten in days .
While hiding in the forest from the rebels , they survived off fruit they could pick from trees .
Now in Busanza , Uganda , just feet from the Congo border at Kitagoma , they depend on the kindness of their Ugandan neighbors .
But Jean still gripped his stomach with his hands and clenched his face in pain to convey the urgency of his hunger .
Melchisedek said that as he fled with his wife and four children , the Congolese army fled with them .
Who is left to protect now ?
Melchisedek explained that as fighting became worse , gunshots flying through the air , bombs exploding , he got separated from his two youngest children -- 2 and 4 years old .
As he had to decide whether to continue running with the rest of his family and maybe live , or turn back and maybe die , he made an excruciatingly difficult choice .
He kept running .
At the Ishasha border crossing , Melchisedek said they had to swim through a river to cross over into Uganda since it was impossible to use the guarded border .
He described how they had to hold their children above their heads as they pushed through the quickly moving water .
They made it into Uganda .
But his two youngest are still somewhere in Congo .
He cast his eyes down , whispering , " I do n't know where they are . "
I saw pain in the eyes of the Congolese who were gracious enough to share their stories with me .
I also saw enormous courage .
Thrown into circumstances I can barely fathom , their dignity remains .
I am overcome by humanity .
The best and the worst .
I am horrified children are still being abducted to fight -- their childhoods stripped from them and a life of violence forced upon them .
I am humbled by the mothers I met , who continue to give their lives for the sake of their children .
One Congolese refugee woman , Espe , who fled the war last week while nine months ' pregnant , gave birth this week .
Espe named her daughter Tantine , which she says means " ca n't fear the war . "
Those words : can't fear the war .
An indescribable resolve has named that child .
Today I hear the voices of the refugees -- their stories wrapped like falling rain around me .
And I see the empty border again .
How many more Jeans , Melchisedeks and Espes are still behind the borders ?
How many will survive ?
I ask these questions not really wanting answers .
The relief and development organization I work with , Food for the Hungry , conducted an assessment this week with these very refugees to determine a way to respond .
I am convinced : The Congolese are waiting for peace .
But they should n't have to wait for assistance .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lindsay Branham .

There are a number of sources of Omega - 3 .
The most well known are cold water fish and flaxseed oil .
Interestingly both these sources differ as to the amount of Omega - 3 they contain and how the Omega - 3 is processed in the body .
Unrefined organic flaxseed oil contains around 55 % Omega - 3 more than any other source .
The American Dietetic Association lists flaxseed oil as the richest source of ALA ( alpha linolenic acid ) , and ALA is a parent compound of Omega - 3 fats .
ALA is converted in the body to EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) and DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) .
Flaxseed is also known as linseed which is a flowering annual with blue flowers .
It is versatile , being used in industrial and culinary contexts .
The fibre from the outer part of the plant is used in textiles and rope .
Highly valued for its oil and fibre , flaxseed has been linked to many health benefits .
Flaxseed can be purchased as oil , or as whole or ground seeds .
Flaxseed oil has a nutty flavour and the oil is not used for cooking as the nutritional value is lost but is used in dressings over salads , cooked vegetables , in dips among other dishes .
It is stored in an amber coloured bottle in the fridge to prevent oxidisation .
There are two types of flaxseed : Brown and Golden .
Golden is preferred for its nutty flavour , while Brown is used for Linseed oil and paints .
As for many seeds and beans , it is always best to grind the flaxseeds just before consumption , keeping the quality and flavour .
The nutrients are absorbed easily from the flaxseeds when ground .
As well as being high in Omega - 3 , flaxseeds are an excellent source of dietary fibre , and manganese , and a good source of folate , vitamin B6 , as well as the minerals magnesium , phosphorus , and copper .
Another important nutrient contained in flaxseeds is lignan phytonutrients .
The flaxseed is densely packed with nutrition .
Canadian Council of Flax lists , with studies and references , the benefits of flaxseed for certain conditions , which include : arrhythmia , prostate cancer , blood pressure , rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , heart health , depression .
In general , western diets contain around 10 times more Omega - 6 than Omega - 3 .
Medical bodies such as the National and Medical Research Council recommend increasing the amount of Omega - 3 consumed so that there is an even balance with Omega - 6 .
Omega - 6 is derived from a range of vegetable oils including sunflower , safflower , sesame , peanut , as well as polyunsaturated margarines or spreads , dairy and fatty meats .
The body uses Omega - 3 to make anti-inflammatory molecules which are effective against inflammatory conditions including arthritis , asthma , migraines and osteoporosis .
On the other hand the body uses Omega - 6 to produce pro-inflammatory molecules .
We need both types of Omega as long as Omega - 6 is balanced by Omega - 3.
Consuming more Omega - 3 is beneficial against excessive bone loss because of the higher ratio of Omega - 3 to Omega - 6 .
When the ratio is even , the damaging effect of Omega - 6 is reduced which researchers believe is due to the anti-inflammatory molecules protecting the body against the pro-inflammatory ones .
Other research has found that a healthy heart benefits from a balance of the Omega oils .
As previously mentioned flaxseed contains lignans .
Lignan compounds , which may be found in other seeds and grains , are converted in the body into hormone - like molecules .
These molecules have been found to provide some protection against breast cancer .
Other benefits for women include : reduced dry eyes , hot flashes , help with ovulation and balancing the hormones .
The lignans are recognised as antioxidants and beneficial for viral , fungal and bacterial infections .
If you are taking medications ( particularly those for blood thinning , diabetic and hormonal conditions ) and wish to take flaxseed , it is advisable to discuss this with a qualified health care practitioner .
If you are taking dietary supplements , the recommendation is to take flaxseed at a different time so as not to affect absorption -- 1 hour before or 2 hours after .
( Source : University of Maryland Medical Center ) The Omega - 3 and Omega - 6 oils are essential fatty acids which can only be obtained from food sources and cannot be synthesized .

In order to get requirements , business analysts often work through a number of realistic examples with the customers , such as existing report forms or examining existing work processes .
These examples are then translated to abstract requirements in the first step of the Telephone game .
Developers extract knowledge from that and translate it into executable code , which is handed over to testers .
Testers then take the specifications , extract knowledge from them and translate it into verification scripts , which are then applied to the code that was handed over to them by the developers .
In theory , this works just fine and everyone is happy .
In practice , this process is essentially flawed and leaves huge communication gaps at every step .
Important ideas fall through those gaps and mysteriously disappear .
After every translation , information gets distorted and misunderstood , leading to large mistakes once the ideas come through the other end of the pipe .
An interesting thing about examples is that they pop up several times later in the process as well .
Abstract requirements and specifications leave a lot of space for ambiguity and misunderstanding .
In order to verify or reject ideas about those requirements , developers often resort to examples and try to put things in a more concrete perspective when talking about edge cases to business experts or customers .
Test scripts which are produced to verify the system are also examples of how the system behaves .
They capture a very concrete workflow , with clearly defined inputs and expected outputs .
Concrete realistic examples give us a much better way to explain how things really work than requirements .
Examples are simply a very effective communication technique and we use them all the time , this comes so natural that we are not often aware of it .
Trying to put things into a better perspective , the participants of the second Agile Alliance Functional Testing Tools workshop , held in August 2008 in Toronto , came up with this diagram explaining the relationship between examples , requirements and tests :
Examples , requirements and tests are essentially tied together in a loop .
This close link between requirements , tests and examples signals that they all effectively deal with related concepts .
The problem is that every time examples show up on the timeline of a software project , people have to re-invent them .
Customers and business analysts use one set of examples to discuss the system requirements .
Developers come up with their own examples to talk to business analysts .
Testers come up with their own examples to write test scripts .
Because of the Telephone game , these examples might not describe the same things ( and they often do not ) .
Examples that developers invent are based on their understanding .
Test scripts are derived from what testers think about the system .
Requirements are often driven from examples , and examples also end up as tests .
With enough examples , we can build a full description of the future system : a specification by example .
We can then discuss those examples to make sure that everyone understands them correctly .
By formalising examples we can get strict requirements for the system and a good set of tests .
If we use the same examples throughout the project , from discussions with customers and domain experts to testing , then developers or testers do not have to come up with their own examples in isolation .
By consistently using the same set of examples we can eliminate the effects of the Telephone game .
The Doctors : Dr. Travis Stork Dating Carrie Underwood
25 country singing sensation and American Idol winner , has been seen out and about in New York City with .
If that name sounds familiar you 've either caught him as The Bachelor circa 2006 or as co-host on The Doctors , a new afternoon talk show .
Stork , 36 has a Nashville connection , having practiced ER medicine at Vanderbilt Medical Center .
His latest television venture bills the ER Doc and his colleagues as ' America 's medical dream team ' .
His cohorts include Dr. Jim Sears , Dr. Lisa Masterson and Dr. Drew Ordon .
The show debut was in September 2008 .
During Stork 's tenure on The Bachelor , he whittled down a group of 25 women and chose Nashville kindergarten teacher Sarah Stone to be his wife .
The dew was off the rose before the show finale hit the airwaves and the couple parted , fondly remembering the show as a " great experience in Paris and we 'll never forget that " .
Stork was photographed at one of Underwood 's recent Carnival Tour concerts in Topeka , Kansas .
He was sporting an all - access backstage pass around his neck .
They were also seen at Stephen Starr 's French bistro Parc in Philadelphia dining with friends .

Joe Klein is calling the McCain campaign 's assault on the media " insidious " , " bullying " and " not only stupidly aggressive , but unprofessional in the extreme . "
The story of the day out here in Minneapolis is the McCain campaign 's war against the press ...
So what 's going on here ?
Two things .
McCain is just plain angry at us .
By the evidence presented in the utterly revealing Time interview , he 's ballistic .
This is a politician who needs to see himself as the man on the white horse , boldly traversing a muddy field ... any intimations that he 's gotten muddied in the process , or has decided to throw mud , are intolerable .
The second thing is more insidious : Steve Schmidt has decided , for tactical reasons , to slime the press .
He wants the public to believe that there is an unfair -- sexist ( you gotta love it ) -- personal assault going on against Palin and her family .
This is a smokescreen , intended to divert attention from the fact the very real and responsible vetting that is taking place in the media -- about the substance of Palin 's record as mayor and governor .
... There is a tendency in the media to kick ourselves , cringe and withdraw , when we are criticized .
But I hope my colleagues stand strong in this case : it is important for the public to know that Palin raised taxes as governor , supported the Bridge to Nowhere before she opposed it , pursued pork - barrel projects as mayor , tried to ban books at the local library and thinks the war in Iraq is " a task from God . "
The attempts by the McCain campaign to bully us into not reporting such things are not only stupidly aggressive , but unprofessional in the extreme .
That 's straight talk , the clear - quill real deal .
Klein comes in for a lot of grief from liberal blogs because he was originally a vocal supporter of the Iraq invasion .
It 's been a goodly while now since Joe said that was a mistake he regrets and that 's good enough for me .
Liberals really should be cutting Joe some slack - he's a well - connected , establishment journalist who has worked out that he was fooled once and is determined not to have it happen again .
California ’s Fair Political Practices Commission ( FPPC ) announced today that they would investigate allegations that the LDS Church did not fully disclose non-monetary contributions to the Prop 8 Campaign .
Fred Karger of Californians Against
Hate called for the investigation last week , writing a letter to the FPPC detailing many of the allegations , including :
Church organized phone banks from Utah and Idaho
Sending direct mail to voters
Transported people to California over several weekends
Used the LDS Press Office to send out multiple News Releases to promote their activities to nonmembers
Walked precincts
Ran a speakers bureau
Distributed thousands of lawn signs and other campaign material
Organized a “ surge to election day ”
Church leaders travel to California
Set up of very elaborate web sites
Produced at least 9 commercials and 4 other video broadcasts all in support of Prop 8
Conducted at least 2 satellite simulcasts over 5 Western states
These allegations are on top of the $ 22 million raised by Mormons in support of Prop 8 , and according to Karger are in violation of the Political Reform Act .
While the LDS Church has not yet commented on the announcement , they have previously stated that they “ fully complied with the reporting requirements of the California Political Reform Act ” and that “ any investigation would confirm the church ’s full compliance with applicable law . ”
Roman Porter , executive director of FPPC said today that an investigation does n’t necessarily mean there was any wrongdoing , and asked everyone to “ reserve judgement . ”

The event provided clues as to how Mr Obama will handle the press
By Kevin Connolly
BBC News , Chicago
Barack Obama faced questions from the press in Chicago , the same city where , on election night , he saluted the American people 's response to one of the great challenges of their history .
America is still basking in the warm afterglow of the election which brought to power its first black president - a result which changed the way the world views America and , perhaps , changed the way Americans look at themselves .
But there is an undercurrent of anxiety here too - the bad news stories came thick and fast on the day we waited for Mr Obama under the glittering chandeliers of a downtown hotel ballroom over the road from the park where he embraced his destiny .
The event was interesting for the clues it gave us about how Mr Obama will manage his relationship with the press
Unemployment rose to its highest level for 14 years ; the crumbling powerhouses of Ford and General Motors produced more terrible figures ; and consumer sales , in the words of one analyst , fell off a cliff .
The president - elect 's first news conference since his powerful victory speech contained no major new message on the economy - indeed you got the impression that the event had been called not because Mr Obama had anything new to say , but because there was such hunger to hear him say something .
Mr Obama was ringed by his 17 - strong Transition Economic Advisory Team , and he underlined the core messages of his campaign - about the depth of the economic crisis , the pain facing families losing jobs and homes , and his determination to put together a stimulus package to help .
But there were no big new answers and difficult questions - about the quality of the intelligence to which he now has access , and how he will deal with disagreements with President George W Bush during the transition period - were politely but firmly batted away .
In America , though , his careful answers to questions which were distinctly lacking in challenge will be swallowed up avidly .
The United States is hungry for news about its new leader .
Double - take
He looked , I thought from my position just a few feet from the podium , as though the weariness of the campaign was showing in his face and voice .
But there was no doubt that he was in good form .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
When he walked in , the assembled journalists stood up , as they are expected to for the president - although no - one seemed quite sure whether it is also required for presidents - elect .
He did a slight double - take when he saw that and said simply : " Wow , thanks guys . "
Mr Obama knows how to charm a room and how to radiate a little humour and humility .
He did it again on his way out of the room after he had declared proceedings to be at an end , answering a journalist who shouted " One question from France ? " by smiling and calling : " Bonjour ! "
In between , the answers on the economy were fairly familiar - he will not be deterred from his priorities of clean energy , health , education and tax cuts by the state of the public finances , which are catastrophic .
The event was more interesting for the clues it gave us about how Mr Obama will manage his relationship with the press , rather than how he will manage the country .
He knew by name the Chicago Sun - Times reporter who was wearing a sling because she cracked her arm in the stampede to hear the Obama victory speech on Tuesday , and he was ready for the inevitable questions about what is surely to become the most famous dog in America .
This was chiefly about Americans being offered another chance to get to know their new president
This is the pet he has promised to buy his daughters Sasha and Malia when they live in the White House .
He said it was one of the biggest issues on his website , and many Americans are obsessed with what breed he will choose .
That in itself is a reminder of how extraordinary and powerful an idea it is that the the first family to which America now looks up is African - American .
Here too , Mr Obama was the soul of self - deprecation - Malia it seems is allergic , so the search is on for a hypoallergenic hound , although the politically correct preference would be for a shelter dog - " a mutt like me " as the new president - elect put it , making light of his mixed racial heritage which is the talk of the world .
There was substance on the economy , but nothing really new - this was chiefly about Americans being offered another chance to get to know their new president .
It will be interesting to see how the tone holds up and the style evolves as that relationship develops .

i Phone - Controlled R/C Car
Demo video
How - to video
The Big Idea
Layering different simple systems together to perform one complex task is really at the heart of what engineering is all about .
In this project we show how it is possible to utilize different technologies and piece them together to controll an inxpensive RC Car , with an iPhone .
With the NerdKit serving as the bridge between the computer and the R/C Car , it is as an example of how useful microcontrollers can be when they serve as the glue that makes complex systems work together , and how with an understanding of microcontrollers a neat system like this one is achievable as a Do - It - Yourself weekend project .
Parts List
Beyond the USB NerdKit , we need a few extra parts for this project .
Photo Part Quantity Description " Thunder Tumbler " remote control car 1 A colorful , simple R/C car .
It 's seems pretty tough and it's inexpensive enough to experiment with .
Small n-channel MOSFET , 2N7000 4
We need four transistors to act as switches .
Each one controls one of the four channels : left forward , left backward , right forward , right backward .
As we discussed the source , gate , and drain terminals in the NerdKits Guide , I 'll point them out here .
With the 2N7000 set as in the picture here , with leads down and labeling visible , the terminals are source , gate , drain from left to right .
As of 4/07/2009 , four 2N7000s are now included with the USB NerdKit !
Step 1 : Open up the controller , and drill a hole for the wires
If you take out the four screws on the back side of the remote control , you 'll be able to take the top half of the plastic case off , and this is basically what you 'll see ( with the right joystick removed ) :
We 're going to solder six wires in total inside the remote control , and we have to bring those wires out to the breadboard , so drill a small hole in the back of the remote control that 's big enough to get those six wires through .
Step 2 : Solder to the four control nodes , and the two battery leads
As described in the video , there are four little wire loops sitting underneath the folded metal springs .
These control the four possible movements .
Solder a wire to each one , and if you still want to be able to use the remote control without the NerdKit in the loop , then be extra careful not to obstruct the normal movement of the joysticks .
Also , attach wires onto the 9V battery holder inside the remote control , so that the NerdKit microcontroller can run off the same power source .
Step 3 : Build the circuit
The circuit you have to build is really quite simple , as it just uses the four 2N7000 transistors as switches between the remote control wires and ground :
You can see that we easily wired it up at the top of our NerdKits breadboard :
Step 4 : Compile and upload the software to the microcontroller
Download the source code , and then make a new NerdKits project just like you would any other -- starting from a template project on the included CD and modifying the Makefile .
Step 5 : The Web Server
We need to be running a web server on the computer for the iPhone to be able to communicate with the system .
Download and install the Apache Webserver .
Once that is installed , download the Web Code for this project .
It contains three files , car.php and newVector .
php should be placed in a web accessible folder ( these are the web scripts ) .
On Linux , Apache uses / var / www by default .
On Windows , you have to check the configuration to see where the root web folder is .
The third file , pyCar.py should be placed somewhere in your hard drive .
Now we have to create the named pipe that is going to allow newVector . php and pyCar.py to communiate with each other .
As we said in the video , and you can see from the code , newVector .
php treats the named pipe just like a file that it writes strings to .
The Python script opens the pipe just like a file and reads it , then sends the information to the NerdKit .
On Linux , to make the named pipe , use the command mkfifo my_pipe .

Tomislav Domazet - Lošo and Diethard Tautz from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön , Germany , have systematically analysed the time of emergence for a large number of genes - genes which can also initiate diseases .
Their studies show for the first time that the majority of these genes were already in existence at the origin of the first cells .
The search for further genes , particularly those which are involved in diseases caused by several genetic causes , is thus facilitated .
Furthermore , the research results confirm that the basic interconnections are to be found in the function of genes - causing the onset of diseases - can also be found in model organisms ( Molecular Biology and Evolution ) .
The Human Genome Project that deciphered the human genetic code , uncovered thousands of genes that , if mutated , are involved in human genetic diseases .
The genomes of many other organisms were deciphered in parallel .
This now allows the evolution of these disease associated genes to be systematically studied .
Tomislav Domazet - Lošo and Diethard Tautz from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön ( Germany ) have used for this analysis a novel statistical method , " phylostratigraphy " that was developed by Tomislav Domazet - Lošo at the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb ( Croatia ) .
The method allows the point of origin for any existing gene to be determined by tracing the last common ancestor in which this gene existed .
Based on this information , it is then possible to determine the minimum age for any given gene .
Applying this method to disease genes , the scientists from Plön came to surprising findings .
The vast majority of these genes trace back to the origin of the first cell .
Other large groups emerged more than one billion years ago around the first appearance of multi-cellular organisms , as well as at the time of origin of bony fishes about 400 million years ago .
Surprisingly , they found almost no disease associated genes among those that emerged after the origin of mammals .
These findings suggest that genetic diseases affected primarily ancient cellular processes , which emerged already during the early stages of life on Earth .
This leads to the conclusion that all living organisms today , i.e. not only humans , will be affected by similar genetic diseases .
Furthermore , this implies that genetically caused diseases will never be beaten completely , because they are linked to ancient evolutionary processes .
Although it was already known that many disease associated genes occur also in other organisms distant to humans , such as the fruitfly Drosophila or the round worm Caenorhabditis , the analysis of Domazet - Lošo and Tautz shows now for the first time that this is systematically true for the vast majority of these genes .
At present it remains unknown why the more recently evolved genes , for example those involved in the emergence of the mammals , do not tend to cause diseases when mutated .
The research results of the scientists from Plön also have some practical consequences .
It will now be easier to identify candidates for further disease genes , in particular for those involved in multi-factorial diseases .
Furthermore , the results confirm that the functional knowledge gained about such genes from remote model organisms is also relevant for understanding the genes in humans .
If your PS3 is connected to your big screen TV with an awesome sound system but all your films are on your PC that has a small screen and tiny speakers ?
Well here 's a quick ' How to ' that will guide you through streaming all that media you have stored on you PC onto your PS3 .

As a final note .
The PS3 does n't support all the file types that Windows Media Player does .
You have undoubtedly heard in your life the phrase , " garbage in , garbage out . "
Well , there is nothing more true when you talk about nutrition and what you put into your body and how it can effect your health and well being .
It is not a coincidence that as diets have moved from raw natural foods to highly processed foods , loaded with chemicals , additives , and laden with sugars that so many people are becoming overweight , fatigued , and literally debilitated with a myriad of chronic disease conditions .
The Extinction Of The Hunter Gatherer
People , until relatively recently , were hunter - gatherers whose diets consisted of a combination of lean animal foods ( including fish ) and uncultivated vegetables and fruits .
Studies show that the " average " ancient diet consisted of 55 percent animal foods and 45 percent plant foods .
The animal foods included healthy fats as well as protein , and the plant foods consisted of fruits , stalks , seeds , leaves , roots , and tubers .
Grains and cow 's milk did n't enter the picture until about 7,000 to 10,000 years ago , too short a time for genetic adaptation .
Today 's Doctors And Nutritionist Weigh In :
Many doctors , herbalists and nutritionists believe that a proper diet is the key to longevity , much more so than relying on the many pharmaceuticals created to treat ( or sometimes just mask ) the symptoms of disease .
Acid Alkaline Imbalance
Our bodies must stay in a very narrow ph level .
When excess acids are created by our bodies they must be neutralized .
To keep our bodies in this desired " homeostatic state " our body reacts to the acid condition by depleting alkaline reserves .
The result leaves the body in a weakened condition .
Acid Alkaline Imbalance Effect On Health :
An Acid Alkaline Balanced diet , according to many experts , is a vital key to health maintenance .
The concept of acid alkaline imbalance as the cause of disease is not new .
In 1933 a New York doctor named William Howard Hay published a ground - breaking book , A New Health Era in which he maintains that all disease is caused by autotoxication ( or " self - poisoning " ) due to acid accumulation in the body .
There have been numerous doctors , herbalists and nutritionists since that time supporting the theory that diets that create an acid-alkaline imbalance in the body ( over acidity ) if left unchecked can weaken all body systems , and give rise to an internal environment conducive to disease .
It is also believed that a shift to a pH - balanced diet can provide an environment which allows normal body function necessary for the body to resist disease .
Understanding pH
pH ( potential of hydrogen ) is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution .
It is measured on a scale of 0 to 14 .
The lower the pH the more acidic the solution .
The higher the pH the more alkaline ( or base ) the solution .
When a solution is neither acid nor alkaline it has a pH of 7 which is neutral .
Body pH :
The body is comprised of approximately 70 % water .
The body has an acid-alkaline ( or acid - base ) ratio called the pH which is a balance between positively charges ions ( acid- forming ) and negatively charged ions ( alkaline - forming . ) .
When we talk about body pH , we are not talking about the pH of the stomach .
When we refer to body pH we are referring to the pH of the body 's fluids and tissues .
As humans , a normal pH of all tissues and fluids in the body ( except the stomach ) is slightly alkaline .
The most critical pH is in the blood .
All other organs and fluids will fluctuate in their range in order to keep the blood a strict pH between 7.35 and 7.45 ( slightly alkaline ) .
This process is called homeostasis .
The body makes constant adjustments in tissue and fluid pH to maintain this very narrow pH range in the blood .
It continually strives to a balance pH in a very specific pH range .
When this balance is compromised many problems can occur .
Today 's Diet And Its Effect On Body pH :
Most people who suffer from unbalanced pH are acidic .
This condition forces the body to borrow minerals - including calcium , sodium , potassium and magnesium - from vital organs and bones to buffer ( neutralize ) the acid and safely remove it from the body .
When the body reacts to neutralize a highly acidic condition it weakens itself .
If this condition is a common occurrence , and the body must consistently respond to highly acidic conditions chronic health conditions may result .
What makes over acidity so insidious is that this condition may go undetected for years until permanent health conditions may result ( similar to how another diet condition ; pre-diabetes can occur as a result of long term carbohydrate loading leading to insulin insensitivity , eventually resulting in type 2 diabetes ) .
Scientific Evidence Confirms The Effect Of Diet On Disease
Overwhelming evidence from a variety of sources , including epidemiological , prospective cohort , and intervention studies , links most chronic diseases seen in the world today to physical inactivity and inappropriate diet consumption .
Chronic diseases present an enormous burden to society by increasing medical costs and human suffering ) .
Recent data estimate that physical inactivity and poor diet caused 400,000 deaths in 2000 , ranking second only to tobacco , and that it is likely that inactivity and diet will soon rank as the leading cause of death in the United States ) .
This number may be an underestimate given that it reflects deaths attributable only to those with obesity , and physical inactivity and inappropriate diet impact mortality at any BMI .
Although health problems such as diabetes , heart disease have been virtually nonexistent in underdeveloped countries , they are on the rise as these people change their diets and become more sedentary .
Acidosis Health Effects
To be to acidic in the body can have far reaching consequences .
For example , if the blood becomes too acidic the body will balance the pH at all costs .
This can lead to common symptoms which include but are not limited to :
Acceleration of free radical damage , possibly contributing to cancerous mutations and premature aging
Bladder and kidney conditions , including kidney stones
Bone loss , weak and brittle bones , osteoporosis , osteoarthritis , bone spurs and other osteo related conditions ( A recent seven - year study conducted at the University of California , San Francisco , on 9,000 women showed that those who have chronic acidosis are at greater risk for bone loss than those who have normal pH levels .
The scientists who carried out this experiment believe that many of the hip fractures prevalent among middle - aged women are connected to high acidity caused by a diet rich in animal foods and low in vegetables .
This is because the body borrows calcium from the bones in order to balance pH .

Body pH Testing
You can test your pH levels to determine if your body 's pH needs immediate attention .
Blood tests and urine are an accurate way to test blood pH. Saliva test can also be done .
Home pH test strips are available to determine your pH factor quickly and easily in the privacy of your own home .
Urine pH :
Urine testing may indicate how well your body is excreting acids and assimilating minerals , especially calcium , magnesium , sodium and potassium .
These minerals function as " buffers . "
Buffers are substances that help maintain and balance the body against the introduction of too much acidity or too much alkalinity .
Even with the proper amounts of buffers , acid or alkaline levels can become extreme .
When the body ingests or produces too many of these acids or alkalis , it must excrete the excess .
The urine is the perfect way for the body to remove any excess acids or alkaline substances that cannot be buffered .
Urinary pH should fluctuate between 6.0 - 6.4 in the morning and 6.4-7.0 in the evening .
If the average urine pH is below 6.5 the body 's buffering system is overwhelmed , a state of " autotoxication " exists , and attention should be given to lowering acid levels .
Saliva pH :
While the saliva also utilizes buffers just like the urine , it relies on this process to a much lesser degree .
It instead relies more on activity of digestive enzymes in the body that are primarily manufactured by the stomach , liver and pancreas .
Saliva pH reveals the flow of enzymes running through your body and shows their effect on all the body systems and your tissues .
Salivary pH should stay between 6.4 and 6.8 .
If the saliva pH is too low ( below 6.5 ) , the body may be producing too many acids or may be overwhelmed by acids because it has lost the ability to adequately remove them through the urine .
If the saliva pH is too high ( over 6.8 ) , the body may suffer greatly , e.g. excess gas , constipation and production of yeast , mold and fungus .
How To Determine Your Body pH Level
The best time to test your pH is about one hour before a meal and two hours after a meal .
I would recommend doing the saliva and urine tests for 10 days in a row .
Ignore the top three and bottom three tests because they 're extremes .
Average the remaining four to determine your pH .
You can retest a few weeks after changing your eating habits .
pH Levels And What They Mean
Healthy pH Levels :
If your urinary pH fluctuates between 6.- 0 to 6.4 in the morning and between 6.4 and 7.0 in the evening , your body is functioning within a healthy range .
If your saliva stays between 6.5 and 6.8 all day , your body is functioning within a healthy range .
Acidosis Effects On Body Chemistry :
Your body is able to assimilate minerals and nutrients properly only when its pH is balanced .
Not only may you be experiencing fatigue and other conditions with generalized symptoms that you might not consider may be the result of a acidic body condition but your problems may also be compounded in that such a condition may also impact the bioavailability of nutrients from your food , as well as from any supplements you may also be taking it improve your health and well being .
It is therefore possible for you to be taking healthy nutrients and yet be unable to absorb or use them .
If you are not getting the results you expected from your nutritional or herbal program , look for an acid alkaline imbalance .
Even the right herbal program may not work if your body 's pH is out of balance .
Getting Back On Track
Several studies have shown that physical activity and proper diet are effective interventions to many of the chronic diseases seen today .
Acid And Alkaline Minerals And Foods :
To determine if a food is acid or alkaline , it is burned and the ash is mixed with water .
If the solution is acid or alkaline then the food is called acid or alkaline .
Ash is the mineral content of the food .
Nutritionally important alkaline minerals include calcium ( Ca+ ) , potassium ( K+ ) , magnesium ( Mg+ ) , and sodium ( Na + ) .
In regards to diet , it is important to understand which foods create an acidic environment , and which foods help counteract an acidic environment .
Determining what foods are right for your diet is not as straight forward as it seems .
Food 's acid or alkaline - forming tendency in the body has nothing to do with the actual pH of the food itself .
For example , grapefruits , lemons and limes are very acidic , however the end - products they produce after digestion and assimilation are very alkaline so they are alkaline - forming in the body .
Likewise , meat will test alkaline before digestion but it leaves very acidic residue in the body so , like nearly all animal products , meat is very acid -forming .
To help you , I have included a brief summary of some specific foods and their effect on the body when digested ( refer to Table 1 below ) .
Tips To Restore Acid / Alkaline Balance In Your Body :
If your saliva and urine are too acid you would benefit from increasing the alkalinity of your body .
Ways to do this include :
Eat a balanced diet .
You should not cut out all acid - forming foods - some are necessary , otherwise you probably would n't get enough protein and variety of nutrients , .
The key to ph balancing the body is to shift the overall balance of your diet over toward the alkaline , and away from the excessively acid-forming diet of conventional western culture .
Eat mostly alkaline foods .
The general " rule of thumb " is to eat 20 % acid foods and 80 % alkaline foods .
Consume higher alkaline foods such as green leafy vegetables , broccoli , spinach , as well as mild alkaline fruits , and vegetables .
You do not have to be a vegetarian to gain the alkalizing benefits of fruits and vegetables .
Just a handful of raisins , two dates , or a small banana each provide more than 300 mg of potassium .
In fact it takes just about 35 percent of total calories as fruits and veggies to produce a net alkaline load .
Avoid the " strongly acid " foods .
Avoid or at least minimize strongly acid foods and drinks .
Limit mild acidic foods and drinks .
Limit mild acidic foods ( e.g. , grains , legumes , nuts ) and drinks .
Lower your glycemic load .
Cut back on breads , pastas , and other grain - based foods , as well as " high - glycemic " foods such as potatoes .
Besides causing potential acid conditions , higher blood sugar and higher insulin levels they are also nutrient - poor foods , compared with protein and veggies .
Refined carbohydrates also effects coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk .
Refined carbohydrates are highly processed , resulting in removal of fiber , vitamins , minerals , phytonutrients , and essential fatty acids .
Consumption of refined carbohydrates compared with whole grains increases the risk of CAD resulting , in part , from the increased glycemic load of these types of carbohydrates .
Limit artificial sweeteners .
Artificial chemical sweeteners like NutraSweet , Equal , or aspartame , are extremely acid-forming .
Consider natural sweetener stevia instead .
Supplement your diet .
The following is just a partial list of potential supplements .
Salts of the alkaline minerals cesium , rubidium .
Calcium citrate .
This supplement is better absorbed than calcium carbonate ( coral calcium is largely calcium carbonate ) .
Potassium is a crucial mineral for maintaining bone , mainly by promoting alkalinity .
Magnesium citrate .
Absorbable magnesium is crucial to help build necessary buffers .
Magnesium is often lost in urine as a consequence of too much acid in the body .
If your urine is 5.8 - 7.2 take magnesium citrate to support healthy bones .
Sulfur acts as a buffer to maintain proper pH levels .
Buffered vitamin C , which is ascorbic acid formulated with the carbonate forms of calcium , magnesium , and potassium , might also have a slight alkalizing effect .
Phosphorus is a mineral that helps convert food to energy .
Kelp ( Seaweed ) is high in alkaline and other healthy nutrients .
Colloidal Minerals .
Colloidal Minerals can help provide structural integrity for muscles , skin and hair , help eliminate toxins , supports enzyme function , enhance protein synthesis , provides electrolytes for cellular fluid balance , help regulate blood pressure and help supports the immune system .
Consider a high quality pH - balanced product that contains a full spectrum of macro and trace minerals , that can be easily assimilated into the body .
Elder Bark , Hops and Willow are examples of supplements that may reduce stress ( stress can create acidic conditions ) .
Enzymes for better digestion .
Examples my include : Amylase , Cellulase , Hydrilla , Marshmallow , Papaya , Protease , Lipase , Pectinase / Phytase , etc. ) .

Creating games is a business , there is no doubt , but it is a business that many people feel passionately about .
For every large team in the industry slaving away with massive resources on big - budget games , there are dozens of enthusiasts out there creating games with limited resources — or even experience — but loads of passion .
In fact , this is a great time to be a young game developer , as there are more ways than ever to learn to create your own games and sell them yourself .
One site is taking a new approach to making sure it has plenty of content : they will train gamers to create Flash games themselves .
Kongregate , a web site with an addictive variety of Flash games , has launched Kongregate Labs , a series of tutorials that , in essence , teach you how to use Flash to create your own games .
Jim Greer , the CEO of Kongregate , thinks the tutorials will give budding developers a good start .
After completing the tutorials , gamers " will know all the basic skill needed to create 2D flash games — animation , event handling , simple AI , collision detection , sound , even things like statistics and achievements .
They should be able to create a pretty wide variety of games , " he told Ars .
The forums at Kongregate have also become a place to learn , as users are sharing game creation tips with one another .
" In general the community in the forums and chat is quite supportive — people answering questions , helping out people who have problems .
This morning , one of our users posted very detailed instructions on how to complete the tutorials without the commercial Flash product using free open - source tools , " Greer said .
" That makes me happy . "
This may seem like an initiative that 's looking to the future , but these sorts of tools and user - driven communities actually hearken back to the early days of game development .
Greer explained why the company decided to begin this program .
" First off , we 've had a lot of demand for this — we have a programming forum on our site , and we were thinking it would be mostly experienced programmers exchanging tips .
As it turns out it 's a lot more beginning programmers asking for help . "
The second reason will be familiar to our older readers .
" Secondly , I learned to program by making games — this was like 25 years ago , on an Apple ] [+.
Back then it was pretty common for books and magazines to print the source code for games , and you had to type it in if you wanted to play it .
That was a great way to learn that obviously does n't happen any more , so creating a step - by - step tutorial seemed like a good alternative . "
While it 's true that level editors and SDKs for modern gaming may give experienced gamers more control over mods and new content than they even have , that does n't help inexperienced coders .
Kongregate Labs wants to lower the bar of entry , and the tutorials are their way of getting people excited about the possibility of creating their own content .
Of course Kongregate is also hoping that , in the end , the site will benefit from a user base that now knows how to create its own games ; the easiest way to make sure you find an Einstein is start teaching as many children as you can .
Greer sees a future where giving as many gamers as possible these tools will lead to what 's most important : great games .
" In the short term , I think we 'll see a lot of experimentation , pretty simple games , slight alterations of what you build in the tutorials .
Over the next 6 to 12 months , I bet we 'll see that some of those people turn into serious developers who create great games , " he explained .
" Obviously we 're betting that Kongregate will continue to benefit from that . "
Since the historical discovery of the speech center in the left cortex in 150 years ago , functional differences between left and right hemisphere have been well known ; language is mainly handled by left hemisphere , while spatial recognition is more specialized to the right hemisphere .
However , the structural differences of synapses underlying left - right difference of the brain remained unknown .
Japanese research team , led by Prof Ryuichi Shigemoto in National Institute for Physiological Sciences , Dr Yoshiaki Shinohara and his colleagues found that synaptic size and shape in the center of the spatial memory ( i.e. hippocampus ) were asymmetrical between synapses receiving input from the left and right hemisphere .
Hajime Hirase in Brain Science Institute in RIKEN helped this study , and it was done under Japan Science Technorogy Agency support .
They investigated the electron microscopic structure of synapses in left and right hippocampus , and found synapses made by terminals from the right hippocampus are large , complex in shape , and rich in the GluR1 subunit of AMPA - type glutamate receptors .
In contrast , synapses receiving input from the left hippocampus are small and rich in the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors .
That means , both synaptic structure and synaptic molecules differ between synapses with left and right inputs .
" Long - term potentiaon ( LTP ) , that is known as the cellular mechanism of learning and memory , depends on the allocation of glutamate receptors in hippocampus .
According to our present finding , synapses receiving right input may be more suitable to initiate LTP .
This finding may help understand how our left and right brains work differently " , said Prof Shigemoto .
This report is published in Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences in the week of Nov 17 , 2008 .
We know theft is against the law , and we know that when you download a song or a game without paying for it , there 's a good chance that it 's copyright infringement .
But what about when you steal a virtual item ?
Dutch courts had an interesting case to deal with when two youths were sued for stealing in - game items from another youngster , forcing him to give up items in the game Runescape .
The youths were sentenced to community service for their crimes .
In other words , theft of the virtual item has led to real - world consequences , a first for the Netherlands .
There are other criminal aspects of this case , as it has been reported that the victim gave up the items after being physically assaulted in his room and threatened with a knife if he did n't comply .
The case in question , however , dealt only with the stolen items , in this case an amulet and a mask .
The 15 - year - old and the 14 - year - old were sentenced to 200 and 160 hours of community service , respectively .
Most significantly , the court treated the Runescape goods as though they were material items : " these virtual goods are goods ( under Dutch law ) , so this is theft . "
This sets a strong precedent ( at least in The Netherlands ) : these goods have real - world value , and they " belong " to you inasmuch as it's a crime to take them from you by force .
This seems to be a very open - and - shut case , as it involves physical assault in addition to the theft , but cases rooted in virtual worlds may increasingly find themselves before meatspace judges .
Take EVE Online , for instance .
The game has been home to many cases of virtual fraud , and in some cases the " crime " takes place over months , involving industrial espionage or plain - old social engineering to grab cash , plans , or simply destroy in - game property .
EVE is a completely open , not to mention brutally competitive , world .
When these issues pop up , there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth , but in most cases gamers see it simply as being part of the game .
The issue comes up with in - game currency being traded for real currency , or even items or accounts being sold for real money .
While such action is against the End User Licensing Agreement of nearly all online games , a quick Google search shows that buying items or currency in any game is a simple matter .
Could these in - game heists be considered real - world fraud ?
In another case , Linden Labs repossessed virtual land from a user named Marc Bragg who bought the land by fiddling with URLs and making purchases on lots that Linden Labs did n't mean to be publicly available .
Bragg sued , and Linden Labs ended up reinstating the land , although the rest of the details of the settlement have remained confidential .
In another case in Second Life , a man sued another user who ripped off designs for in - game objects , which again have real - world value and are often sold .
In that case , the defendant ended up paying $ 525 in damages .
As long as in - game items can be easily translated into real - world value , we 'll continue to see online crime as often as we find it in the real world .
Maybe even more so , as " criminals " may think the court systems and the police are not educated in online gaming , or the law as it pertains to in - game items and cash .
What 's odd about the Dutch case is that as recently as late last year , Terra Nova published an opinion piece detailing Dutch wariness toward treating virtual items as real things , or thinking of deprivation of those items as theft .
" As long as the original owner loses something of value ( such as virtual items ) due to the act of another individual who gains possession over the item , it should in my opinion be qualified as theft , no matter whether the locus delicti is in the physical or the virtual world , " the author wrote .
While the courts have finally caught up with that opinion , more problematic aspects of treating in - game items as property will likely be fought out across a number of future cases .
( Reuters ) -
The faltering economy has become the central focus of the presidential campaign in the final days before the November 4 election .
Both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama have offered short term stimulus proposals and longer term packages to jump start the economy and provide for longer term growth .
The next U.S. president , who will take office on January 20 , 2009 , will be operating in the context of a record budget deficit of at least $ 500 billion .
Some analysts say it could reach as much as $ 1 trillion next year .
Republican John McCain has proposed a $ 52.5 billion short - term economic stimulus plan that would :
-- Use $ 300 billion of the $ 700 billion financial rescue package recently enacted to buy troubled mortgages and replace them with manageable fixed - rate mortgages .
-- Reduce taxes on the first $ 50,000 of withdrawals from IRA and 401 ( k ) retirement accounts to 10 percent for the next two years .
Currently , withdrawals at retirement are taxed at regular income tax rates that range from 10 percent to 35 percent .
-- Suspend rules that require retirees to begin withdrawals from retirement accounts six months after they reach the age of 70 .
The delay would allow retirees to ride out the current market crisis and stock market decline .
-- Increase the amount of capital losses from the sale of stocks and other assets that can be written off against ordinary income to $ 15,000 from $ 3,000 .
-- Reduce the top tax rate on long term capital gains , currently at 15 percent , to 7.5 percent for two years .
-- Exempt unemployment benefits from taxes for two years .
-- In the longer term , McCain has proposed extending President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts , which expire at the end of 2010 and cutting the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent .
-- McCain said he would cut government spending and promote free trade agreements .
Barack Obama has proposed an economic stimulus plan that some experts estimate could cost as much as $ 190 billion .
Obama said he would :

These days you can find things on the Internet that you would never see published in a magazine , or on television .
The cloak of anonymity and the chain - mail culture seems to encourage – among other things – the spread of sexist ‘ jokes ’ and stereotypes .
The internet abounds with articles taking an apparently humorous look at the kind of things that men and women ‘ always do ’ .
One particular list that caught my attention was ‘ Courses For Men , Taught By Women ’ which included such gems as “ Spelling : Even You Can Get It Right ” , “ The Weekend And Sports Are Not Synonymous ” and “ Parenting Does n’t End With Conception ” .
Of course there was a parallel list for women , but it was the list about men that got me thinking .
Let ’s not kid ourselves here : men as well as women are limited by gender stereotypes .
The idea of men as stupid and sex - obsessed is an enduring generalisation that is allowed to flourish in – dare I say it – a much more brazen way than the stereotypes about women , mainly because no man ever stands up and says : “ Hey , that ’s sexist and it offends me ! ”
The problem is , while women are encouraged to reject the ludicrous ideas that are held about them , men are supposed to embrace them .
In the creation of gender stereotypes , men really missed a trick .
Male - dominated culture has cultivated an image of women that I ’m sure you ’re familiar with : endlessly shopping , outspoken ( which for women essentially amounts to expressing a strong opinion about anything ) , money - draining , demanding and contrary .
The classic picture that we are presented with in television , films , advertisements and practically every other medium for disseminating information , is of women as a burden , the irritating nagging voice in the back of your head that wo n’t leave you alone even for a second and scolds you for leaving the toilet seat up .
Feminism encourages women to shed gender stereotypes and consider themselves as individuals .
Men simply do n’t think about gender .
Why would you , when it rarely impacts in a noticeable way on your life ?
But Christ , guys , have you seen what we ’re supposed to be like ?
Looking solely at stereotypes , men do not fare well .
I would never dare to suggest that men have a harder time than women in general society , because that ’s just patently untrue , but in terms of stereotypes we fail utterly .
Male perceptions of women are designed to make us feel smug in our superiority , but the way we ’ve chosen to label ourselves should make any man feel thoroughly humiliated and ashamed of his gender .
Men are often characterised as spoiled , helpless brats utterly unable to perform simple household tasks , too stupid to remember anniversaries and appointments and completely unable to understand these strange female creatures and their hysterical emotions .
We ’re base brutes ruled by our overactive sex drives who simply can’t help being crass and immature , because that is the way God made us .
Basically , we are mentally deficient lumps who require a female carer to function in society .
This is precisely the kind of ridiculous stereotype that , if applied to women , would be torn to shreds in intelligent debate .
So why do n’t men object at being labelled emotional morons totally in thrall to their basest instincts ?
Here ’s the thing : men do n’t have anything remotely equivalent to feminism .
From an early age , women are aware of their gender and what it means for their lives , far more than men are .
Feminism encourages women to shed gender stereotypes and consider themselves as individuals .
Men simply do n’t think about gender .
Why would you , when it rarely impacts in a noticeable way on your life ?
Very rarely is your progress barred because you are a man and it is true that male culture generally does not promote frank and open discussion of such issues .
Many men are n’t feminists simply because it has never occurred to them that they should be : when you ’re not faced every day with the challenges thrown up by gender inequality it is very easy to think : “ Well , we ’ve changed the law so we have equality now . ”
I know it sounds ridiculous – you ’d never hear anyone claiming that racism died when it became illegal to racially discriminate , for example , but it is a pretty common thought .
If women are under - represented in highly paid jobs , it is because these changes take time to filter through , or because there were no female candidates qualified enough to take the positions , not because sexism is still endemic .
I ’m ashamed to say that I used to think like that : sexism is n’t a major issue for men and it is easy to brush it off in this manner .
For a man to become all that is good and masculine , he must revel in his inability to function as an acceptable human being .
The ultimate goal of a ‘ real man ’ is to spend his life slumped in front of the television , beer in hand , watching the football and waiting for his wife to cook him something appropriately manly
So men do n’t get to discuss gender in the same way that women do , and there ’s a reason for this .
Male culture – the kind promoted by FHM , Nuts , tabloid newspapers and the like – abhors debate on anything remotely intelligent .
Men are hemmed in on two fronts : by the stereotypes the media pins on them and the pervading culture they have created for themselves that leads to such stereotypes in the first place .
The ‘ real man ’ is encouraged to reject intelligence and self - improvement as ideas firmly in the domain of women , creating a wonderful self - perpetuating cycle of idiocy .
Creativity , interest in academia and a desire to learn are all frowned upon by a male culture where footballers are considered legitimate role models .
Reading ?
Boring .
Poetry ?
Something for ‘ gays ’ and ‘ nerds ’ , lesser men in the eyes of their peers .
Lesbianism ?
A spectator sport designed for the titillation of men .
For a man to become all that is good and masculine , he must revel in his own stupidity and inability to function as an acceptable human being .
The ultimate goal of a ‘ real man ’ is to spend his life slumped in front of the television , beer in hand , watching the football and waiting for his wife to cook him something appropriately manly .
I always found it amusing that massive slabs of meat are considered more fitting for a man ’s meal than those no - good effeminate vegetables , but it ’s the only part of this rotten aspirational model that makes me smile .
We ’re meant to feel good about this ?
This is the goal of a man ’s life ?
No thanks .
I ’m by no means the only one who rejects the idea of a ‘ real man ’ embodying all these things , but – and here ’s the crucial point – despite the fact that there are many of us who grew up resenting the dominance of this ( to borrow a phrase ) idiocracy , we are content to let it continue .
The people labelled nerds or geeks for not wanting the worthless life that traditional masculinity offers them , allow themselves to be ostracised for it .
Yes , it is gratifying to look back at those people who , during your teenage years , were the epitome of the classic ideas of manhood .
They mostly now live dead - end lives , but do n’t forget that their culture is still the dominant one among men .
Intelligent men who do n’t subscribe to this ideal of a ‘ real man ’ as a rugged emotionally - stunted womaniser probably outnumber those who do , and yet it ’s still not quite alright for a man to be interested in poetry , be a feminist , or know how to darn socks ( hey , I ’m a student , it ’s all about saving money ! ) .
A lot of men do n’t realise that instead of feeling troubled because they fail to fit this mould , they should be rejoicing in breaking free of it .
Let ’s start converting some more men to feminism : considering the problems caused by gender for women is a fantastic way to make them think about how gender also holds them back .
It worked for me
Feminism has taught women who are prepared to listen that their traditional gender roles need n’t be upheld as a good thing , that to branch out from the way women are ‘ supposed to be ’ is a way of marking yourself out as independent and intelligent .
Men simply have n’t got anything to raise their consciousness about this issue : we are still , as a gender , wedded to these damaging ideas of manhood that do nothing but churn out generation after generation of men unable to aspire to any goals worth having .
So what can we , a group of individuals who clearly care about gender equality and despise gender stereotypes , do about this ?
Granted , it is n’t fair of men to expect feminism to deal with male gender stereotypes as well as female ones , and I do n’t for a second they should , but it is a problem that affects all of us .
A prevailing culture of stupidity just is n’t good enough for men or women , even if the former often do n’t realise it .
Men can be the attentive and understanding partners that women want , and it is a tragic shame that society has conditioned the male mind to reject this sensitivity as weak and inappropriate .
The change that needs to be made is cultural , but that does n’t make it any less difficult .
Let ’s stop putting sports stars on a pedestal and start celebrating poets , writers , scientists and artists .
Let ’s start converting some more men to feminism : considering the problems caused by gender for women is a fantastic way to make them think about how gender also holds them back .
It worked for me .
It is easier to see the problem than come up with a solution , but just letting male culture continue down this road is n’t good enough for me .
Guys , unless we learn to throw out these damaging ideas of manhood and learn to aspire to something better , when we truly have equality of the sexes we ’re going to look very shabby and stupid compared to women .
I ’m used to being ashamed and disappointed by the way my gender acts – I do n’t want to add embarrassment to that list .
Alex Gibson is a modern history student at Magdalen College , Oxford .

Video taken in Turkey earlier this year allegedly shows unprecedented detailed footage of UFOs visiting earth .
The footage was captured by night guard Yalcin Yalman in a compound in Turkey , and handed over to the Sirius UFO Space Science Research Centre for confirmation .
The video below is a 16 minute version of the highlights from over two and a half hours of UFO footage .
After running extensive testing on the footage , and confirming independent sitings of UFOs in the area at the same time , the center is claiming the footage is n’t faked , and that it ’s the best evidence yet that we are not alone in the universe .
The video has to be seen to be believed .
It ’s a case of Aliens being real , or this being the most elaborate scam of all time , because that ’s how incredible this footage is compared to what we ’ve come to expect from so - called “ UFO evidence ” in the past .
I want to believe …. and at least one shot shows a craft not completely dissimilar to the flying cookie picture we covered last week .
What do you think ?
Return return
Among the things I read during the past two months was the paper Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher - Order Polymorphism , by Mark P. Jones .
I do n't remember why I read this , but it sure was interesting .
It is an introduction to the new , cool features of Haskell 's type system , with many examples .
It was written in 1995 when the features were new .
They 're no longer new , but they are still cool .
There were two different pieces of code in this paper that wowed me .
When I started this article , I was planning to write about # 2 .
I decided that I would throw in a couple of paragraphs about # 1 first , just to get it out of the way .
This article is that couple of paragraphs .
[ Addendum 20080917 : Here 's the article about # 2 . ]
Suppose you have a type that represents terms over some type v of variable names .
The v type is probably strings but could possibly be something else : data Term v = TVar v --
Type variable | TInt -- Integer type | TString -- String type | Fun ( Term v ) ( Term v ) -- Function type
There 's a natural way to make the Term type constructor into an instance of Monad : instance Monad Term where return v = TVar v TVar v >>= f = f v TInt >>= f = TInt TString >>= f = TString Fun d r >>= f = Fun ( d >>= f ) ( r >>= f )
That is , the return operation just lifts a variable name to the term that consists of just that variable , and the bind operation just maps its argument function over the variable names in the term , leaving everything else alone .
Jones wants to write a function , unify , which performs a unification algorithm over these terms .
Unification answers the question of whether , given two terms , there is a third term that is an instance of both .
For example , consider the two terms a → Int and String → b , which are represented by Fun ( TVar " a " ) TInt and Fun TString ( TVar " b " ) , respectively .
These terms can be unified , since the term String →
Int is an instance of both ; one can assign a = TString and b = TInt to turn both terms into Fun TString TInt .
The result of the unification algorithm should be a set of these bindings , in this example saying that the input terms can be unified by replacing the variable " a " with the term TString , and the variable " b " with the term TInt .
This set of bindings can be represented by a function that takes a variable name and returns the term to which it should be bound .
The function will have type v → Term v .
For the example above , the result is a function which takes " a " and returns TString , and which takes " b " and returns TInt .
What should this function do with variable names other than " a " and " b " ?
It should say that the variable named " c " is " replaced " by the term TVar " c " , and similarly other variables .
Given any other variable name x , it should say that the variable x is " replaced " by the term TVar x .
The unify function will take two terms and return one of these substitutions , where the substition is a function of type v → Term v .
So the unify function has type : unify :: Term v → Term v → ( v → Term v ) Oh , but not quite .
Because unification can also fail .
For example , if you try to unify the terms a → b and Int , represented by Fun ( TVar " a " ) ( TVar " b " ) and TInt respectively , the unfication should fail , because there is no term that is an instance of both of those ; one represents a function and the other represents an integer .
So unify does not actually return a substitution of type v → Term v. Rather , it returns a monad value , which might contain a substitution , if the unification is successful , and otherwise contains an error value .
To handle the example above , the unify function will contain a case like this : unify TInt ( Fun _ _ ) = fail ( " Cannot unify " ....)
It will fail because it is not possible to unify functions and integers .
If unification is successful , then instead of using fail , the unify function will construct a substitution and then return it with return .
Let 's consider the result of unifying TInt with TInt .
This unification succeeds , and produces a trivial substitition with no bindings .
Or more precisely , every variable x should be " replaced " by the term TVar x .
So in this case the substitution returned by unify should be the trivial one , a function which takes x and returns TVar x for all variable names x .
But we already have such a function .
This is just what we decided that Term 's return function should do , when we were making Term into a monad .
So in this case the code for unify is : unify TInt TInt = return return Yep , in this case the unify function returns the return function .
Wheee !
At this point in the paper I was skimming , but when I saw return return , I boggled .
I went back and read it more carefully after that , you betcha .
That 's my couple of paragraphs .
I was planning to get to this point and then say " But that 's not what I was planning to discuss .
What I really wanted to talk about was ... " .
But I think I 'll break with my usual practice and leave the other thing for tomorrow .
Happy Diada Nacional de Catalunya , everyone !

The radio presenter who called a Conservative councillor a " Nazi " and an " ignorant pig " live on air has been sacked .
An investigation was launched after the remarks , made by Jon Gaunt on his Talksport radio show , generated " a number " of complaints from listeners .
During a show earlier this month , Gaunt was interviewing councillor Michael Stark about Redbridge Council 's ban on smokers becoming foster parents , which will come into force in January 2010 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Stark defended the decision on the grounds that the welfare of young children should be put ahead of the needs of foster families .
But Gaunt , who was in care as a child , accused his interviewee of being a " Nazi " and an " ignorant pig " .
He then tried to tone down his remarks by saying Mr Stark was a " health Nazi " and arguing that children in care would be deprived of the chance of finding a foster home under the new policy .
At the end of the show , Gaunt made an on -air apology to his guest and was suspended pending an investigation .
A Talksport spokesman said today : " Talksport yesterday terminated presenter Jon Gaunt 's contract following an interview with Redbridge Council 's Councillor Michael Stark on Friday , November 7 .
" The decision follows an internal Talksport investigation that was instigated following complaints about the content and nature of the broadcast .
" The radio station has apologised to the councillor for the manner in which the interview was conducted . "
War was a common pastime in the middle ages .
Nations battled nations , cities battled cities , and villages battled villages .
It is no wonder that it is the period that generated some of the greatest soldiers and military units in history .
This is a list of the best of the best – the 12 most impressive soldiers of the middle ages .
12 Mamluks
A mamluk was a slave soldier who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages .
Over time , they became a powerful military caste often defeating the Crusaders .
On more than one occasion , they seized power for themselves ; for example , ruling Egypt in the Mamluk Sultanate from 1250 – 1517 .
After mamluks had converted to Islam , many were trained as cavalry soldiers .
Mamluks had to follow the dictates of furusiyya , a code that included values such as courage and generosity , and also cavalry tactics , horsemanship , archery and treatment of wounds , etc .
11 Janissary
The Janissaries comprised infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan ’s household troops and bodyguards .
The force was created by the Sultan Murad I from Christian slaves in the 14th century and was abolished by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 with the Auspicious Incident .
Initially a small compact force of elite troops , they grew in size and power during the five centuries of their existence until they eventually became a threat to the fabric of the Ottoman empire .
In their later years , they mutinied whenever an attempt was made to reform them , deposing and murdering those sultans they regarded as enemies .
10 Billmen
The bill was a polearm used by infantry in Europe in the Viking Age by Vikings and Anglo - Saxons as well as in the 14th , 15th , and 16th centuries .
It was a national weapon of the English , but was also common elsewhere , especially in Italy .
Derived originally from the agricultural billhook , the bill consisted of a hooked chopping blade with several pointed projections mounted on a staff .
The end of the cutting blade curves forward to form a hook , which is the bill ’s distinguishing characteristic .
In addition , the blade almost universally had one pronounced spike straight off the top like a spear head , and also a hook or spike mounted on the ‘ reverse ’ side of the blade .
One advantage that it had over other polearms was that while it had the stopping power of a spear and the power of an axe , it also had the addition of a pronounced hook .
If the sheer power of a swing did not fell the horse or its rider , the bill ’s hooks were excellent at finding a chink in the plate armour of cavalrymen at the time , dragging the unlucky horseman off his mount to be finished off with either a sword or the bill itself .
9 Boyar
A boyar or bolyar was a member of the highest rank of the feudal Moscovian , Kievan Rusian , Bulgarian , Wallachian , and Moldavian aristocracies , second only to the ruling princes ( in Bulgaria Emperors ) , from the 10th century through the 17th century .
The rank has lived on as a surname in Russia and Finland , where it is spelled “ Pajari ” .
Boyars wielded considerable power through their military support of the Kievan princes .
Power and prestige of many of them , however , soon came to depend almost completely on service to the state , family history of service and to a lesser extent , landownership .
Ukrainian and “ Ruthenian ” boyars visually were very simillar to western knights , but after the Mongol invasion their cultural links were mostly lost .
8 Knights Templar
The Poor Fellow - Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon , commonly known as the Knights Templar or the Order of the Temple , were among the most famous of the Western Christian military orders .
The organization existed for approximately two centuries in the Middle Ages , founded in the aftermath of the First Crusade of 1096 , with its original purpose to ensure the safety of the many Christians who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem after its conquest .
Officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129 , the Order became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power .
Templar knights , in their distinctive white mantles with red cross , were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades .
Non-combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom , innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking , and building many fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land .
7 Crossbowmen
A crossbow is a weapon consisting of a bow mounted on a stock that shoots projectiles , often called bolts .
It was created in the Mediterranean and in China separately .
A mechanism in the stock holds the bow in its fully - drawn position until it is shot by releasing a trigger .
Crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of North Africa , Europe and Asia .
Crossbows are used today primarily for target shooting and hunting .
The use of crossbows in European warfare dates back to Roman times and is again evident from the battle of Hastings until about 1500 AD .
They almost completely superseded hand bows in many European armies in the twelfth century for a number of reasons .
Although a longbow could achieve comparable accuracy and faster shooting rate than an average crossbow , crossbows could release more kinetic energy and be used effectively after a week of training , while a comparable single - shot skill with a longbow could take years of practice .
6 Housecarls
Housecarls were household troops , personal warriors and equivalent to a bodyguard to Scandinavian lords and kings .
The anglicized term comes from the Old Norse term huskarl or huscarl .
They were also called hirth ( ‘ household ’ ) that referred to household troops .
The term later came to cover armed soldiers of the household .
They were often the only professional soldiers in the kingdom , the rest of the army being made up of militia called the fyrd , peasant levy , and occasionally mercenaries .
A kingdom would have fewer than 2,000 Housecarls .
In England there may have been as many as 3,000 royal housecarls , and a special tax was levied to provide pay in coin .
They were housed and fed at the king ’s expense .
They formed a standing army of professional soldiers and also had some administrative duties in peacetime as the King ’s representatives .
The term was often used in contrast to the non-professional fyrd .
As an army , the Housecarls were renowned for their superior training and equipment , not only because they constituted a standing army ( an ad hoc fighting force of professional soldiers as opposed to militia ) , but also due to rigorous quality control .
For example , one lord passed legislation requiring that all enlistees own a sword with a gold - inlaid hilt .
This assured that enlistees were of the economic standing that would permit them to train without financial hindrance and purchase good quality equipment .
The most famous army of housecarls is without a doubt the one employed by Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings .
5 Varangian Guard
The Varangians or Varyags , sometimes referred to as Variagians , were Vikings , Norsemen , mostly Swedes , who went eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia , Belarus and Ukraine mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries .
Engaging in trade , piracy and mercenary activities , they roamed the river systems and portages of Gardariki , reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople .
Basil II ’s distrust of the native Byzantine guardsmen , whose loyalties often shifted with fatal consequences , as well as the proven loyalty of the Varangians led Basil to employ them as his personal bodyguards .
This new force became known as the Varangian Guard .
Over the years , new recruits from Sweden , Denmark , and Norway kept a predominantly Scandinavian cast to the organization until the late 11th century .
So many Scandinavians left to enlist in the guard that a medieval Swedish law stated that no one could inherit while staying in Greece .
In the 11th century , there were also two other European courts that recruited Scandinavians : Kiev Rus c. 980-1060 and London 1018 - 1066 .
Steve Runciman , in “ The History of the Crusades ” noted that by the time of the Emperor Alexius , the Byzantine Varangian Guard was largely recruited from Anglo - Saxons and “ others who had suffered at the hands of the Vikings and their cousins the Normans ” .
4 Swiss Mercenaries
Swiss mercenaries were soldiers notable for their service in foreign armies , especially the armies of the Kings of France , throughout the Early Modern period of European history , from the Later Middle Ages into the Age of the European Enlightenment .
Their service as mercenaries was at its apogee during the Renaissance , when their proven battlefield capabilities made them sought - after mercenary troops .
During the Late Middle Ages , mercenary forces grew in importance in Europe , as veterans from the Hundred Years War and other conflicts came to see soldiering as a profession rather than a temporary activity , and commanders sought long - term professionals rather than temporary feudal levies to fight their wars .
Swiss mercenaries were valued throughout Late Medieval Europe for the power of their determined mass attack in deep columns with the pike and halberd .
Hiring them was made even more attractive because entire ready - made Swiss mercenary contingents could be obtained by simply contracting with their local governments , the various Swiss cantons , the cantons had a form of militia system in which the soldiers were bound to serve and were trained and equipped to do so .
It should be noted , however , that the Swiss also hired themselves out individually or in small bands .
3 Cataphract
A cataphract was a form of heavy cavalry used by nomadic eastern Iranian tribes and dynasties and later Ancient Greeks and Romans .
Historically the cataphract was a heavily armed and armoured cavalryman who saw action from the earliest days of Antiquity up through the High Middle Ages .
Originally , the term referred to a type of armour worn to cover the whole body and that of the horse .
Eventually the term described the trooper himself .
While cataphracts and knights are given differing names , in battle the cataphract ’s role differed little from that of the knight in medieval Europe , though arms and tactics still separated the two .
Unlike a knight , a cataphract was merely a soldier off the battlefield and had no fixed political position or role beyond military functions .
2 Halberdiers
A halberd is a two - handed pole weapon that came to prominent use during the 14th and 15th centuries .
Possibly the word halberd comes from the German words Halm ( staff ) , and Barte ( axe ) .
The halberd consists of an axe blade topped with a spike mounted on a long shaft .
It always has a hook or thorn on the back side of the axe blade for grappling mounted combatants .
It is very similar to certain forms of the voulge in design and usage .
The halberd was 1.5 to 1.8 meters ( 4 to 6 feet ) long .
The halberd was cheap to produce and very versatile in battle .
As the halberd was eventually refined , its point was more fully developed to allow it to better deal with spears and pikes ( also able to push back approaching horsemen ) , as was the hook opposite the axe head , which could be used to pull horsemen to the ground .
Additionally , halberds were reinforced with metal rims over the shaft , thus making effective weapons for blocking other weapons like swords .
This capability increased its effectiveness in battle , and expert halberdiers were as deadly as any other weapon masters were .
It is said that a halberd in the hands of a Swiss peasant was the weapon that killed the Duke of Burgundy , Charles the Bold , decisively ending the Burgundian Wars , literally in a single stroke .
And finally , my own number 1 most impressive medieval military unit .. by far ..
1 Longbowmen
A longbow is a type of bow that is tall ( roughly equal to the height of a person who uses it ) , is not significantly recurved and has relatively narrow limbs , that are circular or D - shaped in cross section .
A Welsh or English military archer during the 14th and 15th Century was expected to shoot at least ten “ aimed shots ” per minute .
An experienced military longbowman was expected to shoot twenty aimed shots per minute .
A typical military longbow archer would be provided with between 60 and 72 arrows at the time of battle , which would last the archer from three to six minutes , at full rate of shooting .
Thus , most archers would not loose arrows at this rate , as it would exhaust even the most experienced man .
Not only are the arms and shoulder muscles tired from the exertion , but the fingers holding the bowstring become strained ; therefore , actual rates of fire in combat would vary considerably .
Ranged volleys at the beginning of the battle would differ markedly from the closer , aimed shots as the battle progressed and the enemy neared .
Arrows were not unlimited , so archers and their commanders took every effort to ration their use to the situation at hand .
Nonetheless , resupply during battle was available .
Young boys were often employed to run additional arrows to longbow archers while in their positions on the battlefield .
“ The longbow was the machine gun of the Middle Ages : accurate , deadly , possessed of a long range and rapid rate of fire , the flight of its missiles was likened to a storm . ”
This rate was much higher than that of its Western European projectile rival on the battlefield , the crossbow .
It was also much higher than early firearms ( although the lower training requirements and greater penetration of firearms eventually led to the longbow falling into disuse in English armies in the 16th century ) .
Longbows were difficult to master because the force required to deliver an arrow through the improving armour of medieval Europe was very high by modern standards .
Although the draw weight of a typical English longbow is disputed , it was at least 360 N ( 80 lbf ) and possibly more than 650 N ( 143 lbf ) with some high - end estimates at 900N ( 202 lbf ) .
Considerable practice was required to produce the swift and effective combat shooting required .
Skeletons of longbow archers are recognizably deformed , with enlarged left arms and often bone spurs on left wrists , left shoulders and right fingers .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the plan to buy troubled bank assets would cost " hundreds of billions " of dollars .
" This needs to be big enough to make a real difference and get at the heart of the problem , " Paulson told reporters at a brief press conference .
Paulson said the plan would include features to protect the taxpayer " to the maximum extent possible . "
" The ultimate taxpayer protection will be the stability this troubled asset relief program provides to our financial system , even as it will involve a significant investment of taxpayer dollars , " Paulson said .
THE dense woods of northern New England are crackling these chilly November days with the sound of rifle shots : the deer - hunting season opened in mid-month and is in full swing .
But the camouflaged shooters are not roaming the forests quite as they did in the past .
In ( non-native ) America 's oldest hunting grounds , the sport is in slow decline .
In Vermont the number of hunting licences sold has dropped 12 % over the past ten years .
In New Hampshire , where 60,000 resident and visiting hunters contribute $ 83 m annually to the small state 's economy , the decline is even steeper : a 28 % drop in licences since 1996 .
The ceasefire causes problems , since the fees are used to help pay for wildlife management .
Judy Stokes , of New Hampshire 's Department of Fish and Game , identifies several causes : the loss of hunting areas to housing and commercial development ; the competing demands on family time posed by sport and other weekend activities for children ; and a changing social structure .
“ It takes a hunter to make a hunter , and fewer fathers are bringing up their children as hunters , ” she says .
Of New England 's northern states , only Maine has seen the popularity of hunting hold steady .
The number of licences issued there has stayed at about 200,000 since 1993 .
Paul Jacques , of the state wildlife department , thinks this is because Maine is better than its neighbours at keeping game and fish populations high for hunters and anglers .
The state has also encouraged both young and old to join the hunt .
It has introduced a $ 500 lifetime licence for children under 16 , and Maine citizens aged 70 years and older can buy a lifetime licence for $ 8 .
Maine has a special incentive to protect its outdoors .
Its gross state product is less than $ 50 billion , and the contribution of hunting , fishing , bird - watching , boating and so on is put at $ 2.5 billion — a vital statistic in a state where L.L. Bean , an outdoors catalogue company , ranks among the five largest employers .
There 's a growing anti-trade sentiment in our country .
Much of the dialogue is grossly misinformed .
Let 's try to untangle it a bit with a few questions and observations .
Does the U.S. trade with Japan and England ?
Put another way , is it members of the U.S. Congress trading with their counterparts in the Japanese Diet or the English Parliament ?
Of course not .
When I purchased my Lexus , I had nothing to do with either the Japanese Diet or the U.S. Congress .
Through an intermediary , a Lexus dealer , I dealt with Toyota Motor Corporation .
While it might be convenient to speak of one country trading with another , such aggregation can conceal a lot of evil , particularly when people call for trade barriers .
For example , what would be a moral case for third - party interference , by either the Japanese Diet or the U.S. Congress , with an exchange between me and Toyota Motor Corporation ?
Some might reason that since Japan places restrictions on U.S. products entering their country , an appropriate retaliatory measure is not to allow Japanese products to freely enter the U.S. Consider that Japanese protectionist restrictions on rice imports force Japanese consumers to pay three or four times the world price for rice .
How much sense does it make for Congress to retaliate against Japan by imposing restrictions on their products thereby forcing American consumers , say Lexus buyers , to pay higher prices ?
Should our rule be :
If one country screws its citizens we should retaliate by screwing our citizens ?
MP : It 's a simple , but overlooked point : Countries do n't trade , individual American consumers make voluntary decisions to buy products produced by foreign companies ( e.g. check the country of origin on the tags / labels on your clothes ) , and individual American businesses voluntarily buy from , and sell to , foreign firms and consumers .
Most of the discussion about trade focuses on aggregate trade statistics at the " country level , " like reports of a $ 56.5 billion U.S. trade deficit in September , a $ 700 billion U.S. trade deficit for 2007 , a $ 195 trade deficit with China this year , or a $ 14 billion trade surplus with the Netherlands this year .
Like Walter Williams points out , those aggregate trade data can disguise the fact that it was individual American consumers and businesses making voluntary decisions on buying and selling products every day that result in some country - level trade deficit or surplus when trade data between the U.S. and other countries is aggregated at the end of a month , quarter or year .
Bottom Line : People trade , not countries .
Therefore , any restrictions on trade in the form of protectionism hurt American people , i.e. U.S. consumers , and the workers and shareholders of U.S. businesses .
A tariff on Japanese - made products is not a tariff on the country of Japan , it is really a tax on American consumers and businesses who voluntarily decide to buy products made by Japanese producers .
Summary :
( OrganicJar )
Most people diet to trim there waistlines but others are a members of the US - based Calorie Restriction Society .
They diet strictly to enhance longevity and avoid age - related disease .
Inspired by animal experiments showing that underfeeding enhances vitality and prolongs life by 30 percent or more , they are slashing kilojoule intake in hopes of halt the ageing process .
A worldwide epidemic of obesity - related diseases has put a spotlight over the last decade on the link between food and health .
In rich countries , 90 percent of the population probably eats , on average , about 50 percent too much .
A wealth of scientific evidence has confirmed that maintaining that balance of food intake helps prevent type - 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease and cancer .
Experiments with both animals and humans have also shown that pushing one 's energy intake 10 to 20 per cent below that baseline threshold - without lowering nutrients - may provide additional health advantages .
Consuming less kilojoules does not necessarily mean eating less food .
The diet usually consist of large quantities of fruits and vegetables , along with smaller portions of lean meats and fish .
Despite the proven health benefits , the jury is still out on whether counting kilojoules enhances longevity , which some scientists think has a genetically - imposed ceiling .
But one thing is sure - calorie restriction will help you reach your maximum lifespan potential , which is different for all of us depending on our genetic profile .

As we head into the final month of the presidential campaign , Barack Obama is launching a major attack on John McCain ’s healthcare plan that includes speeches , four new TV ads , four new mailers , and radio ads in battleground states .
Obama calls McCain ’s plan radical and says millions could end up uninsured .
Today in Newport News , VA , Obama accused McCain of pulling a bait and switch , “ You see , Senator McCain would pay for his plan , in part , by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history .
And this tax would come out of your paycheck .
But the new tax credit he ’s proposing ?
That would n’t go to you .
It would go directly to your insurance company — not your bank account .
So when you read the fine print , it ’s clear that John McCain is pulling an old Washington bait and switch .
It ’s a shell game .
He gives you a tax credit with one hand — but raises your taxes with the other . ”
Obama also brought up the point that McCain ’s plan drops encourages younger workers to buy their own plan , and employers will be left with older , sicker employees to cover , “ And here ’s something else Senator McCain wo n’t tell you .
When he taxes people ’s benefits , many younger , healthier workers will decide that it ’s a better deal to opt out of the insurance they get at work — and instead , go out into the individual market , where they can buy a cheaper plan .
Many employers will be left with an older , sicker pool of workers who they ca n’t afford to cover .
As a result , many employers will drop their health care plans altogether .
And study after study has shown , that under the McCain plan , at least 20 million Americans will lose the insurance they rely on from their workplace .
Advertisements
Here is the first Obama TV ad about McCain ’s plan :
The McCain campaign accused Obama of lying , but only said that McCain would reform the tax code , and did n’t mention healthcare .
The McCain plan is actually the same Republican healthcare plan that has been floating around since the days of Reagan .
What you need to understand is that this plan is n’t based on providing better health insurance .
It is rooted in the ideologies of privatization , the free market , and big business .
Obama has not lied about anything , but I do wish that his campaign would mention the part of McCain ’s plan that would eliminate the employer tax credit for providing healthcare .
The McCain philosophy of privatization wo n’t work unless the current employer based system is taken apart .
The McCain plan would allow the insurance companies to not insurance the sick , and it would do nothing to help the currently uninsured , because a person would only qualify for the tax credit , AFTER they buy a policy .
What if the insurance companies wo n’t insure a person , or what if they are deemed a risk , and their premiums cost more than the tax credit ?
I am not for government run healthcare , and I think we need to find a way to get the currently uninsured into the system .
Our nation provides great healthcare , and the point of any new plan should be access to that care , not changing the entire system .
McCain ’s plan would deny more people access to the system .
This is n’t change .
It ’s an expansion of ideological politics .
Healthcare is an important issue , and Obama has an obligation to point out the consequences of the McCain plan .
So he tells MTV , which keeps the underwear - themed questions alive :
Sway : I know people have piercings , tattoos .
Eric , in particular , is talking about a ban on sagging pants .
Do feel like people should be penalized ?
Obama :
Here is my attitude : I think people passing a law against people wearing sagging pants is a waste of time .
We should be focused on creating jobs , improving our schools , health care , dealing with the war in Iraq , and anybody , any public official , that is worrying about sagging pants probably needs to spend some time focusing on real problems out there .
Having said that , brothers should pull up their pants .
You are walking by your mother , your grandmother , your underwear is showing .
What 's wrong with that ?
Come on .
There are some issues that we face , that you do n't have to pass a law , but that does n't mean folks can't have some sense and some respect for other people and , you know , some people might not want to see your underwear — I 'm one of them .
History is full of great men and women who laid down their lives for a cause they believed in .
What the history books do n't tell you about , however , is the small handful of bull - headed people who 've given their lives for causes that really did n't matter to anyone but them .
Here are six people who proved a very important point :
It 's really easy to die doing something stupid .

6 Franz Reichelt Continue Reading Below Advertisement What He Tried to Prove :
That he was both an awesome inventor and that the law of gravity simply did not apply to him .
The Method :
Franz Reichelt , a tailor by trade , dreamed of inventing a fashion accessory that would allow a person to float safely to the ground after falling from a great height ( perhaps after jumping out of one of those new - fangled flying machines they were experimenting with at the time ) .
What He Actually Proved :
Newton 's law of universal gravitation .
More specifically , he proved that falling from a great height will result in death even if you happen to be wearing one of these convenient , comfy garments : Continue Reading Below Advertisement
" Ladies , gentlemen ... behold !
My entire wardrobe , sewn together ! "
Reichelt 's " coat parachute , " pictured above , was supposed to function in the same way as a modern parachute .
The ultimate test of his invention was when , in 1912 , he jumped off the Eiffel Tower in front of an assembled group of worried onlookers .
You can pretty much imagine how that went .
Fortunately for the internet , but unfortunately for Reichelt , his tragic failure and subsequent impact with France was captured on what has to be one of the first ever examples of a viral video .
It 's difficult to imagine how Reichelt could have thought his invention would be successful .
Sure , Batman pulls off this stunt repeatedly and with alarming ease in The Dark Knight .
However , Bruce Wayne had the advantage of space age smart cloth , he was n't just sewing a bunch of trench coats together .
And he's also the goddamned Batman .

ATLANTA , Nov. 13 ( UPI ) --
More than 400,000 people in the United States die prematurely each year as a result of smoking or secondhand smoke , government health officials said .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Adult and Child Health Smoking - Attributable Mortality , Morbidity and Economic Cost software , said that during 2000 - 04 , an estimated 443,000 people in the United States died prematurely each year as a result of smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke .

This figure is higher than the average annual estimate of approximately 438,000 deaths during 1997 - 2001 and is predominantly a result of population growth , the report said .
During 2001 - 04 , the average annual smoking - attributable healthcare expenditure nationwide was approximately $ 96 billion .
When combined with productivity losses of $ 97 billion , the total economic burden of smoking is approximately $ 193 billion per year , the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality weekly report said .
Before I start , I just want to give a shout out to dsmith and Joe Armstrong ( at his book ’s discussion forum ) for all of the help in getting this module to work correctly .
The Erlang community is very helpful and kind to beginners !
So at this point I have both a proper table generation function as well as a function to calculate the CRC16 CCITT checksum for a list of integers .
To generate a table , you can call the maketable / 0 function and it will return a list with the entire LUT .
To calculate the checksum on a list of integers , call ccitt / 1 and pass the list as the parameter .
At this time the module has a static look - up table ( LUT ) that is used by the ccitt function for simplicity in using the module .
The LUT generation was really just an exercise for me to learn Erlang .
Here is the latest version of the code :

I pleased with the results thus far ; the output matches that of my C++ code .
I also feel much more confident with Erlang now and I think I ’m ready to get to work with concurrency .
To summarize what I have learned from wrirting this module :
a better understanding of recursive function design
looping in Erlang , especially looping with accumulation
how to control overflow in binary arithmetic
a better understanding of functions and funs
I suspect this module will still evolve along the way .
For further investigation :
error and exception handling for invalid input
switching from a list look - up to an array look - up to improve performace [ dsmith pointed out to me that Erlang list look - ups are O ( n ) ]
controlling the display of output on the screen — I ’d like to be able to display hex , if possible 🙂
Formed in 2001 , Suspyre ’s brand of melodic metal can be attributed to the band members ' wide range of influences .
These talented , young musicians from New Jersey have discovered an energetic and gifted way of combining progressive rock and symphonic metal with classical and jazz fusion .
October 24 , 2005 marked the release of the band 's first full - length album , The Silvery Image .
Response to the album was so good that the band was signed to Nightmare Records and followed up with the release of their next album , A Great Divide , in March 2007 .

Former premier Morris Iemma 's gift to Sydney , the high profile World Youth Day that was held in July , ran $ 100 million over budget .
As a result , the NSW Auditor - General is calling on the Government to undertake a full review of the event , so it can more accurately plan for future large - scale events held in the state .
" The estimated final cost for World Youth Day is six times the original budget estimate , " NSW Auditor - General Peter Acherstraat said in a report released today .
Researchers in New York are reporting development of the world 's thinnest balloon , made of a single layer of graphite just one atom thick .
This so - called graphene sealed microchamber is impermeable to even the tiniest airborne molecules , including helium .
It has a range of applications in sensors , filters , and imaging of materials at the atomic level , they say .
Paul L. McEuen and colleagues note that membranes are fundamental components of a wide variety of physical , chemical and biological systems , found in everything from cellular compartments to mechanical pressure sensing .
Graphene , a single layer of graphite , is the upper limit : A chemically stable and electrically conducting membrane just one atom thick .
The researchers wanted to answer whether such an atomic membrane would be impermeable to gas molecules and easily incorporated into other devices .
Their data showed that graphene membranes were impermeable to even the smallest gas molecules .
These results show that single atomic sheets can be integrated with microfabricated structures to create a new class of atomic scale membrane - based devices .
We envision many applications for these graphene sealed microchambers , says McEuen .
These range from hyper - sensitive pressure , light and chemical sensors to filters able to produce ultrapure solutions .

The post was updated at 4:30 p.m. , with S.E.C. statement and closing stock price .
It was updated at 7 p.m. to correct the percent of the Mamma.com stock Mr. Cuban owned .
Did Mark Cuban , the Internet entrepreneur turned owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team , and would - be buyer of the Chicago Cubs , violate insider trading laws in a particularly egregious fashion ?
Or is he the victim of a political hit job because he helped finance a movie that was scathingly critical of President Bush ?
Either way , the insider trading complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission today arouses a lot more interest than most enforcement actions .
I ’ll get to the facts of the complaint in a minute , but first here is Mr. Cuban ’s reaction .
His lawyers issued a statement saying :
This matter , which has been pending before the commission for nearly two years , has no merit and is a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion .
Mr. Cuban intends to contest the allegations and to demonstrate that the commission ’s claims are infected by the misconduct of the staff of its enforcement division .
Mr. Cuban stated , “ I am disappointed that the commission chose to bring this case based upon its enforcement staff ’s win- at - any - cost ambitions .
The staff ’s process was result - oriented , facts be damned .
The government ’s claims are false and they will be proven to be so . ”
A person close to Mr. Cuban provided me with a copy of an e-mail message said to have been sent by Jeffrey Norris , an S.E.C. lawyer in the Fort Worth regional office ( and no known relation to me . )
This e-mail message seems to have been sent after an exchange in which Mr. Norris complained that Mr. Cuban had financed a movie called “ Loose Change ” that discusses the president ’s actions relating to Sept. 11 .

Mark :
If this upsets you , I wonder how George Bush feels .
I assume that Mr. Cox would view your involvement with “ Loose Change ” much as I do .
After all , he served his country as a Republican Congressman from Orange County for nearly 20 years and was appointed by President Bush .
If you feel like sharing my thoughts with Chairman Cox , be my guest .
Previously , I thought you were merely foolish and naïve .
Now , however , I see that you are also a hypocrite .
I guess your belief in free speech has severe limitations .
If someone else is the victim of an absurd conspiracy theory , you defend your right to participate in smearing the good name of a patriot like President Bush .
But , when you are the subject of a parody of the attack you have endorsed , you suddenly issue threats .
I think I will e-mail this to Chairman Cox myself .
I think he will enjoy it .
I ’m sure he is also a Laker fan .
Since Chairman
Cox may not know the background , I will explain .
Mark Cuban is the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and has participated in distributing the vicious and absurd documentary , “ Loose Change , ” which posits that President Bush planned the demolition of the World Trade Center as a pretext for going to war against Iraq .
We have had some past exchanges about my opinion the Mr. Cuban ’s support for this project is irresponsible and immoral .
Below , I parodied his position that every opinion , no matter how absurd and vicious , deserves to be broadly disseminated .
The copy sent to me does not include the previous parody .
John Nester , an S.E.C. spokesman , said this afternoon that the investigation was conducted by the S.E.C. ’s Washington office , and that Mr. Norris was not involved in it .
He added :
“ Chairman Cox has never met the individual who corresponded with Mr. Cuban , nor has he spoken or corresponded with him in any way .
After those communications came to light , the matter was referred for disciplinary action against the individual .
To avoid any potential appearance issues , Chairman Cox recused himself from the Commission vote , and he has not been involved in this investigation at any time . ”
The vote he refers to was the commission ’s vote to file the case .
Mr. Norris has not returned a call left for him at his office .
Now for the facts of the insider trading case .
Mr. Cuban made a substantial profit from a quick trade in an Internet company that , oh - so - briefly , was a hot stock in 2004 .
It is not clear from public records just how much money he made , but even if the S.E.C. succeeds in its efforts to take about $ 750,000 in profits from him , he will still be one of the few public shareholders to rank as having made a lot of money from the company .
Mamma.com was , and is , an Internet search engine .
In late February 2004 , it was trading for around $ 4 a share .
Then it announced earnings and announced new advertising features and the stock took off , aided by some stock tip sheets .
( That trading brought on an S.E.C. investigation , which ended without charges being filed . )
The trading was crazy .
A company with 10.5 million shares outstanding was trading more than 60 million shares a day while the stock ran up .
There was heavy short - selling .
Mr. Cuban disclosed that he had acquired 600,000 shares , a 6.3 percent stake , by March 15 , 2004 .
He did not disclose a purchase price or say when he had acquired the shares .
According to the S.E.C. , on June 28 , 2004 , the company ’s chief executive asked Mr. Cuban if he would like to participate in a planned new offering of the company ’s stock .
After being warned that he was receiving confidential information , Mr. Cuban is said to have expressed dismay about the offering .
“ At the end of the call , Cuban told the C.E.O .
‘ Well , now I ’m screwed .
I ca n’t sell . ’ ”
But a few minutes later he did sell 10,000 shares in after - hours trading .
He sold the rest the next day .
He took in $ 7.9 million , realizing an average of $ 13.24 per share .
After the close on June 29 , the offering was announced , and the stock opened the next day at $ 11.89 .
The S.E.C. figures that is a measure of his illicit gain .
Mamma.com is still around .
In fact , I did all the searches connected to this blog using that search engine , and it performed quite adequately .
But it has not prospered .
The corporate name has changed to Copernic and the current stock price is 28 cents .
At that price , Mr. Cuban ’s former holding would be worth $ 168,000 .
Mr. Cuban disclosed that sale , as required for a major holder .
It is not clear what caused the S.E.C. to begin its investigation in early 2007 , two and a half years after the sale .
But if Mr. Cuban had waited to sell , he still would have gotten a very good price for the stock — at least from the perspective of 2008 — and the S.E.C. would have had no case .
As it is , there appears to be no question about when Mr. Cuban sold the stock .
The S.E.C. cites phone company records and company memos about the timing and content of the call .
If those memos were accurate , it appears that Mr. Cuban knew he had a duty not to sell until the information about the offering was made public .
But even if all that is true , the Norris e-mail , sent from an S.E.C. e-mail address , indicates the commission has a lawyer with , at best , very poor judgment .
While most traits of Objective - C follow consistent styles , method invocation formatting — arguably a defining characteristic of the language — does not .
In this post , I 'll look at a handful of approaches that different programmers use to format their method invocations and discuss their advantages and disadvantages .
The problems with method invocations ...
How should you format a method invocation when it is too long to fit on the line ?
Judging from the multitude of conventions that different programmers use , there is no clear answer .
There is no ambiguity about how to write a short , simple method invocation :
[ myColor set ] ;
But if a method is longer than the nominated screen width :
NSColor * myColor = [ NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed : 120.0 / 255.0 green : 120.0 / 255.0 blue : 120.0 / 255.0 alpha : 1.0 ] ;
opinions begin to vary .
In addition to this consideration is how much should you inline ?
Cocoa strongly suggests that an allocation and initialization statement should always be a single line :
id myObject = [ [ MyClass alloc ] init ] ;
but how far should you continue to inline before decomposing the statement into separate statements ?
i.e.
// Completely inline ... NSColor * deviceColor = [ [ [ NSColorPicker sharedColorPicker ] color ] colorUsingColorSpaceName : NSDeviceRGBColorSpace ] ; // Decomposed ... NSColor * cur = [ [ NSColorPicker sharedColorPicker ] color ] ; NSColor * devColor = [ cur colorUsingColorSpaceName : NSDeviceRGBColorSpace ] ;
Here are a few different approaches ...
Style 1 : Soft wrap and never decompose
The simplest approach to formatting Objective - C method invocations is the " do nothing " approach .
This involves :
Make your text editor wrap lines with an indent if they are wider than the page
Never decompose statements if the sub-methods are only used once .
Using this approach , the deviceColor creation might look like this :
NSColor * deviceColor = [ [ [
NSColorPicker sharedColorPicker ] color ] colorUsingColorSpaceName : NSDeviceRGBColorSpace ] ;
This is the approach advocated by Penny Arcade recurring character Wil Shipley in his Pimp My Code series .
It is also the approach that Apple have started using in some ( but not all ) of Xcode 's project templates .
Advantages
You , as the typer of code , never have to do anything .
No fussing , no reformatting .
You also never have to declare a variable that you only need once ; just inline everything .
For Apple , providing code in a template , this approach also has the advantage that if users prefer wrapped code , it is faster for Xcode users to reformat this unwrapped style into a wrapped style of their choice than it is to reformat already wrapped code into a different style .
Disadvantages
This approach can reduce clarity .
From Pimp My Code Part 5 : Special Apple Sample Code Edition ...:
return [ [ NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains ( NSApplicationSupportDirectory , NSUserDomainMask , YES ) objectAtIndex : 0 ] stringByAppendingPathComponent :[ [ NSProcessInfo processInfo ] processName ] ] ;
A statement like this is not for everyone .
Personally , when I 'm starting to lose focus on the code after a few hours at the keyboard , I can't read this well .
The visual hierarchy of the statement does n't follow the structure it contains .
A missing or redundant element could be hiding anywhere .
There is also a lack of interoperability with this approach .
To anyone reading your code in a non-wrapping editor , the code is significantly less legible .
For this reason code is sometimes formatted in the same way but hard - wrapped at 80 characters .
Style 2 : Left align all parameters at the same level
For the myColor creation statement that I showed earlier , left aligning all parameters would result in the following :
NSColor * myColor = [ NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed : 120.0 / 255.0 green : 120.0 / 255.0 blue : 120.0 / 255.0 alpha : 1.0 ] ;
Advantages
Visual structure follows statement structure resulting in high readability .
Highly effective for methods with long parameter lists .
This approach is also sympathetic to common C and C++ code formatting styles .
Minor variations on this style are excellent for formatting structured inline data .
i.e .
NSDictionary * myDictionary = [ NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys : [ NSArray arrayWithObjects : [ NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys : @ " value1 " , @ " key1 " , @ " value2 " , @ " key2 " , @ " value3 " , @ " key3 " , nil ] , nil ] , @ " keyForArray " , @ " topLevelValue1 " , @ " topLevelKey1 " , @ " topLevelValue2 " , @ " topLevelKey2 " , nil ] ;
Disadvantages
Relative to soft - wrap in your text editor , this approach has a high code formatting and maintenance cost .
There 's a lot of tabs , returns and whitespace to type , delete and move .
Dogmatically applying this style to complexly structured statements can result in poor results .
For example , the Pimp My Code sample rigourously formatted in this way :
return [ [ NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains ( NSApplicationSupportDirectory , NSUserDomainMask , YES ) objectAtIndex : 0 ] stringByAppendingPathComponent : [ [ NSProcessInfo processInfo ] processName ] ] ;
Style 3 : Some left align , some decompose
A more balanced variation on the previous formatting , this approach makes the following changes :
Decompose the self access / creation if it can't be performed on one line
Only begin wrapping a sub- statement if it can't fit on its line
Put the self component of the invocation on the same line as the assignment or return operator ( optional )
The sample taken from Pimp My Code would now become :
NSArray * searchPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains ( NSApplicationSupportDirectory , NSUserDomainMask , YES ) ; return [ [ searchPath objectAtIndex : 0 ] stringByAppendingPathComponent : [ [ NSProcessInfo processInfo ] processName ] ] ;
Advantages
Handles compound statements better than dogmatic alignment of every single parameter yet retains much of the structural clarity .
Decomposing self access , rather than wrapping it , makes the " subject " of the statement more clear .
Disadvantages
Requires a few judgement calls to be made about when to decompose and when to begin wrapping a statement .
Can have the highest code - formatting maintenance requirements of the styles listed so far , since choosing to decompose or reintegrate elements is time - consuming .
Style 4 : Column alignment
This relates to various method invocation formatting styles which attempt to align columns of wrapped data within their lines , including alignment on the colon character :
[ object methodWithParam : the Param another : the OtherValue something : the SomethingValue else : the ElseValue ] ;
From my perspective , I do n't see people write this type of invocation much anymore , so it seems to me like an " old way of doing things " .
However the support is in Xcode to help you with this ( Preferences - > Indentation -> Syntax Aware Indenting - > " : " ) .
I 've also seen the following style used :
[ someObject instanceMethod : parameter ] ; [ differentObject otherMethod : anotherParameter ] ;
which is an attempt to tab - align every single component on the line .
Advantages
If you are strongly particular about alignment , then maybe this is for you .
Disadvantages
It is doubtful that the end - result in these cases justifies the effort to generate and maintain them .
There is text editor support for some of these alignments but it still requires maintenance .
These approaches are also incompatible with any sub-statements that need to be wrapped and so require near - complete decomposition .
Conclusion
If you look at my code , I clearly use something approximating " Style 3 " , with ad hoc variations depending on how I 'm feeling .
After years of working in offices with strict coding standards , it seems odd that I do n't maintain greater attention to detail but there it is .
There are certainly times when I 've considered changing my style to soft - wrapped .
Reformatting code because you 're changing a line or you decide it 's unwieldy is annoying ( although I doubt that it actually consumes as much time as it seems ) .
Soft - wrapped code also appears to be the direction that Apple are heading and they tend to drag a lot of Mac programmers along in their wake .
At this time , I do n't find wrapped code to be a pleasing enough aesthetic , so I continue to endure the burden of formatting .
Windows has a nice feature in Networking – you just configure the IPs correctly , and the network sharing “ magically ” works .
In Linux we will have to manually configure Samba or some other similar tool to share files between two linux systems – and that ’s a bit daunting for a new user .
But there is an easier way – using SSH .
SSH or Secure Shell is a program for logging into a remote machine and executing commands on a that machine .
Do n’t worry – you wo n’t have to type commands to transfer files – there are GUI clients that supports SSH protocol – for example , the great Konqueror .
SSH is installed and turned on in most distros – so chances are you are running an SSH server at the moment .
But if its not installed by default , you can install it using these commands …
In Fedora / Red Hat
yum install openssh
In Ubuntu / Debian
apt - get install openssh
After installing it , you have to activate it in the Services configuration utility .
Once that is done , SSH will turned on at boot .
Make sure the remote machine have SSH installed and running before trying to connect to it .
An Example Implementation
I use SSH to transfer files between my system and my brothers system .
This will give you an overview of the network …
Both the systems have SSH enabled .
Now if I want to get some files from my brother ’s system , all I have to do is open Konqueror and enter this address in the Address bar : fish://username@192.168.1.20
That is fish ://[ Remote User ] @ [ Remote Machine ’s IP / Name ] .
This will show a password prompt – where you have to input the password of the remote user .
Once that is done , you will see all the files in the remote machine that is accessable by the user you logged in as .
All operation you are used to in Konqueror are still supported – Copy / Paste , Drag and Drop etc – they will work between the local system and the remote machine .
If you are a Gnome user , this is possible in Nautilus as well .
Instead of fish://username@192.168.1.20 , you have to enter ssh://username@192.168.1.20 in the address bar – protocol is ssh:// instead of fish ://.
Limitations
Keep in mind that this is practical only for small home networks .
If you are implementing a large network with permission settings , shares and stuff , go with Samba .
SSH is not a choice there .

The words Net neutrality do not appear in the campaign platforms of the federal Liberal and Conservative parties .
The federal NDP and Greens , on the other hand , include Net neutrality in their platforms .
The NDP say it ’s vital to protecting Canadians ’ ability to access the Internet at a flat rate of payment and with transparent rules .
Richard Rosenberg , a UBC professor emeritus of computer science , told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview that there are different views on whether or not Internet service providers should be allowed to limit the number of bits that are moved over a network .
Proponents of Net neutrality argue that consumers should determine which content , services , and applications they want to use .
They say that telecommunications giants should n’t have the right to control which files are sent .
But this is precisely what Bell Canada is doing , spurring a complaint to the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission in April by the Canadian Association of Internet Providers .
“ All of this means that certain kinds of downloading will be different than other kinds , ” said Rosenberg , who is also president of the B.C. Freedom of Information and Privacy Association .
“ So the Net will not be neutral with respect to the bits that are moving on it . ”
The issue has n’t gotten much attention from the mainstream media during the election campaign , but it ’s a vitally important topic , according to Steve Anderson , the Vancouver - based national coordinator of the Campaign for Democratic Media .
In a phone interview with the Straight , Anderson said that Bell angered some of its customers and third - party ISPs by “ throttling ” BitTorrent , a technology that efficiently distributes video and other content over the Internet .
He said that if the Net were neutral , telecommunications companies would n’t be allowed to do this .
“ We ’ve been calling on the CRTC to look at all of the ISPs and have a public hearing on this issue of Net neutrality , ” Anderson said .
He noted that Bell distributes its own video content in competition with the independents who use BitTorrent .
The Campaign for Democratic Media , which is a nonprofit media - reform network , filed an intervention with the CRTC in July , arguing that Bell ’s throttling of Internet traffic violated the Telecommunications Act .
In a submission to the CRTC , Bell defended the practice as a measure necessary to ensure “ a better allocation of bandwidth for all users that share a common network ” ¦and better experience on the network for all users during peak Internet usage periods ” .
The company claimed that it was necessary to “ shape ” traffic in order to address the small minority of users who shared large files and slowed down access for everyone else .
Bell Canada spokespeople did n’t return calls from the Straight on the subject of Net neutrality .
Part of the problem , from Anderson ’s perspective , is that the CRTC does n’t regulate the Internet .
He claimed that the CRTC ’s lack of jurisdiction could have profound consequences in three areas : competitiveness , innovation , and on - line choice .
Anderson raised the possibility of gatekeepers charging organizations fees to put up Web sites .
He said that educational institutions , in particular , could be hit hard because they might one day face extra levies to gain access to students .
He also cited the potential for Internet companies to make investments in vain because their products and services could end up being restricted .
“ It has implications on pretty much every realm of our society , ” Anderson said .
He added that the CRTC is expected to rule on the Canadian Association of Internet Providers ’ complaint before the end of October .
In June , the B.C. Civil Liberties Association filed a submission to the CRTC expressing concern “ that technical and business decisions made by Bell Canada will negatively impact Canadians ’ ability to use the internet as a tool for expression ” .
The BCCLA brief also stated that it ’s “ clearly unacceptable ” for Bell Canada to “ throttle ” its Gateway Access Service , which other ISPs use to connect their customers to the Internet , to drive revenue for its other business interests .
Speaking in the House of Commons in April , NDP MP Charlie Angus alleged that consumers and entrepreneurs are at the mercy of telecommunications giants , which can choke off traffic from smaller competitors .
“ What steps will the Minister of Industry take to ensure that consumers who paid for access are not going to be ripped off , that badly needed competition will not be squeezed off , and send a message to the telecom giants that they have no business monkey - wrenching with the free flow of information ? ”
Angus demanded .
Industry Minister Jim Prentice pointed out in his reply that the Internet does not fall within the government ’s jurisdiction .
“ We continue to monitor the discussion that is taking place , ” he said , “ but there is no regulation of the relationship between Internet providers and consumers . ”
Angus replied that the minister ’s “ hands - off approach ” would be detrimental to innovation in Canada .
“ Net neutrality is the cornerstone of an innovative economy , ” he said , “ because it is the consumer and the innovator who need to be in the driver ’s seat , not Ma Bell , not Rogers , not Vidéotron .
They have no business deciding what information is in the fast lane or what information is in the slow lane . ”
Anderson said that the Campaign for Democratic Media will release a report on the positions of each of the federal political parties before the October 14 election .
We are almost there .
The mood here in the USA is tense .
I am excited for this election , but with only a few days left , I am even more excited for it to be over .
We Obama supporters are exhilarated yet exhausted , confident but cautious .
Mostly we cannot stand the suspense .
This campaign has been going on for nearly two years , and " change " has already come to America .
In that time , I have changed jobs , moved homes and upgraded my marital status .
For the country , all the complicated debt financing our consumer shopping spree seems to have come due at once , and Britney Spears , well , no one even cares what she 's up to anymore .
Since January , I have been consumed : cable news , YouTube , blogs , door - to - door voter contact , conventions , debates , conference calls , rallies , interviews , meetings , music videos and more .
Like our dependence on fossil fuels , this pace is unsustainable .
I have lost Facebook friends over this election .
Facebook friends !

At least I get to play a direct role in the process through donations and actual voting .
I can only imagine what people overseas must feel like having no say whatsoever in a process that could mean the difference between receiving shipments of humanitarian aid and shipments of bombs .
We are almost there .
The polling is clear .
Obama has a steady national lead .
More importantly , he is leading in the handful of states whose electoral votes actually matter including four states that voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 .
John McCain had hoped to make California competitive .
Instead he finds himself ahead by only two points in his home state of Arizona , forced to commit resources and to start running deceptive automated phone calls in a desperate attempt to prevent an embarrassing loss .
Assuming he wins , what can we expect from Barack Obama .
Can he unite the country as he 's promised ?
He will have his work cut out .
The divisions in America run deep racially and politically , but there can and will be progress , if not total resolution .
A friend and fellow comedian who produces a video series called " This Week In Blackness " spoke with me about the oft - repeated concept of a " post- racial " America .
The notion is that we will have won the War On Racism by electing Obama and once and for all healed America 's racial divide .
Claims of employment discrimination , systematic imprisonment and economic segregation could be met with , " But you have a black president . "
The country could finally move on to more pressing matters , like selecting the next flavour of Coca Cola .
This simple resolution will not happen .
In fact , Obama 's mere candidacy ( and the reaction of his opponents to it ) have exacerbated that racial divide in small but poignant ways .
Obama has tapped into hope , but he has also triggered a backlash of fear from the more ignorant realms of our society .
News organisations have scrambled to display their understanding of blackness but often showcase massive ignorance instead .
Fox News refers to Michelle as Obama 's " baby mama . " .
CNN tries to summarise all of Black America in a two - part series almost exclusively highlighting pain , struggle and failures .
Most outlets fail to understand that Obama is not here to represent " blackness " to begin with but rather " Americanness . "
Many of us have seen the ugliness flow forth from Republican rallies .
Looking like images ripped from history books , crowds that seem more like mobs scream " terrorist " or " traitor " or " kill him " .
All that 's missing are the police , fire hoses , attack dogs and bell bottoms .
Post - rally interviews turn up more foolishness : Obama is a " monkey " ; Obama is a " Muslim " ; Obama will " let the blacks take over " .
Of course , we have heard of the plots by extremist white supremacist groups to assassinate Obama .
Yet the ignorance of the media , the vocal minority at some rallies and the plots of extremists do not define the entire country .
We will know from the exit polling data in a few days , but it appears that Americans think they are more racist than they actually are .
Despite much hype , the so - called Bradley Effect , in which white voters lie to pollsters about their willingness to vote for black candidates , has not emerged , while something more interesting has .
When asked if they would vote for a black presidential candidate , approximately 95 per cent of white Americans said yes .
When asked if they thought their neighbours would , only 75 per cent said yes .
It 's the equivalent of the nation collectively saying , " Oh , I 'm not racist , but they are . "
We lack faith in one another , and restoration of that faith is something that Barack Obama is ideally positioned to do .
His temperament and his biography speak loudly to black children and rural white factory workers alike in a common language that few others can .
There is hope that , although he cannot successfully resolve the race question with his mere election , Barack Obama may be just the president to move the conversation further in the right direction .
Should he be elected , another difficult and unenviable job for Obama will be to unite the increasingly polarised left and right political wings .
This election has seen a hardening of lines .
Both sides are massively afraid of victory by the other .
Sarah Palin has terrified the Left. Conservatives quake at the notion of a federal government controlled by Democrats .
How do you come together with people who think you 're a secret communist or people you fear will sabotage the courts with religious extremists ?
More than any other candidate in many decades , Obama would be the president most likely to lead both factions .
He has garnered support from the most left - leaning environmentalists to the most conservative elected officials .
He speaks in a language of rights and responsibilities .
When faced with challenges , he appeals to our shared hopes rather than our divided fears .
In addition to being exceptionally well - produced – I think he should campaign for an Oscar – his 30 - minute television special on Wednesday night gave us a preview of the type of mature dialogue he would be willing have with the nation .
By example , he refuted the most extreme of his critics , displaying a family man in touch with the concerns and aspirations of average citizens .
So we have come a long way both historically and in this election .
We are so close .
The question is n't so much whether Barack Obama can close the deal .
It is , can America ?
I believe we can .
Next Tuesday , we 'll find out .

Overview
The jQuery Linkselect plug - in converts < select /> elements into a combination of an anchor tag associated with a dropdown menu .
This combination allows you to highly customize the look and feel of the select element , without losing any functionality .
While there are many similar plug-ins , the key differentiator with the Linkselect plug - in is that is designed to fit in limited real estate .
One key design issue with the < select /> is that it 's hard to control how much screen real estate is taken up by the element .
If your < select /> contains options of varying sizes , the width of the < select /> element can quickly get out of hand .
In a recent project we were working on , we required the functionality of a < select /> element , but had to work within a very confined design area .
Because we had no control over how much data or the length of the items that appeared in the < select /> element , we knew could n't use the element as - is .
What we need was a < select /> element that would allow us to wrap long options to another line .
This is what lead to the development of the Linkselect plug -in .
The Linkselect Plug - in resolves this space by replacing the < select /> element with an anchor tag that provides all the same functionality of a single item select box .
Requirements
In order to use the Linkselect plug - in , you need the following :
j Query v1.4.3 ( or higher ) *
jquery.linkselect.js
Plug-in
jquery.bgiframe.js
Plug - in ( Optional ; for fixing overlay issues in IE6 )
Usage
To convert your < select /> elements into linkselect elements , just invoke the jQuery plug - in using the following syntax :
$ ( " select " ) .linkselect ( [ options ] ) ;
The width of the drop down based on the width of the anchor tag .
If anchor tag happens to be an inline element ( i.e. display : inline ; , ) then the width will be based on the anchor 's parent element .
If the fixed Width is set to false , then the drop down will be further adjusted to make sure that the width of the drop down is wide enough .
You can set a maximum width by setting the max - width property of the .linkselect - container class .
Arguments
options
This argument is optional and allows you to customize the settings used for each instance of the plug - in .
For a list of all available options , see the Options section .
Elements
The Linkselect converts the standard < select /> element to a specialized UI element .
There are a few key attributes from both the < select /> and < option /> elements which are used by the Linkselect plug - in and special funcationality .
Below is a list of the attributes that provided special functionality to the Linkselect plug -in .
< select />
id
This attribute is required and is used as the id attribute of the hidden input element that is created by the plug - in .
If no name attribute exists , then the id is used as the name attribute of the hidden element that is created .
name
This attribute is optional and is used as the name attributes of the hidden input element that is created by the plug - in.
title
This attribute is optional and is used to provide a title bar to the Linkselect 's dropdown menu .
tabindex
This attribute is optional and is used to set the tabindex of the anchor tag .
This just duplicates the original < select /> element 's tabindex .
onchange
This attribute is optional and will be fired just like the original onchange event would .
However , when this function is triggered , it will have access to the same arguments that the normal change callback would .
NOTE : The Linkselect Plug - in was designed only for single select style elements .
It will not allow you to select more than one option .
< option />
NOTE : The text of the < option /> is used as the text shown in the dropdown for the item .
value
This attribute is option and is used as the value for the selected item .
selected
This attribute is optional and is used to define which option is selected by default .
class
This attribute is optional and is used to define any classes that should be applied to the option in the dropdown .
You can also supply an optional " placeholder " class ( see options ) to an option element to have the option tag used as a selectable title for the linkselect object .
Now that we have a reference to the widget , we can invoke any of the public API calls .
Public API
$ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " val " )
Returns the current value for the linkselect element .
$ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " val " , value )
Sets the value of the linkselect element .
$ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " text " )
Returns the text label for the selected linkselect option .
$ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " focus " )
Places focus on the Linkselect 's anchor tag .
This is like doing a $ ( " a " ) .focus ( ) ; $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " blur " )
Blur 's the focus from the Linkselect 's anchor tag .
This is like doing a $ ( " a " ) .blur ( ) ; $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " change " )
Triggers the " change " event for the Linkselect element .
You can use this to trigger off the change events for the default selected item . $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " open " )
Opens the Linkselect 's dropdown menu . $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " close " )
Closes the Linkselect 's dropdown menu . $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " disable " , boolean ) Disables ( true ) or enables ( false ) the Linkselect element .
Disabled elements still pass their form value when the form is submitted to the server , but the user can not change the value via the UI . $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " destroy " )
This destroys the linkselect element and places the original select element back in the DOM .
The select element will reflect any changes made to the option elements done by the replaceOptions API call .
$ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " replaceOptions " , options , includeFilter , doCallback )
Replaces the options in the dropdown with the array of objects passed into the options argument .
You can use this API method to repopulate a Linkselect with options via an AJAX call .
You can use the includeFilter argument to specify a jQuery selector of elements to not replace .
This is useful if you want to preserve your placeholder items , or other items in the select element that you do not want replaced .
When the options are replaced , the change callback is triggered for the newly selected item .
You can set the doCallback to false to prevent callback from being triggered .
For example : var options = [ {value : 1 , text : " Option 1 " } , {value : 2 , text : " Option 2 " } , {value : 3 , text : " Option 3 " , selected : true} , {value : 4 , text : " Option 4 " , className : " emphasis " } , {value : 5 , text : " Option 5 " , className : " de- emphasis " } ] ; $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " replaceOptions " , options ) ;
Each item in the " options " array is a JavaScript object that must contain at least the keys " value " and " text " .
Also supported are the keys " selected " ( which can be true for any single item that needs selecting ) and the " className " key , which can be used to define a class for the < option /> element . $ ( " #id " ) .linkselect ( " object " )
Returns a reference to the internal $ . Linkselect object .
This is for advanced usage only .
Examine the source code for uses of the $ .
Linkselect object .
Options
There are a number of options available for customizing the look and feel of the Linkselect widget .
{ style : " linkselect " // the default style to use , classLink : " " // additional classes to use for the anchor tag , yAxis : " top " // the position of the dropdown relative to the link // ( can be either " top " or " bottom " ) , titleAlign : " right " // location of dropdown 's title bar if dropdown is on // right edge of the screen ( can be either " right " or // " left " ) , fixed Width : false // false = dropdown sizes to width of options , // true = dropdown uses width of link , init : null // callback that occurs when a linkselect menu is // initialized , change : null // callback that occurs when an option is selected , format : null // callback that occurs when rendering the HTML to use // for an item in the dropdown , open : null // callback that occurs when the menu is opened , close : null // callback that occurs when the menu is closed }
Events
A linkselect object will announce the following events .
You can use jQuery 's bind ( ) function to bind events to these listeners so that you can attach custom code anytime one of the events is triggered .
update [ event , value , text , li ]
Is fired any time the linkselect value is changed .
Events are triggered for both the original select element and the input element that replaces the select element .
The event returns 4 arguments : event - the jQuery event object
value - the new value of the linkselect object
text - the text description for the value
li - a jQuery object contain the < li > element representing the original < option > element .
Keyboard Usage
The linkselect 's keyboard functionality is set to mimic the behavior of Internet Explorer 6's handling of the < select /> element .
When a Linkselect element has focus you can :
Press the first letter of an option to jump to the first instance of that item in the dropdown .
Subsequent presses of the same key will cycle through all items that start with the matching character .
When a new key is pressed , it will attempt to jump to the first item that starts with the new keyboard character typed .
Press [ UP ARROW ] or [ DOWN ARROW ] to cycle through valid options
Press [ HOME ] to jump to the first item
Press [ END ] to jump to the last item
Press [ PAGE UP ] to jump up one page of options
Press [ PAGE DOWN ] to jump down one page of options
Getting Started
The first thing we need to do is to load the required JavaScript libraries and the CSS stylesheet used by the widget :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " ./lib/jquery-1.2.6.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="./lib/jquery.linkselect.js " ></ script> <!---// load the Linkselect CSS stylesheet //---> < link type =" text/css " href= " ./css/jquery.linkselect.css " rel=" stylesheet " media= " all " />
Before you can invoke an instance of the Linkselect widget , you must have one or more < select /> elements on your page .
The key attributes from your select tag ( id , title , tabindex ) are all supported by the Linkselect plug -in .
< select id =" category " title = " Select a category " class =" linkselect " > < option value= " " >[ none ] </ option > < option value= " help_desk " >
Help Desk </ option > < option value=" customer_service " >
Customer Service </ option > < option value= " knowledge_manager " >
Knowledge Manager </ option > < option value= " change_manager " >
Change Manager </ option > < option value= " service_desk " > Service Desk </ option > < option value= " asset_manager " >
Asset Manager </ option > < option value= " software_manager " > Software Manager </ option > </ select >
The next step is to actually create an instance of the Linkselect widget .
You want to make sure to initialize the widget after all the necessary DOM elements are available , which makes the document .
ready event a great place to initialize the widget .
< script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .
ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #category " ) .linkselect ( ) ; } ) ; </script >
Now let us take a look at what the code above produced .
Example
Original < select /> element
Please select a category : [ none ]
Help Desk Customer Service Knowledge Manager Change Manager Service Desk Asset Manager Software Manager
Same code using the Linkselect Plug - in Please select a category :
Click on the " [ none ] " anchor above to open up the linkselect dropdown .
As you change options , the text of the anchor will get updated with the text from the < option /> tag .
A hidden < input /> element with with the same name / id attribute will have it 's value updated with the value of the < option /> tag .
The hidden < input /> element is used to pass the value of the Linkselect element back to the server .
Linkselect 's element have full keyboard support , which has been modeled after how Internet Explorer 6 handles < select /> elements .
See the Keyboard Usage section for more information .

The " update " event every time the input 's value is changed , so if either the change or select callbacks return false , the event is fired again when the value is reset .
Fixed logic issue where returning to previous value could fail when callbacks return false under some circumstances .
v1.5.11 ( 2013-07-09 )
Linkselect plugin now annouces an " update " event whenever the value changes -- which allows you to set up listeners for when the value has changed .

Changes in the keyboard behavior when a placeholder is used so that PAGE UP , PAGE DOWN , END and HOME stay within the context of the dropdown menu v1.5.00 ( 2011 - 12- 23 )
Revised CSS naming structure to make it to have multiple visual styles of linkselect elements on the same page .
The changes in v1.5 are not backwards compatible , so you will need to update your CSS in order to upgrage to v1.5 .
You can either replace you existing CSS files with one included in the zip file , or you can modify your existing CSS files to match the new naming syntax ( which for the most part is just changing the camel casing from " linkselectLink " to " linkselect - link " , " linkselectLinkOpen " to " linkselect - link - open " , etc .
Also , all CSS classes now using the prefix " linkselect - " by default .
Added new " style " option .

Only the ignorant and the uninformed would assume that DARPA has never , ever dabbled in any kind of surveillance that was n't questionable on some level , but a recent contract awarded to Kitware gives us a better idea of just how deep the rabbit hole has gotten .
The $ 6.7 million deal seeks to create a system whereby DARPA can " monitor live video feeds and search large volumes of archived video data for activities of interest , " with the point being to match up similar events from past and present in order to prevent an attack , foreshadow a certain event or discover some sort of terrorist trademark .
As of now , we 're simply informed of the video spying in areas of Iraq and Afghanistan , but given that the capabilities are already here , it could be enacted wherever the government could place a camera - toting manned or unmanned aerial vehicle .
Look up and give the friendly skies a wave , wo n't you ?
Just do n't do anything " suspicious . "

Technology is taking such rapid strides forward at such a blurring pace that what is considered a marvelous novelty turns into a mundane common object within no time .
To classify and bunch a set of man-made marvels from a world that is being constantly altered is a pretty tough job .
Finding them is easy enough in a world filled with man-made wonders but the relevance of such a compilation will be short - lived compared with a list from the ancient world .
Yet we embark on a journey across the planet and beyond to try and find out the best the world has to offer — our own creations that leave us in awe .
We limit ourselves to finding the biggest , tallest or the highest as otherwise we would probably never end the journey we began .
It is a journey filled with variations and grand delights in a spectacular way .
So , have a fun ride ...
With an ability to change our understanding of the world around us and give us the reasons of our own existence , CERN ’s LHC is for now the most spectacular and important technological marvel modern science has created .
The particle accelerator is just a couple of days away from action , and the large construction 17 miles in circumference will surely make the coming two decades the most exciting for modern physicists .
It ’s truly amazing creation that could answer the questions about the creation and existence of this universe itself !
2. International Space Station ( ISS ) :
It is one thing making wonders of engineering on earth and a whole different ballgame when you need to do it outside the planet in outer space .
The International Space Station ( ISS ) is a research facility that is a joint project among the space agencies of the United States ( NASA ) , Russia ( RKA ) , Japan ( JAXA ) , Canada ( CSA ) and eleven European countries .
When completed in 2010 , it will be the largest and grandest human endeavor away from home , and to build such a massive structure in such dangerous conditions is one magnificent tribute to both human will and skill .
3. Three Gorges Dam :
Taking shape of the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world and that too by a long shot , the Three Gorges Dam in China is not just spectacular to watch but enormous in magnitude .
Generating 22.5 GW of power it will supply energy amounting to 4 % of China ’s national needs .
Creating a reservoir as large as Lake Superior , this dam will be good as a grand marvel of modern engineering by becoming the world ’s largest concrete structure !
4. Petronas Twin Towers :
At 452 meters tall , the Petronas Twin Towers are magnificent and unique .
While their familiarity seems at times to diminish their true aura , you only need to stand in front of the towers for one moment to realize the magnitude of the construction .
For sheer intimidating height and the sophisticated look , they are a marvel of modern times .
5. Space Telescope Chandra :
Also known as the Advanced X - ray Astrophysics Facility , Chandra is an X - ray telescope orbiting the earth and sending back the most spectacular images of the cosmos that man has ever captured .
The telescope moves in an orbit which makes it the furthest traveling earth - orbiting man-made object .
The X - ray images offered by Chandra since its launch have redefined our notions of the cosmos and have given astronomy a whole new direction .
6. Palm Deira of Dubai :
Palm Deira is the latest of Dubai ’s trilogy of man-made islands .
This island will occupy all of 46.35 million square meters of land reclaimed from the Persian Gulf to make the Palm Deira the largest man-made island in the entire world .
All set to be finished by the year 2013 , the island will further alter the landscape of effervescent Dubai !
7. Viaduc de Millau Bridge :
Stretching higher than the Eiffel Tower , the Viaduc de Millau Bridge is a marvel of art and architecture that caught the eye of even flamboyant French President Jacques Chirac .
Stretching across southern France ’s Tarn River Gorge , it is 1.6 miles ( 2.6 kilometers ) long and soaring to 1,132 feet ( 343 meters ) at its highest point , it is the tallest bridge in the world .
Built by the firm that also built the Eiffel Tower , its spectacular presence bowls over one and all !
8. Bird ’s Nest :
The Bird ’s Nest in the heart of Beijing needs little introduction to anyone , and it is one structure that has now become synonymous with the Olympic Games .
Apart from its grand , yet unique design , the stadium is the world ’s largest steel structure .
No other man -made structure used up as much steel as the Olympic Stadium , with its intricate yet hypnotic design .
That surely sets it apart in terms of being a one of a kind venue in the sporting world .
9. Burj - Al - Arab Hotel :
By now almost everyone knows about the Burj - Al - Arab , and if you have not heard of it or seen its picture till now , then welcome back to earth .
The hotel stands at a height of 321 meters and is the tallest operational hotel in the world .
While the Rosa Tower is set to soon take away that crown , it still will not diminish the unique aura of the Burj , with its unique shape and its own artificial island .
This is one hotel where you can live it up in a grand style !
10 . Kingda Ka Roller Coaster :
At a height of 456 feet , the Kingda Ka Roller Coaster is the tallest fun ride in the world .
Located in the Six Flags Theme Park in New Jersey , the ride will take you into a different world and even before you know it , you will be plunging back towards earth at a speed of 128 mph .
This heart - stopping and mind - numbing ride is not just the tallest in the world but also the most exhilarating .
This is a modern marvel that is just for fun and adrenaline , and that makes it our personal favorite !
11 . Rungnado May Day Stadium :
Located in Pyongyang , North Korea , the May Day stadium is the largest in the world and has seen some pretty big crowds .
The May Day stadium has 150,000 seats and a total floor space of more than 207,000 square meters .
The inner stadium floor area covers 25,000 square meters , including 14,000 square meters of which its athletic field is artificially made and 8,300 square meters of lawn .
Vertical axis of stadium is 450 meters and horizontal axis 350 meters .
Those are just a few numbers from this humongous stage for sporting extravaganza !
12 . Akashi Kaikyo Suspension Bridge :
The Akashi Kaikyo Suspension Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the world and is a spectacular visual delight .
It apparently took 2 million workers 10 years to construct the bridge , 181,000 tons of steel and 1.4 million cubic meters of concrete .
The four - mile bridge links the island of Awaji and the mainland city of Kobe .
This is probably one man-made marvel that even the Japanese are proud about and look at in awe !
13 . Lake Mead :
Lake Mead is one of my own personal favorites not just because it is such a spectacular human creation among nature ’s brilliant creations , but it also brings in the aura of the Hoover Dam into the list .
When it was completed , the Hoover Dam was the largest concrete structure in the world , and also the largest power - producing entity .
With time all that might have gone , but the artificial lake it creates among the gorgeous Grand Canyons — Lake Mead — is still the world ’s largest man-made reservoir .
Simply spectacular !
14 . Project Genesis :
When finished in 2009 , Royal Caribbean ’s Project Genesis luxury cruise ship will be the largest cruise ship the world has ever known .
This modern - day luxury - on - ocean will end up costing a cool $ 1.24 billion to make .
It will measure 1,180 feet long and carry 5,400 passengers .
When ready , the ship would have a central park , luxury hotels , restaurants , public spaces , picnic spots and bars .
Yes , it is like a little city of its own !
15 . Hangzhou Bay Bridge :
There is something about bridges that we just can not get enough of .
It is just the scientific knowledge and the engineering skill involved in building them that makes them stand out as technical pieces of art .
The Hangzhou Bay Bridge is the longest road bridge in the world and another Chinese marvel that made it to our list .
The £ 840 million Bridge , measuring 36 km , spans Hangzhou Bay to link China ’s financial hub and the port city of Ningbo to the south .
The fact that it is anchored in waters that are 60 meters deep in places and yet is so solid and spectacular makes it a feat of accomplishment indeed !
16 . Channel Tunnel :
The Channel Tunnel , more popularly known as the Eurotunnel , is the longest under - sea rail tunnel in the world in terms of length of the tunnel under the sea .
Connecting England and France , it starts out at Kent in England and finishes at Coquelles near Calais in northern France .
Creating a bridge over water is hard enough but to plow under the sea to create a rail tunnel !
This is one ride that you will never forget .
17 . Singapore Flyer :
These big giant wheels that go round and round giving you a spectacular view of the city are so cool , and the one in London is obviously pretty famous .
But there is plenty of hard work and engineering skill behind the apparent simplicity .
The Singapore Flyer is the world ’s largest Ferris wheel and reaches 42 stories high , it comprises of a 150 - metre high wheel built over a three - story terminal building , thus giving it a total height of 165 meters .
It not only gives you a view of Singapore in totality but parts of Malaysia and Indonesia as well ...
Awesome !
18 . Pan STARRS -1 :
Built at Manoa ’s Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu at the University of Hawaii , the largest digital camera has been installed on the Pan STARRS - 1 telescope on Haleskala , Maui .
This digital wonder along with the telescope will form one of the most powerful observatories on the planet and will monitor the cosmos constantly .
19 . MareNostrum :
It is not often that science and religion get along well , and that makes the MareNostrum all the more special .
MareNostrum is the most powerful supercomputer in Europe and while Europe does not cover the world , it is the only one where you will find a church .
The supercomputer consists of 2560 JS21 blade computing nodes , each with 2 dual - core IBM 64 - bit PowerPC 970 MP processors running at 2.3 GHz for 10240 CPUs .
All this in a chapel , and the ironic part : it is used for human genome research !
20 . San Alfonso Del Mar :
Freaky Dancing Robot - Creepy Dancing Robot .
Don`t ask me why he looks like an `80s - era East LA gangster though .
In addition to being one of the fathers of computer science , Alan Turing postulated a very simple test for when computers move beyond calculations and start engaging in what we might consider thought .
For Turing , the ultimate test was whether a person , engaged in a text - based conversation with a machine , would believe that it was conversing with another human .
Each year , the University of Reading hosts a competition where software is put to this test , with the winner taking home the Loebner Prize in Artificial Intelligence .
This year 's winner , called Elbot , came within one judge of passing the test , but its success may be less important than the underlying technology :
Elbot is the product of a company that promises its software can help companies take the requirement for humans out of live chats and e-mail .
Over a dozen competitors took part in this year 's contest , including older favorites like ALICE and Jabberwacky , both of which wound up among the six finalists .
Elbot took home the Loebner Prize by convincing three of a dozen judges that it was human ; it and most of the rest of the bots received high scores for portions of their conversation .
Typically , fooling 30 percent of people is considered a pass on the Turing Test , so this suggests that the combination of fast processors and sophisticated software is on the verge of passing the test .
It 's worth pointing out that having a computer pass the test is likely to tell us something about Turing 's standard for artificial intelligence , rather than conclusively demonstrate that computers have reached something that approximates intelligence .
So far , the software behind the chat bots does n't seem to involve the sort of wide - ranging intellectual capacity that we tend to file under " intelligence . "
Nevertheless , the chat bots can extract a degree of information from a sentence and formulate a response that 's generally at least peripherally related to the matter at hand , as you can tell from a visit to the winner .
I started two chats with Elbot with roughly the same question and had wildly different results .
Sometimes , it was clear that the software was grasping for anything in what I typed that it could work with , but at other times it seemed positively witty and thoughtful , such as when it concluded , " My guesses would probably be more interesting than the actual answer . "
What was most striking to me , however , was the company that was putting Elbot up on the web .
Artificial Solutions ' home page comes with a chat bot in the top corner — when asked about the Loebner Prize , it was happy to tell me , " Loebner ? Elbot ( www.elbot.com) won a contest with that name , I heard .
Must be some kind of ' best piece of garbage ' contest . "
Why is a company interested in chat bots , rudely dismissive or otherwise ?
Welcome to the next generation of tech support .
The company sells an e-mail analysis system that promises to perform a natural language analysis of incoming mail and formulate a reply , attaching any relevant documents .
The response is forwarded to a live human to determine if the software got it right , but it obviously has the potential to take some of the drudge work out of a number of potential duties .
In the same manner , an interactive chat assistant can be posted on a company support page , where it will engage in a full - fledged , Turing - like conversation and attempt to determine what a user is looking for .
If it 's successful , no real human time will have been wasted in answering an easy question .
If it fails , the human it forwards the problem to can rely on the chat transcript to quickly get up to speed .
These capabilities are obviously an extension of existing automated support systems , and they only require a fairly specialized sort of intelligence .
Having been driven to the verge of violence by both automated and human support , I can't tell whether this represents a good trend or not .
I live in Los Angeles , which means I have horrible self esteem and body issues .
So I decided to sign up for personal training sessions .
I was assigned Alyi ( yes , she spelled it like a hippie would , or a hip - hop artist ) randomly , and she seemed nice enough .
A normal , healthy looking girl about my height .
I asked for a contact number in case I had to cancel if something came up .
She gave me her headshot .
This was not a good sign .
Alyi was a 22 year old former meth addict who also used to be bulimic .
She came to LA to be a dancer , but fell into personal training the same way people fall into bartending – because their first choice career just was n’t happening .
She would often change her career trajectory from filmmaker , to actress , to joining The Army .
She did n’t actually pursue any of these paths more than just talking about signing up for classes or browsing the Army ’s website .
I admitted to her that I thought about liposuction before I decided to spend the money on a personal trainer .
Taking that as a suggestion , she went to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and got lipo .
Some days she would only drink green tea to lose weight quickly and become , I quote , “ a total rockstar . ”
I blame the Roxy and the Whiskey being on her bike path to work ( she did n’t own a car ) .
Alyi’s live - in fiancé was an alcoholic and an illegal immigrant from Mexico .
The one time I met him , he was plastered and it was only 7 pm .
He barely spoke a word of English and we communicated mostly through mime .
I would have understood her attraction to him if he was handsome and debonair , an exotic lov-ah .
But he was shorter than both of us , had no muscles , and looked kind of retarded .
What the hell was she getting out of this ?
Maybe they had drinking in common , since I once had to pick her up from The Abbey because she was too drunk to bike home .
She gave me a month of free training for dog-sitting her pitbull over Thanksgiving .
I lived in her tiny studio apartment for a week cleaning up after her dog that peed everywhere but outside .
Her fridge ’s only contents were vodka .
She had no pots or pans .
She actually owned the complete box collection of the Look Who ’s Talking movies .
If you live in Los Angeles , you have no excuse for having a shitty DVD collection .
This was inexcusable .
One day , she called me and told me I had to meet her at another gym for our session .
“ Why ? ” I asked .
She admitted she got fired .
“ For training me illegally under the table ? ” I wondered .
“ No . ” “ Was it because you hit on your boss ? ” “ No , not that either . ”
“ What about showing up to work drunk , was it that ? ” Apparently not .
She was stealing money from the gym by not reporting unused training sessions .
Shrug .
She did n’t kill anybody , and I could fit into my skinny jeans again .
I ’ll keep meeting with her .
Alyi had miraculously gotten a job at another gym , but continued to train me discretely since I was n’t a member and could n’t legally use their equipment .
She would run on the treadmill beside me like we were workout buddies , and she ’d whisper “ Keep going !
Only two more minutes at this speed ! ”
It ’s hard to get motivated when you ’re constantly looking over both shoulders .
When I hit my goal weight , it was time to say goodbye to Alyi .
I had lost thirty pounds , but I gained a complete reassurance for my own sanity .

( Cannabis ) DUTCH PLAN TO WEED OUT CRIMINALS
Plans For Giant Cannabis Farm To Cut Out ' Back - Door ' Supply To Coffee Shops
The Dutch city of Eindhoven has caused a stir with a plan to set up a cannabis plantation to supply marijuana to its coffee shops .
The move was announced at a " weed summit " , when dozens of Dutch mayors urged the government to back the pilot project in an effort to clamp down on the criminals who supply the drug .
The Netherlands , famed for having one of Europe 's most tolerant policies on soft drugs , allows for the possession of less than 5g of marijuana and its sale in coffee shops , but bans the cultivation and supply of the drug to these shops .
The majority of Dutch mayors say this legal " back door " has spawned an illicit industry worth ?
2 bn ( UKP 1.7bn ) a year .
" It 's time that we experimented with a system of regulated plantations so we can have strict guidelines and controls on the quality and price , " Rob de Gijzel , the Mayor of Eindhoven , told the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant .
" Authorities must get a grip on the supply of drugs to coffee shops . "
There are also concerns about the increasing strength of unregulated cannabis , with the content of tetrahydrocannabinol , the active chemical ingredient , doubling in recent years .
The weed summit was called to thrash out a revamp of drugs policy after the provincial cities Roosendaal and Bergen op Zoom announced plans to shut all their coffee shops in the next two years to combat drugs tourism and criminal activity .
They complain that the 1.3 million French and Belgians who come every year for a puff of weed or dash of hash are often badly behaved .
Worse still , they are targeted by " drugs runners " who lure them away from legal outlets to back - door suppliers that offer harder , illegal drugs .
Han Polman , the Mayor of Bergen op Zoom , said : " We are in favour of the Eindhoven experiment but we do n't see it happening quickly .
That 's why we are going ahead with our shutdown . "
The Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin , of the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal party , has applauded these " courageous " efforts to wipe out coffee shops .
The capital , Amsterdam , was in shock over the weekend after news that one in five of its coffee shops would be forced to close under a new law .
The city council said 43 of 228 sites must close by the end of 2011 because they are within 250 m of a school .
This includes the famous Bulldog coffee shop , a tourist magnet housed in a former police headquarters on the Leidseplein .
Three Canadian visitors were reeling from the news .
One said : " We come here twice a year , we fly thousands of miles , spend probably ? 4,000 while we are here .
It 's the place to be ! "
The headmistress of a nearby school , Margriet Bosman , was equally unimpressed by the new measure : " This is just for show .
Children will get their drugs if they want to anyway , and closing the shops , which are quite regulated , is not a very good solution . "
Amsterdam 's mayor , Job Cohen , is also in favour of permitting the sale of soft drugs .
" There should be a system ... in which it is clear where soft drugs come from , " he said .
Many
Dutch also want the tolerant approach to remain in place , with a newspaper poll this week showing 80 per cent of Dutch opposing coffee shop closures .
Experts agree that a ban is not the answer .
" A ban is even more dangerous than the grass itself because consumers will turn to illegal circuits and criminality will explode , " said Tim Boekhout , a criminologist .
The plan for a cannabis plantation will now go before the Dutch cabinet .

Every time John McCain or Sarah Palin say Barack Obama wants to “ spread the wealth “ , someone must hold up a huge applause sign that reads : Clap and hoot like crazy gullible idiots .
Knowing how dumb these easily fools and rubes are , the sign must also have pictures on them showing hands clapping and owls hooting .
Nah .
Forget the “ owls ” part .
Too subtle for them ; they ’d never get it .
Just who the hell do these cement heads think McCain is making them think Obama is talking about ?
Are they some mythical , ethereal people living somewhere in their own part of the country with the un-Americans in un-America U.S.A .
No , You jackasses .
He ’s talking about You !
You !
You , the dumb numbnuts in John McCain ’s audiences .
You , the people that are too dumb to vote in Your own interests .
You , the people who are so insensitive to Your own welfare that You are blind to the fact that They hate You .
It ’s You , who believe McCain ’s lies that he ’s working for You .
That he has Your best interests at heart .
You , who are so stupid , you do n’t realize that it ’s McCain who wants to give
Your hard - earned tax dollars to his rich cronies .
You , who do n’t see that it ’s Obama who wants to give
You tax cuts and not the rich .
Obama wants to raise taxes on the Rich , not on You .
That ’s not spreading the wealth around , it evening up the playing field .
You , who do n’t hear the truth that Obama wants
You to have reasonably affordable health care , while McCain lies and tells
You that he ’ll give
You a $ 5,000 tax credit , tax You on Your new health care plan that will cost you $ 12,000 and put
You in the hole for an additional seven grand .
It ’s John McCain who voted against
You who have no health insurance for Your kid , and he made sure
You do n’t have any by voting NO on S - Chip .
I wo n’t bother explaining S - Chip , because
You ’re probably too dumb to grasp it , because You ’ve been brain washed by McCain .

Research from the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester shows that nitric oxide ( NO ) can change the computational ability of the brain .
This finding has implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's Disease and our understanding of brain function more generally .
The research is led by Professor Ian Forsythe and is reported in the journal Neuron on 26th November .
Professor Forsythe , of the MRC Toxicology Unit , explains : " It is well known that nerve cells communicate via the synapse - the site at which chemical messengers ( neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine or glutamate ) are packaged and then released under tight control to influence their neighbours .
" Nitric oxide is a chemical messenger which cannot be stored and can rapidly diffuse across cell membranes to act at remote sites ( in contrast to conventional neurotransmitters which cannot pass across cell membranes ) .
" It is broadly localized in the central nervous system , where it influences synaptic transmission and contributes to learning and memory mechanisms .
However , because it is normally released in such minute quantities and is so labile , it is very difficult to study .
" We have exploited an in vitro preparation of a giant synapse - called the calyx of Held , developed here at the University of Leicester in the 1990s - and its target in the auditory pathway to explore nitric oxide signalling in the brain .
" We show that NO is made in response to incoming synaptic activity ( activity generated by sound received by the ear ) and that it acts to suppress a key potassium ion-channel ( Kv3 ) .
Normally these ion-channels keep electrical potentials very short - lived , but nitric oxide shifts their activity , slowing the electrical potentials and reducing information passage along the pathway , acting as a form of gain control .
" Surprisingly , the whole population of neurons were affected , even those neurons which had no active synaptic inputs , so indicating that nitric oxide is a ' volume transmitter ' passing information between cells without the need for a synapse .
Such a function is ideal for tuning neuronal populations to global activity .
On the other hand , too much nitric oxide is extremely toxic and will cause death of nerve cells ; so within the kernel of this important signaling mechanism are the potential seeds for neurodegeneration , which if left unchecked contribute to the pathologies of stroke and dementias . "
In the future Professor Forsythe 's research group will be trying to understand how these signalling mechanisms are applicable elsewhere in the brain and will investigate how aberrant signalling contributes to neurodegenerative disease processes such as in Alzheimer 's disease ..

Rep . Michele Bachmann appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews last night and tangled over the recent emphasis on Barack Obama ’s relationship with unrepentant domestic terrorist William Ayers .
Matthews trapped Bachmann with a couple of reductio ad absurdum arguments , and somehow wound up asserting that an investigation to find anti-American Congressmen would be a good idea :
Michele ’s a friend and I know her passion for her country , but she let herself get trapped by Matthews here .
She did well until the last two minutes , but she let Matthews get away with characterizing her statements as equating liberal policy with anti-Americanism .
That leads to the conclusion that half of Congress hates America , which is ridiculous , and led to the silly notion that someone should “ look into ” it .
We do n’t need another House Un- American Activities Committee .
Voters make those decisions .
Mainstream liberal policy may be wrong - headed and ineffective , but it ’s not anti-American .
That ’s not the point with William Ayers , unless Matthews suggests that Ayers represents mainstream liberal views — a suggestion that would rightly offend mainstream liberals .
That ’s how Rep. Bachmann should have answered Matthews .
Ayers is a pretty good example of anti-Americanism ; he bombed the Pentagon and other places , and his group wound up killing people to score political points .
He wants to destroy the private - property system and replace it with essentially a Soviet state .
Jeremiah Wright preached “ God Damn America , ” about as anti-American a statement a preacher can make from the pulpit , and accused the government of creating AIDS as a genocidal tool against people of color .
I ’d call both anti-American , and not coincidentally , Barack Obama spent years of his life in politics with both people .
If Matthews objects to this coming out now , he can blame himself and his colleagues .
Had they spent one - tenth the effort investigating Obama as they have in investigating Joe the Plumber , Obama ’s evasions on Ayers would have been widely known months ago .
Matthews was too busy feeling tingles up his leg , which is all anyone needs to know about Matthews ’ credibility on anything connected with Obama .
Has John McCain fallen too far behind , too late in the presidential campaign , to overtake Barack Obama ?
That is the question facing strategists in both parties three weeks before Election Day .
History suggests that the answer is probably so .
Mr. Obama has already made history as the first African - American to become a major - party nominee for president .
But his breakthrough represents a wild card that could yield election returns at odds with poll results .
Beyond that , Mr. McCain ’s hopes rest on capturing the support of undecided voters , as well as shaking loose some voters who support his Democratic rival .
No one , including Mr. Obama ’s advisers , says such a turnaround in Mr. McCain ’s favor is impossible .
But the magnitude of Mr. McCain ’s task may leave him depending on a misstep by Mr. Obama or a national security crisis rather than on what he can achieve through speeches , advertising or a winning performance in the final debate on Wednesday .
There are so many people voting early in Florida that Governor Charlie Crist has flip flopped and declared a state of emergency in Florida to extend voting hours .
From the Miami Herald :
Declaring a state of emergency in Florida because of long voting lines , Gov. Charlie Crist on Tuesday extended early voting hours across the state to 12 hours a day .
The executive order comes after record early voting turnout has contributed to long lines at polling sites .
Current Florida law allows for early voting to be conducted eight hours a day each weekday and for a total of eight hours during the weekends .
With Crist ’s order , early voting sites will be open the rest of this week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m .
They will be open a total of 12 hours on Saturday and Sunday , the last day of early voting .
” It ’s not a political decision , ” Crist said moments after signing the order .
“ It ’s a people decision . ”
Crist said he made the decision after seeing numerous news reports about long lines and after he had a conversation with state House Democratic leader Dan Gelber of Miami Beach .
Crist ’s appointed secretary of state , Kurt Browning , had rejected the idea of extending the early voting hours earlier this week .
…
The polls in Miami - Dade opened at 11 a.m.

Patients should not place " false hope " in promises made by untested internet miracle cures , medical experts warned today .
Independent medical charity Sense About Science said many vulnerable patients are being duped by " surreptitious promotion and misleading stories " online and spending thousands of pounds on drugs that might be nothing more than snake oil .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The charity said it is worried about " the emotional and financial costs of over - hyped treatment claims that sell false hope " .
Tracey Brown , managing director of Sense About Science , said : " We 've been contacted by so many people exhausted from the pressure they feel to try advertised treatments , dietary regimes and exercises .
" One person told us how the last years of his wife 's life were spent endlessly pursuing new treatments , from goats blood serums to unlicensed stem cell treatments abroad , all to no avail . "
To assist , the charity has published a guide called I 've Got Nothing to Lose by Trying
It that explains how to tell the beneficial drugs from the bogus .
The guide has received the backing of the Royal College of GPs whose vice - chairman , Dr Clare Gerada , said : " This guide provides a wealth of sensible information to patients and the public .
" It goes a long way to taking the mystery out of medicine and I would recommend it to patients as a common - sense read . "
Patients suffering from Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease are particularly targeted .
Dr Kieran Breen , director of research with the Parkinson 's Disease Society , explained how patients are prepared to try anything to ease their suffering .
He said : " It can be tempting to believe personal stories of miracle cures , but only by using tried and tested methods can we move forward and provide people with Parkinson 's with the best available advice and treatments . "
The campaign has also secured the political support of Liberal Democrat MP Phil Willis , who is chairman of the Innovation , Universities , Science and Skills Select Committee .
The politician said : " The cruellest deception for a patient with a chronic illness is the promise of a cure based on empty hope , not evidence .
" The publication of I 've Got Nothing to Lose by Trying
It is an inspired attempt to empower patients to evaluate so - called ' miracle cures ' with evidence - based advice . "

Saturday , August 23 , 2008
On August 11 , United States Senator and 2008 presidential Republican candidate John McCain gave a speech regarding the crisis between Georgia and Russia .
Following the speech , a regular Wikipedia editor noticed that his speech was very similar to an article on Wikipedia also regarding the crisis , in what could be considered plagiarism .
Wikinews was able to talk to that editor about how he found out about the similarities and what he did in response .
Wikinews also took a deeper look at the claim and investigated further .
John McCain
McCain gave his speech in Erie , Pennsylvania and was speaking to citizens , giving a warning to Russia stating , " Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe , long - term negative consequences that their government ’s actions will have for Russia ’s relationship with the U.S. and Europe . "
McCain continued his speech saying , " Georgia is an ancient country , at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia , and one of the world ’s first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion .
After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution , the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922 .
As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War , Georgia regained its independence in 1991 , but its early years were marked by instability , corruption , and economic crises . "
While reading the first few paragraphs , the Wikipedia editor Killing Vector , ( who wishes to be called by his contributor name in fear of retribution for coming forward with the claim ) , noticed a striking similarity to McCain 's speech and the Wikipedia article on the country of Georgia .
Not only did he notice the similarities , but after reading through the article 's edit history , ' Killing Vector ' noticed that his speech might have been lifted from Wikipedia , with some of the material in McCain 's speech dating prior to the start of the Georgian and Russian crisis .
" I began reading the text of McCain 's address on the Georgia crisis , and as I was browsing it the irregularity jumped out almost immediately .
The paragraphs which discussed the history of Georgia simply did n't fit with the rest of the speech ; the rhetorical style was jarringly different .
I figured , " where 's someone in a hurry going to get basic information on the Republic of Georgia ? "
I opened up Wikipedia , went to the article , picked a recent but not current revision more or less at random ( July 24th ) , and hit gold on the first try ; McCain 's speech and the Wikipedia article had significant strings of words in common , emphasized the same events , made largely the same word choices , " Vector said to Wikinews .
Although other media outlets reported the alleged plagiarism , the two passages below were dated at least one week prior to the Georgian and Russian crisis .
The first two paragraphs of McCain 's speech appear to resemble the Wikipedia article in the history dated July 24 , 2008 .
" Two paragraphs , about an eighth of the full speech , contain material directly copied from Wikipedia or superficially modified from its text .
Those two paragraphs constitute the entire factual background of the speech , though — the rest is reaction and proposed policy , " added Vector .
Example ( identical wording is in italics . ) :
Wikipedia – .... one of the first countries in the world to adopt Christianity as an official religion .
McCain – .... one of the world 's first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion .
Wikipedia – After the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Georgia had a brief period of independence as a Democratic Republic ( 1918 - 1921 ) , which was terminated by the Red Army invasion of Georgia .
Georgia became part of the Soviet Union in 1922 and regained its independence in 1991 .
Early post -Soviet years was marked by a civil unrest and economic crisis .
McCain – After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution , the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922 .
As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War , Georgia regained its independence in 1991 , but its early years were marked by instability , corruption , and economic crises .
We did not copy Wikipedia in Sen. McCain ’s remarks .
There are only so many ways to state basic historical facts and dates and that any similarities to Wikipedia were only coincidental .
— Brian Rogers , McCain campaign spokesman
McCain 's campaign denies they plagiarized Wikipedia , but also did n't state whether they used it as a source for his speech .
" We did not copy Wikipedia in Sen. McCain ’s remarks .
There are only so many ways to state basic historical facts and dates and that any similarities to Wikipedia were only coincidental , " said a spokesman for the McCain campaign , Brian Rogers to The Politico .
Wikinews contacted McCain 's campaign , but has yet to receive a response .
Wikinews e-mailed Jay Walsh , the director of communications for the Wikimedia Foundation to see what they thought of the situation , and what if anything they planned to do about it .
" We are n't particularly concerned with this , " said Walsh who also added that " I 'm only aware of this situation through media coverage I 've seen , nor do we or I have any in - depth detail about the situation . "
" I would say it 's a good practice to attribute text or content whenever possible .
Obviously when it's a matter of copyright then there are legal considerations , but the Foundation is not able to examine individual cases , " added Walsh .
Wikinews attempted to contact Mike Godwin , the legal counsel for the Foundation , but has yet to receive a response .
Vector stands by his claim and also notes what he calls ' dishonesty ' on the part of McCain 's campaign .
" What concerns me more , as a voter , is the ethical issue .
Plagiarism comes from dishonesty and intellectual laziness on the part of an individual , but McCain 's campaign 's later denial adopts that individual 's dishonesty , " stated Vector .

Due to health reasons , John McCarthy could not attend the conference .
Alan Kay was ( I hear ) heading somewhere else in the evening – it would be a tight fit for his schedule if he was going to be there and also make his other “ date ” .
Seeing as McCarthy could n’t make it , Kay decided not to come .
Instead , Guy Steele conducted the interview by phone .
( What as most striking to me about this was just how careful Steele was and how precise he was with his language .
He appeared to already know the answers to all the questions … and if things got sidetracked or drifted off in a random or unclear direction , he always knew just what to say to pull things back together and pin things down .
Just observing this interview process , it was clear that Guy was exactly the kind of person that you ’d want to have running a massive language standards type project .
It ’s no accident that Steele is as influential as he is .
He was very different from the traditional stereotype of a Lisp hacker .
Throughout the day , I ’d run into people and say … that ’s Guy Steele over there !
That ’s the guy who wrote the lambda papers !
Unfortunately , this did n’t seem to mean much to the typical conference goer …. )
When asked what should have been added to Lisp , McCarthy said he would like to add some direct logic , but he did n’t know how to do that in a good way .
Steele mentioned something about the Lisp - Prolog people in an aside .
( I think Norvig implemented Prolog in Common Lisp in PAIP …. )
When asked what separates a good programming language from a bad one , McCarthy said he had one advocacy : a language should have access to its own abstract syntax .
Any program which works with programs involves abstract syntax .
If you take Java and you want to write a program that deals with Java programs , then you ’ve got to scan it and look up the plus sign and its precedents .
( What a mess ! )
Steele asked about the variation in the implementation of key - value pairs and association lisps .
Was this an accident or a reinvention ?
McCarthy said he invented both– when he invented the second , he was n’t thinking about what he ’d done the first time .
Steele asked if s-expressions were good or bad .
McCarthy said his original idea was to make it like Fortran .
( With m-expressions , that is . )
Steve Russel took McCarthy ’s eval and said you could just program in s-expressions .
Being a “ conservative guy ” , McCarthy thought this was a bad idea .
Steele appeared to be slightly taken aback by the idea of such a revolutionary figure describing themselves as “ conservative . ”
McCarthy said , “ everybody ’s conservative about what they ’ve been doing . ”
( I have several notes on the significance and uses of abstract syntax , but I do n’t understand them .
If anyone out there knows what he meant about having different versions of it– say , one to write in and one that ’s pretty – then please help elucidate this .
He also said something about not having really any good examples of Lisp programs that write programs .
I think that ’s what he said ; I ’d like to know more about this , too . )
Steele noted that most new languages have a “ boss ” .
( Perl has Larry , Python has Guido , etc. )
Steele then asked who was that boss of Lisp .
McCarthy cracked back , “ if Lisp has any boss , it ’s you !
You wrote the language manual ! ”
The audience laughed .
“ There was no boss , ” McCarthy said .
“ I never attempted to be the boss . ”
( And of course , as we had seen in the historical perspectives on Lisp earlier in the day , there were tons of Lisp implementations in the sixties and seventies .
Each “ tribe ” was going off in their own directions and people could n’t really consolidate them at the time because of hardware limitations . )
“ Even in the early days I was n’t the boss of Lisp , ” he said .
“ People could get things into Lisp without me knowing it . ”
Steele asked what ’s his one idea that could have had the most practical impact if it had actually gotten implemented .
McCarthy said , if IBM had taken his ideas about time sharing … then things would have been quite a bit better in the 1960’s .
At this point , JonL stood up and started clapping .
The final parts of the interview covered Perlis ’s attachment to Formula - Algol before “ apologizing ” and agreeing with the Lisp approach .
McCarthy said he had looked at Formula - Algol when they first proposed it and thought it was pretty bad : it overloaded the algebraic operations and applied them to formulas , he said .
He concluded by saying he did n’t know what the alternatives were to abstract syntax .
The most important problem we can be working on , he said , was formalizing common sense .

Lieberman Contributed to GOP Senate , House Candidates
Sen. Joe Lieberman's ( I - Conn . ) support of John McCain 's presidential campaign was well known .
His contribution to Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) was not .
( By Melina Mara -- The Washington Post Photo )
By Paul Kane
Here 's a story of the Thanksgiving spirit , forgiving and forgetting senatorial style .
When Democrats gathered last week to decide the fate of Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , a pair of senators - elect , Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley of Oregon , stepped up to offer symbolically important speeches .
Having ridden the wave of support for President - elect Barack Obama , Udall and Merkley spoke out in favor of the spirit of reconciliation and moving on from the campaign , in which Lieberman was one of the highest profile supporters of the Republican presidential ticket .
But no one in the room knew , as Merkley spoke , that Lieberman had supported Merkley 's opponent , Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore . ) .
Lieberman , through his Reuniting Our Country PAC , gave Smith 's reelection bid $ 5,000 on Oct. 10 , according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission .
Lieberman 's support of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) for the presidency was well known , punctuated by his nationally televised speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul criticizing Obama as not prepared to be president .
His endorsement of Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , who has served as the top Republican beside him at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , also was well known in Democratic circles .
But not even Merkley knew of Lieberman 's backing of Smith in their critical Senate race , until Capitol Briefing alerted his staff today .
" We were surprised to hear this news , but it 's time to put the election behind us .
Jeff Merkley is looking forward to working with all his new colleagues on an agenda that will put our nation back on track , " said Julie Edwards , spokeswoman for Merkley .
Lieberman 's support of Smith came the same weekend he wrote an op -ed in the St. Paul Pioneer Press defending Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) for his work as chairman of an investigative subcommittee on Lieberman 's homeland security committee .
The same day he wrote a check to Smith , Lieberman 's ROC PAC gave $ 5,000 to Rep. Peter King , the Long Island Republican .
In radio and TV appearances the final days of the campaign , Lieberman also frequently said that a Democratic majority of 60 votes , a filibuster - proof level , would be a bad thing .
Lieberman's $ 5,000 check was clearly not a difference maker for Smith , as Merkley still won by more than 50,000 votes .
And Coleman is clinging to a razor - thin lead during a recount of his race against Democrat Al Franken .
But the internal Democratic caucus debate over Lieberman 's fate almost always focused on Lieberman 's criticism of Obama , not on his support of Republicans in Senate races .
Edwards , Merkley 's spokeswoman , has said that Merkley also expressed how much Lieberman 's actions in the presidential race angered him .
He did not encourage other Democrats to vote one way or the other , but did talk about moving on from the bitter fights of the campaign .
Then , on a 42 - 13 vote , Democrats supported keeping Lieberman as chairman of the committee with broad oversight of the Obama administration and removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee .
Lieberman 's office acknowledged his donation to Smith , but noted that he worked hard for other Democrats as well .
" While the Senator 's political action committee donated to a very few Republicans , the Senator 's pacs donated and raised over a half million dollars for wide range of Democratic candidates and organizations in this past election cycle , " Marshall Wittmann , his spokesman , said .

About our vote count :
We ( ok , I ) grossly underestimated how many votes we would get on this particular post .
Almost 800 comments in total — many of which contained more than half a dozen free software projects — made finishing the total count ( 36 pages of comments ) before Thanksgiving 2011 impossible .
So , this represents just over 1,100 votes , only one third of the total comments we received .
This list of 40 contains all the apps that received 10 or more votes .
As almost 200 mentions got only a single vote , we think that even though it 's incomplete , it 's closely representative of the general consensus .

Our apologies for the incomplete count — lesson learned .
Next time , we 'll use a proper survey tool .
Obama leads by two to seven points among likely voters
Gallup Daily : Presidential Race Narrows Slightly Obama leads by two to seven points among likely voters
PRINCETON , NJ --
The gap between Barack Obama and John McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Saturday through Monday has narrowed slightly , and Obama is now at 49 % of the vote to 47 % for McCain among likely voters using Gallup 's traditional model , and at 51 % to 44 % using Gallup 's expanded model .
Both candidates continued vigorous campaigning on Monday .
One forthcoming event with the potential to affect voter sentiments is a 30 - minute Barack Obama paid program , for which his campaign has purchased time on Wednesday night on a number of national broadcast and cable television networks .
The two percentage point margin for Obama over McCain in today 's traditional likely voters result , based on Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Oct. 25 - 27 , is not the first time the race has been this close ; it matches the two - point Obama margin that held for three straight reporting periods spanning Oct. 13 - 17 , a week and a half ago .
The traditional model assumes that turnout will follow the patterns of past elections , in which both current interest in the election and past voting behavior are predictors of actual voting .
Obama 's seven - point lead among expanded likely voters , based on a model which makes no assumptions about turnout based on past voting history , is fairly typical of what has been measured over the last two weeks , although slightly narrowed from the last two days ' reports .
Obama 's lowest margin among this expanded group was four points , measured on Oct. 15 - 17 .
Obama is also now at a seven - point margin over McCain among registered voters , 50 % to 43 % .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 25 - 27 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,781 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Results based on " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) include interviews with 2,439 voters , and assume a turnout of 60 % of national adults .
The likely voter sample is weighted to match this turnout assumption , so the weighted sample size is 1,813 .
The associated maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,396 " expanded " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
The expanded likely voter model does not make any assumptions about turnout level .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
" Deny thy father and refuse thy name , " sweetly demanded Shakespeare 's most famous heroine .
Yes , Juliet may have been rather pushy for a fictional prepubescent girl living in 16th - century Italy , but fast - forward to 2008 and a growing number of men are doing just what she asked .
When 29 - year - old scriptwriter Kris Myddelton ( né Dyer ) married Jo last October , there was no question of who was wearing the trousers : it was him ( she was in the traditional floor - sweeping white satin ) .
But it was he who took her surname .
" It may not be very butch , " admits the groom , " but it is rather pleasantly twee . "
If you 're picturing a downtrodden , emasculated new - age hippie , you 'd be wrong .
Myddelton is keen to point out that the main reason behind their decision was simple : " My surname was rubbish and hers was n't . "
In addition , Jo is an only child , so they decided that carrying on the family name seemed a " nice thing to do " .

" I do n't consider myself particularly avant - garde , " he continues , " and I 'm not flying the flag for metrosexuality – it just seemed a sensible idea at the time .
What we had n't prepared ourselves for is just how old - fashioned the rest of the world is . "
Ignoring the drift of post - wedding cards addressed to Mr and Mrs Dyer , last May Myddelton paid £ 34 to change his name by Deed Poll .
" There was no other way to do it , " he says , " no box to tick on the marriage certificate [ as there is for a woman taking a man 's name ] . "
Instead , there were several months of administrative hell : when the new Mr Myddelton sent letters to banks and mobile - phone companies to notify them of his name change , he was greeted with confusion .
" It did n't seem an option .
Instead , my wife started receiving mysterious letters congratulating her on her marriage and name change . "
It was their friends who proved the fiercest reactionaries .
" I always considered my friends to be pretty metropolitan , but they too seemed to have problems coming to terms with it , " says Myddelton .
" They thought I was joking ; eventually I had to show them my new bank cards to get them to believe me .
They kept asking ' Why ? '
People seemed vaguely disapproving , as if we were breaking a sacred rule . "
Since weddings are increasingly non-traditional – from humanist ceremonies to female best " men " – such opposition is surprising .
So why is this one element still such a sticking point ?
Although surnames did n't even exist in Britain until the 13th century , the biblical story of Eve being formed from one of Adam 's ribs cemented the idea of a woman as an " appendage " to her companion .
That surnames came to follow this pattern is no surprise .
Until the mid-20th century , marriage was a complex patriarchal exchange of money , status and property – of which women were a vital part ; marriage signalling the woman 's assimilation from her father 's to her husband 's estate .
But things have moved on since then .
Martin , a 27 - year - old groom - to - be , will follow in Kris Myddelton 's footsteps .
" Modern weddings are not about a man owning a woman , " he says .
" I am marrying an independent person with her own mind , her own life and her own job .
When I take on my wife 's family name , it 's a positive move forward , as I believe women are equal to men – if not slightly better . "
Aside from the ideological arguments , it is also pertinent to mention that Martin 's surname is Willey – something both he and his bride are keen to leave behind .
Louise Bowers , a spokesperson for the UK Deed Poll Service , estimates that only about 50 per cent of women now take their husband 's name .
" Increasingly couples double - barrel , or ' mesh ' , their surnames together , " she says – a trend gaining traction in America , where Los Angeles 's mayor , Antonio Villaraigosa , famously became a " mesher " after combining his name , Villar , with his wife 's , Raigosa .
However , Stephanie Gill , who has been married for seven years , sees a potential problem in this for future generations .
While she flits between her maiden name and her husband 's ( " his for bills and bank accounts , mine for work " ) , her children have her husband 's surname and her maiden name as a middle name .
" Double - barrelled names sound pretentious , " she says .
" And what happens down the line ?
Our great - great grandchildren could have been lumbered with eight surnames . "
Just as some couples choose to marry in an aquarium while others stick with a church , the question of a married name is a matter of taste .
For the Myddeltons , the important thing was to choose a name to share .
" We share our money , our home , the housework – and one day we hope to share children , " says Kris .
" Sharing our name was one of the most appropriate ways we could think of to celebrate that . "

In the last two days , I saw two amazing rants from the Religious Right , should , God forbid , Obama be elected .
First up , is a letter , sent out but Focus on the Family , entitled Letter from 2012 in Obama ’s America .
This 16 page missive starts by asking “ What will the United States be like if Senator Obama is elected ? ”
It then goes on to postulate what the year 2012 will look like .
What do they think 2012 will look like ?
First , it posits that , after Obama is inaugurated , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens would announce that they were stepping down .
Obama would immediately replace them with “ two far - Left , American Civil Liberties Union - oriented judges . ”
( We should be so lucky ! )
And then ( cue the “ da - da - da - duuuum ” scary music ) :
The decisive changes on the Supreme Court started in June , when Justice Kennedy resigned – he was 72 and had grown weary of the unrelenting responsibility .
His replacement – another young liberal Obama appointment – gave a 5 - 4 majority to justices who were eager to create laws from the bench .
The four conservative justices who remained — John Roberts , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — were suddenly in the minority .
Then in August 2009 , two months after Kennedy resigned , Justice Scalia unexpectedly announced his resignation due to health reasons and by October 2009 another Obama appointment took his oath and joined the court .
…
Finally the far - Left had the highest prize : complete control of the Supreme Court .
And they set about quickly to expedite cases by which they would enact the entire agenda of the far Left in American politics – everything they had hoped for and more took just a few key decisions .
Scared yet ?
And , what are these cases that were the entire agenda of the far Left in American politics ?
Let ’s look at them .
It ’s fun , really .
Grab a beer ( yes , this is long ) , click that link and read the massive freak - out taking place in Jesus Camp land .
Ok , where were we ?
Oh , right …how the Left will enact their agenda .
First up : Same sex “ marriage ” ( in quotes , of course , because marriage – and the often resulting divorce – should only allowed to take place between a man and a woman ) .
Suddenly , homosexual “ marriage ” was the law of the land in all 50 states , and no state legislature , no state Supreme Court , no state Constitutional amendment , not even Congress , had any power to change it .
And the result of this abomination ?
The Boy Scouts no longer exist as an organization .
They chose to disband rather than be forced to obey the Supreme Court decision that they would have to hire homosexual scoutmasters and allow them to sleep in tents with young boys .
Elementary schools now include compulsory training in varieties of gender identity in Grade 1 , including the goodness of homosexuality as one possible personal choice .
There are no more Roman Catholic or evangelical Protestant adoption agencies in the United States .
…
Christian parents seeking to adopt have tried going through secular adoption agencies , but they are increasingly excluding parents with “ narrow ” or dangerous views on religion or homosexuality .
All businesses that have government contracts at the national , state or local level now have to provide documentation of equal benefits for same - sex couples .
The Bible can no longer be freely preached over radio or television stations when the subject matter includes such “ offensive ” doctrines as criticizing homosexual behavior .
Physicians who refuse to provide artificial insemination for lesbian couples now face significant fines or loss of their license to practice medicine
Social workers and counselors , even counselors in church staff positions , who refuse to provide “ professional , appropriately nurturing marriage counseling ” for homosexual couples lose their counseling licenses .
Church buildings are now considered a “ public accommodation ” by the Supreme Court , and churches have no freedom to refuse to allow their buildings to be used for wedding ceremonies for homosexual couples .
If they refuse , they lose their tax - exempt status , and they are increasingly becoming subject to fines and anti discrimination lawsuits .
While churches are still free to turn down homosexual applicants for the job of senior pastor , churches and parachurch organizations are no longer free to reject homosexual applicants for staff positions such as parttime youth pastor or director of counseling .
…
In addition , any chaplain who holds to an interpretation of Scripture that homosexual conduct is morally wrong and therefore does not espouse “ mainstream values , ” is dismissed from the military .
Wow .
That ’s some list of things to be very , very frightened of .
But , it does n’t end there .
No , there is the concern of discussing religion in the “ public square . ”
The new 6 - 3 liberal majority on the Supreme Court followed his reasoning and outlawed any use of school property for any kind of religious meeting , even outside of normal school hours .
In addition , Christian students cannot raise religious objections to curriculum material that promotes homosexual behavior .
Wow , they really have a hard - on for those God - damned homosexuals , do n’t they ?
But , there ’s more .
Tens of thousands of young churches suddenly had no place to meet when the Supreme Court ruled that public schools in all 50 states had to stop allowing churches to rent their facilities — even on Sundays , when school was not in session .
After the Supreme Court ruled that “ proselytizing ” speech and “ worship ” speech did not have the same First Amendment protection as other speech , and after it declared same - sex “ marriage ” to be the law of the United States , a subsequent Supreme Court decision predictably ruled that universities had to prohibit campus organizations that promote “ hate speech ” and have discriminatory policies .
Therefore these Christian ministries have been prohibited from use of campus buildings , campus bulletin boards , advertising in campus newspapers , and use of
dormitory rooms or common rooms for Bible studies .
Uhm , did they just admit that their organizations promote hate - speech ?
Sorry , I am digressing .
Back to the tirade .
Public school teachers are no longer free to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States .
( Because it contains “ under God ” )
But , wait …we have not yet gotten to one of their favorite tirades ( cue scary music again ) : Abortion .
The Freedom of Choice Act also reversed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 , so infants can be killed outright just seconds before they would be born .
Nurses are no longer free to refuse to participate in abortions for reasons of conscience .
23
If they refuse to participate , they lose their jobs , for they are now failing to comply with federal law .
Many Christian nurses have left the
health care field rather than violate their consciences .
Nurses are no longer free to refuse to participate in abortions for reasons of conscience . …
The same restrictions apply to doctors : Doctors who refuse to perform abortions can no longer be licensed to deliver babies at hospitals in any state .
Pornography and gun ownership are also included , but since these are minor tirades , I will skip them .
Feel free to read the document ( at the above link ) should you desire .
On to education !
Parents ’ freedom to teach their children at home has been severely restricted .
… the Supreme Court declared that home schooling was a violation of state educational requirements except in cases where the parents ( a ) had an education certificate from an accredited state program . , ( b ) agreed to use state - approved textbooks in all courses , and ( c ) agreed not to teach their children that homosexual conduct is wrong , or that Jesus is the only way to God , since these ideas have been found to hinder students ’ social adjustment and acceptance of other lifestyles and beliefs , and to run counter to the state ’s interest in educating its children to be good citizens .
Parents found in violation of this ruling have been subject to prosecutions for truancy violation , resulting in heavy fines and eventual removal of their children from the home .
( Oh , back to the homosexuals , again ! )
Timeout !
A quick nod to Obama .
After many of these decisions , especially those that restricted religious speech in public places , President Obama publicly expressed strong personal disapproval of the decision and said that the Supreme Court had gone far beyond what he ever expected .
But he has also stated repeatedly that he had sworn to “ preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , ” and , now that the Supreme Court had ruled , he had no choice but to uphold the law , for these decisions were the law of the land .
Or , not so much .
Oh , and “ Since 2009 , terrorist bombs have exploded in two large and two small U.S. cities , killing hundreds , and the entire country is fearful , for no place seems safe . ”
Russia invaded Georgia , Ukraine , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
And “ President Obama has also moved to deepen U.S. ties and U.S. trade with communist regimes in Cuba , Venezuela and Bolivia , regimes that had long enjoyed the favor of far - Left factions in the Democratic Party . ”
I. Am. So. Scared !
Daddy ( Republican party ) , help me !
Yes , yes , there is more .
Healthcare !
The new Congress under President Obama passed a nationalized “ single provider ” health care system , in which the U.S. government is the provider of all health care in the United States , following the pattern of nationalized medicine in the United Kingdom and Canada .
The great benefit is that medical care is now free for everyone — if you can get it .
Now that health care is free , it seems everybody wants more of it .
The waiting list for prostate cancer surgery is 3 years .
The waiting list for ovarian cancer is 2 years .
And you far , far worse if you are older .
Because medical resources must be rationed carefully by the government , people older than 80 have essentially no access to hospitals or surgical procedures .
Their “ duty ” is increasingly thought to be to go home to die , so they do n’t drain scarce resources from the medical system .
Euthanasia is becoming more and more common .
That ’s right , Obama is going to kill your parents , grand parents and great grandparents .
BTW , I am only on page 11 of this 16 page document .
Bored yet ?
Yeah , I thought so .
I will paraphrase most of the rest of this outrageously stupid document .
You are all going to die slow , lingering deaths by socialization , overtaxation , unionization , and the cost of gas because we did n’t Drill Baby Drill .
One last set of quotes , for I only hope and pray that this one would happen !
The FCC quickly implemented the “ Fairness Doctrine , ” which requires that radio stations provide “ equal time ” for alternative views on political or policy issues .
As a result , all radio stations have to provide equal time to contrasting views for every political or policy - related program they broadcast by talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh , Laura Ingraham , Sean Hannity , Dennis Prager , Janet Parshall , Michael Medved and Hugh Hewitt , and broadcasters like Dr. James Dobson .
Every conservative talk show is followed by an instant rebuttal to the program by a liberal “ watchdog ” group .
And what was the cause of this great American demise ?
Christians did n’t take time to find out who Barack Obama was when they voted for him .
Why did they risk our nation ’s future on him ?
It was a mistake that changed the course of history .
But , wait , MsJoanne , you said you read TWO rants .
Yes , I did .
The second comes from Pat Buchanan , who last night had this piece on Real Clear Politics discussing Obama ’s first 100 days as president .
“ What does the triumvirate of Obama - Pelosi - Reid offer ? ” starts Buchanan ’s laundry list of end of the world predictions .
Swift amnesty for 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens and a drive to make them citizens and register them , as in the Bill Clinton years .
This will mean that Nevada , Colorado , New Mexico and Arizona will soon move out of reach for GOP presidential candidates , as has California .
Border security will go on the backburner , and America will have a virtual open border with a Mexico of 110 million .
Taxes will be raised on the top 5 percent of wage - earners , who now carry 60 percent of the U.S. income tax burden , and tens of millions of checks will be sent out to the 40 percent of wage - earners who pay no federal income tax .
Like the man said , redistribute the wealth , spread it around .
Social Security taxes will be raised on the most successful among us , and capital gains taxes will be raised from 15 percent to 20 percent .
The Bush tax cuts will be repealed , and death taxes reimposed .
Two or three more liberal activists of the Ruth Bader Ginsberg - John Paul Stevens stripe will be named to the Supreme Court .
U.S. district and appellate courts will be stacked with “ progressives . ”
Special protections for homosexuals will be written into all civil rights laws , and gays and lesbians in the military will be invited to come out of the closet .
“ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” will be dead .
The homosexual marriages that state judges have forced California , Massachusetts and Connecticut to recognize , an Obama Congress or Obama court will require all 50 states to recognize .
A “ Freedom of Choice Act ” nullifying all state restrictions on abortions will be enacted .
America will become the most pro-abortion nation on earth .
Affirmative action — hiring and promotions based on race , sex and sexual orientation until specified quotas are reached — will be rigorously enforced throughout the U.S. government and private sector .
Universal health insurance will be enacted , covering legal and illegal immigrants , providing another powerful magnet for the world to come to America , if necessary by breaching her borders .
A federal bailout of states and municipalities to keep state and local governments spending up could come in December or early next year .
The first trillion - dollar deficit will be run in the first year of an Obama presidency .
It will be the first of many .
“ Welcome to Obamaland ! ” He ends .
On that , I am 100 % with him !
UPDATE : I forgot to add my very favorite part of the Focus on the Family 16 page missive .
This on prosecuting Bush and other Bush officials :
In his first week in office , Obama followed President Clinton ’s precedent and fired all 93 U.S. attorneys , replacing them with his own appointments , including the most active members of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
President Obama argued this was not a selective political action like what President Bush had done , because Obama had fired all of them , conservatives and liberals alike .
The Justice Department soon began to file criminal and civil charges against nearly every Bush administration official who had any involvement with the Iraq war .37 During his campaign , Senator Obama said , “ What I would want to do is to have my Justice Department and my Attorney General immediately review the information that ’s already there and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued .
” 38 In order to facilitate these proceedings , President Obama rescinded President Bush ’s executive order that had prevented presidential papers from being released , and millions of pages of previously secret White House papers were posted on the Internet .
ACLU attorneys have spent four years poring over these papers looking for possible violations of law .
Dozens of Bush officials , from the Cabinet level on down , are in jail , and most of them are also bankrupt from legal costs .
Please , please … make this a dream come true !

October 7 , 2008 US / NATO bombs kill about ten times more Afghan civilians with a ton of our " precision " bombs than we killed Serbs in 1999 .
More than 80 % of Afghan civilian deaths today caused by the US / NATO are due to close air support attacks .
They ( Afghans ) are only worth one - tenth of an Alaskan sea otter rather than forty camels .
We spend ten dollars on the military in Afghanistan to pursue our geo-strategic aims and less than $ 1 on reconstructing the everyday lives of Afghans devastated by thirty years of war .

The real face of the U.S.�s Afghan air war : children burnt by U.S. bombs at Lashkargah�s Emergency hospital in October 2006 ( from Maso Notarianni at http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawanews.php?id=18 ) .
My original dossier on civilian victims of U.S. aerial bombing was released on December 10 , 2001 , see http://www.cursor.org/stories/civilian_deaths.htm
Executive summary
The overarching theme of this dossier is to carefully document the very low value put on the lives of common Afghans by U.S. military and political elites ( along with their many handmaidens in the corporate media ) .
Highlights include : Exposing three common subterfuges used to rationalize the killing of Afghan civilians ;
Pointing out that Afghan civilians killed by U.S/ NATO forces � direct action since January 1 , 2006 now outnumber those who perished in the original U.S. bombing and invasion during the first three months ( 2001 ) of the U.S. Afghan war .
The overall human toll is far greater than just those killed by direct U.S/ NATO actions as it includes all those who died later from injuries , the internally displaced who died in camps , etc . ;
Documenting that close air support ( CAS ) bombing is more deadly to Afghan civilians than was the strategic bombing of Laos and Cambodia ;
Revealing that CAS air strikes now account for about 80 % of all Afghan civilians who perish at the hands of the U.S. and NATO ;
Emphasizing that by relying upon aerial close air support ( CAS ) attacks , US / NATO forces spare their pilots and ground troops but kill lots of innocent Afghan civilians .
Air strikes are 4 - 10 times as deadly for Afghan civilians as are ground attacks .
Revealing that Human Rights Watch " counts " at best only 50 % of the Afghan civilians killed by U.S/ NATO actions , whereas the figure for the Associated Press is a mere 33 % ; moreover neither present verifiable / reproducible disaggregated data thereby violating a basic tenet of social science ;
Presenting a unique analysis of compensation / condolence payments made by the United States in eight countries .
The United States spent ten times more on saving an Alaskan sea otter after the Exxon Valdez oil spill than in condolence payments to Afghan families for a family member killed by U.S. occupation forces .
These seven points form part of an interconnected whole � the undervaluation of Afghan lives � supported by many other indicators , e.g. only one dollar is officially spent in " reconstruction " for every ten dollars spent on achieving U.S. geo-political aims .
Senator Obama has staked out a political position by claiming that he will increase U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan by at least one - third , will permit U.S/ NATO forces to engage in hot pursuit into Pakistan�s tribal areas and increase U.S. bombing and Special Operations Forces raids into Pakistan .
Caesar - like he proclaims that Afghanistan is a " war on terror " we must and can win .
He appears to be completely ignorant that Pashtun nationalism ( Taliban ) and Al Qaeda jihad are two very different things [ 1 ] .
In effect , Obama proposes to continue and escalate military policies of the Bush administration if he can draw down U.S. occupation forces in Iraq .
I have argued that these actions are doomed to fail on their own terms , will cement a deadly alliance between Taliban and radical Islamists , and will further destabilize a nuclear Pakistan [ 2 ] .
And whom did Mr. Obama visit on his very first day in Afghanistan in July 2008 ?
He met none other than Gul Agha Sherzai , favorite of George Bush�s General Dan ' Bomber � McNeill and notorious ex-governor / warlord of Kandahar infamous for his cruelty , trafficking in drugs , corruption , and pederasty with young boys [ 3 ] .
On the following day , he spent time with U.S. occupation forces and the " mayor of Kabul " who was in his Kabul fortress ( and not off mourning somewhere or on an international junket raising monies ) .
Mr. Obama fails to admit that recent U.S/ NATO aerial bombing has been extremely deadly to Afghan civilians , which when combined with the negligible value attached to an Afghan life reveals that U.S politicians and the military hold little interest in Afghanistan proper other than in a geo-political sense [ 4 ] .
U.S. priorities are further revealed by the more than ten - to - one ratio of military to reconstruction aid since 2002 .
The Senlis Council in its report contrasted military spending vs. development spending in Afghanistan during 2002 - 2006 ( Figure 1 ) .
Another source , a report released by ACBAR , an alliance of international aid agencies working in Afghanistan , echoes , While the U.S. military is currently spending $ 100 million a day in Afghanistan , aid spent by all donors since 2001 is on average less than a tenth of that � just $ 7 million a day . [ 5 ]
Figure 1 . Military vs. Development Aid ( Source : http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/Afghanistan_Five_Years_Later/chapter_05
)
In other words , what actually takes place in the realms of the economic and the social on - the - ground in Afghanistan is at best of marginal concern ; furthermore many point to the ineffectiveness of aid [ 6 ] .
I shall argue herein such marginal stress upon improving the everyday life of common Afghans is paralleled by a callous disregard for Afghan civilians in the carrying out of military operations ( especially close air support strikes ) and a paltry compensation ( when offered at all ) for innocent Afghans killed by U.S or NATO actions .
The Subterfuges Employed by the U.S/ NATO to Excuse Killing Innocent Afghan Civilians
When we assemble the different pieces of the media jigsaw puzzle , clear patterns emerge .
Western victims are presented as real , important people with names , families , hopes and dreams .
Iraqi and Afghan victims of British and American violence are anonymous , nameless .
They are depicted as distant shadowy figures without personalities , feelings or families .
The result is that Westerners are consistently humanized , while non-Westerners are portrayed as lesser versions of humanity ( from " Militants and Mistakes , " Media Lens ( July 22 , 2008 ) ) .
While Afghans killed by US / NATO forces are completely invisible as human beings in the U.S. mainstream media , contrast the efforts undertaken by the same media to give humanity to U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan , as for example in the Washington Post at http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/
A major aim of this report is to provide real figures on Afghan civilians killed by U.S/ NATO actions since 2006 , thereby undermining the common claim that such numbers cannot be gotten .
We often hear glib statement about the " fog of war " or " war is hell " or " we don�t do body counts . "
My numbers are admittedly under-estimates for reasons discussed herein ( an incomplete universe of recorded deaths , a propensity of the Pentagon and its Afghan client to label as militants what were civilians , the injured who later die from wounds , censorship by omission , etc ) .
Not counting or estimating plays into the hands of those who market the U.S. war in Afghanistan as a " clean " war , a " precision " war and the like .
The latter is routinely trotted out by the apologists of aerial bombing ; " It �s sort of the immaculate conception to warfare , " was how Professor of Strategy , Col. ( ret. U.S Marine ) Mackubin Owens at the U.S. Naval War College ( Newport , R.I. ) described the U.S military campaign in Afghanistan in November 2001 .
The acknowledging and counting of civilian deaths in modern wars has long been a highly politicized matter .
One need only recall that it took close to sixty years for the civilian carnage caused in Germany by Allied bombing ( 1940 - 1945 ) to be openly written about .
[ 7 ]
It took over fifty years for the slaughter of innocent Korean civilians in the Korean War by U.S. warplanes to make the pages of mainstream American media [ 8 ] .
More recently , an acrimonious debate has raged over the scale of Iraqi civilian deaths since the U.S. invasion of March 2003 , for example pitting Iraq Body Count against the believers of estimates reported in the Lancet studies ( as at the Media Lens website ) [ 9 ] .
The liberal British scholar of peace studies , Paul Rogers , wrote in a recent article about Afghanistan � the impulses of sympathy with these radical forces ( Taliban militias , Al Qaeda forces ) are fuelled by the detailed reporting by al - Jazeera and other media outlets of the many civilian victims of western air - strikes and other calamities in Afghanistan .
This ensures that Muslims across the rest of the world are becoming as aware of what is happening in Afghanistan as they have been regarding Iraq since 2003 [ 10 ] .
A reader in the post - 9/11 world might conclude that since reporting of " the many civilian victims of western air strikes " fuels the Muslim resistance , the next step is to ignore , disparage or silence such detailed reporting ( which is of course precisely what the U.S. Government has been doing ) .
Sadly , we have come to live in a post - 9/11 culture where silencing the messenger is acceptable .
One recalls the U.S. bombing of the Al Jazeera office in Kabul on November 12 , 2001 .
For the Pentagon and its many media boosters , there are good bodies ( civilians killed by " our enemy " ) and bad bodies ( civilians killed by " our " militaries ) , respectively in the western mainstream labeled accidental collateral damage and ( Afghan civilians transformed by the click on a keyboard into ) " militants " or " insurgents . "
During the Yugoslav conflict , Human Rights
Watch highlighted civilians killed by Serbs while neglecting civilians killed by non-Serbs [ 11 ] .
Today in Afghanistan , the U.S. mainstream media led by the Associated Press describes in detail the civilian victims of " Taliban " suicide attacks often even providing photographs while remaining far more circumspect about the victims of US / NATO air strikes and never printing photographs [ 12 ] .
Counting dead civilians remains a highly politicized exercise .
Two main subterfuges have been used by the U.S and NATO militaries , the compliant corporate media and organizations like Human Rights Watch to excuse the killing and wounding of innocent Afghan civilians .
The first is to express self - righteous anger over " them " killing civilians intentionally whereas " we " never intentionally target civilians .
The second is to assert that the dastardly Taliban and their Muslim or Arab associates employ civilians as human shields .
A third means examined elsewhere [ 13 ] has been to simply suppress whenever possible written reports and especially photos of the victims of U.S/ NATO military actions ( " bad " bodies ) in Afghanistan , all the while amply publishing stories and photos of Afghan civilians killed by IED�s or suicide bombers ( " good " bodies ) .
Photos of civilians whose death was caused by U.S. or NATO bombs are virtually non-existent [ 14 ] .
One might call this censorship by omission [ 15 ] .
News - magazine photo coverage of the " war on terrorism " in Afghanistan most often supports U.S. government narrative and versions of events [ 16 ] .
The policy of embedding reporters with U.S. or NATO occupation forces is an obvious attempt at removing independent reporting which , sadly , most often succeeds .
Figure 2 .
An Afghan woman holds a photo of her family members who were killed on August 22 , 2008 , in a U.S. air raid called - in by U.S. Special Forces .
The U.S. military for weeks denied civilians had been killed ( photo by Mohammad Shoaib of Reuters ) U.S human rights lawyers charged on July 20 , 2008 , that US military prisons are " legal black holes " and that force is employed to " shut people up " about activities in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Many people in Afghanistan and in Iraq who have been targeted for detention are local journalists covering the conflict in their own country , " said another prominent US human rights lawyer , Barbara J. Olshansky .
" When the United States detains reporters , photographers , camera operators and holds them for long period without charge for any offence and without trials and without any evidence , we know that part of the goal is to just shut people up , " she said . [ 17 ]
The mainstream U.S. corporate media led by Fox News largely has sought to present the Afghan invasion as a simple war of good versus evil [ 18 ] .
Texts or images which might have raised questions have been censored .
Fox News has gone far beyond - the - call - of - duty in parroting U.S. military interpretations [ 19 ] but others in the U.S. corporate media have followed suit , e.g. , Laura King of the Associated Press has been a notorious under-counter of Afghan civilian deaths [ 20 ] .
A new twist in Pentagon / NATO news management has recently been introduced .
As of August 2008 , the U.S. Air Force no longer releases daily reports about missions over Afghanistan .
On the British side , Britain is funding a surge in spin doctors in Afghanistan to construct and present pro-NATO / US media reports [ 21 ] .
The intentionality argument is often couched in the language of justifiable collateral damage , regrettable but necessary .
Since the killing was collateral , it can not be intentional goes the story .
The overarching problem is the criminal nature of the offensive war first waged by the United States and Britain upon an entire sovereign country after 9/11 .
The collective group of " Afghans " has de facto been targeted for seven years as lives and countryside have been laid to waste ; anyone who opposes the U.S / NATO occupation is by definition an " enemy " and can be justifiably killed collaterally .
As pointed out by others , " [ we ] can�t possibly judge the morality of collateral damage while leaving out the question of the war itself � it is the immorality and illegality of a war that makes collateral damage a crime . " [ 22 ]
Least - cost considerations ( in terms of U.S. military deaths and U.S. dollars ) by the US and NATO militaries have directly translated into thousands of Afghan civilian casualties .
How ?
During the initial phases of the U.S. bombing campaign but still today , U.S. warplanes dropped powerful bombs in civilian - rich areas with little concern for Afghan civilians .
In effect , I am turning Michael Walzer 's notion of ' due care ' [ 23 ] upside down : that is , far from acknowledging a positive responsibility to protect innocent Afghans from the misery of war , U.S military strategists chose to impose levels of harm upon innocent Afghan civilians in order to reduce present and possible future dangers faced by U.S forces .
As I wrote in late 2001 , The absolute need to avoid U.S. military casualties means fling high up in the sky , increasing the probability of killing civilians : " ��.. better stand clear and fire away .
Given this implicit decision , the slaughter of innocent people , as a statistical eventuality is not an accident but a priority -- in which Afghan civilian casualties are substituted for American military casualties . " [ 24 ]
But , I believe the argument goes deeper and that race enters the calculation .
The sacrificed Afghan civilians are not ' white ' whereas the overwhelming number of U.S. pilots and elite ground troops are white .
This ' reality ' serves to amplify the positive benefit - cost ratio of certainly sacrificing darker Afghans today [ and Indochinese , Panamanians and Iraqis ] for the benefit of probably saving American soldier - citizens tomorrow .
What I am saying is that when the " other " is non-white , the scale of violence used by the U.S. government to achieve its stated objectives at minimum cost knows no limits .
A contrary case might be raised with Serbia which was also subjected to mass bombing in 1999 .
But , the Serbs were in the view of U.S. policymakers and the corporate media tainted [ ' darkened ' ] by their prior ' Communist ' experience .
No instance exists [ except during World War II ] where a foreign Caucasian state became the war target of the U.S. government [ 25 ] .
The closest example might be that of the war waged by Britain upon Northern Ireland and , there , the British troops applied focused violence upon its Caucasian ' enemy . '
When the " other " is a non-white foreigner , the state violence employed becomes amplified [ 26 ] .
Today , the aerial bombing in Afghanistan is more related to close air support called - in by ground forces as a means to defeat the enemy without having to fight him on the ground and likely suffer casualties .
Both high - level bombing and midnight attack ground attacks served to shift the burden of casualties upon Afghan civilians .
The doctrine that `war is hell ' seeks to transfer any responsibility for the cruelty of war to the enemy [ 27 ] .
The U.S/ NATO war managers and their handmaidens in the defense and corporate media establishments dredge out the tired old " intent " argument .
As Edward Herman noted , �it is claimed by the war managers that these deaths and injuries are not deliberate , but are only " collateral " to another end , they are treated by the mainstream media , NGOs , new humanitarians , and others as a lesser evil than cases where civilians are openly targeted .
But this differential treatment is a fraud , even if we accept the sometimes disputable claim of inadvertence ( occasionally even acknowledged by officials to be false , as described below ) .
Even if not the explicit target , if collateral civilian deaths are highly probable and statistically predictable they are clearly acceptable and intentional .
If in 500 raids on Afghan villages alleged to harbor al Qaeda cadres it is likely that civilians will die in 450 of them , those deaths are an integral component of the plan and the clear responsibility of the planners and executioners .
As law professor Michael Tonry has said , " In the criminal law , purpose and knowledge are equally culpable states of mind . " [ 28 ]
What also needs to be made very clear is that Afghan civilian casualties are not accidents or mistakes .
They result from careful calculation by U.S. commanders and military attorneys who decide upon the benefits of an air strike versus the costs in innocent civilian lives lost .
These are calculated predicted deaths [ 29 ] .
Aerial bombing in the name of liberating Afghans will continue with little regard for Afghan civilians who for the Western politico - military elites remain simply invisible in the empty space which is an " increasingly aerially occupied Afghanistan " [ 30 ] .
The compliant mainstream media perpetuates the myth by serving as stenographer of the Pentagon�s virtual reality .
Patrick Coburn of The Independent got it dead - on , The reaction of the Pentagon to the killing of large numbers of civilians in Afghanistan , Iraq and now Pakistan has traditionally been first to deny that it ever happened .
The denial is based on the old public relations principle that " first you say something is no news and did n't happen .
When it is proved some time later , that it did happen , you yawn and say it is old news . " [ 31 ]
When details of Afghan civilian deaths finally leak through the US / NATO news management efforts , a Lt. Colonel at the Bagram Air Base offers " sincere regrets " or the promise of an investigation and by tomorrow all is forgotten .
They are , after all , just Afghans " we " killed .
Theirs are bad bodies , not good bodies like those on " our " side that were killed .
A myth has circulated since the beginning of the U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan in October 2001 .
The myth is endlessly repeated by the U.S. occupation forces , corporate media , the Pentagon , defense intellectual pundits , Human Rights Watch , the Cruise Missile Left , the humanitarian interventionists , and even some in the United Nations : Afghan insurgents hide amongst civilians whom they use as human shields [ 32 ] .
To begin with , the assertion is never empirically documented but just merely stated as a self - evident truth .
Secondly , the implication is that an insurgent or Taliban fighter , resisting the U.S. / NATO invasion should stand alone on a mountain ridge , his AK - 47 raised to the sky , and engage in a " fair " act of war with an Apache attack helicopter or A - 10 Warthog and see who prevails .
Should resistance fighters stand out in an open field or on a mountain ridge ?
Thirdly , what is conveniently omitted is that the insurgents often live in the area , have friends and families in the communities , and that such a local support base is precisely what gives a guerrilla insurgency ( along with knowledge of the local terrain ) its classic advantage [ 33 ] .
Such local connection means that the insurgents will ( unlike the US / NATO occupation forces ) go to great lengths to not put local people in danger .
Purveyors of the line about the " Taliban 's execrable tactic of using civilians as human shields " [ 34 ] are either themselves unaware of classic guerrilla strategy or , more likely , seek to manipulate the general public�s ignorance about the same .
Using the language of guerrilla warfare , can a " fish " swim outside of the " sea " ?
One recalls the U.S. military�s campaign in Vietnam to drain the sea by creating strategic hamlets ( translate , concentration camps ) , seeking to deny the Vietnamese resistance access to sympathetic villagers .
Rather than the " hiding among civilians " story , what is happening is that civilians figure prominently in the vast numbers of " militants " or " insurgents " reported killed in US / NATO bombing , as I have documented countless times in the Afghan Victim Memorial Project .
The latest egregious example involves the slaughter of over 90 Afghan civilians in Azizabad where for weeks the U.S. military asserted that 30 " Taliban " had been killed and no civilians .
In other words , civilians killed by US / NATO action are being falsely labeled by the US / NATO as " eliminated militants , " which suggests that my overall count of civilians killed is a gross underestimate .
In addition , no doubt many cases where civilians have been killed by US / NATO action simply are not reported ( censorship by omission ) .
But no matter , for as Robert Higgs underscores is � the complete insouciance with which the American public greets reports of deaths by drones .
I do not exaggerate if I say that the general reaction is " ho - hum . "
Well , the average American says , that disposes nicely of another " bad guy . "
The gratuitous murder of the bad guy�s family members , neighbors , and other innocent persons in the vicinity appears to create no blip on the average American�s moral radar screen .
Perhaps Americans do not consider Yemenis , Afghanis , and Pakistanis to be real human beings whose right to life we are obliged to respect ? [ 35 ]
The Magnitude of Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan " Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it " - George Santayana ( 1905 ) The U/S. and U.K. corporate media have been particularly guilty of censorship by omission � simply not reporting upon the " bad bodies " of those killed by US / NATO actions [ 36 ] .
A little reported fact is that the number of Afghan civilians [ 37 ] killed by U/.S. and NATO forces since 2005 exceeds the total recorded during the three months of intensive U.S. bombing , October 7 - December 10 , 2001 .
The following chart presents the numbers .
These numbers underestimate the true human toll because they exclude the thousands who later die from injuries incurred in a U.S/ NATO attack , those killed in incidents which went un-reported , those who die from lack of vital resources in refugee camps [ 38 ] , etc. Killed October 7 � December 10 , 2001 2,256 - 2,949 2005 408 - 478 2006 653 - 769 2007 1,010 -� 1,297 Jan. 1 � August 31 , 2008 573 - 674 Sept. 1 - 19 , 2008 55 Sub-total 2005 - 2008 2,699 - 3,273
The nature of the air war in Afghanistan has changed substantially between 2001 and 2006 - 8 .
During the last three months of 2001 , the U.S bombing was part of a traditional military campaign pitting two armies against each other .
As such , the bombing involved large tonnages being dropped ; whereas during 2006 - 8 , the U.S and NATO bombing involved close air support ( CAS ) against a decentralized , highly fluid guerrilla resistance .
During the former campaign some 14,000 tons of bombs were dropped or almost twelve times the tonnage dropped during the two - and - a - half years ( 2006 � mid 2008 ) .
Of course , the killing of innocent civilians by U.S. bombing has a long history spanning the twentieth century .
For example , after 58 years recently released classified documents tell the story of how 93 napalm canisters were dropped on the little island of Wolmi , South Korea , in September 1950 , incinerating over a hundred residents [ 39 ] .
Estimates or counts of civilian deaths caused by the U.S. bombing during 2001 - mid 2002 reveal similar numbers .
The count by Herold ( 2002 ) relies upon media and NGO reports as well as other written materials and the universe estimation by Benini and Moulton employing statistical analysis report 3,600 - 3,900 Afghan civilian deaths .
The Benini & Moulton study calculates civilian deaths from bombing , landmines , unexploded ordnance strikes , from non-Western ground forces and should hence significantly exceed a count focused upon deaths directly caused by U.S. aerial bombing or ground attacks [ 40 ] .
The Benini & Moulton study based upon canvassing 600 communities covers September 12 , 2001 � June 20 , 2002 , whereas Herold covers October 7 , 2001 � July 31 , 2002 .
Field staff visited all 600 communities directly affected by fighting ( both air strikes and ground combat ) .
Benini & Moulton calculate 3,994 civilians died from air and artillery bombardments , shooting , and other violence [ 41 ] .
In other words , the Herold count of 3,620 civilians killed by U.S. air and ground attacks is close to the population - based estimate of Benini & Moulton .
Whereas the numbers of civilian casualties resulting from the intense bombing of 2001 has been determined , it remains a far more difficult exercise to estimate the magnitude of civilians who perished from the CAS bombing of recent years .
Two major problems exist : unlike in the earlier period , civilians have died at the hands of U.S. and NATO ground fire and aircraft strafing raids ( especially by the AC - 130 gunship , Apache attack helicopters , Predator drones and the A - 10 CAS jet fighter ) ; and secondly , data provided by U.S. and NATO does not exist making possible an incident - by - incident reconstruction of bombing versus strafing .
What can , however , be derived are figures which represent orders of magnitudes under different assumptions ( Table 4 ) .
Today , the U.S. operates over 90 percent of all strike aircraft in Afghanistan .
Such reconstruction reveals that U.S close air support bombing has been far more deadly for innocent Afghan civilians than the earlier more intense , traditional bombing campaign of 2001 .
The following Table 1 presents a unique summary of the aerial bombing ( not strafing ) in Afghanistan during 2006 - mid 2008 , employing data in the Afghan Victim Memorial Project data base [ 42 ] .
We know that aerial close air support bombing during 2007 and 2008 took on increasing importance , implying that the relative share of all civilians killed by bombing attacks has probably been rising .
Already during 2005 , the U.S. military began increasing air strikes to 157 from 86 during 2004 [ 43 ] .
The number of CAS strikes in Afghanistan in which munitions were dropped soared from 176 in 2005 , to 1,770 in 2006 , and 2,926 in 2007 .
Elizabeth Rubin noted " that the sheer tonnage of metal raining down on Afghanistan was mind - boggling : a million pounds between January and September of 2007 , compared with half a million in all of 2006 . " [ 45 ]
US Air Force B1 - B�s renewed the bombing of Afghanistan on May 6 , 2006 [ 46 ] .
U.S. General Dan " Bomber " McNeill performed up to expectations [ 47 ] .
The total dropped for 2005 was a mere 60,000 pounds ( or 27.2 metric tons ) .
During the first half of 2008 , more tonnage was dropped than in all of 2007 [ 48 ] .
The rise in CAS strikes paralleled almost perfectly the number of roadside bombings which numbered 1,931 in 2006 and 2,615 in 2007 [ 49 ] .
Tit for tat .
In effect , the US / NATO forces are relying upon air power in lieu of ground forces and in so doing causing high levels of civilian casualties which , in turn , push locals towards the resistance [ 50 ] .
This is particularly important in Afghanistan where the culture of revenge has long stalked Americans there [ 51 ] .
U.S/NATO aerial attacks turn friends into enemies [ 52 ] .
This aspect was emphasized at a 2007 meeting at of the United States Institute of Peace [ 53 ] .
Such is simply part of the age - old wisdom that aerial bombing does not induce surrender , quite to the contrary .
Nothing has changed since the U.S. bombing of Takeo , Cambodia , in 1972 , as described by a villager �based on my experiences during the bombing in Takeo around 1972 .
The bombings were [ spreading ] further into towns and villages .
My parents ' house was hit by the bombs , and we had to move to the opposite side of the country .
We had known [ that ] almost the entire village that survived from the bombings had joined forces with the Khmer Rouge [ 54 ] .
The U.S. Army�s counterinsurgency manual FM 3 - 24 admits that aerial bombing " can cause collateral damage that turns people against the host - nation government and provides insurgents with a major propaganda victory . "
Wing Commander Andrew Brookes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London noted Even a 400 - pound bomb has ca wide area of blast and you are quite likely to kill some civilians .
Kill a wife , children , mother , or uncle and people become so angry the terrorist cycle starts all over again [ 55 ] .
In addition , bombing destroys homes , orchards , livestock , etc. which fuels the ire of the bombed .
After the very high level of civilians killed by U.S. and NATO forces during 2007 � some 1,010 - 1,297 as I report in Table 1 � the rules of engagement were allegedly tightened in recognition that civilian casualties undermine support for the US / NATO occupation [ 56 ] .
On the other hand , the advent of indisputably greater bombing precision by for example the use of ROVER [ 57 ] technology has encouraged dropping more bombs � in other words , the overall killing of civilian depends upon the trade - off between greater precision of a bomb and the extent to which more bombs are being dropped , in other words it depends upon the risk elasticity of bombing tolerance .
Dead civilians are not mistakes .
In my original Dossier , I argued that the primary cause of high levels of Afghan civilian casualties was due to U.S. bombing of civilian - rich areas [ 58 ] .
A further complicating element is that precision strike weapons create a myth of infallibility , when the weapons are at best only as good as the targeting data and absence of adverse disruptive influences [ 59 ] .
This myth served to allegedly remove the public�s general sense of barbarity associated with aerial bombing .
Naturally a whole new language of war was crafted by the military - industrial - media complex to oil this transition : surgical , collateral , precision , etc . [ 60 ]
Some enthusiasts even spoke of a " new kind of war " [ 61 ] with smaller bombs [ 62 ] though at least for civilians the deadliness of old wars continued .

In Iraq during 2007 , only 1,447 bombs were dropped .
Another source reported that by May 15 , 2007 , the number of weapons dropped on Afghanistan was 929 ( http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,138201,00.html ) . ^number of close air support strikes in which munitions were dropped ^^ From Cloud ( 2006 ) , op .
cit. reported that by mid-November 2006 , American aircraft had dropped 987 bombs and fired more than 146,000 cannon rounds and bullets in strafing runs .
During the entire period 2001 thgrough 2004 , a total of 848 bombs and just over 119,000 bullets were used by aircraft according to U.S. Air Force data .
*^
My figures for 2008 are supported by the Afghan government , rights and aid groups which say that over 300 civilians have died this year from Western operations , mostly when air power is called in to get allied troops out of trouble ( from Mark John , " Analysis : Western Forces Hooked on Air Power in Afghan War , " Reuters ( July 5 , 2008 at 14:31 GMT ) at http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L05811864.htm
**^ during 2006 , the U.S. Air Force dropped 575,500 pounds of bombs ( Benjamin , 2007 , op. cit. ) , or 261 metric tons .
**^^ During 2007 , coalition forces dropped about a million pounds of bombs in Afghanistan , which would amount to 454 metric tons .
This figure is erroneously reported as being for the entire 2007 when it covered only Jan-Sept ..
I have hence adjusted the total to 1,25 mn pounds or 567 metric tons .
Benjamin ( 2007 ) said that the U.S. Air Force alone dropped 527,860 pounds of bombs on Afghanistan during the first six months of 2007 . ++
I have derived this number as follows .
The most popular USAF bombs are the 500 and 200 - pound GPS guided JDAMs and the 500 - pound laser - guided bomb .
Assuming each amounts to one - third of all bombs dropped ( numbering 1,853 according to Rolfson ( 2008 ) .
The lethality of war can be assessed using different criteria .
For example , during 2008 to - date some 628- 729 Afghan civilians were killed by U.S/ NATO action .
During the same period of time , 120 U.S. troops and 104 NATO soldiers died .
For every occupation soldier killed , about three Afghan civilians are killed by the occupation forces ( for 2006 , the figure was 3 - 4 ) [ 63 ] .
A way to measure the lethality of aerial bombing is to compare the numbers of bombs dropped to the number of civilians killed .
Table 2 indicates that in terms of lethality to civilians , the Gulf War was lowest , followed by Kosovo , with the initial Afghan bombing campaigns being by far the deadliest for civilians notwithstanding the much greater use of " precision " weapon systems [ 64 ] .
Indeed , in 2001 it took only 4 - 5 bombs dropped to kill one Afghan civilian ; during the first half of 2008 , the figure was 9 - 10 bombs , though by July 2008 , an Afghan civilian was killed every 5 - 6 bombs dropped ( Table 3 ) .
Table 2 . Lethality of Aerial Bombing in Different Air Campaigns as Measured by Number of Bombs to Necessary Kill One Civilian Bombing Campaign ( 1 ) # bombs & missiles dropped ( 2 ) # civilians killed Bombs to kill one civilian , ( 1 ) / ( 2 ) = Iraq 1991 250,000 2,278 110 Kosovo 1999 23,000 1,200 19 Afghanistan 2001 12,000 ** 2,569-2,949 4.1-4.7 Afghanistan , first half of 2008 1,853 273-335* 5.5 - 6.8
* If we assume that two - thirds of the total number of civilians killed ( 273-335 ) during this period died from aerial attacks , the numbers would be 183 - 224 .
In Table 6 the number of civilians actually killed in air strikes is reported at 178-192 .
** figure from Global Security for October 7 � December 10 , 2001 which reported 12,000 bombs and missiles dropped during October7 � December 10 ; by March 2002 , the figure was 21,000 and by mid-September 2002 it was 24,000 .
When we focus just upon Afghanistan during the years 2006 until the present ( Table 3 ) , one finds that about every five bombs dropped one civilian died ( though the number was much higher during 2007 when the resistance engaged the US / NATO in open battles the US / NATO war planes dropped over 3,500 bombs ) .
Table 3 . Numbers of Bombs dropped to kill One Afghan Civilian , 2006 - present 2006 2007 First half 2008 June 2008 July 2008 # bombs dropped 1,000 3,572 1,853 646 515 # civilian deaths 653-769 1,008-1,295 273-335 49-69 134-157 50 % civilian deaths 326-385 67 % civilian deaths 675-868 182-224 33-46 actual 90-105 actual Bombs / civilians 2.6-3.1 4.1-5.3 8.3-10.2 14-19.5 4.9-5.7
Note : for 2006 , I have assumed that 50 % of civilian deaths were due to aerial bombing and firing missiles ; during the later time periods when the air war intensified , I assume that two - thirds of civilian deaths were the result of bombs and missiles dropped from the air .
For 2008 , the two - thirds ratio is an underestimate .
What is striking is that these past two - and - a - half years of close air support bombing have been more deadly for Afghan civilians than was the traditional bombing campaign of October 7 , 2001 � December 10 , 2001 , when 14,000 tons of bombs ( and 12,000 bombs & missiles ) were dropped by U.S war planes , which caused an estimated 2,569 - 2,949 civilian deaths .
The figure then for civilians killed per 10,000 tons bombs dropped was 1,835 � 2,106 .
The figures for 2006 - mid 2008 are 13,265-16,454 civilians killed per 10,000 tons dropped ( derived from Table 1 ) .
Lesser tonnage was dropped in recent years but that which fell from the skies was terribly deadly to Afghan civilians .
Predictably , we find that CAS strikes account for the following shares of actual total Afghan civilian deaths during 2008 : January - June 2008 : 61 % July 2008 : 82 % August 2008 : 89 % September 1 - 19 : 89 % [ 65 ]
As I have pointed out , the 2001 ratio ( of civilians killed per 10,000 tons of bombs dropped ) made the bombing of Afghanistan about as deadly for innocent civilians as the bombing of Laos and Cambodia , being the most lethal of all post - World War II bombing campaigns notwithstanding that the precision of aerial bombing has increased greatly [ 66 ] .
A typical incident amongst the hundreds where US / NATO military bombing action resulted in the deaths of Afghan civilians chronicled in my Afghan Victim Memorial Project took place in the village of Jabar , Kapisa Province on March 6 , 2007 .
U.S war planes dropped two 2,000 - pound bombs killing nine civilians including three children aged between six months and five years .
Here is how Col .
Tom Collins , NATO spokesman described these nine deaths
We didn�t know who was in that building , but we saw fighters move into that area who were legitimate targets .
The building was struck and , as we all know , unfortunately civilians were killed .
Yes , unfortunately all nine members from four generations of a single Afghan family .
Figure 3 .

A NATO air strike destroyed a mud - brick home , killing nine people from four generations of an Afghan family during a clash between Western troops and militants , Afghan officials and relatives said Monday ( Source : Musadeq Sadeq photo , A.P. )
A couple months later , as Ramzy Baroud wrote in His " Firepower Doesn�t Always Win Wars " :
The BBC�s Alastair Leithead reported on May 31 , " Afghans� Anger over US Bombing " merely details one of many such incidents in which scores of innocent civilians are killed ; such reports are ever more rare since they are simply not newsworthy � the worth of a news story from Afghanistan is measured by whether Coalition forces incurred causalities or not .
The recent killings in the village of Shindand in the Zerkoh Valley , Western Afghanistan was harrowing by any standards .
57 were reportedly killed by American bombardment ; half of the dead were women and children , according to Leithead ; the bombardment also destroyed 100 homes , humble dwellings that are unlikely to be rebuilt soon .
" The bombardments were going on day and night .
Those who tried to get out somewhere safe were being bombed .
They didn�t care if it was women , children or old men , " said one of the survivors .
But who would believe Mohammad Zarif Achakzai , who fled his mud house with his family under the relentless bombardment ?
Brig Gen Joseph Votel has simply dismissed the reports of civilian causalities .
" We have no reports that confirm to us that non-combatants were injured or killed out in Shindand , " he said .
And that is that [ 67 ] .
The luckier ones are only wounded by the CAS bombing .

Crawling wounded from the wreckage of his home , Mr Lalai discovered that his grandfather , grandmother , wife , father , three brothers and four sisters had died in the bombing .
The youngest victim was 8 , the oldest 80 .
Only Mr Lalai�s mother and two sons , aged 5 and 3 , survived .
Both boys were wounded .
Yet the forces that wiped out his family were not British , nor those of any other Nato unit .
The airstrikes were called in by American Special Forces operating with their own rules of engagement on a mission totally devolved from Nato command in Afghanistan .
At least 21 Afghan civilians died in the bombing of Gurmaw [ 68 ] .
Carlotta
Gall reported that the toll according to local residents was much higher involving 56 - 80 civilians in three houses [ 69 ] .
When Lal Zareen , the groom�s father , reached the scene of the U.S. terror bombing of a wedding procession ( the traditional Afghan " wara " made up of mostly women and children ) near the village of Khetai on July 6 , 2008 , he recounted I saw pieces of bodies scattered around .
I couldn�t even make out which part was which .
It was just flesh everywhere [ 70 ] .
Fifty - two members of the double wedding party were dead , including the two brides , both aged 18 [ 71 ] .

And what has been the reaction by the U.S. military to such Afghan civilian casualties ?
The United Nations ?
By the Associated Press ?
By Human Rights Watch ?
By so - called defense intellectuals like William M. Arkin ?
When the U.N. announced in late June 2008 that the number of civilians killed in fighting during the first half of 2008 amounted to 698 � 255 killed by foreign or Afghan troops and 422 by " militants " ( with the cause of death of 21 undetermined ) , the U.S. military�s spokesperson in Kabul stated " those numbers were far , far higher than we would recognize . " [ 72 ]
The U.S/ NATO responses involve first denial and then shifting the blame by using the human shields argument .
More recently , the U.S. military complains about the Taliban�s mastery in manipulating media [ 73 ] .
The Afghan resistance is alleged to fabricate stories about US / NATO bombing attacks which it feeds to either sympathetic or naïve journalists .
These stories then are stated to drive a wedge between foreign forces and the Afghan regime , leading to " more investigations and crippling operational restraints . "
As I have written about elsewhere , it is the U.S. military which has developed a program to manipulate gullible western media and publics [ 74 ] .
The issue is much less that of the sophistication of the Taliban in regards to media , but rather the blatant lying by the Pentagon and NATO spokespersons .
Moreover , to presume that independent Afghan media and / or wire service stringers will automatically publish Taliban accounts is insulting .
The reporting of the independent Pajhwok Afghan News is widely praised .
Zubair Babakarkhail of Pajhwok Afghan News has said that he does not feel that the information provided by the military is any more credible , " The Taliban makes claims , and the other side also makes claims .
We don�t believe either of them . " [ 75 ]
In 2007 , a pro-military website , Strategy Page , proclaimed that the ~ 1,700 bombs dropped by the U.S Air Force during 2006 had killed " some 3,000 Taliban fighters " and because of smart missiles and bombs fewer than a hundred Afghan civilians had perished [ 76 ] .
In truth , 303-360 Afghan civilians had perished in 2006 at the hands of the U.S and NATO ( Table 1 ) .
Neither the United Nations nor the Associated Press ( A.P. ) ever presents disaggregated data .
We are asked to believe summary figures based upon faith .
Such analysis violates a basic tenet of serious research , naming being able to reproduce the research results .
The U.N. and A.P. numbers cannot and should not be treated seriously .
My research available at the Afghan Victim Memorial Project website indicates that during the first eight months of 2008 , 573-674 Afghan civilians were killed just by U.S. and NATO actions .
The response of defense intellectual and consultant to the U.S. Air Force , William M. Arkin , is even less satisfactory [ 77 ] .
Arkin and his cohorts had the gall to assert that civilian casualties during the first three months of the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan totaled 100-350 [ 78 ] .
On October 21 , 2001 , William M. Arkin , frequent contributor on military affairs to major U.S. daily newspapers and faculty member at a U.S. military university , re-assured the American public that the U.S. bombing campaign of Afghanistan would generate few civilian casualties because of it being " as ' targeted ' as anyone can reasonably expect . " [ 79 ]
Arkin went on , ... U.S. analysts evaluate location and the blast radius of the intended weapon before the target can be approved .
In other words , avoidance of civilian casualties has become institutionalized even to the point of rejecting important targets if there is a high probability of civilian harm .
And this is not the Clinton administration .
The scene in the towns and fields of Afghanistan belied the good professor pundit .
Between 35 - 55 innocent Afghans succumbed to U.S. bombs and missiles on that Sunday .
The victims spanned five provinces in five U.S. bombing attacks : 9-18 died in the bombing of the Parod Gajaded neighborhood of Khair Khana in Kabul ;
a seven year - old girl died in the Macroyan housing project in Kabul ;
21 -32 civilians died in the bombing of a neighborhood in Tarin Kot and as they tried to flee on a farm tractor in a widely reported attack ;
3 died in Kandahar city when a U.S. jet targeted six Taliban tanks hidden under a tree and missed , upending trees and killing three persons on the nearby road ;
Sardar Mohammed , 20 , died from a fractured skull in the village of Shakar Dara , located in the Kohesafie district , 40 kms. north of Kabul .
Arkin informs us that he spent time in early 2007 as a National Security and Human Rights Fellow at the Carr Institute for Human Rights at Harvard University studying whether " there ( is ) a shred of evidence that airpower is either responsible for civilian deaths or is deadlier than ground operation ? "
And what did Arkin discover while researching at Harvard ?
First , that civilian deaths are " collateral " to a legitimate military mission insofar as the said military unit " takes all necessary precautions to avoid civilian harm and has ' no intention � in killing civilians , the deaths are an unfortunate part of war � especially this war , because the enemy hides behind and preys upon the civilian element . "
He falls back upon the same old intentionality and human shields arguments .
Secondly , Arkin adds that the alleged visibility of air power with its bombs dropped can be counted and hence results in distinct reporting about civilian deaths , leading many to falsely conclude that air power is more deadly for civilians than ground combat .
In fact , Arkin gets it exactly backwards as I will later demonstrate .
Simon Jenkins pointed out that massacres committed by infantrymen are subject to courts marital .
He wrote , " If soldiers enter a house by the front door and kill civilians inside , then they are hauled before world opinion and condemned .
If a dropped bomb enters the same house through the roof and has the same effect , it is dismissed as collateral damage . " [ 80 ]
Lastly , presumably after some months at Harvard , Arkin concluded " we do not have enough reliable data even to gauge the level of civilian deaths ( at U.S. hands , moreover ) , let alone the " responsible party within the U.S. military . "
In other words , the Harvard Fellow dismisses outright numbers and accounts compiled by the United Nations in Kabul , the Associated Press and myself .
For its part , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) occasionally issues summary figures on Afghan civilian deaths .
For example , in a report devoted primarily to the human costs of " insurgent attacks , " HRW�s Mark Garlasco asserted in passing that during 2006 , 929 Afghan civilians had died � 116 in air bombardments , 114 from foreign and Afghan ground forces and 699 at the hands of the Taliban [ 81 ] .
In a later communication , HRW reiterated that during 2006 , " insurgents " had killed 699 civilians and foreign forces 300 [ 82 ] .
In other words , HRW admits US and Afghan forces killed 230-300 civilians .
The entries in my Afghan Victim Memorial Project data base for 2006 list 653-769 civilians who perished just at the hands of the U.S. and NATO alone .
Human Rights
Watch has an established record of complicity in America�s Afghan war [ 83 ] .
As regards 2007 , Garlasco stated that 434 Afghan civilians died at the hands of NATO or the U.S. [ 84 ] , while my data indicates the number is 1,008 - 1,295 .
HRW is continuing its long - standing tradition of presenting one - third of the truth as the whole truth , going back to the Kosovo bombing campaign where Arkin in the employ then of HRW proclaimed some 500 civilians had been killed by the NATO bombing whereas other independent sources cited figures of 1,200 - 1,500 [ 85 ] .
HRW apparently believes that air strikes had killed 119 civilians ( to which another 54 died from fighting on the ground ) during 2008 until July 1st , again precisely one - third of the truth [ 86 ] .
Garlasco asserts ( no disaggregated data provided ) that since 2006 , 837 innocent Afghans were killed by NATO / US - led operations ( of which 556 by US air strikes ) when my data ( Table 3 ) documents the figures are 1,934-2,399 .
Moreover , HRW is at pains to regurgitate the old intentionality canard , underscoring that " there is no evidence suggesting that coalition or NATO forces have intentionally directed attacks against civilians . "
At the very time when U.S. CAS strikes in Afghanistan during July 1 - 18 , 2008 had killed an estimated 111 - 131 civilians , Marc Garlasco had the temerity to announce , " in their deliberate targeting , the air force has all but eliminated civilian casualties in Afghanistan , " though admitting in immediate targeting precautionary rules are less adhered to [ 87 ] .
The Associated Press fairly regularly has published summary data on Afghan civilian casualties , though never reveals disaggregated figures which might allow fact - checking .
We are simple asked to believe .
As I have argued time - and - again , for the A.P. truth about civilian casualties comes only through an American lens [ 88 ] .
The A.P. uses figures provided primarily by U.S. , NATO and Afghan sources , thereby displaying a bias as severe as were one to rely upon only Taliban data .
The A.P. published figures for the fist ten months of 2007 : US / NATO and Afghan militaries killed 337 Afghan civilians whereas the " militants " killed 346 .
These numbers are about one - third of the true count for 2007 [ 89 ] .
Curiously , once again a pattern is here at play : in 2002 , the AP�s Laura King announced that the U.S. bombing campaign during 2001 had led to the deaths of some 600 - 700 innocent Afghan civilians ; my report indicated the figure was closer to 3,100 [ 90 ] ( revised downwards now to 2,569-2,949 ) [ 91 ] .
In 2006 , the A.P. reporter Jason Straziuoso , a good friend and faithful stenographer of the U.S. military version of events , updated the A.P. count saying that since February 2002 until May 2006 , the A.P. count " based upon figures from Afghan officials , the coalition and witnesses shows at least 180 civilians have died during coalition military action . "
Yes , at least 180 !
Accounts in my data bases indicate that during December 11 , 2001 � December 31 , 2005 , Afghan civilian deaths at the hands of US / NATO forces were 1,349 -1,589 .
On August 8 , 2008 , Strasziuso proclaimed that during January through July according to A.P. figures compiled from coalition and Afghan officials 128 Afghan civilians had been killed by U.S. or NATO forces [ 92 ] .
He claims half the figure put out by the United Nations .
Karen DeYoung of the Washington Post , who uncritically cites HRW figures , put the figure killed by air strikes alone at more than 200 for the first eight months of 2008 [ 93 ] .
My data for the same period show 444-475 .
The United Nations released aggregate figures for the first six months of 2007 and 2008 ( Table 4 ) , as well as for eight months of 2008 .
The latter numbers are very close to my own for the first 8 months of 2008 .
U.N. figures are : Civilians killed by international and Afghan forces��� 577 ( 2007 : 477 )
Civilians killed just by air strikes ����������.�. ~ 400 ( 2007 : n.a. )
Civilians killed by Taliban and associates �������~ 800 ( 2007 : 462 )
Civilians who died unaccounted for��������� �68 [ 94 ] ( 2007 : 101 ) My totals reconstructed from disaggregated on the Afghan Victim Memorial Project website data shows that for the first eight months are : killed by USNATO action @ 573-674 ( mid point at 624 ) and by air strikes alone @ 444-475 ( mid point at 460 ) ( Table 5 ) .
The U.N. did not say how its human rights monitors collected statistics on civilian deaths , or discuss its sources of information or their reliability .
The following Table 4 summarizes available aggregate statistics on Afghan civilian deaths for the period 2006 � mid 2008 [ 95 ] .

Reuters ( June 11 , 2008 ) reported that more than 520 civilians were killed during 2007 by foreign forces alone according to Afghan rights groups .
The UN Human Rights rapporteur says foreign and Afghan forces have killed " at least 200 civilians " during Jan-April .
In early August , ACBAR reported that 1,000 civilians had been killed during 2008 to - date ( 260 in July alone ) .
The following presents a graphical image of the various counts of Afghan civilian casualties mentioned in Table 4 .
Three counts are comparable : those of Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , the Associated Press ( A.P. ) and Herold .
The United Nations data is only for the first half year of 2007 and 2008 .
Karen
De Young only lists civilians killed in US / NATO air strikes as mentioned by HRW .
What clearly emerges is that HRW and the AP put out gross under-estimates , presumably a result of censorship by omission .
On September 8 , 2008 , Human Rights Watch released a report on air strikes and civilian deaths in Afghanistan [ 96 ] .
It presented data , decried the costs of civilian casualties in terms of undermining " international efforts to provide basic security to the people of Afghanistan " and warned ominously that such deadly air strikes act as a recruiting tool for the Taliban .
In addition , HRW correctly pointed out that a disproportionate number of the civilian deaths from air strikes called - in by the nearly 20,000 U.S. occupation troops who operate independently of NATO and who have far less stringent rules of engagement .
Throughout the report , HRW either directly states or indirectly implies that the Taliban use civilians as human shields with deadly consequences .
HRW says its figures are based upon " military records , hospital admissions and on - the - ground testimonies . "
Indeed , the Economist states that American military figures show civilian deaths in airstrikes rose from 116 in 2006 to 321 in 2007 , precisely the figures cited by Human Rights Watch [ 97 ] .
Military records , we know , whether U.S. or Afghan , are notoriously unreliable .
Secondly , hospital entry data is largely irrelevant as Afghans bury their dead soon after the death .
It behooves HRW to tell us about the scope of its " on - the - ground testimonies " ; they might take the Benini-Moulton ( 2003 ) study as a model .
The HRW summary figures for 2006 � 2008 ( first seven months ) are presented in Table 5 below .
What is immediately striking is the relatively low ratio of total reported civilian deaths caused by air strike : 50 % in 2006 , 47 % in 2007 and 69 % in 2008 .
By way of contrast , data from Herold�s Afghan Victim Memorial Project as well as commentary from most sources during this period of time point to a higher proportion of civilians killed by US / NATO air strikes , e.g. 60 - 85 % .
But more importantly , the figures put forth by Human Rights Watch without the slightest bit of supporting evidence ( in the form of data incident - by - incident ) , are very low absolute numbers of civilians killed by US / NATO occupation forces .
For example , the HRW figures for Afghans killed by US / NATO air strikes are only 70 % in 2006 , 42 % in 2007 and 27 % in 2008 ( first seven months ) of those reported by Herold .
In other words , Human Rights Watch carries on its long - established tradition of reporting a fraction of the truth as the whole truth when dealing with " bad bodies " ( those killed by US / NATO forces ) .
Table 5 . Afghan Civilian Deaths during 2006 - 8 as Reported by Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) and Herold 2006 2007 2008 HRW : US / NATO total 230 ( 683 ) 173 ( 7 mos ) : air strikes 116 321 119 HRW : air / total in % 50 % 47 % 69 % Herold : US / NATO total 653-769 1010-1297 573-674 ( 8 mos ) : mid point 711 1154 624 : air strikes 326-385 ( 50 % ) 675-868 ( 67 % ) 444-475 : mid point , air 356 772 460 Herold : air / total in % 50 % 67 % 74 %
In his report , Garlasco inveighs that during the past year civilians killed in air strikes have nearly tripled .
This figure is in the ballpark ( for the years 2006 - 7 ) and was widely cited even by some critical of the Bush wars .
But , the figure obscures the fact that HRW numbers are only a fraction of the overall Afghan human toll .
Human Rights
Watch counts only about 50 % of all Afghans killed as indicated in the following Table 6 : Table 6 .
Comparison of Recorded Afghan Civilians killed by US / NATO actions year HRW total HRW air Herold total Herold air 2006 230 116 711 356 2007 683 321 1,154 772 2008 ( 7 mos ) 173 119 448 304 Total 1,086 556 2,313 1,432
Note : the figures for Herold are midpoint numbers of the reported range Measuring the lethality of aerial bombing to the population is a complex endeavor .
Clearly the bombing intensity needs to be related to the civilian toll as absolute numbers in themselves mean very little .
The measure I have chosen to employ is civilians killed per 10 tons ( or 10,000 tons ) of bombs dropped .
Obviously , bombing across countries with radically different levels of urbanization make crude comparisons difficult .
The tonnage figures include bombs dropped on purely military targets .
Were one able to tally only bombs dropped where civilians perished , the ratio of civilians killed per tonnage would be significantly higher .
In 1999 , Fred Kaplan noted that the lethality of bombing for civilians was about equal in Vietnam and Yugoslavia , namely one civilian died for every ten tons of bombs dropped [ 98 ] .
The figures for Laos , Cambodia and Afghanistan ( 2001 ) were appreciably higher ( more than double , Table 7 ) .

* figure is for October 2001 � February 2002
The civilian figures for Afghanistan above are for total civilian deaths caused by U.S/ NATO actions .
In order to achieve comparability , the deaths caused by aerial attacks need to be derived .
A conservative estimate would be that during 2006 , half the deaths were caused by aerial attacks and in 2007 and 2008 two - thirds .
Close air support strikes often involve a mix of civilian and military victims .
Table 7 presents derived numbers in the last column for the number of Afghan civilians killed per 100 tons of bombs dropped .
For the U.S. close air support bombing of 2006 - 8 , I have employed figures in Table 1 , conservatively assuming that one - half of recorded civilian deaths were from air strikes .
The figures probably need to be adjusted downward slightly to take into account that some Afghan civilians died from strafing runs and not bombs .
Recognizing that the U.S. reliance upon close air support strikes increased significantly during 2007 - 8 , I will assume that in 2006 half of all civilian deaths were caused by aerial bombing , but that during 2007 and 2008 the figure is 67 % .
When one makes these adjustments , the lethality of close air support air strikes to Afghan civilians as measured by the ratio of civilians killed per 100 tons of bombs dropped is : 2006 : 125-148 2007 : 119-153 2008 : 29-36
In all three years , the lethality of U.S. bombing in Afghanistan exceeded by far that recorded in Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Yugoslavia , Iraq ( 2003 ) and Afghanistan ( 2001 ) .
The lethality of CAS strikes to Afghan civilians has fallen significantly during the first six months of 2008 , though no doubt has risen greatly during July and August [ 99 ] .
Yet , the figure for 2008 is still in the order of magnitude of those recorded for what are admitted to have been the terribly deadly U.S. carpet bombing of Cambodia and the Allied bombing of Germany during World War II [ 100 ] .
Disaggregated data for 2006 reveals that 653-769 Afghan civilians died as a result of U.S/ NATO actions .
The number of attacks was eighty , meaning that 8 - 10 persons perished per attack .
But this average obscures a bi-polar distribution : 49 attacks resulted in 1 - 5 civilian deaths and 20 attacks killed at least 11 Afghan civilians .
Table 8 . The Matrix of Death : Afghan Civilians Killed by US / NATO Actions , January 1 � July 1 , 2008 Total killed by demographics Men : 54 Women : 39 - 41 Children : 55 Undetermined : 124-184
Total by type of US / NATO attack Air : 178-192 Ground : 50 - 80 Air & ground : 44 - 62 Numbers of attacks by type Air : 20 Ground : 22 Air & ground : 2 Average killed by attack type Air : 9 Ground : 2 - 4 Air & ground : 22 -31
The matrix of death for 2008 constructed in Table 8 indicates that of the total number of Afghan civilians killed ( 272-334 ) , air attacks killed 178- 192 , ground attacks another 50 - 80 , and combined air and ground attacks 44 - 62 .
Aerial attacks were 3 - 4 times as deadly for Afghan civilians as were ground attacks .
Many more children and women are killed by US / NATO attacks than men .
Two - thirds of the fifty - five identifiable children killed died in air or combined air & ground attacks .
Some 57 - 65 % of Afghans killed died from air attacks as compared with only 18 - 24 % from ground attacks .
On the other hand , not a single US / NATO pilot was killed but 123 foreign occupation ground soldiers died during January through June 2008 .
The recent increasing reliance upon unmanned drones to dispense death and destruction in the border regions is in a sense the penultimate disconnect between killing them and saving ours .
The trade - off is very clear : by relying upon aerial close air support ( CAS ) and drone attacks , US / NATO forces spare their pilots and ground troops but kill lots of innocent Afghan civilians .
Air strikes are 4 - 10 times as deadly for Afghan civilians as are ground attacks .
The matrixes of death ( Tables 8 and 9 ) for January - August 2008 couldn�t be clearer about this trend : Table 9 .

What is a Dead Afghan worth to the United States ?
In the very rare instances , when the U.S. military acknowledges that Afghan civilians wrongfully died or were wounded because of military action , what monetary compensation ( the U.S. military refrains from using the word compensation , preferring instead condolence ) is paid [ 101 ] ?
Rather than estimating ex ante what might be the monetary value of an Afghan life , I focus instead upon how much compensation has been paid ex post for a death caused [ 102 ] .
Afghans have been seeking compensation from the United States since early 2002 [ 103 ] .
A particularly egregious case occurred in the dark of night at 3 A.M on January 24 , 2002 , described meticulously in The Afghan Victim Memorial Project :
In the village of Hazar Qadam , Uruzgan Province .
Amanullah , 25 , was sleeping when a rocket hit the Islamic school , the Sharzam high school , and U.S troops burst into the school spraying it with bullets .
He saw his cousin struggle with U.S occupation soldiers .
But Amanullah fearing for his life , fled to hide in the village mosque .
When he returned he found his cousin dead with bullets in his neck , stomach and shoulder .
Bari Gul also described how Haji Sana , his brother died .
Bari Gul was heading up a group of 18 Afghans who were negotiating disarmament locally .
The U.S occupation forces beat them , abducted all of them and 9 other civilians , keeping them in wooden - barred cages and beating them for 2 weeks at the Kandahar base .
Allah Noor , 40 , a farmer , suffered 2 broken ribs from the beatings .
The masked U.S Special Forces troops killed 14 men in one compound , 2 in a second compound serving as the district office .
Villagers later found 2 local men dead with their hands tied behind their backs with plastic bands stenciled with the words , " Made in U.S.A. , " killed execution - style .
The school courtyard was a graveyard of twisted , shrapnel - shredded vehicles .
Its façade was pocked with hundreds of bullet holes .
The floor of one classroom was marked with bloodstains .
" Made in U.S.A. " ?
Bari Gul added , " None of our friends fired on the Americans because they were asleep . "
An Uruzgan elder told TIME ( Feb. 2002 ) , " The U.S. must be punished for what they did in this room , what they did in this place . "
In June 2003 , a participating member in this deadly U.S. attack upon the schoolhouse , Sgt. Anthony Pryor , of the 5th Special Forces Group , was awarded the Silver Star medal and was given a ring made of Afghan lapis lazuli .
Less than ten days after the attack , CIA agents visited the village to pay condolence .
Bari
Gul whose brother was a member of a local disarmament commission and was slaughtered by the U.S. Special Forces , was given ten $ 100 bills [ 104 ] .
Figure 6 .

Five - and - a- half years later , the U.S. military stated it intended to pay $ 90,000 in compensation to the families of at least 16 victims killed in an air strike in Tulokhan west of Kandahar on May 21 / 22 , 2006 .
The U.S. military said 16 civilians had died , but rights groups like the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission ( AIHRC ) insisted the number was 37 .
However , U.S. Col .
Tom Collins added the caveat that compensation would only be paid when security improved in the area [ 105 ] .
In the night of April 17 / 18 , 2006 , U.S soldiers shot and wounded three women and a newborn in Khost Province when the women were on their way home in a vehicle after one of them had given birth to a baby in a nearby clinic .
The family of Gardez Khan was given compensation in the amount of 80,000 Afghanis ( or $ 1,600 ) [ 106 ] .
On March 4 , 2007 , U.S. Marines were hit with gunfire and went on a shooting rampage killing and injuring scores of Afghans in Nangarhar Province .
The U.S. Army later apologized to the affected people and offered a " condolence " sum of $ 2,000 to each affected family [ 107 ] .
In July 2007 , families of 25 victims of a NATO air strike during June on the Alam Khan village , Gereshk district of Helmand Province , were awarded compensation in the amount of 2.2 million Afghanis ( or $ 50,000 ) , or $ 2,000 per dead relative [ 108 ] .
The villages demanded that the NATO troops be punished for killing ordinary citizens .
On September 27 , 2007 , a U.S. bombing raid killed 49 persons in Uruzgan .
The families received 100,000 Afghanis ( $ 2,000 ) for a dead relative and 50,000 Afghanis ( $ 1,000 ) for those injured [ 109 ] .
On the other hand , the family of a 13 - year - old boy who was killed by U.S troops � gunfire in Kabul in March 2006 , received $ 4,000 .
In March 2007 , the U.S. military offered $ 2,000 in compensation to the family of Alexander Ivanov , a truck driver who was killed by U.S. troops � gunfire at the entrance of the U.S. Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan [ 110 ] .
Condolence payments to Iraqis slain by U.S. occupation forces vary from $ 500 - $ 5,000 with the variation accounted for by the degree to which the death of a high - profile victim might have an impact on U.S. - Iraqi relations [ 111 ] .
A typical case is that of Ali Kadem Hashem who in 2003 watched his wife burn to death and his three children die after an American missile hit his home .
Almost a year later , M. Hashem received $ 5,000 in a stack of crisp $ 100 bills ( or $ 1,250 per victim ) and an " I�m sorry " from a young captain ' [ 112 ] .
Or take the case of Said Abbas Ahmed who was given $ 6,000 after an American missile killed his brother , his sister , his wife and his six children .
He received $ 1,000 for each dead family member ; Abbas commented , " Are we not worth more than a few thousand ? " [ 113 ]
A U.S. official in 2007 is quoted in a U.S. Congressional Hearing making the astounding claim that compensation should be modest lest " this could cause incidents with people trying to get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their family�s future . " [ 114 ]
The U.S. military gives at most $ 2,500 condolence payment ( not compensation which would admit wrong - doing ) for a death and half that for an injury .
Canadian per person condolence payments to Afghans since 2006 range from $ 1,100 - $ 9,000 [ 115 ] .
British compensation aside from being totally sporadic and arbitrary are paltry : of the 1,289 claims filed by Afghan civilians , just 397 were settled and less than 150,000 pounds has been paid in compensation to civilians injured or killed in the intense fighting in Helmand [ 116 ] .
Mirwais Ahmadzai who leads the AIHRC says these compensation figures are far too low .
He pointed out that the " blood price " for a killing under Afghan customary law is more than ten times the U.S. offer [ 117 ] .
According to Afghanistan�s current Islamic penal code , a person who mistakenly kills an individual should pay Islamic compensation ( " Diyat " ) equivalent to the price of forty camels to the affected family � or roughly $ 25,000 [ 118 ] .
The London - based Global Commons Institute reported ( 1995 ) that the cash value of a statistical life in the EC or the USA was ~ $ 1'500'000 per head , Centre for the Social and Economic Research of the Global Environment ( C - SERGE ) based in the UK has already published a valuation of the lives to be lost .
In a recent research paper it stated that the cash value of a " statistical life " in the EC or the USA is $ 1,500,000 per head , but in " poor " countries such as China , it is only $ 150,000 .
( The disparate figures are derived from peoples ' ability - to - pay for damage insurance ) .
In global cost / benefit analysis , this means therefore these economists discard a real Chinese life ten times more easily than a real life in the EC or the USA [ 119 ] .
I propose to compare compensation paid by the U.S , military to Afghan civilians to other instances of compensation .
The following Table 10 describes a dozen such cases : Table 10 .
The Monetary Value of Life Paid in Compensation Measured in PPP $ �s Victim�s nationality in nominal $ 's GDP PPP $'s / GDP US $ 's ratio in PPP US $ 's of Americans 1988 * $ 1'850'000 1.00 $ 1'850'000 of WTC victims 2002 $ 1'800'000 1.00 $ 1'800'000 of Italians 1998 $ 1'900'000 1.09 $ 2'071'000 of Japanese 2001 $ 1'440'000 0.70 $ 1'010'000 of Chinese 1999 $ 150'000 4.58 $ 687'000 of South Koreans 2002 $ 162'500 1.7 $ 276'250 of Iranians 1998 $ 132'000'000/290 2.5-3 $ 125,172 of Indians ( Bhopal ) 1984 $ 3'200 5.01 $ 16'032 of Afghans @ lifetime earnings *** $ 3'300 - $ 5'000 ~4** $ 13,200 - $ 20,000 of Afghans @ US military $ 2000 ~ 4 $ 8'000 of Afghans @ Diyat $ 25,000 ~ 4 $ 100,000 * average compensation paid to 270 victims of the 1988 Lockerbie , Scotland , Pan Am Flight 103 disaster [ see Amanda Ripley , " WTC Victims : What 's A Life Worth , " Time ( February 6 , 2002 ) ) .
The value for victims of airplane crashes into World Trade Center is from Beverly Eckert , " My Silence Cannot Be Bought , " USA Today ( December 19 , 2003 ) .
In 1984 , in United States court cases , awards for a person negligently killed were $ 500'000 .
Recent estimates used by the Environmental Protection Agency have been $ 6.1 million [ see the excellent paper by Frank Ackerman and Lisa Heinzerling , " The $ 6.1 Million Question " [ Medford , MA. : Global Development and Environment Institute Working Paper No. 01-06 , Tufts University , April 2002 ] , available at : http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae ) .
A comprehensive bibliography on the Economics of Disasters and Valuation of Life may be found at www.geo.umass.edu/courses/geo510/economics.htm .
The figure for Bhopal is from http://www.iced.org.au/files/iced/bhopal/injustice.html
** the Afghan ratio of 4 is estimated on basis of GDP data and it is close to that for Pakistan where prices are similar , a ratio of 4.25 in Pakistan .
The Afghan and Pakistani economies have been very tightly linked monetarily .
*** an average Afghan earns about $ 300 a year and life expectancy is in the low 40�s .
The incidents listed illustrate recklessness admitted to by the United States .
These include the terrible Union Carbide chemical leak in Bhopal , India in 1984 ; the downing in 1988 of an Iran Air A300 Airbus by a US warship causing 290 civilian deaths [ 120 ] ; the low - flying U.S. Marine EA - 6B jet severing two cables of an Italian ski-lift on February 3 , 1998 , killing 20 skiers from six nations ( within a year and threatened with an international lawsuit , the U.S. settled paying for 3/4 of the $ 40 mn compensation ) [ 121 ] ; and in November 2002 , the U.S. Government paid out $ 13 mn to the families of those killed when a U.S. Navy submarine had struck a Japanese fishing vessel in Feb. 2001 .
At 11:45 P.M. on May 7 , 1999 , a U.S. B - 2 bomber deliberately dropped three JDAM ' smart ' bombs upon the Chinese Embassy in New Belgrade [ 122 ] .
Three young Chinese journalists were killed and 23 other persons in the embassy were wounded .
Four months later , the United States agreed to pay $ 4.5 million in damages to the families of the deceased and to the injured .
This amounts to about nominal $ 150'000 per victim .
On July 22 , 2002 , a little over a month after a U.S. armored vehicle in South Korea struck and killed two South Korean teenagers , the U.S. military offered $ 162'500 in compensation to each family [ 123 ] .
The data in Table 10 reveals that the West ' values ' life in direct proportion to a nation 's level of average material development .
Afghanistan figures at the bottom along with the victims of Bhopal .
When presented in PPP $ �s a clear hierarchy is revealed : Euro - Americans are worth most followed by East Asians whereas Central / South Asians figure last .
Were an Afghan compensated for according to the traditional practice of the Diyat , the amount would approach that paid out ( in PPP $ �s ) by the United States to the family of a victim of the Iranian Airbus shooting - down .
Instead , the U.S , military distributes a condolence payment one - fifteenth the amount offered the family of an Iranian victim .
Approximately US $ 80'000 was spent on the rehabilitation of every sea otter affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill [ 124 ] , that is , ten times the condolence amount offered by the U.S. military to the family of an Afghan killed .
Bombs away !
US / NATO bombs kill about ten times more Afghan civilians with a ton of our " precision " bombs than we killed Serbs in 1999 [ 125 ] .
They ( Afghans ) are only worth one - tenth of an Alaskan sea otter rather than forty camels .
We spend ten dollars on the military in Afghanistan to pursue our geo-strategic aims and $ 1 on reconstructing the everyday lives of Afghans destroyed by thirty years of war [ 126 ] .
For ( most ) Americans , Afghans truly are lesser versions of humanity .
Lest we forget , what did " America " do for Afghans when its geo-strategic goal of defeating the Soviets was achieved in 1989 ?
America cut and ran .
Conclusion : Obama�s Afghanistan as a Surreal Hunting Estate " The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results " � Albert Einstein Candidate Obama , his Clinton era advisers , and sadly all too many others fail to recognize a web of inter-connected , persistent constraints , or given realties .
One might label them as the " five cannots " : US / NATO cannot send 400,000 combat troops to garrison Afghanistan�s towns , hamlets and countryside [ 127 ] ( which is a pre-condition for reconstruction to win hearts and minds [ 128 ] ) ; the US / NATO cannot impose a powerful central government upon Afghanistan [ 129 ] ; the US / NATO cannot neutralize the very effective least - cost weapons of choice of the Afghan resistance ( IED�s and suicide bombers ) ; the US / NATO cannot seal the Afghan - Pakistan border and hence will not eliminate the vital sanctuary so necessary to a guerrilla movement ) ; and lastly , the Pakistan government has never been able to dominate its vast tribal borderlands and there is no reason to believe such will change .
Those who choose not to understand these " five cannots " advocate change in a vacuum .
The present military impasse begets a political solution and the abandonment of any nation - building fantasy [ 130 ] .
The perceived poison of a foreign occupation , the rampant corruption , the all - too - frequent desecration of Islam by the occupiers , the sheer folly of the US / NATO seeking to extend the writ of a central government into the Pashtun tribal regions [ 131 ] , the spiraling count of civilian deaths has shifted the Afghan struggle towards being a war of national liberation .
The presence of foreign forces is furthermore according to the United Nations � senior expert on Al Qaeda , providing the glue with which Osama bin Laden�s Al Qaeda network is bonding support in the region [ 132 ] .
Anatol Lieven of King�s College ( London ) puts things aptly .
Afghanistan is Becoming a sort of surreal hunting estate , in which the U.S. and NATO breed the very terrorists they then track down [ 133 ] .
No matter that in Kabul even foreigners speak about being " inside a living hell . " [ 134 ]
No matter that veteran reporter Kathy Gannon notes that Afghans are fed up with the U.S. and Karzai [ 135 ] .
No matter that Karzai and U.S. bombs have transformed what was once a backward looking Taliban primarily espousing sharia into a thriving modern movement of resistance and national liberation [ 136 ] .
No matter that anti-Americanism is spiraling in Pakistan as U.S raids take place [ 137 ] .
Obama and McCain propose dusty death without end in Afghanistan [ 138 ] .

32 . Incidentally , the same myth was applied to Hezbollah in Lebanon in July 2006 .
As Normal Finkelstein argues , Alan Dershowitz has repeatedly alleged in numerous op - ed pieces that Israel typically takes " extraordinary steps to minimize civilian casualties , " while Hezbollah 's typical tactics were to " live among civilians , hide their missiles in the homes of civilians , fire them at civilian targets from densely populated areas , and then use civilians as human shields against counterattacks . "
No evidence is ever presented to substantiate such claims of using human shields .
No mention is made of Israel using such indiscriminate weapons as cluster bombs fired by artillery or dropped by aircraft ( see Norman Finkelstein , " Descent into Moral Barbarism .

The HRW repo
Many people are caught out when using their phone while on holiday European telecoms chiefs have backed plans to make it cheaper to access data while on a mobile phone abroad .
The measures will slash the cost of sending a text while abroad and reform the way phone operators charge for data calls made when customers roam .
The changes to charges are due to come in to force across the EU 's 27 member nations from July 2009 .
Some nations and industry groups said the changes could mean higher charges for other services .
Costly calls
" We want to avoid so - called bill shock , when someone gets back from a holiday and gets a nasty surprise , " said Luc Chatel , French minister for industry and consumer affairs .
Operators have plenty of margin
Viviane Reding
Many people have incurred high data download charges for using their phone when abroad to get a photo or watch a video .
The initial proposals to cap data roaming charges were made by EU Telecommunications Commissioner Viviane Reding .
On 27 November the package of measures won the backing of EU telecoms ministers at a ministerial meeting .
The rules put a retail price cap of 11 euro cents ( 9p ) on texts sent while roaming - a substantial cut on the European average of 29 euro cents ( 24 p ) .
The ministers backed a cap of 1 euro per megabyte ( 83 p ) on the price of downloading data - though this applies only to the charges operators levy on each other .
Also included in the rules is a mechanism that will allow for connections to be cut if a data bill hits 50 euros ( £ 41 ) .
Operators ' fears
Not all ministers were equally happy with the EU proposals .
" If operators do n't get their revenues from roaming then they will get it from somewhere else , " the Czech Republic said .
The GSM Association , which represents operators , declared its " disappointment " that the measures were deemed necessary .
" In the current economic climate governments should be working to encourage investments , " said a spokesman .
" The biggest concern is extending the use of retail price regulation which is a very extreme step and could deter investment in new services , " he added .
" The real cost of transmitting an SMS on roaming is less than one cent , " said Commissioner Reding .
" I believe there is ample room between one cent and 11 cents which is the ceiling which will be fixed . "
" Operators will be able to provide 25 to 50 cents per megabyte and we set one euro per megabyte , " she said .
" Operators have plenty of margin . "
She added that traffic had jumped 30 - 35 % on voice calls since EU tariffs cut the roaming charges by 50 - 60 % .
Research suggests that phone owners would use their phones more overseas if worries about high charges were eased .
20 % of the people questioned by research firm TNS said confusion over roaming charges stopped them using their phone overseas .
If offered a fixed price for roaming data 17 % of those questioned by TNS said they would be more likely to use their phone more while abroad .
Now the proposals have won the backing of EU telecoms ministers , the proposals pass to the European Parliament .
However , it is not expected to raise any significant objections and the measures are expected to come in to force in July 2009 .

Mr McCain has been an outspoken critic of Russia
The Russian mission to the UN in New York says it has turned down a request from John McCain to help fund his presidential campaign .
Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin and others received standard mail - outs asking them to help " stop the Democrats from seizing control of Washington " .
Spokesmen for the McCain campaign and the mission accepted the letters were " a computer error " .
Mr McCain has been a strong opponent of Russia on human rights and Georgia .
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , told the BBC the campaign had not itself received any complaints from the mission and that " it sounds like they 're having a little fun at our expense " .
" It 's just an error , " he said .
US presidential candidates are legally barred from accepting foreign donations .
Funding denial
The letter to Mr Churkin has a return form which carries the words : " I am proud to stand with our Republican candidates as the Obama Democrats and their wealthy liberal backers focus their attacks squarely on defeating Republicans and gaining control of our government .
" I want to do all I can to help stop the Democrats from seizing control of Washington and implementing their radically liberal policy for our nation . "
The form then has a space for a signature over the typed name , Vitaly Churkin .
On the copy the Russians released , the space is unsigned .
Ruslan Bakhtin , a spokesman for Russia 's UN mission , said : " It 's evident that [ the letter ] was a mistake .
It happens . "
But he also stressed : " Russian authorities are in no way engaged in funding political campaigns or political activities abroad . "
Mr McCain has opposed Moscow on a number of measures .
To evade Russia 's veto in the UN Security Council he has proposed setting up an alternative body : the League of Democracies .
During the Russia - Georgia conflict this summer , he said : " We are all Georgians now . "
He has also proposed throwing Russia out of the G8 over its human rights record .
Springsteen played at a concert aimed at boosting Democratic registration
Final efforts are under way to register new voters in a number of US states , as reports suggest the Democrats have gained an edge over the Republicans .
Virginia , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Florida and Colorado are among the states where new voter registration ends on Monday .
Both parties have held celebrity events to try to boost voter sign - up rates .
Over the past year , about four million new voters have registered in a dozen key states , with the Democrats gaining the most , the Washington Post says .
Democratic gains in Florida , a big battleground state , have been double those of the Republicans , the newspaper reports .
The registration ratio rises to four - to - one in favour of the Democrats in Colorado and Nevada and six to one in North Carolina , it says .
In Virginia party affiliation is not recorded when voters register , but a disproportionate number of new voters live in Democratic strongholds , the paper adds .
All five of those states were won by George W Bush in 2004 but have been targeted by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama as potential swing states this year .
His campaign hopes that the party 's gains of newly registered voters will be matched by a corresponding swell in numbers going to the polls on 4 November .
The Obama campaign arranged free concerts by singer Bruce Springsteen in Pennsylvania and Ohio over the weekend in a bid to boost voter sign - up ahead of the deadline .
Meanwhile , Republican rival John McCain called on two former American football players to join his campaign efforts in Ohio last week .
Young people , Hispanics and African - Americans are among the groups targeted by organisations encouraging increased voter registration .
Analysts say the long primary battle between Mr Obama and his rival for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton , may work in his favour because more people registered in order to take part .
Some states allow new voters to register up to election day .
It was easy to mount the original iPod and access it liks a USB drive .
It 's possible to do that with an iPhone , too , although there are different approaches depending on the type of data you want to work with .
In this article we 'll explore the different approaches , and they 're summarised below :
Fundamentally , on a non-jailbroken device it's not possible to work with data other than camera files and data from selected apps .
In this article we look at both approaches .
PTP : Accessing Photos , videos and camera data as a disk mount
iOS automatically presents modern devices as cameras when they 're connected over USB .
This uses Picture Transfer Protocol ( PTP ) which is a fairly limited system allowing you to copy photos back and forth .
You 'll probably recognise the DCIM folders that photos tend to appear in .
PTP has a number of drawbacks : most obviously , you can't access files other than from the camera .
And PTP does n't support functionality such as renaming or modify files or folders : instead , it must delete and recreate them to effect a change .
This is slow .
Accessing photos & app data over AFC with iTunes
Apple 's knowledge - base has an article describing how to manage rudimentary filesharing with iTunes .
Accessing app data over USB with FUSE
FUSE is a system that lets users mount drives on their Windows or Mac computers without needing to make administrator - level changes to their systems .
FUSE stands for " filesystem in userspace " and is available in different forms on most platforms .
FUSE itself is an abstraction layer , in that it is n't the technology that communicates directly with the device or data source : usually , another approach is used for that .
In the case of mounting an iPhone as a drive , FUSE would communicate with the iPhone using another protocol : SSH , AFC / AFC2 , PTP or WebDAV .
On Windows , the popular Dokan user - mode file system is often used , and on macOS osxfuse is popular .
From a user 's perspective , because FUSE normalises the way the device 's data is presented , it usually does n't matter which underlying protocol is responsible for the mount .
Using a FUSE mount on macOS
Let 's demonstrate that approach on macOS , and how to mount a device .
In order for this to work , you 'll need to install the free Homebrew package manager and be familiar with using the macOS Terminal .
First of all , let 's find your device 's UDID .
You can do this with the free version of iPhone Backup Extractor , with the lsusb command , or with ioreg -p IOUSB - l -w 0 .
Run iPhone Backup Extractor whilst your device is connected , select your device , and choose the " Info " tab .
You 'll see the UDID shown in the " Hardware identifiers " section :
Device data shown in iPhone Backup Extractor
Next , let 's get FUSE for macOS ready :
$ brew tap homebrew / cask $ brew cask install osxfuse == > Caveats
To install and / or use osxfuse you may need to enable their kernel extension in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General For more information refer to vendor documentation or the Apple Technical Note : https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2459/_index.html
You must reboot for the installation of osxfuse to take effect .
And let 's install ifuse , which is the code that can communicate with iOS devices through FUSE :
$ brew install ifuse
With ifuse installed , it 's possible to mount your iPhone or iPad using the UDID we obtained earlier :
$ mkdir ~/ iphone $ ifuse ~/ iphone --udid 000000000000000000000000
That 'll mount your iPhone as a disk on your machine .
If you 'd like to go further and dig into more data , this superuser post is rather handy , and similarly , this post covers off use of the usbmuxd tool .
Troubleshooting errors you might run into ifuse might complain : Invalid device UDID specified , length needs to be 40 characters .
Starting with the iPhone X , Apple changed UDID s to use 24 bytes and a dash ( - ) instead of the old 40 - byte format .
If you get Failed to connect to lockdownd service on the device .
Try again .
If it still fails try rebooting your device .
ensure that your device is connected , and is n't displaying a " Trust this computer " dialog .
You 'll need to approve that first .
If you then get ERROR : Device 000000000000000000000000 returned unhandled error code - 13 you 'll need to disconnect and reconnect the device .
Whilst doing this , it pays to ensure no other applications are running on your PC or Mac which might be trying to connect to your iOS device .
If you 're only ever going to mount a single iOS device , you can just run ifuse ~/ iphone .
Need to use a pre-release version of usbmuxd ?
usbmuxd is n't frequently updated , so occasionally when a new version of iOS is released , it lacks support .
To fix that , you can install the latest development version of it as below :
brew unlink usbmuxd brew install -- HEAD usbmuxd brew unlink libimobiledevice brew install -- HEAD libimobiledevice brew cask uninstall osxfuse brew cask install osxfuse idevicepair
Accessing app data over USB with FUSE on a jailbroken device
The instructions are exactly the same as above .
With the device jailbroken , you 'll see more data straight away .
Neat , eh ?
Using Filza's WebDAV server for iOS root file access
On a jailbroken iOS device , it 's possible to install a file manager app named Filza through Cydia .
Under Fileza 's settings , you can enable WebDAV server mode .
This provides a fairly simple interface for other devices to access your iOS device , although it is extremely insecure .
WebDAV is a very general mechanism for working with web data , and there are many clients which can access it : including a web interface that 's built - in to Filza .
Connect to your device with a web browser , and you 'll see the interface .
Easy .
Using AFC2 to access iOS files over USB
What is AFC2 ?
AFC stands for " Apple File Conduit " , Apple 's own mechanism for transferring data from an iOS device to a host computer .
AFC runs on every iOS device , but is locked down to only providing access to a limited set of data .
" AFC2 " is the nickname given to a series of tools built by the jailbreaking community , emulating AFC but providing access to the entire device .
The latest implementation of AFC2 was built by Cannathea and is available on GitHub .
AFC2 can be install from Cydia , and once installed will allow an AFC client to browse the device in its entirety .
Other techniques for accessing all data on jailbroken devices
Prior to the release of iOS 8 , there were several Cydia plugin for jailbroken devices which would make an iPhone present itself as a USB stick when connected .
Alas , there are no longer supported on modern versions of iOS .
Recovering deleted files from a mounted iOS device
If you can mount your iPhone or iPad as a drive , you might think you could recover deleted files by manipulating the filesystem directly on a jailbroken device .
Unfortunately , you can't recover files this way from an iPhone as the filesystem is encrypted .
Even if you could find bits of the data , you 'd not be able to decrypt them .
Each file has its own encryption key , and those keys are discarded on deletion .
Apple 's iOS Security Guide covers this briefly on page 17 in the " architecture overview " :
Every time a file on the data partition is created , Data Protection creates a new 256 - bit key ( the “ per- file ” key ) and gives it to the hardware AES engine , which uses the key to encrypt the file as it is written to flash memory using AES - XTS mode .
On devices with an A7 , S2 , or S3 SoC , AES - CBC is used .
The initialization vector is calculated with the block offset into the file , encrypted with the SHA - 1 hash of the per - file key .
Mounting can work well for getting to extant files , but it 's not much help for recovery .
For that , you either need an iTunes or iCloud backup , data synced with the iCloud , or a forensic image of the device from before the data was deleted .
Bonus : mounting your Windows computer from your iPhone or iPad
iOS 13 saw the introduction of SMB support to iOS .
This allows users to remotely access drives on Windows computers .
This is how it works :
Find the IP address of your Windows computer .
The ipconfig command should tell you this .
On the Windows computer , right - click the folder you 'd like to share and choose Properties → Sharing → Advanced sharing .
Click " Share this folder " .
In the Sharing tab , select Share ... , then in the drop - down menu select your user account , add it , and make sure it has " Read / write " permissions .
Click " Share " and " Apply " , and close the window .
On your iOS device , open Apple 's " Files " app , tap " Connect to a server " .
Type smb:// followed by the IP address of your PC .
Then choose " Registered user " and enter your Windows account name and password .
With this done , your Windows drive should appear on the iOS device .
De Qing , an expert in Buddhism in Nanjing , said : “ The discovery of the relic will have a huge influence on the cultural history of Buddhism in China and will establish Nanjing as a premier site .
It will be a great encouragement for Buddhists as well as for future studies .
It is important for Buddhism as a religion to have these sarira , or relics , to show its followers .
The more a Buddhist practises , the more relics will remain of him after his death .
I am hugely excited .
I think they should take the skull outside of the container , it is a sacred item , but it is not an untouchable item . ”
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A new type of dry glue designed to mimic gecko feet is 10 times stickier than the gravity - defying lizards , and three times stickier than other gecko - inspired glues , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .
A flying gecko is displayed during a live reptile exhibition in the Bulgarian capital Sofia , May 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Nikolay Doychinov
“ It ’s the stickiest dry glue yet , ” said Liming Dai of the University of Dayton , who reported on the glue in the journal Science .
A 1 - inch ( 2.5 - cm ) square of the adhesive can support the weight of a 220 - pound ( 100 - kg ) man climbing up a vertical surface , but it can be easily lifted and reapplied , an ideal material for , say , a Spider - Man suit .
“ That is not real .
What we do is real , ” said Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , referring to the comic book superhero ’s wall - climbing prowess .
Aside from helping people walk up walls , the glue could be used in electrical components without the need for soldering , Wang and Dai said in a telephone interview .
And because it is dry , it could be used at very low temperatures as in space , where more conventional glues lose their grip .
Like other gecko - inspired glues , the new glue uses a carpet of carbon nanotubes , thin filaments of carbon molecules .
But attached to the ends of these filaments are curly strands of carbon that expand the surface area of the glue ’s gripping action .
This design matches the structure of real gecko feet , which have microscopic hairs that branch off in different directions .
“ Our sticky glue has a force 10 times that of gecko feet and three times more than previous sticky glues trying to mimic the gecko feet , ” said Dai , who also worked with teams from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory near Dayton and the University of Akron to develop the glue .
Dai said the design is meant to maximize the effect of atomic - scale attractive forces known as van der Waals forces .
When the curly part of the tubes are pressed onto a surface , the tubes become aligned with the surface , forming a strong bond .
But , when lifted at an angle , this bond is broken .
Wang uses the analogy of having a foot stuck in mud .
If you pull straight up , the foot stays stuck , but if you slowly peel the foot away , the bond is broken .
MEXICO CITY 
Many of the mug shots of drug traffickers that appear in the Mexican press show surly looking roughnecks glaring menacingly at the camera .
An anticorruption investigation unveiled last week in the Mexican capital , however , made it clear that not everybody enmeshed in the narcotics trade looks the part .
There was a gray - haired , grandfatherly type who was pushing 70 , as well as an avuncular figure with a neatly coiffed goatee and wire - rimmed spectacles perched upon his nose .
Some of the five men who found themselves on the front pages of newspapers on their way to jail , wore suits , which made them look more like bureaucrats than bad guys .
Among the greatest challenges in Mexico ’s drug war is the fact that the traffickers fit no type .
Their ranks include men and women , the young and the old .
And they can work anywhere : in remote drug labs , as part of roving assassination squads , even within the upper reaches of the government .
It has long been known that drug gangs have infiltrated local police forces .
Now it is becoming ever more clear that the problem does not stop there .
The alarming reality is that many public servants in Mexico are serving both the taxpayers and the traffickers .
With all the news of the past few days , that the McCain campaign is at wit ’s end with Sarah Palin , that she ’s a “ rogue elephant ” who wo n’t listen to McCain or his advisers , that she does what she wants and to hell with McCain and the campaign , what does this bode for a McCain presidency ?
It means that we ’d have another Dick Cheney on our hands , but one that ’s a heck of a lot dumber .
And that ’s dangerous .
It ’s been bad enough having an evil genius pulling Pinocchio ’s strings the past eight years , but can American really afford an evil idiot in his place ?
Rien ne lui fera abandonner le combat .
C'était une promesse faite par Nicolas Sarkozy aux lobbys de l'industrie culturelle , et elle entend bien la défendre jusqu 'au dernier souffle d'air qu'elle parviendra à trouver dans ce dossier .
Confirmant nos craintes , la ministre de la Culture Christine Albanel a rejeté la portée de l'amendement anti-riposte graduée voté mercredi par le Parlement Européen .
Elle garde le projet de loi Création et Internet à son agenda .
Non , rien de rien , non , je ne changerai rien .
C’est payé , balayé , oublié .
Je m’fous des députés .
Edith Piaf avait son Marcel Cerdan , Pascal Nègre a sa Christine Albanel .
Telle la boxeuse sur son ring , la ministre de la culture encaisse les coups les uns après les autres mais se relève toujours , poussant son combat jusqu ’au dernier round en se sachant constamment au bord du K.O. Contre toute attente , dans ce que l’on croyait être mercredi la dernière reprise , la puncheuse a encore trouvé l’énergie de tenir sa garde au bout d’un affrontement musclé , et a refusé de jeter l’éponge .
Au premier round , en avril 2008 , l ’ancienne patronne du Château de Versailles avait encaissé un premier crochet du gauche du Parlement européen , déjà , et elle s’était relevée , déjà .
« Le Parlement européen n’a pas une bonne compréhension de ce que nous allons faire et nous allons le leur expliquer « , déclarait la ministre à peine vacillante en revenant vers son crachoir .
Au second round , un mois plus tard , c’est le régulateur européen des télécoms qui décroche une droite .
Bien positionnée sur ses jambes , Albanel esquive et retourne dans son coin nettoyer son protège - dents en attendant le gong .
Au troisième round , elle récidive l’exploit .
Cette fois c’est la CNIL qui tente de passer sous les gants mais la ministre s’accroche bien à son adversaire et la renvoie dans ses cordes .
Elle rappelle dans un rictus que la Commission qui protège la vie privée des Français n’a qu’un avis consultatif , et qu’elle n’est donc pas tenue de le suivre .
Sautillante sur le ring , elle attend son prochain adversaire d’un regard déterminé .
Au quatrième round , c’est cette fois le Conseil d’Etat qui ose s’approcher de la ministre et lui adresser quelques coups dans les reins .
Sans grande conviction .
Christine Albanel encaisse les coups en armant la riposte .
Au cinquième round , c’est l’ISOC , une organisation internationale reconnue et respectée qui déclenche un crochet , aussitôt bloqué par la ministre .
Dans le public , personne n’a rien vu .
La serviette n’est même pas de sortie .
Elle se relève au bout de l’effort
Jusque là , la championne a enchaîné les reprises avec force , sûre de tenir la victoire aux points .
A l’entame de la sixième reprise , elle rassure son coach .
« Il y a un agenda parlementaire très chargé .
C’est une bataille .
Mais je sens beaucoup de volonté politique » pour faire étudier le projet de loi en novembre au Sénat , promet la ministre avant d’entrer une nouvelle fois sur le ring .
Le sixième round lui est pourtant presque fatal .
Le Parlement Européen revient le mercredi 24 septembre dans l’arène avec l’envie d’en découdre , et se précipite sur son adversaire pour lui asséner un violent uppercut sous le menton .
Le public retient son souffle .
Pour la première fois la ministre s’effondre sur le tapis .
On croit au K.O. La force du coup laisse les commentateurs ébahis ( 573 voix pour , 74 contre ; près de 85 % des voix ) .
L’arbitre décide de compter .
Dix .
Neuf. Huit .
Sept … arrivera - t - elle à se relever ?
Six … Cinq… Quatre … Albanel commence doucement à se réveiller .
Elle soulève une paupière , puis l’autre .
Trois .
Les observateurs s’interrogent .
Pourrait - elle encore une fois remonter sur le ring et renvoyer des coups ?
On imagine l’impossible .
Deux .
La ministre se met sur ses genoux , elle vacille encore .
Un. Cette fois , elle est debout .
Reprise .
Le vote du Parlement européen « ne s’oppose pas » au maintient de la loi Création et Internet et à la mise en place de la riposte graduée , proclame dans la soirée la ministre en recrachant une dent , puis deux .
Comme dans le scénario de science - fiction que nous avions imaginé , Christine Albanel fait « observer que le débat qui s’est déroulé intervient en première lecture « .
« Aucun des Etats membres qui composent le Conseil de l ’Union , pas plus que la Commission , n’ont manifesté leur volonté de soutenir un amendement de cette nature « , rappelle la ministre , qui mise donc sur un retoquage de l’amendement par le Conseil , avant un renvoi au Parlement en deuxième lecture .
La ministre affirme que le texte adopté mercredi par le Parlement Européen « se borne à rappeler un principe général qui n’apporte rien au droit existant « , ce qui doit conduire à « rejeter catégoriquement l’interprétation donnée par le député socialiste européen Guy Bono et par les lobbyistes qui s’opposent à la défense des droits des créateurs « .
Plus tôt , le député Bono avait proclamé la mort de la riposte graduée qui devait conduire à suspendre ou résilier l’abonnement à Internet de certains P2 Pistes présumés sur simple condamnation administrative .
Le texte de l’amendement voté par les eurodéputés dispose que « aucune restriction aux droits et libertés fondamentales des utilisateurs finaux ne doit ê tre prise sans décision préalable de l’autorité judiciaire « .
Poings serrés , Christine Albanel refuse de reconnaître que parmi les droits et libertés fondamentales des utilisateurs finaux d’Internet figure le droit … d’accéder à Internet .
Elle veut s’en remettre pour interprétation à la Cour européenne de justice , qui ne se prononcera qu’en cas de litige , et donc en cas de mise en œuvre de la riposte graduée .
La ministre s’est bien relevée , mais elle a définitivement perdu toute sa lucidité .
Il y aura une huitième reprise .
Discussion of authoring and content for Scott Meyers ' book on producing fast software
By Sima Kotecha
Newsbeat US reporter
With America set to decide between Barack Obama and John McCain for their new president next Tuesday , Newsbeat visits a mosque in a New York suburb to find out how Muslims feel about the election .
Many of America's 4 million Muslims are feeling angry about the Presidential race .
They feel they 've been rejected by mainstream politics in the US , a result perhaps of the 9/11 attacks by followers of Osama Bin Laden , the Islamic extremist , and for which many still feel hated and alienated by their fellow citizens .
I do find it offensive that being Muslim is being considered as a slur .
That is offensive , it is racist and it is unfortunate
Azeem Khan , 27 , from New York
At a mosque in Queens , New York , Anoushka prays for peace .
She thumbs her prayer beads and tells me that a Barack Obama victory would make the world a better place .
She said : " He seems like a truthful person and he has good policies . "
She also happens to think , wrongly , that he 's a Muslim .
Most of the Muslims here are pro-Obama .
After all New York is a state that normally supports his Democratic Party .
Vote split Traditionally , American Muslims have often supported the Republicans .
However , this election is turning things around .
Many Muslims in America want a change in the country 's leadership
With the economy wobbly and Republican President Bush talking in tough and condemnatory terms about radical Islamic groups worldwide , many are switching sides and promising to give Obama their vote .
Azeem Khan , 27 , is one of them .
He said : " There are many Muslims who say because of what they 've seen in the past eight years they can't bring themselves , in their lifetime , to vote for a Republican .
" It is sad for them to see unfair wars like the Iraq war where life is lost for no reason . "
Religious ' slur '
This election has n't been an easy one for Muslims .
They 've watched Obama , a Christian who spent four years as a child in Muslim Indonesia , apparently fight shy of public association to the faith .
At a rally in Detroit two women in hijabs were told not to stand behind him .
His campaign quickly apologised but Azeem Khan is unimpressed .
He said : " I do find it offensive that being Muslim is being considered as a slur .
That is offensive , it is racist and it is unfortunate . "
Colin Powell ( centre ) wants Barack Obama to be the next US president Recently , the man who used to run US foreign policy under President Bush 's leadership came to the defence of Muslims .
Colin Powell , one of the most respected Republicans in the United States , has endorsed Obama for President .
He told the nation it should n't matter what religion the Democrat was .
He said : " I 'm also troubled by , not what Senator McCain says , but what members of the party say , and it is permitted to be said .
" Such things as , ' Well you know that Mr Obama is a Muslim ' .
Well , the correct answer is , ' He is not a Muslim , he 's a Christian , he 's always been a Christian . '
" But the really right answer is , ' What if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? '
The answer is , ' No .
That 's not America . '
" Is there something wrong with some seven - year old Muslim - American kid believing that he or she can be president ?
" Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion he 's a Muslim and he might be associated with terrorists .
" This is not the way we should be doing it in America . "
Polls here suggest 10 % of Americans still think Obama is a Muslim .
This Texan woman who did n't want to give Newsbeat her name is one of them .
She said : " I really do n't care what Obama says because I do n't want someone with a Muslim background running our country .
" He 'll be letting them all come over here and he 'll be buddy buddy with them all .
" We 'll be giving them nuclear arms .
Next thing you know they 'll be attacking us again . "
Her strongly held views demonstrate why so many of the Muslims in America feel isolated and unwelcome in the land of the free .

I did n’t come up with the title , it was the subject line of an email I got from Jenny .
Jenny is in a very common situation , she ’s just about the graduate school , currently has some income , and is looking to purchase a house in the very near future .
I ’m 24 years old and really concerned about my financial future , I come from rather meager upbringings and I want to be sure that I ’ll be able to live / retire comfortably .
I ’m currently a full time student and full time employee making about 32,000 a year and am living on my own with bills to pay .
I currently have about 9,000 in savings ( plus a small RSP savings account with Scotia Bank that pays less than 2 % interest )
I would like to make sure that I ’m on the right track , and would like to own a condo / apartment within the next couple years , but worry that with such low funds and only 1 credit card in the way of credit I ’m not going to have much luck !!
I ’m living in BC approximately an hour outside downtown Vancouver and figure that I ’ll be paying about 250,000 for a condo in my suburb .
As for graduation the details get a little foggy there , right now I ’m fairly content with my job but am getting my bachelors degree just as an insurance policy so to speak .
I figure that by the time I graduate ( probably in 3 years or so ) I ’ll either be ready to try my hand at a new career unrelated to my education ( but be able to earn a higher salary since I have it ) , or will have been led certain way by the courses I ’m interested in / skilled at .
Absolutely no debt and am not yet married .
To start , I ’ve said this before , but I ’m not a financial advisor so anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt .
With that out of the way , looking at the details indicated , it seems that Jenny is far from clueless .
As a young person still in school , it ’s commendable to be debt free and have some savings put away even if working full time .
Lets take a look at some of the financial goals
Rent vs. Buy
Jenny ’s first goal is to purchase a $ 250,000 condo .
Assuming a 5.5 % fixed interest rate , and 5 % down , the payments would be $ 1,450 / month + property tax + condo fees .
Assuming 1 % / yr property tax and $ 250 / month in condo fees , the total housing cost of approximately $ 1,900 / month not including utilities .
To rent in the same area , according to Jenny , it would cost around $ 1,200 / month for a 2 bedroom apartment .
The initial problem with purchasing is qualifying for the mortgage at her current salary .
Purchasing the condo would result in a month housing expenses of at least $ 2,000 / month with utilities .
The maximum a lender will give is a gross debt servicing ( GDS ) and total debt servicing ( TDS ) of 32 % and 40 % respectively .
In Jenny ’s case , even if $ 32,000 / year would result in a GDS of 75 % which is way outside the qualification range .
Even if her salary got boosted to $ 50,000 in a couple years , it would still result in a GDS of 48 % .
Jenny ’s ( or family ) income would need to increase to $ 75,000 / year to qualify for a mortgage on this home .
The point being is that unless Jenny ’s income ( or down payment ) increases significantly , then purchasing a home at this price may not be an option .
The alternative , not that it ’s a bad one , is renting .
Renting has always gotten a bad rap as they say that you ’re paying someone elses mortgage .
While this may be true , paying lower housing costs and investing the difference between renting and mortgage payments , can put you ahead over the long term as home ownership is historically known to only keep up with inflation .
If home ownership is something that you want for yourself , then I would suggest to rent first ( as cheaply as possible ) , save as much as possible , then consider buying when the income levels are high enough to support the housing costs after a large down payment .
In conclusion , I think that Jenny is already on the right track .
She should keep up her savings habits even while her salary increases , index her portfolio for the long term , and wait for the right time to purchase a home .
How would you improve Jenny ’s financial situation ?
In terms of art , I 'd like to have more , but if I did that myself , it certainly would n't qualify as " pretty " , if anything it would probably make it worse .
If you 're interested in contributing art I 'd be more than happy to have a look at what you can do .
Drop me a line in game ( name : creative nickname ) or otherwise .
Kariloy has been contributing a significant amount of artwork as of late .
If she keeps up her current pace , most of the artwork will be done in short order , so you can thank her !
What , it 's not pretty enough for you yet ?
Ideas Three Inconvenient Things
There are three nasty sources of air pollution very close to home that nobody seems to recognize as a problem .
By Ted Mitchell
Published November 04 , 2008
It seems that a day does n't go by without hearing something about air quality .
We now know that this is not just a nuisance problem .
People die prematurely from air pollution , and research has shown the effects are oddly enough more on the heart than the lungs .
In residential areas , it is easy to be complacent because in general , air quality is pretty good for much of Hamilton .
But there are three nasty sources of air pollution very close to home that nobody seems to recognize as a problem .
These are :
Off road and old diesel engines Wood burning stoves and fireplaces Small engines
Now it is true that each of these sources is a small proportion of total pollution .
But they are heavy hitters , ranking off the scale on a per mass basis .
You could call this concept ' specific pollution ' , and it could be referenced to mass or energy content of fuel , power or heat output .
But let 's not get too technical .
We are really talking about pollution per person , and responsibility for that pollution .
To contribute more than your fair share of pollution , you can't be more guilty than by hiring a diesel backhoe to move some dirt around ( the politically correct term is " landscape " ) , light a cozy fire after dinner , or blow some leaves and 2 - stroke smoke around the yard .
Each of these is to a Hummer what a Hummer is to a bicycle .
And all of them are entirely legal and off the radar of politicians .
Proximity
The air quality index ( AQI ) is determined by measuring the concentration of pollutants in monitoring stations located around the province .
They tend to be on the second or third story roofs of buildings , away from any nearby pollution source such as a busy intersection or an industry .
What they measure is an artificially low average that does n't pick up point sources or mobile sources .
But your lungs do pick up this pollution , especially when you spend time on a road or sidewalk .
Or in your own back yard .
Diesel
Photo redit : Fourwheeler.com
On - road diesel engines are undergoing a renaissance as a consequence of technology and regulation .
Particulate matter ( PM ) often comes with a subscript like 2.5 which refers to particle size in microns : smaller ( fine ) particles are more harmful to people .
Diesels are the major source of fine PM in most areas without nearby heavy industry .
Diesel particulate is made of tiny particles of soot , with organic compounds stuck to them which deliver their characteristic smell .
Some of these polycyclic organics are carcinogenic , but research has yet to determine how much this contributes to health effects .
Unfortunately , old diesel engines seem to last forever .
This is a problem if public policy relies on fleet replacement to produce air quality improvements .
The other hole in regulations is off - road engines , which do not need to meet the same standards as their on - road counterparts .
In fact the Canadian regs for 2008 permit about 26 times the PM emitted in an off - road diesel as compared to a similar engine in a heavy truck .
Since off - road diesels show up regularly in densely populated urban construction sites and residential areas , there is no argument for this lax exemption except maybe lobbying of the EPA from the usual suspects .
Wood Smoke

Cigarettes do not cause cancer because they are a vice .
Nor is nicotine carcinogenic .
What causes cancer are many of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon products of incomplete combustion .
Wood smoke is chemically similar to tobacco smoke , and should be assumed to be carcinogenic .
The few human health studies that exist , from third world countries , show that wood / biomass smoke is comparable to cigarette smoke in carcinogenicity .
Canada continues to ignore the US EPA 's 1993 regulation requiring all new stoves and fireplaces to be clean burning .
These certified stoves are typically 10 - 20 times cleaner than conventional wood burning devices .
During the February Upwind / Downwind Cconference , I spoke to an Environment Canada rep at their stove demonstration ' burn trailer ' .
He related a story about a woman who repeatedly complained about a neighbour 's constant , choking wood smoke infiltrating her house .
After several visits from the fire department and a court injunction , the stench stopped .
A few months later , she was talking to her neighbour .
" No hard feelings , but thank you for stopping the smoke , it was really bothering me . "
" But I did n't stop . "
" What ?
But there 's no more smoke ! "
" I got a certified stove installed . "
The difference really is that big .
Relative Emissions of Fine Particules ( Image Credit : EPA
So with this technology readily available , it is puzzling why Canada still has n't adopted this regulation for new wood heating units .
There is however , extensive educational information online .
How Canadian .
If nothing is done to retrofit existing units , or put some sensible restrictions in place , we are in for many stinky winter days for decades .
Ironically enough , some of the worst local air quality in Hamilton is not in the downtown but is caused by wood smoke in pretty little rural hamlets such as Mineral Springs .
All you need is a wind - sheltered area , and a couple of homes heated frequently with damp wood and a rarely cleaned chimney and presto , downtown never smelled so clean .
Small Engines

Recently I was engaged in an argument about pollution from on - road motorbikes .
Regulations permit much higher emission concentrations than cars .
The big difference between clean and dirty motorbikes is due to one thing – fuel injection , or the lack of it .
The other guy 's argument was sure they have higher emission concentrations , but these bikes have small displacement and get better gas mileage so that cancels out the effect .
As is turns out , motorbikes cannot be ' drive - clean ' tested , so the argument could not be settled factually .
But there is one easy , overlooked test that combines emission concentration with displacement and mileage : when behind a vehicle , use your nose .
If it stinks more , it is polluting more .
What you smell is mostly hydrocarbons , but those are a surrogate for other harmful pollutants as well .
Speaking of stink , you can find small engines where there are green lawns .
Their emissions remain essentially unregulated .
Two stroke engines were the workhorse of Eastern Bloc countries .
The plastic Trabbi , once a symbol of the failure of Communism , contains the same engine technology that is now one of the darlings of the big box consumer set .
They are cheap , stinky , noisy , and everywhere .
Progress ?
So much of Canadian environmental regulations are frustrating because they are complicated , expensive , generate understandable opposition , and are so ineffective compared to what is easily possible .
I believe it is time to start changing this sorry state of affairs , because health and quality of life are integral to a civilized society .
The obvious , responsible place to start is in our own back yards .

Unprecedented Election
Day turnout could leave voters waiting hours to cast their ballots – some have called the situation a new poll tax .
Others say it 's simply a colossal pain in the ass and an excuse to skip the electoral process .
If the system is maxed out by voter turnout approaching 60 percent , what will happen if 80 percent of the electorate shows up at the polls , as is expected in some states ?
Chaos , that 's what .
Election officials worry about technology breakdowns , flawed voter lists and other problems .
Early voting and absentee ballots help ease the crush , but it 's time to seriously consider an idea that has emerged this year – drive - through voting .
The idea has caught on in places like California 's El Doradoand Sonoma counties and Douglas County , Oregon .
It 's cheap , it 's easy and it should be replicated everywhere .
It 's a simple idea and an alternative to voting by mail .
Voters leave their absentee ballots in a drop - box at designated locations .
Some places allow drop - offs 24/7 .
El Dorado County officials say more than 500 people have taken advantage of the box and saved a bit of change on their postage .
The downside is the boxes encourage driving when polling places are supposed to be close enough to walk .
All those cars heading off to cast a ballot will create more greenhouse gas .
And of course there needs to be some way of preventing fraud and the minimizing the risk that someone will vandalize the boxes – and their contents .
What do you think ?
Do you have a practical suggestion to make it easier , faster or more commuter - friendly to vote ?
Or are long lines just a consequence of representative democracy that we have to live with ?

Castlevania fans who may be experiencing franchise fatigue after a steady stream of portable games — starting with 2001 's Circle of the Moon on the GameBoy Advance — should take notice , as the latest entry in the series is the game you wished Portrait of Ruin would 've been .
With Order of Ecclesia , series producer Koji Igarashi has finally switched up the formula that reinvented the franchise in Symphony of the Night .
The game will still feel very familiar to Castlevania veterans , but there is enough new stuff to make it worthwhile .
Like all Castlevania games , Ecclesia tasks players with stopping yet another coming of Dracula .
But instead of playing one of the vampire - hunting Belmont clan , players take on the role of a new character , Shanoa .
As a member of the titular vampire - hunting organization , Shanoa has been training to fight the dark lord since a very young age , and thus has a multitude of skills and powers at her disposal .
Unfortunately , an accident at the beginning of the game erases her memory so that she essentially becomes a blank slate , having to relearn all of her old abilities .
This is achieved through the new glyph system .
Glyphs represent different weapons and magical abilities , and can be recovered from fallen enemies and at other specific points in the game — much in the way souls were acquired in Dawn of Sorrow .
Two glyphs can be equipped at a time , giving Shanoa the ability to dual - wield different weapons .
However , there is a trick to choosing different combinations of weapons , as certain pairings can create powerful special attacks .
This allows for a bit of strategy when selecting weapons , and requires some experimenting .
Unfortunately , these attacks — while cool and very useful — consume way too many hearts , so they have to be used sparingly .
But while the glyph system helps make the combat feel fresh , the biggest change in Ecclesia is how levels are set up .
Instead of one large , sprawling castle — though the end game does include just that — the game is divided into much shorter levels , which can be accessed using a world map .
This significantly changes the pacing of the game , and is perfect on the portable platform , as it allows for quick run-throughs in addition to long play sessions .
The new set - up also makes backtracking much easier and quicker , thus eliminating some of the frustrations of past games .
The world map also brings with it a fresh feature : a town filled with NPCs to talk to .
Well , it will be full once you get around to saving all of the kidnapped villagers .
This process slowly fills up the village with new characters , starting with the most useful .
This includes both a shop owner and a healer who will agree to make different kinds of medicine if you bring him the right items .
Though there is relatively little to do in Wygol Village , it helps break up the action and provides an excellent place to return to after quick bouts of level grinding .
And you will have to grind .
Unlike a number of its predecessors , Ecclesia is a very difficult game .
You will die a number of times throughout the game , and , surprisingly , a lot of the time it will be at the hands of regular enemies .
There are a number of tough foes littered throughout the game , but more often than not , a little bit of grinding will help you get through a tough spot .
The bosses , however , can be even more frustrating , and require some difficult pattern memorization to defeat .
The game even tries to throw you off sometimes by presenting a boss at the beginning of a level .
Thankfully , save and warp rooms are fairly plentiful , so it 's possible to run away from a fight you 're not quite ready for .
Like most action games , the difficulty helps make any success all the more gratifying , even if it does produce more than one intensely frustrating experience .
And by combining this classic difficulty with interesting new game mechanics and vintage Castlevania visuals and sounds , Igarashi and his team have crafted what could be the best game in the series since Symphony on the PlayStation .
Hopefully , fans are n't too burnt out on the series to notice .

The plaintiff argued an omniscient God would know of the lawsuit
A US judge has thrown out a case against God , ruling that because the defendant has no address , legal papers can not be served .
The suit was launched by Nebraska state senator Ernie Chambers , who said he might appeal against the ruling .
He sought a permanent injunction to prevent the " death , destruction and terrorisation " caused by God .
Judge Marlon
Polk said in his ruling that a plaintiff must have access to the defendant for a case to proceed .
" Given that this court finds that there can never be service effectuated on the named defendant this action will be dismissed with prejudice , " Judge Polk wrote in his ruling .
Mr Chambers cannot refile the suit but may appeal .
' God knows everything '
Mr Chambers sued God last year .
He said God had threatened him and the people of Nebraska and had inflicted " widespread death , destruction and terrorisation of millions upon millions of the Earth 's inhabitants " .
He said he would carefully consider Judge Polk 's ruling before deciding whether to appeal .
The court , Mr Chambers said , had acknowledged the existence of God and " a consequence of that acknowledgement is a recognition of God 's omniscience " .
" Since God knows everything , " he reasoned , " God has notice of this lawsuit . "
Mr Chambers , a state senator for 38 years , said he filed the suit to make the point that " anyone can sue anyone else , even God " .
To John Koza ’s way of thinking , the United States wo n’t be holding a true national election for president this November .
And that ’s made him eager to make a change : Revise the system to send the candidate with the most votes to the White House .
The problem is the Electoral College , which decides the election ’s winner .
Since electoral votes are tallied state by state , it turns out that the results from only about a quarter of the 50 states really matter .
These so - called “ battleground states ” still have a chance to tilt toward one candidate or the other .
As a result , John McCain and Barack Obama will spend nearly all their time and money campaigning in these states .
“ Voters in three - quarters of the states [ have been ] ignored , meaning that the issues of concern to voters in three - quarters of the states [ have been ] ignored , ” Mr. Koza says .
Making those neglected voters relevant is one of the chief reasons Koza founded the National Popular Vote initiative ( nationalpopularvote.com ) in 2006 .
But it ’s not the only reason .
Four times in US history – 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , and 2000 – the candidate with the most popular votes did not win the White House because he had fewer votes in the Electoral College , which is based on the size of each state ’s congressional delegation .
The National Popular Vote campaign encourages states to enact legislation that would give their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who receives the most votes nationwide , thus ensuring that the candidate with the most popular votes always wins the election .
Efforts to change or abolish the Electoral College are hardly new .
Some 800 proposed amendments to get rid of it have been introduced in Congress since the early 19th century , says Alex Keyssar , a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University .
In the 1969 - 70 , Congress nearly sent such legislation to President Nixon , who was ready to sign it ; the amendment easily passed the House , but a filibuster by a handful of lawmakers in the Senate killed it .
Today , national and state polls consistently show about 70 percent of Americans favor direct election of the president .
The National Popular Vote drive differs in its tactics , though not its aims , from these previous efforts .
Rather than a top - down strategy aimed at Congress , it seeks to enact change at the grass roots – state legislatures .
So far , four states – Hawaii , Illinois , New Jersey , and Maryland – with 50 combined electoral votes have enacted bills that would give their electoral votes to the winner of the nationwide popular vote .
Similar legislation has passed one or both houses in more than a dozen other states .
Once states with at least 270 combined electoral votes ( the minimum needed for electing a president ) enact legislation , the change would go into effect , since the winner in the Electoral College would also have to have a popular vote majority .
Koza , a computer scientist who co-invented the rub - off instant lottery ticket used by state lotteries , is a consulting professor at Stanford University .
But the drive to secure a national popular vote takes most of his time .
A Constitutional ‘ end run ’
Because his organization is not seeking a constitutional amendment , opponents have charged that the effort is trying to sneak through a loophole .
“ It ’s basically an end run around the Constitution , ” says Michael Hough , a spokesman for the American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) , a group of conservative state legislators that opposes the idea .
“ The appropriate way would be to actually amend the Constitution , ” Mr. Hough says .
“ But they know that they ca n’t do that because they would n’t have the popular support , they would n’t be able to get it through [ Congress ] . ”
Scholars agree with Koza that the Constitution does give states power to decide how they choose to cast their electoral votes .
Today ’s winner - takes - all approach in each state was not mandated by the Founding Fathers , but evolved as a matter of political expediency in the mid-19th century .
But Hough argues such an effort overrides important states ’ rights .
“ It goes against the Founders ’ intent , ” he says .
“ They came up with the Electoral College because they wanted states to have an important role in the elections . ”
The Electoral College gives states with small populations a slightly bigger say than their number of potential voters , since every state starts with two electoral votes ( just as every state has two senators ) .
“ By going to a national vote , you ’re drastically changing the way we do elections in this country , ” he says .
In 1979 , Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D ) of New York , considered one of the most erudite members of Congress at the time , called the idea of abolishing the Electoral College “ the most radical transformation in our political system that has ever been considered . ”
Close race anticipated
This fall ’s election will give voters a fresh chance to see the current system – and , in Koza ’s eyes , its flaws – in action .
If the race is close , as is expected by many , the popular vote and Electoral College could once again yield different results .
Right now most of Koza ’s support has come from Democrats , who still feel the sting from the 2000 election , in which Vice President Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote – and the White House .
But the opposite nearly happened the next time out in 2004 .
President Bush easily won the popular vote by 3.5 million , but Democratic candidate John Kerry was only a miniscule 60,000 votes away from carrying Ohio and winning the Electoral College .
Koza says people put too much focus on just the 2000 race , although he concedes most of his support is from Democrats .
But “ We have Republican sponsors [ of the bill ] in most states , ” he says .
Former Republican Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota and Jake Garn of Utah sit on the group ’s advisory board .
Koza ’s group is “ doing a smart thing in undertaking this at the state legislative level , where getting an item on the agenda is a little bit more down - to - earth process , ” says Gregory Magarian , an election law expert and professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis .
He hopes that the national popular vote effort will stimulate a discussion about the way Americans hold their presidential elections and whether they ’re satisfied with the current system .
“ It ’s a real , deep , important question about what the results of a presidential election are supposed to reflect ” – the view of the electoral college or of individual voters .
Time to ‘ get rid of it ’
Professor Keyssar , who wrote a letter endorsing the National Popular Vote bill to the Massachusetts legislature , agrees that the movement could spark a valuable discussion , though he suspects that the American public eventually would want to pass a constitutional amendment too .
“ I think most legislators and most citizens really think that the Electoral College is kind of dumb and would like to get rid of it , ” he says .
Though no previous effort to elect the president by popular vote has succeeded , Koza remains hopeful .
“ I compare it to Mothers Against Drunk Driving , ” he says .
“ When they got started everyone laughed at their proposals ....
Then they went state by state , and now almost all the states have enacted their platform at least to some degree . ”

MESSIEURS ,
You often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries .
Permit me to communicate to the public , through your paper , one that has lately been made by myself , and which I conceive may be of great utility .
I was the other evening in a grand company , where the new lamp of Messrs .
Quinquet and Lange was introduced , and much admired for its splendour ; but a general inquiry was made , whether the oil it consumed was not in proportion to the light it afforded , in which case there would be no saving in the use of it .
No one present could satisfy us in that point , which all agreed ought to be known , it being a very desirable thing to lessen , if possible , the expense of lighting our apartments , when every other article of family expense was so much augmented .
I was pleased to see this general concern for economy , for I love economy exceedingly .
I went home , and to bed , three or four hours after midnight , with my head full of the subject .
An accidental sudden noise waked me about six in the morning , when I was surprised to find my room filled with light ; and I imagined at first , that a number of those lamps had been brought into it ; but , rubbing my eyes , I perceived the light came in at the windows .
I got up and looked out to see what might be the occasion of it , when I saw the sun just rising above the horizon , from whence he poured his rays plentifully into my chamber , my domestic having negligently omitted , the preceding evening , to close the shutters .
I looked at my watch , which goes very well , and found that it was but six o'clock ; and still thinking it something extraordinary that the sun should rise so early , I looked into the almanac , where I found it to be the hour given for his rising on that day .
I looked forward , too , and found he was to rise still earlier every day till towards the end of June ; and that at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as till eight o'clock .
Your readers , who with me have never seen any signs of sunshine before noon , and seldom regard the astronomical part of the almanac , will be as much astonished as I was , when they hear of his rising so early ; and especially when I assure them , that he gives light as soon as he rises .
I am convinced of this .
I am certain of my fact .
One can not be more certain of any fact .
I saw it with my own eyes .
And , having repeated this observation the three following mornings , I found always precisely the same result .
Yet it so happens , that when I speak of this discovery to others , I can easily perceive by their countenances , though they forbear expressing it in words , that they do not quite believe me .
One , indeed , who is a learned natural philosopher , has assured me that I must certainly be mistaken as to the circumstance of the light coming into my room ; for it being well known , as he says , that there could be no light abroad at that hour , it follows that none could enter from without ; and that of consequence , my windows being accidentally left open , instead of letting in the light , had only served to let out the darkness ; and he used many ingenious arguments to show me how I might , by that means , have been deceived .
I owned that he puzzled me a little , but he did not satisfy me ; and the subsequent observations I made , as above mentioned , confirmed me in my first opinion .
This event has given rise in my mind to several serious and important reflections .
I considered that , if I had not been awakened so early in the morning , I should have slept six hours longer by the light of the sun , and in exchange have lived six hours the following night by candle - light ; and , the latter being a much more expensive light than the former , my love of economy induced me to muster up what little arithmetic I was master of , and to make some calculations , which I shall give you , after observing that utility is , in my opinion the test of value in matters of invention , and that a discovery which can be applied to no use , or is not good for something , is good for nothing .
I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition that there are one hundred thousand families in Paris , and that these families consume in the night half a pound of bougies , or candles , per hour .
I think this is a moderate allowance , taking one family with another ; for though I believe some consume less , I know that many consume a great deal more .
Then estimating seven hours per day as the medium quantity between the time of the sun 's rising and ours , he rising during the six following months from six to eight hours before noon , and there being seven hours of course per night in which we burn candles , the account will stand thus ; --
In the six months between the 20th of March and the 20th of September , there are
Nights 183
Hours of each night in which we burn candles 7 Multiplication gives for the total number of hours 1,281
These 1,281 hours multiplied by 100,000 , the number of inhabitants , give 128,100,000
One hundred twenty - eight millions and one hundred thousand hours , spent at Paris by candle - light , which , at half a pound of wax and tallow per hour , gives the weight of 64,050,000 Sixty - four millions and fifty thousand of pounds , which , estimating the whole at - the medium price of thirty sols the pound , makes the sum of ninety - six millions and seventy - five thousand livres tournois 96,075,000
An immense sum ! that the city of Paris might save every year , by the economy of using sunshine instead of candles .
If it should be said , that people are apt to be obstinately attached to old customs , and that it will be difficult to induce them to rise before noon , consequently my discovery can be of little use ; I answer , Nil desperandum .
I believe all who have common sense , as soon as they have learnt from this paper that it is daylight when the sun rises , will contrive to rise with him ; and , to compel the rest , I would propose the following regulations ; First .
Let a tax be laid of a louis per window , on every window that is provided with shutters to keep out the light of the sun .
Second .
Let the same salutary operation of police be made use of , to prevent our burning candles , that inclined us last winter to be more economical in burning wood ; that is , let guards be placed in the shops of the wax and tallow chandlers , and no family be permitted to be supplied with more than one pound of candles per week .
Third .
Let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches , &c. that would pass the streets after sunset , except those of physicians , surgeons , and midwives .
Fourth .
Every morning , as soon as the sun rises , let all the bells in every church be set ringing ; and if that is not sufficient ? , let cannon be fired in every street , to wake the sluggards effectually , and make them open their eyes to see their true interest .
All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days ; after which the reformation will be as natural and easy as the present irregularity ; for , ce n'est que le premier pas qui coûte .
Oblige a man to rise at four in the morning , and it is more than probable he will go willingly to bed at eight in the evening ; and , having had eight hours sleep , he will rise more willingly at four in the morning following .
But this sum of ninety - six millions and seventy - five thousand livres is not the whole of what may be saved by my economical project .
You may observe , that I have calculated upon only one half of the year , and much may be saved in the other , though the days are shorter .
Besides , the immense stock of wax and tallow left unconsumed during the summer , will probably make candles much cheaper for the ensuing winter , and continue them cheaper as long as the proposed reformation shall be supported .
For the great benefit of this discovery , thus freely communicated and bestowed by me on the public , I demand neither place , pension , exclusive privilege , nor any other reward whatever .
I expect only to have the honour of it .
And yet I know there are little , envious minds , who will , as usual , deny me this and say , that my invention was known to the ancients , and perhaps they may bring passages out of the old books in proof of it .
I will not dispute with these people , that the ancients knew not the sun would rise at certain hours ; they possibly had , as we have , almanacs that predicted it ; but it does not follow thence , that they knew he gave light as soon as he rose .
This is what I claim as my discovery .
If the ancients knew it , it might have been long since forgotten ; for it certainly was unknown to the moderns , at least to the Parisians , which to prove , I need use but one plain simple argument .
They are as well instructed judicious , and prudent a people as exist anywhere in the world all professing , like myself , to be lovers of economy ; and , from the many heavy taxes required from them by the necessitities of the state , have surely an abundant reason to be economical .
I say it is impossible that so sensible a people , under such circumstances , should have lived so long by the smoky , unwholesome , and enormously expensive light of candles , if they had really known , that they might have had as much pure light of the sun for nothing .
I am , &c .

The RIAA wants its money — and , more importantly , its verdict — to be reinstated in the Jammie Thomas file - swapping case in Minnesota .
Thomas , who was fined over $ 200,000 last year for trading several songs online , was granted a new trial recently after the judge decided that one of his jury instructions was incorrect as a matter of law .
That instruction said that jurors should consider Thomas guilty of " distributing " music even if the evidence only showed that she " made the files available . "
After reconsidering that point , the judge ordered a new trial .
This was a blow to the RIAA , as the Thomas case was the first file - sharing lawsuit to proceed all the way to a jury verdict .
The trade group said that it would no doubt win any new trial , since it also had evidence that Thomas had actually distributed several of the songs , but it would obviously prefer not to go through the entire expensive ordeal once more , especially since the verdict would be issued anew ( and might not go in the industry 's favor ) .
Who knew Duluth , Minnesota's
courthouse could be so exciting ?
Instead , the RIAA wants to appeal ( PDF ) to the Eighth Circuit — not the whole case , just the question about the jury instruction ( hat tip to lawyer Ray Beckerman for pointing out the filing ) .
The idea is that if the appeals court agrees with the RIAA , there 's no reason to have a new trial , since we already have a verdict from a trial in which that instruction was used .
" Either now or after a full retrial , the September 24 Order will be appealed , " says the RIAA .
In its view , better to answer the question about the jury instruction now than to waste time and money on another trial first .
Should the appeal be rejected , the new trial would simply continue as planned .
One wonders if Jammie Thomas had any idea when she decided to fight the case that it would consume several years of her life .
After seeing this sort of case play out , it 's clearer than ever why most people who receive prelitigation letters settle for a few thousand dollars rather than face years of legal uncertainty , the possibility of obscene verdicts , and the intensity of the public stare .

Turkish jets bomb Iraqi Kurds Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday October 6 , 2008
Print This Email This ANKARA ( AFP ) - The Turkish army on Monday stepped up operations against Kurdish rebels , bombing their hideouts both in neighbouring Iraq and inside Turkey after 17 soldiers were killed in a rebel attack last week .
The government meanwhile pondered new measures to curb the separatist Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , among them legal changes requested by the security forces to strengthen their hand in the struggle .
Fighter jets targeted PKK militants holed up in the Avasin Basyan area inside northern Iraq , following an initial operation Sunday night in which Turkish forces fired artillery at two other rebel groups detected in the same region along the border , the military said .
The raid -- the third inside northern Iraq since PKK militants crossing from their camps in the area attacked a Turkish border outpost -- was " successful , " it said , without mentioning rebel casualties .
Later in the day , fighter jets also struck PKK hideouts in the Buzul mountains in Turkey 's southeast , close to the scene of Friday 's attack , the military said .
It also announced that the bodies of two soldiers who were missing since Friday were found , bringing the death toll to 17 .
Clashes following the brazen daytime assault on the outpost left at least 23 PKK rebels dead , making the confrontation the bloodiest between the army and the militants this year , according to the army .
The PKK said earlier Monday it had the bodies of two soldiers .
It also claimed to have killed 62 troops and wounded more than 30 , while putting its own losses at nine .
In Ankara , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a meeting with his ministers of the interior , defence , justice and foreign affairs to discuss fresh measures after the attack on the outpost sparked nationwide outrage and triggered calls for tougher action against the PKK .
Parliament is expected to vote soon on extending by one year the government 's mandate for cross - border military strikes in northern Iraq , where Ankara estimates about 2,000 PKK militants are based .
Turkey has long accused the Iraqi Kurds of tolerating the PKK on their territory , where , it says , the militants easily obtain weapons and explosives for attacks on Turkish targets across the border .
Turkish anger with the Iraqi Kurds flared again following Friday 's bloodshed after the army said the rebels who attacked the outpost were backed by fire from heavy weapons positioned in northern Iraq .
" We have no support at all from the northern Iraqi administration ( against the rebels ) .
Let aside any support , they are providing ( the rebels with ) infrastructural capabilities such as hospitals and roads , " the army 's number two , General Hasan Igsiz , said Sunday .
The Iraqi authorities have repeatedly pledged to curb the PKK , listed as a terrorist group by Turkey and much of the international community , but say the group takes refuge in mountainous regions to which access is difficult .
Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said Monday that discussions were under way on five legal amendments requested by the army and the police to beef up the struggle against the PKK .
The security forces have often complained that certain reforms limiting their powers , passed recently as part of Turkey 's efforts to align with European Union norms , have hampered efforts against criminal groups .
The government , Sahin said , aims to resolve the issue " without giving concessions neither on security nor freedoms . "
The PKK took up arms for self - rule in Turkey 's predominantly Kurdish southeast in 1984 , sparking a conflict that has claimed about 44,000 lives .
There is a striking similarity between Barack Obama and his new nemesis , Sarah Palin - and it's not just that they are both big on basketball .
They have equally set out on what Obama likes to call an " improbable journey " that will see one of them make it all the way to the White House on November 4 .
In Palin 's case , the improbable journey began here : a sprawling wooden compound that looks like a cross between an oversized McDonald 's and a prison complex .
It occupies a patch of barren ground on the edge of Wasilla , the tiny town in Alaska in which she spent her childhood and cut her political teeth .
Above the entrance a banner announces that this is the home of the Wasilla Assembly of God , motto : " To know Him , and to make Him known ! "
It was here Palin was baptised , or " saved " , as she describes it , and later had her children baptised .
It was here she was inducted into the peculiar rituals of her fundamentalist faith - the charismatic preaching , the laying on of hands , the tears and cries of joy of the Pentecostal church .
" I grew up in the Wasilla Assembly of God , " she once said .
" Nothing freaks me out about the worship service . "
On the night I visit the church , the congregation is huddled in a group , arms raised or clasped around each other , as the senior pastor , Ed Kalnins , leads them in prayer .
" Lord , we know that you have made this church a platform , " he exclaims .
" You are using the wonderful Governor Palin to get your message of the gospel across . "
Pastor Ed , as his flock calls him , moved to Wasilla in 1999 - three years after the town elected Palin as its mayor .
What struck him the first time they met , he has said , was that in her eyes religion came first , politics second .
He thought to himself : " This person loves Jesus .
That 's the bottom line .
She loves Jesus with everything she has .
She is a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she is the mayor .
Sarah Palin is the real deal . "
Pastor Ed's language may be colourful .
But he has put his finger on a central truth about the woman who in two months ' time could become the next vice - president of the US .
From her earliest days at the bottom of the political ladder in minuscule Wasilla , through to her sudden rise this week into international stardom , she has always been on a mission .
Her trajectory has run in parallel with that of her party .
Her career took off precisely at the moment when the Christian right seized control of the Republican movement , casting out the fiscal conservatives who had traditionally held sway with their focus on such worldly matters as low taxes and small government .
The shift in the party 's focus from mammon to God is illustrated perfectly in Palin 's successful campaign to become mayor in 1996 .
All previous elections had revolved around such existential questions as how to improve the pavements and get litter off the streets .
She ignored all that , campaigning instead against abortion and gun control and casting aspersions on her ( Republican ) opponent about his infrequent attendance of church .
Victoria Naegele was editor of the local paper , The Frontiersman , at the time and can recall the shock of the Palin revolution .
" I remember thinking ' Wow !
Are religious issues really germane to the job of being mayor of a town of just 5,000 people ? ' "
Naegele remembers vividly too a second shockwave that came swiftly after Palin 's election .
Instead of easing her way into the role , she went in with guns blazing , demanding that six of the department heads of the council - none of them political appointments , several with many years ' service - submit their resignations .
When Naegele protested through the editorial columns of the paper at what she saw as the new mayor 's heavy - handed style , she felt the heat .
" It was a difficult time .
I was lambasted as a liberal , when in fact I am a Christian conservative Republican , just like Sarah Palin . "
Then , in an incident that is fast turning into the stuff of political legend , Palin was revealed earlier this week to have attempted to censor Wasilla 's library .
The idea is almost laughable when you see the library itself .
Its small collection of books includes a prominent section on hunting and fishing , and no visible copies of Lady Chatterley 's Lover .
Yet in 1996 , after parents complained about a book their child had taken home , Palin took umbrage .
Frustratingly , no one can remember the volume concerned .
What we do know is that Palin turned on the then librarian , Mary Ellen Emmons , asking her in a council meeting what she would do if she were told by the mayor to remove certain books from the collection .
Local resident Anne Kilkenny was in the public gallery and heard the librarian 's reaction : " She sucked in her breath , and replied that the books in the library were all acquired in accordance with professional criteria and she would resist completely . "
Palin has since claimed her question was purely rhetorical .
That is not how Naegele and Kilkenny perceived it at the time .
A few weeks later , Palin sent Emmons a letter terminating her employment .
" People in the town rose up in anger , " Kilkenny recalls .
" The library is an important institution in our city , as there 's not a lot else to do here in the winter but sit by the fire with a good book .
There was real public pressure , and Sarah was forced to rescind the letter . "
Emmons survived .
Others were less fortunate .
The museum director , city planner and public works director all quit within months of Palin 's ascendancy , and the police chief was sacked outright ( he sued for wrongful dismissal but lost ) .
Palin said the turnover was needed to clean out the " old boys ' club " .
Others were not so sure .
Again , she was utterly in tune with the trajectory of her party .
By the end of the 1990s the Republican leadership had adopted a modus operandi that also combined religious zealotry with managerial ruthlessness .
Yet this development was not without its detractors within the party .
One of the loudest critics was the very man who has put Palin on the national stage : John McCain .
Paradoxically , it was partly his disdain for the grip that TV preachers came to hold over the Republicans that earned him a reputation as a maverick .
Since then , Palin has travelled a huge distance in her journey towards the White House .
Two years ago she became Alaska 's first female governor , with some of the most valuable natural resources in the US under her control .
Stylistically , she 's become much more sophisticated .
But under the surface , the way of operating has changed little .
The religious mission is still front and centre of her politics .
She opposes abortion in all cases other than those in which the mother would die if she were to give birth .
She is a vocal opponent of gay marriage , and advocate of the teaching of anti-evolutionary creationism , or " intelligent design " , in schools .
Her religious beliefs extend to a conviction that the Iraq war is God 's will .
When she returned to Wasilla in June to pray with her old congregation , she said of the troops being posted to Iraq , including her own son , Track : " Our national leaders are sending them out on a task from God .
We have to pray there is a plan and that it 's God 's plan . "
Most poignantly , she will not countenance sex education for teenagers , preferring instead to preach that abstinence is the only complete protection against pregnancy or venereal disease .
It would be a cheap shot to suggest that this week 's bombshell revelation that her 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , is herself pregnant was Palin 's comeuppance .
But it would not be unfair to point out that Alaska has the highest per capita incidence of chlamydia in the country , and that the rate of teenage pregnancies across the US , including within her state , has just risen for the first time in 14 years - a trend many blame on George Bush 's preferment of abstinence - only education .
" It 's frustrating we are n't doing more to inform our children , " said Brittany Goodnight of the Alaska branch of Planned Parenthood .
If the religious flame still burns bright , so too does the ruthless determination .
In an echo of what happened to the librarian and police chief in Wasilla all those years ago , Palin is embroiled in a full - scale investigation by the Alaskan state legislature into allegations that she sacked the safety commissioner because he in turn refused to act against a police officer whom Palin wanted dismissed .
The officer , Mike Wooten , was the governor 's former brother - in - law , who had been through an acrimonious divorce from her sister .
Palin , her husband , Todd , and several of her aides tried to convince the commissioner , Walter Monegan , to fire Wooten , but he refused .
The casualties scattered along Palin 's path continue to mount .
Lyda Green , a neighbour of Palin's in Wasilla , has just become the latest .
She is stepping down as a state senator after 14 years .
Green is the leader of the Republicans in the Alaskan senate and an old - style fiscal conservative .
She voted against several of the governor 's most important initiatives over the past two years , including a move to increase taxes on the big oil and gas companies .
Green was surprised by the reprisals that followed .
" I found early on that if you disagreed with her it was not taken as a disagreement with policy , but a personal disagreement . "
First came the embarrassment of a radio interview between Palin and a local rightwing shock - jock in which the interviewer called Green a bitch and a cancer within the party .
Palin 's response on air ?
She laughed .
" She knew I 'm a cancer survivor - she sent me flowers , " Green says .
" That was a very lacklustre moment . "
Then Palin arranged for a friend to stand this summer against Green in the Republican party 's selection process for her own senate seat .
Green decided to stand down rather than go through a primary battle she was sure would be ugly .
" There came a point when I thought it was no longer worth it , " says Green .
" I did n't need , in a community as small as this , to stand in the face of this very popular governor . "
Then she adds : " But it 's not a way to run a government . "
That 's a pertinent observation , I suggest , in the light of the next destination Sarah Palin hopes to reach in her improbable journey .
" It is pertinent , " Green replies .
Putin v Palin : who would win in a shoot - out ?
American politicians have a long tradition of talking up their expertise with firearms .
Most recently , then - hopeful presidential candidate Mitt Romney was caught boasting he'd " been a hunter pretty much all my life " - by which , it turned out , he meant he'd been rabbit shooting twice .
But Sarah Palin 's claim seems far more justifiable : a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association , she 's been caribou hunting on numerous occasions , and footage exists of her firing an A4 assault rifle in Kuwait .
She has also taken a close personal interest in " aerial wolf gunning " , an Alaskan practice that involves exactly what you 'd imagine .
Vladimir Putin 's recent tiger - tranquillising triumph , on the other hand , raises numerous questions .
It was n't caught on camera , even though he was with a TV crew , whose lives he reportedly saved , and footage that was released showed another member of the crew explaining how to hold the weapon .
Firing a tranquilliser dart is easier , too : there 's less kickback .
Putin has been photographed brandishing a rifle in the past , but actual instances of shooting seem curiously absent .
Gun enthusiasts swooned over Palin in the US , though some noted the rifle in the Kuwait video appears to be a modified one , equipped with a laser ; you can't see the targets , but it 's likely she was shooting at a simulator screen .
Still , as one of the soldiers can be heard to observe , she 's apparently " hitting pretty close to dead centre " .
This may not be the most persuasive foreign policy qualification in presidential history , but if Palin had to face Putin in a shoot - out on an ice floe in the Bering Strait , it seems likely she 'd win .
Unless Dick Cheney was hunting in the vicinity , of course , in which case he 'd probably accidentally kill them both .
New Zealand has the sixth - biggest ecological footprint in the world , on a per capita basis , according to the World Wildlife Fund .
Reckless borrowing against Earth 's exhausted bounty is driving the planet toward an ecological " credit crunch " , the World Wildlife Fund has warned .
The group 's " Living Planet Report " ranks countries according to their ecological footprints .
First on the list is United Arab Emirates , followed by the United States , Kuwait and Denmark .
Australia is fifth .
The WWF says growing demands on natural capital - such as forests , water , soil , air and biodiversity - already outstrip the world 's capacity to renew these resources by a third .
" If our demands on the planet continue to increase at the same rate , by the mid-2030s we would need the equivalent of two planets to maintain our lifestyles , " WWF director general James Leape says .
The cost of bailing out financial institutions during the economic meltdown , while huge , pales in comparison to the lost value caused every year by ecological damage to the environment , experts say .
Ecological credit crunch - WWF
A European Union study calculates that the world is losing between $ US2 and $ US5 trillion in natural capital every year due to the degradation of the ecosystems .
" The world is currently struggling with the consequences of over - valuing financial assets , " Mr Leape says .
" But a more fundamental crisis looms , an ecological credit crunch caused by under - valuing the environmental assets that are the basis of all life and prosperity . "
The report shows that more than three quarters of the planet 's population live in nations that are ecological debtors - countries where consumption outstrips biological capacity .
Produced with the Zoological Society of London and the Global Footprint Network , the bi-annual study measures the ecological footprint of human demand on natural resources , and assesses Earth 's ability to remain a " living planet . "
The 2008 edition shows a drop off of nearly 30 % since 1970 in some 5,000 monitored populations of 1,686 different species .
Declines are closer to 50 % in tropics , which contain the highest concentration of biodiversity in the world and serve as a brake on global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
Deforestation , land conversion , pollution , over - fishing and climate change are the main drivers of environmental degradation .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama has decided to keep Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in his post , a show of bipartisan continuity in a time of war that will be the first time a Pentagon chief has been carried over from a president of a different party , Democrats close to the transition said Tuesday .
Mr. Obama ’s advisers were nearing a formal agreement with Mr. Gates to stay on for perhaps a year , the Democrats said , and they expected to announce the decision as early as next week , along with other choices for the national security team .
The two sides have been working out details on how Mr. Gates would wield authority in a new administration .
The move will give the new president a defense secretary with support on both sides of the aisle in Congress , as well as experience with foreign leaders around the world and respect among the senior military officer corps .
But two years after President Bush picked him to lead the armed forces , Mr. Gates will now have to pivot from serving the commander in chief who started the Iraq war to serving one who has promised to end it .
In deciding to ask Mr. Gates to stay , Mr. Obama put aside concerns that he would send a jarring signal after a political campaign in which he made opposition to the war his signature issue in the early days .
Some Democrats who have advised his campaign quietly complained that he was undercutting his own message and risked alienating war critics who formed his initial base of support , especially after tapping his primary rival , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , for secretary of state .
DIGG THIS
In an interview promoting his recently published book about the World Bank Steve Berkman , a 16 - year veteran of the Bank and former head of its anti-corruption department , asserts that the World Bank is corrupt .
As one of his many pieces of evidence he cites the forced resignation or firing of Paul Wolfowitz as World Bank President in the spring of 2007 over allegations that Wolfowitz had improperly employed his girl friend and increased her salary in contravention of Bank policy .
Berkman asserts that this was just a pretext to get rid of Wolfowitz who had held up the funding for several projects in India and other countries pending corruption investigations by the Bank .
Since Wolfowitz was a key architect of the United States ' Iraq war and war on terrorism in his position as Deputy Secretary of Defense under Donald Rumsfeld there are no doubt any number of reasons why his tenure at the World Bank was opposed by the Bank 's member countries and management .
So while this makes great headlines for marketing Berkman 's book the real story is the Bank itself and the numerous stories of corruption at the World Bank which Berkman discusses .
This will come as no surprise to libertarians and Austrian economists who know all too well the sad legacy of the corrupting influence of government money and the squandering of capital whether in a rich or poor country .
Government enterprises are inherently flawed since in addition to being morally wrong ( they are redistributors of wealth forcibly taken from private taxpayers ) they invest and provide funding for businesses and projects the private sector avoids which necessarily indicates these are bad businesses or projects for investment .
The World Bank was created July 1 , 1944 as part of the agreements reached at Bretton Woods to provide for reconstruction and development of post - war Europe and Asia .
The Bank now provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries in Africa , South America and Asia .
The Bank provides low - interest loans , interest - free credit and grants to developing countries ( primarily governments ) for education , health , infrastructure , communications and other purposes while its affiliate , the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) , provides debt and equity capital to private sector businesses .
The Bank is headquartered in Washington , D.C. with an international staff of over 10,000 employees deployed in offices around the world .
The Bank is funded through the sale of bonds and from contributions by its 185 member countries .
The Bank consists of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) and the International Development Association ( IDA ) .
The IBRD focuses on middle income and creditworthy poor countries , while IDA focuses on the poorest countries in the world .
Affiliated with the World Bank and making up what is referred to as the World Bank Group are the IFC , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) .
The current President of the Bank as well as President of the IFC and the Bank 's affiliates is Robert B. Zoellick who was elected by the Bank 's Board of Governors July 1 , 2007 following the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz .
Before taking on these roles with the World Bank Group Zoellick was an investment banker with Goldman Sachs , worked in the US State Department , was the US Trade Representative , was an Executive Vice President of Fannie Mae and worked in the Treasury Department .
He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Prior to Wolfowitz the President of the World Bank was an Australian , James D. Wolfensohm , an investment banker with Salomon Brothers , Schroeders ( of London ) and Darling & Co ( Australia ) as well as being a director of the Rockefeller Foundation , the Brookings Institute and also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
From its earliest days most of the Presidents of the Bank have come out of the United States ' banking community along with some senior political appointees .
Murray Rothbard has described in some detail the relationship which exists between the commercial banking community and American foreign policy including the United States ' participation in the World Bank .
In contrast to his predecessor and successor Wolfowitz is not an investment banker but is an academic and has been in the employ of the Pentagon during most of his government service which began in the early 1970s .
The Bank needs projects to fund in order to create the rationale for issuance of its bonds which are sold through investment bankers thereby serving as the source of funding for its investment bankers and the many consultants , suppliers and contractors retained for its projects .
Wolfowitz 's hold on the funding of certain projects created a great deal of resentment within the Bank as well as those to be benefitted from the funding of these projects by the Bank .
Thus , it is not surprising that such a controversial President would soon be pushed out by the bureaucrats and board members of the Bank .
The World Bank forms only part of the network of government sponsored multilateral agencies which exist not only in the US ( e.g. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export - Import Bank of the United States ) but in other countries as well ; in addition to regional development banks such as the Asian Development Bank headquartered in Manila .
The purpose of all these agencies is to promote international development by governments through direct grants as well as loans , guarantees of loans , provision of political risk insurance and similar programs for private sector businesses and projects .
The Bank ( as well as these multilateral agencies ) redistributes money from the taxpayers of its member countries to the beneficiaries receiving funding .
These are businesses and development projects that the private sector would not otherwise fund due to the risk ( political or economic ) or uneconomic nature of the project or enterprise .
Thus , inherent in the provision of any government funding by the World Bank ( whether in the form of grants , loans or equity investment ) or insurance coverage is the uneconomic nature of the investment i.e. they are malinvestments and thus represent a waste of precious capital ( forcibly taken from private taxpayers ) .
This is not dissimilar from the malinvestment scheme currently being promoted by Lehman Brothers ' Felix Rohatyn for the United States .
It is not surprising with so much money being thrown at politicians and bureaucrats that there is corruption — it would be surprising if there were not .
As Berkman says the Bank enriches the government elites of the Third World while creating massive amounts of debt which cannot be repaid .
" [ T ]he Bank pretends it is lending for noble purposes , while the borrowers pretend they will put the money to good use , " says Berkman .
Instead the money is put into the hands of government officials and leaders who historically have looted their national treasuries .
Ten percent of the $ 20 billion disbursed by the Bank each year is lost to corruption and it is estimated that 25 to 35 % of total lending is lost to corruption .
While the corruption takes many forms of course here are just a few examples :
Shell companies paid for goods and services that were never delivered
Tainted pharmaceuticals bought by the Bank for distribution to the public
Faulty AIDS testing kits bought by the Bank
Bank benchmark certification achievement for a hospital built with Bank funds when in fact all that existed was a hole in the ground
Bribes and kickbacks being paid to senior government officials while suppliers go unpaid
Farmers aid programs billed for hundreds of thousands of dollars for office furniture , vehicles , lodging , air conditioners , fencing , household furniture rather than aid to the farmers
As important as it is to weed out corruption it is equally important to understand the inherent mismanagement and malinvestment ( along with corruption ) which occurs in the Bank 's funding process .
I say inherent because the basic premise for the Bank 's existence — to invest in projects the private sector would not touch — is flawed and thus with $ 20 billion of someone else 's money ( taxpayers money or central - bank - created fiat money ) to be distributed annually by a large political bureaucracy in countries around the world for allocation to projects which are inherently malinvestments ( not investments seeking a market financial return ) there can be no other result than corruption , mismanagement and malinvestment .
A case study of the Ivory Coast will suffice to paint the picture of how the World Banku2018s process works and the manner in which the government and the ruling elite of a country ( this can be applied to any country not just the one in the case study ) operate in their dealings with the Bank .
After a generation of relative success ( 8 % annual growth rates ) following World War II due to a relatively competitive free enterprise system the Ivory Coast experienced a slump from which it has yet to pull out .
Notwithstanding its recognition of the problem the World Bank was powerless to assist the country despite it being the country 's largest creditor .
Following the Ivory Coast 's post - war economic success the government extended its authority over the economy and allocation of resources as it began to develop large inefficient infrastructure projects which were financed by the World Bank .
The World Bank did not require that their loans provide a financial return .
The ruling elite withdrew ( legally and illegally ) sizeable percentages of the capital loaned by the Bank to the government .
The loans eventually represented as much as 85 % of the country 's GDP .
The country became dominated and controlled by a small governing minority acting as intermediary between the populace and the international marketplace and community ( as well as intermediary domestically ) similar to the social and governing structure which existed during the period of French colonialism .
The concentration of more power in the central government allowed the urban elite to keep its grasp on power by holding back rural development .
The primary means for this control was the central purchasing authority for the nation 's coffee and cocoa production .
Since it had the government granted monopoly this authority purchased all the coffee and cocoa production of the country and then resold it on the world market .
Since the government was the sole purchaser of coffee and cocoa production in the country it could dictate prices to the producers which it did at rates representing only 37 % of the world prices .
Natually , the government reaped substantial revenues from such an arrangement in addition to controlling the primary export market of the Ivory Coast .
Originally the World Bank 's analysis supported the government 's interventionist model which declared that the success of the country was due to the government 's intervention in the economy and the implementation of the government 's economic policies .
Thus , the Bank 's objective was to strengthen the state in order to promote more coherent economic policies .
This centralized planning by a one - party state allowed the government to control the allocation of resources and distribution of wealth within the country which became an obstacle to economic growth and improvement in the prosperity of the country 's citizens .
The World Bank was , wittingly or unwittingly , a co-conspirator in this gradual destruction of the Ivory Coast 's economy as it continued to provide funding to meet the growing budgetary deficits of the government .
Then in 1982 the World Bank 's analysis changed .
Government intervention along with the centralized purchasing agency was viewed as the problem not the cure .
The price controls of the central purchasing authority were recognized by the Bank as a primary cause of the income inequality in the country .
The more interventionist ( e.g. taxes and regulations ) the slower the economic growth and the more unequal the distribution of incomes .
The World Bank began to propose market - oriented reforms which of course were viewed by the government and the ruling elite as a threat to their continued authority and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the rest of the populace .
The government and the ruling elite ignored the Bank 's proposals for reform while the Bank kept lending the country money .
Why and how this happened is a case study in the functioning of bureaucracies especially government bureaucracies .
As the World Bank 's reform proposals began to be pressed with the ruling elite the reaction was typical Third - World spin .
The World Bank was said to be an instrument of the rich Western nations which wanted to keep the Ivory Coast poor ( this was the unintended consequence of the Bank 's funding of this malinvestment ) .
The ruling elite said the World Bank wanted to keep the country dependent on coffee and cocoa at the expense of the country industrializing .
Lastly , the government used its support of the Western countries in Africa as extortion to maintain the flow of World Bank funds .
At the personnel level the government bureaucrats who manage these programs were relatively senior and part of the ruling elite .
They had a vested interest in making sure taxes were collected and expenditures paid .
They were not penalized for expenditures exceeding tax collections .
Thus , the government bureaucrats were only interested in getting more funding to make up the government 's budget deficits .
On the other side the Bank personnel were rewarded with the continuation of their employment with the Bank and advancement within the Bank by increasing the number and a size of their loan portfolio — there was no incentive based on financial returns .
The Bank 's loan officers were only interested in keeping the funding flowing to the government for as long as possible .
Thus , despite the analysis by the Bank 's analysts ( the analysts operated independently of the loan administrators ) pointing out the negative effects of the state 's interventionist policies and the detrimental effects of the central purchasing authority the Ivory Coast kept borrowing and the World Bank kept lending .
Eventually , in 1990 the Bank stopped its loans to the Ivory Coast and soon after the country slipped into civil war among its competing political groups .
The World Bank will never be able to assist nations such as the Ivory Coast to transition from poverty to prosperity — first , because it fails the basic premise of investment in that it is not a private wealth - generating institution whose objective is to make a return commensurate with the risk of its investments but merely operates as a wealth transfer and redistribution intermediary taking wealth from the taxpayers of one country to redistribute to the ruling elite of another country and second , because it is not willing to adopt the Rothbard Plan and embrace the radical conversion of its client countries to the free market as a condition to any funding by the Bank ( moreover the Rothbard Plan would reject any loans from the Bank ) .
The dimensions of the proffered Rothbard Plan for desocialization should now be clear : ( 1 ) Enormous and drastic reductions in taxes , government employment , and government spending .
( 2 ) Complete privatization of government assets : where possible to return them to the original expropriated owners or their heirs ; failing that , granting shares to productive workers and peasants who had worked on these assets .
( 3 ) Honoring complete and secure property rights for all owners of private property .
Since full property rights imply the complete freedom to make exchanges and transfer property rights , there must be no government interference in such exchanges .
( 4 ) Depriving the government of the power to create money , best done by a fundamental that at one and the same time liquidates the central bank and uses its gold to redeem its notes and deposits at a newly defined unit of gold weight of existing currencies .
All this could and should be done in one day , although the monetary reform could be done in steps taking a few days .
Even if the World Bank bureaucrats could accept the concepts of the Rothbard Plan they could never agree to the timetable for its immediate implementation preferring instead a period of transition over months or even years ; but as Rothbard explains time is of the essence and critical to its success since the free market is an interconnected web of lattice - work ; it is made of innumerable parts which intricately mesh together through a network of producers and entrepreneurs exchanging property titles .
Holding back , freeing only a few areas at a time , will only impose continuous distortions that will cripple the workings of the market and discredit it in the already fearful and suspicious public .
Thus , the only solution for poor countries desiring prosperity is adoption of the Rothbard Plan , avoidance of funding by multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the liquidation or privatization of the World Bank ( and other multilateral agencies ) to stop its continuous legacy of inherent corruption , mismanagement and malinvestment which keeps the populace of the Bank 's clients poor while enriching their governments and ruling elites .

The economics of cannabis- cultivation in Europe Subtitle A.C.M. Jansen [*]
1 . Introduction Eurocannabis represents a rather new cannabis variety .
It is mainly , but not exclusively , produced indoors , under artificial light .
It is grown on specially enriched soils or with hydroponics , and its growth cycle has been shortened to less than three months .
Compared with cannabis from traditional producing countries , Eurocannabis has a different ' appearance ' , a different taste and smell , as well as a different ' high ' .
In terms of THC content , the new product may be called ' strong ' when compared with marihuanas from overseas .
But Eurocannabis does n't generally exceed the strength of hashish , the refined products from countries such as Morocco , Libanon and Pakistan .
To economists , Eurocannabis presents a rather interesting case of ' import substitution ' .
Only a few decades ago , the growing of psychotropic cannabis was largely confined to regions outside the Western world .
Cannabis products had to be imported .
Nowadays Eurocannabis is taking over this - illegal - market in a rather spectacular way .
It is estimated that around 25 % of European cannabis consumption is accounted for by indigenous production .
Countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands even reach levels of around 75 % .
And at an international scale the Dutch cannabis sector even shows signs of ' a competitive advantage ' .
Economic theory provides an explanation for both the import substitution tendencies and the resulting global shift of cannabis production towards the Western world .
2 . The Western cannabis guerrilla Eurocannabis , its taste , its economic structure and development , its high levels of innovation and growth , its rates of return , et cetera , et cetera , could not have emerged and cannot be explained without referring to the illegal status of cannabis .
The worldwide prohibition of cannabis has of course not prohibited the supply .
As worded in an old economic law : " Where a demand emerges , the supply will follow " .
The high prices for imported cannabis in the Western world have provided the economic feasibility of cannabis production under artificial light .
' Theoretically ' , attempts to substitute imports of cannabis could have taken place anywhere in the world , and indeed , to some extent this has been the case anywhere in the Western world ( Clarke , 1998 ) .
But , during the eighties , the Netherlands presented itself as a rather ideal ' incubation environment ' for further developing both the genetics and the production techniques of Eurocannabis .
In this country , the breeding of new strains , suitable for different ( climatic ) conditions , could take place in a legal way .
At the time , the production of hemp seeds was not against Dutch law .
The same applied to experiments with new production techniques .
They were highly innovative - and they had to be .
But the experiments could nevertheless benefit from the existence of a ' cluster ' of enterprises offering services and equipment for intensive horticulture , which in the Netherlands already had enjoyed a rather impressive ' competitive advantage ' on the world market for some decades .
These two favourable circumstances explain why , already halfway the eighties , a rather high - quality outdoor - grown cannabis could be produced in the Netherlands .
Nevertheless , this outdoor - grown cannabis , called ' Netherweed ' , has never been very successful on the market .
Crops were either taken by the police or , more importantly , were stolen by robbers .
So , in the second half of the eighties the ' infant ' cannabis industry moved from ' outdoor ' to ' indoor ' cultivation ( Jansen , 1993 ) .
The feasibility of growing cannabis under artificial lights had already become clear in the United States , where experiments with indoor cultivation were inspired by harsher cannabis policies during the second half of the seventies ( Bergman , 2002 ) .
An influential American handbook ( by Cervantes ) for indoor growing was published as early as 1983 - and was translated into Dutch in 1988 .
The American insights were further developed in a rather spectacular way , again facilitated by the existing Dutch horticultural cluster .
It would go too far here to describe the development of all innovations which brought about the exceptional increase of ' floor productivity ' .
Suffice it to say that , eventually , some four crops a year proved to be possible , which means an annual yield of over one kilogram of Eurocannabis per square meter .
Innovations did not only relate to genetics , fertilizers , lighting , air conditioning and pest control , but also to the fighting of smell and the prevention of noise .
It goes without saying that all technical ( and managerial ) innovations reflect the illegality of Eurocannabis .
3 . The Dutch ' Green Avalanche '
By the end of the eighties , in terms of both quality and ' indoor productivity ' rate , Eurocannabis could be considered as a ' commercial product ' .
However , ' market forces ' specific to the Netherlands prohibited an easy and early commercial success .
Remarkably , in the eighties the so - called ' hash coffee shop ' proved an impediment rather than an inducement to selling Eurocannabis .
During the eighties , high - quality hashish from all over the world was offered in coffee shops on an almost permanent basis , and this refined product with a high THC percentage was preferred by most Dutch cannabis consumers .
Until 1990 , hardly any coffee shop had the new cannabis variety ' on the menu ' .
Eurocannabis , with its different colour , taste and smell , obviously did n't appeal .
Therefore , its production volume was negligible and - with a few exceptions - growing it was not very profitable .
A rather sudden and massive change of ' consumer preference ' was brought about largely by rumours in the regular Dutch press - rumours which were corroborated by analyses of confiscated cannabis .
' Peaks ' of no less than 25 % THC were reported .
These reports were not quite truthful .
Extensive research in the second half of the nineties showed that Eurocannabis offered in Dutch coffee shops contained an average THC percentage of around 10 % , well below the ' strength ' of foreign hashish varieties offered in the same establishments ( Niesink , 2000 ) .
But this way of ' official advertising ' did open the backdoors of the Dutch coffee shops for Eurocannabis at an amazing speed .
Unlike the eighties , when the coffee shops rather prevented an early success of Eurocannabis on the market , during the nineties these very same establishments suddenly became of strategic importance for a very swift process of import substitution .
The exploding demand for Eurocannabis had to be met - and indeed was met - by an avalanche - like growth of production .
The ' Green Avalanche ' would indeed be an appropriate economic metaphor to describe the sector 's developments during the nineties in the Netherlands .
Within a period of ten years , more than 80 % of the domestic demand for cannabis in the Netherlands was met through domestic production .
Obviously , the worldwide prohibition created the right circumstances for a very successful cannabis guerrilla .
Field research ( Jansen , 1993 ; 1996 ; 2002 ) makes it rather certain that the ' Green Avalanche ' has been brought about mainly ( though not exclusively ) by tens of thousands of small , mostly urban , producers .
By looking at the menus in coffee shops and , of course , through conversations with coffee shop owners and cannabis producers , one can make rather sure that the backdoors of the coffee shops were not so much visited by ' organized crime ' but , generally , by producers with an annual production of less than 10 kilograms .
In other words , not only consumer preferences changed dramatically during the nineties , the distribution patterns changed as well : local suppliers and a direct supply of Eurocannabis to coffee shops got the upper hand .
4 . ' Grow shops '
The emergence of shops where all requirements for an illegal cannabis production are available without legal impediment - the so - called ' grow shops ' - have been of strategic importance for the unprecedented growth of small pseudo or part - time entrepreneurs in the last decade of the twentieth century .
Where less than 10 of these grow shops were counted in the early nineties , no less than 300 of them existed at the end of the decade .
The indoor production of marihuana requires extensive knowledge .
Even nowadays - way past the experimental stage of the eighties - a successful indoor production still takes quite some learning and expertise .
Face - to - face contacts and a free exchange of information , always essential to the early stages in the development of a product , have facilitated the ' Green Avalanche ' .
The grow shops sold the requirements for indoor cannabis production but , more importantly , they also distributed knowledge and expertise in a rather efficient way .
They may be seen as centres of learning .
The close contacts between grow shops and producers , moreover , are a reason to see these shops as centres of continuous innovation as well .
Obviously , the high profit rates have encouraged large - scale operations .
Even during the eighties , large - scale growing operations and even ' internationally organized crime ' have been observed in the Netherlands .
And indeed , large - scale operations nowadays seem to play a substantial role in a new stage of sector development following a decade of ' import substitution ' .
But again , because of the emergence of hundreds of grow shops and the existence of more than a thousand coffee shops , a multitude of small - scale producers could be recruited .
They have played a dominant role in bringing about the ' Green Avalanche ' in the Netherlands that has been responsible for the stunning pace at which import substitution took place during the nineties .
5 . From import substitution to a ' competitive advantage '
Not only the Netherlands , but other countries in the Western world as well ( Switzerland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand ) have reached similar high levels of cannabis import substitution .
Of course , circumstances of these countries accounted for different developments .
( Avalanches in Switzerland and the Netherlands consequently differ . )
But in the Netherlands ( and possibly Canada ) import substitution seems to have evolved into a stage of ' competitive advantage ' , by which the economist Michael Porter ( 1990 ) means that an industry is able to compete successfully at international markets .
Indeed , Porter 's theoretical insights on the importance of innovation as well as the importance of local conditions of demand and production are illustrated abundantly in the economic history of Eurocannabis ( Jansen , 2002 ) .
A local market of critical consumers , quite characteristic for the Dutch cannabis sector in the eighties , provided the conditions for a future ' competitive advantage ' , because they induced quality improvements .
The emergence of a multitude of lcal producers has stimulated the efficiency of production and has contributed to the development of both a ' knowledge base ' and an ' economic infrastructure ' which provided all sorts of goods and services to support product quality and the level of competitiveness .
Obviously , Porter 's ' diamond ' of four ' determinants ' ( see figure 1 ) shows a variety of vital interactions between economic activity on the one hand and a supporting local environment on the other .
Porter does n't consider specific governmental measures to promote ' a competitive advantage ' to be of great benefit .
On the contrary , they may even be counterproductive .
Government help that removes the pressure on firms to improve and upgrade , may prevent these firms from reaching the stage of ' competitive advantage ' .
As figure 1 illustrates , government policy influences the national ' diamond ' rather than being part of it .
The economics of an illegal production such as Eurocannabis makes a government a very powerful influencer of the ' diamond ' .
The worldwide prohibition of cannabis has indeed provided the circumstances for high levels of innovation and growth , which generally characterizes cannabis industry in the Western world .
Figure 1 . Porter 's model of competitive advantage .
6 . A ' competitive advantage ' Compared to the Netherlands , most European countries show rather modest levels of import substitution of around 25 % .
Hashish from overseas still seems to be preferred in most European countries , a situation similar to that in the Netherlands during the eighties .
Apart from consumer preferences , import substitution will probably never take on the avalanche - like characteristics that occurred in the Netherlands , if only because of the absence of a tolerated network for cannabis in the other European countries .
Moreover , traditional producing countries have responded to the challenge of Eurocannabis by offering cannabis products of higher quality .
Even in the Netherlands , domestic producers are once more facing tougher competition from hashish from traditional production countries .
At the same time , however , the Dutch cannabis sector seems to be benefiting from a ' competitive advantage ' , which means that the Dutch product seems to be able to increase its market share at the European level .
Nowadays , production figures in this country exceed domestic demand already several times .
One should perhaps not so much emphasize the final product Eurocannabis , but rather the ' competitive advantage ' of Dutch seeds , equipment and other requirements for growing cannabis indoors .
Dutch innovative products , specifically developed to boost both productivity and the quality of Eurocannabis and to evade police attention , continue to provide the very basis for import substitution at the European level .
And although , as already mentioned , import substitution of cannabis appears to be rather modest in most European countries , growth rates will continue to be spectacular , whatever government policy will be at stake .
7 . Profit levels of Eurocannabis Efforts to eradicate the production of cannabis at a world scale have not resulted in less production , but in other ways of production .
The global shift of cannabis production towards Western countries actually shows the superiority of Western guerrilla techniques , compared to those used by producers from traditional cannabis countries .
Because of eradication programmes , producers in traditional cannabis countries have taken refuge in peripheral areas or made their crops less visible by small - scale production , hidden between other crops .
In the Western world , with the help of science and technology , production could be hidden as well : indoors , under artificial light .
That new way of guerilla production proved not only feasible , but turned out to be much and much more profitable as well .
Producers in traditional cannabis countries ultimately do not receive much more than a few percent of the price that Western consumers pay for their product ( see e.g .
Nadelmann , 1989 ) .
Guerrilla farming in the Netherlands and elsewhere turns out to be a lot more profitable .
Producers of Eurocannabis get at least 50 % of consumer prices .
To put it differently : import substitution could ( and can ) benefit hugely from exorbitant commercial profits made on the import of cannabis from outside .
These circumstances , as well as Porter 's theoretical insights , show the futility of the attempts to eradicate cannabis production .
As a reaction of these endeavours , the economics of cannabis have become ' versatile ' if only because of the profitability of a single square meter .
It goes without saying therefore that , in the Netherlands , all governmental efforts to brake the ' Green Avalanche ' have been in vain .
They certainly have not resulted in reduced production , and they have kept prices high .
Quite obviously , these efforts have induced innovations in the industry ( and criminality ) .

NEW YORK -- Albert Pujols views MVP voting a little differently these days .
" You have to consider everything .
You have to put all the numbers together , " the St. Louis Cardinals star said Monday after powering past Philadelphia Phillies slugger Ryan Howard to win the award for the second time .
Pujols won despite the Cardinals finishing in fourth place , the lowest spot for an NL MVP winner since Andre Dawson and Chicago Cubs wound up sixth in 1987 .
Howard led the majors in home runs and RBIs for the World Series champs .
The result will surely renew a debate that Pujols once raised himself :
What qualifies as " most valuable " ?
In 2006 , a month after leading the Cardinals to the World Series crown , Pujols carped when Howard -- whose Phillies missed the playoffs -- captured the coveted award .
" I see it this way : Someone who does n't take his team to the playoffs does n't deserve to win the MVP , " Pujols said at that time .
Shortly thereafter , Pujols clarified his remarks and said Howard was certainly worthy of the award .
" I think the writers made the right choice in 2006 , " Pujols reiterated Monday .
" He did deserve it . "
Just as Pujols believed he earned it this year .
" I was n't surprised at all , " he said .
Pujols hit .357 with 37 home runs and 116 RBIs while playing with a sore right elbow that required surgery .
Howard hit 48 homers with 146 RBIs for the Phillies .
Voting was completed before the playoffs began .
" I 'm happy I did n't have to make that decision , " Pujols said on a conference call from his St. Louis home .
" What you do for your team .
The players who take their teams to the playoffs should have some consideration . "
As Diwali 2008 is about to start ( October 28 ) , the BBC shares Some Diwali Basics with us as well as ways for British schools to get kids to know about it .
Basic Diwali facts
I picked from the article :
" The word Diwali means " rows of lighted lamps " and the celebration is often referred to as the Festival of Lights because of the common practice of lighting small oil lamps ( called diyas ) and placing them around the home , in courtyards and in gardens , as well as on roof - tops and outer walls .
During this time , homes are thoroughly cleaned , windows are opened and diyas are lit as a greeting to Lakshmi , goddess of wealth .
In urban areas candles or electric lights are often substituted for diyas .
During Diwali , gifts are exchanged and festive meals are prepared .
The celebration means as much to Hindus as Christmas does to Christians .
Because there are many regions in India , there are many different versions of the Diwali festival . "
As I mentioned in 2007 , the holiday season usually sees the release of a number of movies hoping to break through .
No big hype this year according to Diwali 2008 : Four movie releases ( Business of Cinema ) .
Amongst the 4 movies released on October 24 and October 29 , Roadside Romeo is an animated movie which they feel " has limited appeal and is releasing only in multiplexes . "
In a different niche Fashion sees Priyanka Chopra in a serious drama in a city setting and aims for the more urban crowd , they feel .
The other 2 releases are Heroes and Golmaal Returns ( picture below ) , they describe the first as as a patriotic flick and the second as a comic caper with a dance soundtrack to match .
In the US , many locales have already held festivities over the week - end .

Let GM Fall By James West
Nov 17 2008 11:31 AM www.midasletter.com
I expect this article will make me in the neighborhood of at least 300,000 new enemies .
That ’s how many employees GM has .
However , the unfortunate thing about truth is that it is relentless and apathetic .
Please do n’t confuse the messenger with the cause .
The reason GM should be allowed to fall is because in its current state , its production overcapacity , if maintained by government money , can only churn out even more cars that nobody wants or can afford to buy .
In other words , it would only prolong the inevitable .
The fact that its management team clung to the illusion of perpetual growth and refused to acknowledge the irrefutable business cycle demonstrates gross incompetence , the result of which should be annihilation .
That ’s what ’s going to happen regardless of how much money is pumped into General Motors or the economy in general .
It is the excess liquidity in the system that exacerbates the peaks and troughs of natural business cycles , and so pouring more and more into the system only confounds the economy ’s natural ability to repair itself through an unfettered continuation of the cycle .
Bear in mind that all that GM represents is not going to disappear in a puff of smoke if they declare bankruptcy .
The assets will merely be re-allocated to other automotive corporations , and the industry itself will become slightly more efficient , and contract as it needs to .
Autoworkers who are skilled and reliable will have to add resourceful to their repertoire to stay viable in a contracting economy .
There are just too many autoworkers and zippo demand for their product .
Since everybody ’s had access to all the cheap liquidity for nearly a decade now , and has got two cars and a parking lot full of brand new recreational vehicles ( if they have n’t yet been located by repo man ) , pumping capital into GM is like trying to continue filling up a bathtub with water after its already full .
It only makes a big mess , the water is wasted , and the more you continue trying , the bigger the mess gets and the more the resource is wasted .
The situation we ’re in should be a plain signal to the world ’s leaders that over - capacity across all industries , fuelled by years of near - zero cost credit , is the result of excess liquidity .
The economy , contrary to modern economic theory , simply cannot expand ad infinitum no matter how cheap money is .
This only causes overproduction of resources , overproduction of products , and volatility in the business cycle .
On the off chance that is n’t clear enough , hear it is again : Perpetual economic growth is impossible .
I think this is the fundamental flaw in all of our G8 leadership ’s assumptions .
If we were to allow the economy to undulate in terms of growth and contraction in a uniform wave pattern , much as nearly all natural systems in biology and physics do , then our existence perhaps becomes sustainable .
The current economic policies cause artificially high concentrations of demand because the net result of excess speculation on the long side in any market creates the illusion of physical demand , which in turn promotes productivity .
We end up consuming our finite natural resources prematurely , and the truly destructive effect will be felt more acutely as generations progress .
Imagine your grandson or granddaughter trying to buy real estate or gas or gold after decades of increasing real demand ( population expansion ) and diminishing production of everything due to shortage of raw materials .
Imagine the prices .
Trying to force continuous and perpetual economic growth through credit and monetary expansion is just plain suicidal , in the long term .
It aggravates peaks and troughs into angry jagged lines that inflate the casualties both human and economic obscenely .
The revision in economic policy required to facilitate that reality does not , at this time , appear to be forthcoming .
At least , not while George Bush is still flapping his gums and swaggering around the podium playing president .
His address to the G20 meetings makes it clear that he is still preoccupied with asserting U.S. unilateralism when it comes to joint foreign policy decisions .
I do n’t know what the G20 leaders were hoping for .
This meeting should not have happened until Obama was in the driver ’s seat .
I ’m sure they all realize that now .
Its clear that Bush seeks to establish credit for initiating the recovery that also is not yet forthcoming .

" No information today .
No comment , " a Somali pirate shouts over the sound of breaking waves , before abruptly ending the satellite telephone call .
They wed the most beautiful girls ; they are building big houses ; they have new cars ; new guns
Garowe resident Abdi Farah Juha
Life in Somalia 's pirate town Somali pirates face battles at sea
He sounds uptight - anxious to see if a multi-million dollar ransom demand will be met .
He is on board the hijacked Ukrainian vessel , MV Faina - the ship laden with 33 Russian battle tanks that has highlighted the problem of piracy off the Somali coast since it was captured almost a month ago .
But who are these modern - day pirates ?
According to residents in the Somali region of Puntland where most of the pirates come from , they live a lavish life .
Fashionable " They have money ; they have power and they are getting stronger by the day , " says Abdi Farah Juha who lives in the regional capital , Garowe .
The crew on MV Faina are reportedly being well - looked after " They wed the most beautiful girls ; they are building big houses ; they have new cars ; new guns , " he says .
" Piracy in many ways is socially acceptable .
They have become fashionable . "
Most of them are aged between 20 and 35 years - in it for the money .
And the rewards they receive are rich in a country where almost half the population need food aid after 17 years of non -stop conflict .
Most vessels captured in the busy shipping lanes of the Gulf of Aden fetch on average a ransom of $ 2 m .
This is why their hostages are well looked after .
The BBC 's reporter in Puntland , Ahmed Mohamed Ali , says it also explains the tight operation the pirates run .
They are never seen fighting because the promise of money keeps them together .
Wounded pirates are seldom seen and our reporter says he has never heard of residents along Puntland 's coast finding a body washed ashore .
Given Somalia 's history of clan warfare , this is quite a feat .
It probably explains why a report of a deadly shoot - out amongst the pirates onboard the MV Faina was denied by the vessel 's hijackers .
Pirate spokesman Sugule Ali told the BBC Somali Service at the time : " Everybody is happy .
We were firing guns to celebrate Eid . "
Brains , muscle and geeks
The MV Faina was initially attacked by a gang of 62 men .
BBC Somalia analyst Mohamed Mohamed says such pirate gangs are usually made up of three different types : Ex-fishermen , who are considered the brains of the operation because they know the sea
Ex-militiamen , who are considered the muscle - having fought for various Somali clan warlords
The technical experts , who are the computer geeks and know how to operate the hi-tech equipment needed to operate as a pirate - satellite phones , GPS and military hardware .
The three groups share the ever - increasing illicit profits - ransoms paid in cash by the shipping companies .
A report by UK think - tank Chatham House says piracy off the coast of Somalia has cost up to $ 30 m ( £ 17 m ) in ransoms so far this year .
The study also notes that the pirates are becoming more aggressive and assertive - something the initial $ 22 m ransom demanded for MV Faina proves .
The asking price has apparently since fallen to $ 8 m .
Calling the shots Yemen , across the Gulf of Aden , is reportedly where the pirates get most of their weapons from .
A significant number are also bought directly from the Somali capital , Mogadishu .
Enlarge Image
Observers say Mogadishu weapon dealers receive deposits for orders via a " hawala " company - an informal money transfer system based on honour .
Militiamen then drive the arms north to the pirates in Puntland , where they are paid the balance on delivery .
It has been reported in the past that wealthy businessmen in Dubai were financing the pirates .
But the BBC's Somali Service says these days it is the businessmen asking the pirates for loans .
Such success is a great attraction for Puntland 's youngsters , who have little hope of alternative careers in the war - torn country .
Once a pirate makes his fortune , he tends to take on a second and third wife - often very young women from poor nomadic clans , who are renowned for their beauty .
But not everyone is smitten by Somalia 's new elite .
" This piracy has a negative impact on several aspects of our life in Garowe , " resident Mohamed Hassan laments .
He cites an escalating lack of security because " hundreds of armed men " are coming to join the pirates .
They do n't call themselves pirates .
They call themselves coastguards
Garowe resident Abdulkadil Mohamed
They have made life more expensive for ordinary people because they " pump huge amounts of US dollars " into the local economy which results in fluctuations in the exchange rate , he says .
Their lifestyle also makes some unhappy .
" They promote the use of drugs - chewing khat [ a stimulant which keeps one alert ] and smoking hashish - and alcohol , " Mr Hassan says .
The trappings of success may be new , but piracy has been a problem in Somali waters for at least 10 years - when Somali fishermen began losing their livelihoods .
Their traditional fishing methods were no match for the illegal trawlers that were raiding their waters .
Piracy initially started along Somalia 's southern coast but began shifting north in 2007 - and as a result , the pirate gangs in the Gulf of Aden are now multi-clan operations .
But Garowe resident Abdulkadil Mohamed says , they do not see themselves as pirates .
" Illegal fishing is the root cause of the piracy problem , " he says .
" They call themselves coastguards . "

As Douglas A. McIntyre wrote back in September , most dictator ’s get to wear general ’s uniforms , so Hank Paulson had better call his tailor .
According to Bush mouthpiece Dan Perino , Bush will trust Paulson and the bankers to implement the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .
The banker takeover bill passed by the Senate and signed into law on October 3 makes Paulson a virtual economic dictator .
Paulson is now authorized to purchase mortgage - related assets from any financial institution headquartered in the United States .
“ The power of the Judicial Branch as an element of the Constitution ’s mandate for ‘ checks and balances ’ has been suspended , undercutting a critical principle established by the Founding Fathers , ” writes McIntyre .
In almost all ways , the bill places the Treasury Secretary outside the law and above Congress and the American people .
On Thursday , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Bush “ is trusting his team at the Treasury Department to design this program , and he believes they are doing it the right way , ” according to CNSNews .
“ I do n’t have details for you on it .
So , we ’ll let them — we ’ll just trust our treasury secretary and those he ’s tasked with to implement the program . ”
In other words , the bankers , not Congress or the American people , will implement the the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .
When Paulson picked Neel Kashkari to act as director of the so - called bailout plan , it became obvious the bankers are in control of the Treasury .
Both Paulson and Kashkari are Goldman Sachs alumni .
In addition , Paulson depends on Goldman Sachs executives Dan Jester and Ken Wilson , both financial institutions bankers , and Steve Shafran , who focused on corporate restructuring while at Goldman .
Shafran joined the department in February 2008 , while Paulson brought Jester and Wilson on board in July and August , respectively , as the credit crisis worsened , according to the Associated Press .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In the 1830s , president Martin Van Buren proposed that an independent treasury be set up and isolated from all banks .
In 1844 , the Democrats inaugurated measures to restore the Independent Treasury System in response to the banker engineered speculative crash of 1837 .
However , the bankers undermined the Independent Treasury System and the separation of the Treasury from the banking system was never completed .
Finally , after the engineered Panic of 1907 and the establishment of the privately owned Federal Reserve in 1913 , and act of Congress brought the Independent Treasury System to an end .
“ I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies , ” wrote Thomas Jefferson .
“ Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance .
The issuing power ( of money ) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs . ”
The mislabeled Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 is a final coup de grâce to the idea of a Treasury separated from the “ monied aristocracy ” Jefferson warned about .
In essence , Perino is telling us the bankers will decide how their takeover bill will be implemented and the American people will have no say in the process .
Goldman Sachs controls the Treasury , the purse of the American people , and a former Goldman Sachs chief executive has a virtual carte blanche to do the bidding of the bankers behind closed doors .
Bush trusts the banksters to do the right thing , that is to say the right thing according to “ a den of vipers and thieves , ” as Andrew Jackson called the bankers in 1832 .

The Gartner numbers seem positive , and encouraging -- especially in light of the acknowledgement that the remaining 15 % are planning to move toward more open source software in the near future .
Then Gartner drops the bad news -- cases that Moody says do n't end badly ( they are usually remedied with a polite phone call ) or even happen terribly frequently ( 12 or so cases a year ) -- that 69 % of companies have no formal method of evaluating and cataloging their open source applications , leaving them at risk of intellectual property liabilities .
Moody details briefly the differences in open licenses , and why they generally are n't a liability at all , especially if modified code is never used or distributed outside of the company that 's modified it .
He says that while mixing code with different licensing for redistribution can get dicey , especially in the case of the GNU GPL license ( which has different constraints than some others ) , it still generally is n't an issue .
Moody spoke to Eben Moglen of the Software Freedom Law Center who indicated that while license violations happen , a civil phone call explaining the situation results in companies willingly complying .
Moglen indicates that serious consequences for an infringing company would only arise from a willing , persistent disregard for the applicable license .
Asay makes the further point -- a good one -- that a company should plain and simple have a plan for managing software whether it be open source or proprietary .
I 'd go so far to add that a plan is needed , regardless of company size or industry ( it does n't matter that IT is n't the business 's main focus -- it is necessary to know what is running , where ) .
Part of software management is license management -- and though there are differences between development licenses , and end user licenses , there are overlaps .
Software has rules -- regardless of whether the source is open or not .
Businesses ( and users ) should n't think ( or be led to believe ) otherwise .
But the open source method -- and approach to upholding the licenses -- seems a compelling reason to use it , rather than a liability .

The photograph of the wild cat [ above ] was taken by Aldo Sornoza of Fundación Jocotoco ( FJ ) , who was helping with the construction of the new visitors ’ lodge on the Jorupe Reserve , Ecuador .
It is thought to be a new species of cat , still to be described , which was first seen two years ago in Peru .
The Jorupe Reserve , owned and managed by the World Land Trust ’s partners FJ , is close to the border with Peru and this would be the first known sighting in Ecuador .
Oreailurus jacobita
Oreailurus jacobita
If the new mystery cat photograph does not show a new species , the only other cat it could possibly be is an Andean Cat ( Oreailurus jacobita ) , one of the rarest of all the cat species , about which very little is known .
Over the last 25 years there have been fewer than 10 documented sightings of Oreailurus jacobita .
The Andean Mountain Cat ( Oreailurus jacobita , Leopardus jacobitus or L. jacobita ) is also known as the Andean Cat .
Its habitat and appearance make it the small cat analogue of the Snow Leopard .
While it is only about the size of a domestic cat , it appears larger because of its long tail and silvery - gray , striped and spotted long fur .
The body length is about 60 cm ( 24 in ) , the tail length is 42 cm ( 17 in ) , the shoulder height is 36 cm ( 14 in ) and the body weight is 5.5 kg ( 12 lbs ) .
The Andean Cat is one of the least known and rarest of all felines ; almost all that is known about it comes from a few observations in the wild and from skins .
There are none in captivity .
It is believed to live only in the high Andes mountains of Peru , Bolivia , Chile , and Argentina .
They are not known to exist in Ecuador .
It has been sighted at elevations of 5,100 meters , well above the tree line .
Lou Jost , of Fundación EcoMinga , also an Ecuadorian partner of the WLT , is lucky enough to have seen the Andean Cat , not just once but twice .
When presented with the mystery cat photo , Lou commented :
“ The ground color is very similar [ to that of the Andean Cat ] .
However I did n’t see any strong patterns on the legs , like this one has , though I would not have seen that from the angles I had ( just the back and sides of the animal running through dense vegetation , both times ) .
The elevations of my sightings were very high , around 2800 - 3000 m , and very wet , completely different from Jorupe .
I could easily imagine that there is a new species of cat endemic to the Tumbesian zone of SW Ecuador and NW Peru . ”

The dismal U.S. auto market took a turn for the worse in October , with sales plunging by about a third as the financial crisis and tightening credit kept buyers away from showrooms .
Auto makers sold 838,186 cars and light trucks last month , according to a tally by Autodata Corp.
General Motors Corp. said it was the worst October in 25 years .
When adjusted for increases in the U.S. population , last month was " the worst month in the post - World War II era , " Michael DiGiovanni , GM 's top sales analyst , said in a conference call .
" This is clearly a severe , severe recession . "
Auto executives warned that the market could deteriorate further , raising the question as to when the auto industry -- a key driver of the U.S. economy -- will hit bottom .
The modest decline in U.S. economic output in the third quarter " is not likely to be the worst we will see in this cycle , " Ford Motor Co. economist Emily Kolinski Morris said in a company conference call .
A closely watched industry figure , the seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate , was 10.6 million vehicles , compared with 16 million a year earlier , according to Autodata .

Regardless of how much money Paulson and Bernanke waste on bailouts , this economy simply is not going to recover with the unemployment picture looking as bleak as it does .
Let 's start off with a look at initial claims then some announcements from today about layoffs .
Initial Claims
Once again , Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims are up although the 4 week moving average is down slightly .
In the week ending Oct. 18 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 478,000 , an increase of 15,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 463,000 .
It is estimated that the effects of Hurricane Ike in Texas added approximately 12,000 claims to the total .
The 4 - week moving average was 480,250 , a decrease of 4,500 from the previous week 's revised average of 484,750 .
The effects of Ike will be diminishing over time , they should be already , but do n't expect those initial claims to start dropping any time soon .
Here are a few recent headlines .
Xerox to Cut 5 Percent of Staff
In response to businesses slowing equipment purchases , Xerox will Cut 5 Percent of Staff .
Xerox Corp. plans to cut 3,000 jobs , or 5 percent of its work force , because a slowdown in orders from large U.S. companies has dragged down the printer and copier maker 's profit margins .
" We 're assuming more of the same ... deterioration in the economic markets , " Anne Mulcahy , Xerox 's chief executive , said on a conference call with analysts .
" That 's why we 're being so aggressive in terms of the cost reductions , so we can be assured of delivering the earnings growth that we expect in 2009 . "
GM Suspends Employer Match , Cuts Jobs
Bleak outlooks from world carmakers and a barrage of job cuts by major U.S. companies including Chrysler and Xerox deepened fears of an extended global recession and kept market nerves on edge on Thursday .
A dive in car shipments to the United States and slowing demand from emerging economies hurt Japanese exports .
Sony Corp slashed its operating profit forecast , citing reduced demand for flat TVs and digital cameras .
U.S. carmaker General Motors said it was temporarily suspending the company match for its retirement savings program to preserve cash .
It also said it planned involuntary cuts in its salaried and contract workforce starting this year .
Chrysler to Cut 1,825 Jobs
Chrysler LLC , now in merger talks with General Motors Corp. , will cut 1,825 jobs as it shuts a Delaware factory a year early and pares output at an Ohio plant because of slumping sport-utility vehicle sales .
The Delaware - made SUVs " are simply not selling , " said Aaron Bragman , a product analyst at Global Insight Inc. in Troy , Michigan .
" It reached a certain point where it simply does n't make sense to keep the plant open . "
Stuart Schorr , a Chrysler spokesman , declined to comment on whether the Durango and Aspen would be canceled , whether the Delaware production would be shifted elsewhere , or how output at the Ohio factory might be affected .
There is a 180 - day supply of Durangos and a 106 - day supply of Aspens , Schorr said .
Analysts consider a 60 - day inventory to be the industry standard .
Goldman Sachs to cut about 10 % of staff
Goldman Sachs Group is planning to reduce staff by about 10 % because the financial crisis has dulled activity in several of the investment bank 's markets , a person familiar with the situation said Thursday .
The cuts will bring the number of Goldman ( GS ) employees down to roughly 29,340 from a peak of about 32,600 earlier this year .
The reductions will be across product lines and geographies and will leave staffing at 2006 and 2007 levels , the person said on condition of anonymity .
" There are significantly lower levels of business activity , " said Michael Williams , dean of the Graduate School of Business at Touro College in New York City .
" This is the primary drive behind the layoffs .
These are not the last job cuts you will see , " he added in a statement that was emailed to MarketWatch .
Massive Mutual Fund , Hedge Fund Job Cutbacks
Janus Capital Group Inc. and AllianceBernstein Holding LP are firing workers to cut costs as the global bear market erases investor assets and profits across the mutual - fund industry .
Janus will eliminate about 115 jobs , or 9 percent of the workforce , in a plan to save $ 45 million a year , the Denver - based company said today in a statement .
AllianceBernstein , the New York - based fund affiliate of French insurer Axa SA , said yesterday it will fire an undetermined number of workers .
The layoffs are the first of what will be the most severe round of job cuts in the fund industry , said Henry Higdon , managing partner of Higdon Partners LLC , a New York - based search firm specializing in financial services .
" A lot of other publicly owned money managers will be forced to follow suit because of market depreciation and withdrawals , '' Higdon said in an interview .
" It 's going to get a lot worse . ''
The fund industry is hunkering down as more than 130,000 jobs already have been eliminated by banks , brokers and other financial firms since mid-2007 , the result of losses in subprime mortgages that ballooned into the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
Hedge - Fund Cutbacks
Hedge funds have already cut 3,000 to 5,000 jobs and may eliminate 10,000 by year 's end as they cope with their biggest losses in two decades , according to estimates by executive search firm Options Group .
The industry employs about 150,000 worldwide .
Asset - management job cuts will surpass layoffs during 2001 and 2002 , the last bear market , Higdon said .

The stone huts of Deir al Sultan monastery are at the heart of the row
An unholy row is threatening one of the most sacred places in Christianity - the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem .
The centuries - old site , where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified , is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and tourists every year .
A recent survey says that part of the complex , a rooftop monastery , is in urgent need of repair , but work is being held up by a long - running dispute between two Christian sects who claim ownership of the site .
Within the main building , dark - robed monks with long beards chant and swing incense as they conduct ceremonies in the many small chapels and shrines .
There has been a church on this site for 1,700 years .
Over the centuries it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times - but some parts are very old indeed .
Collapse risk Various Christian denominations - Greek Orthodox , Armenians , Catholics , among others - have always jealously defended and protected their own particular parts of the site .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Disputes are not uncommon , particularly over who has the authority to carry out repairs .
For example , a wooden ladder has remained on a ledge just above the main entrance since the 19th Century - because no - one can agree who has the right to take it down .
The latest row is potentially much more serious .
The ladder has remained above the church entrance since 19th Century The Deir al - Sultan monastery was built on part of the main church roof more than 1,000 years ago .
The modest collection of small rooms has been occupied by monks from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church since 1808 .
But a recent engineering report by an Israeli institute found that the monastery and part of the roof were " not in a good condition " and that parts of the structure " could collapse , endangering human life " .
Ownership of the monastery , however , is hotly disputed between the Ethiopians and the Egyptian Coptic Church , and the dispute is holding up much - needed repair work .
Click here to see a diagram of the Church Although the Ethiopian monks have lived there for more than 200 years , after losing many of their rights within the main church , the Copts were in overall control of the monastery .
That 's certainly how the Coptic Church interprets the " Status Quo " - the controversial 1852 decree , issued by the then - Ottoman rulers of Jerusalem , to put an end to the arguments among the church 's various claimants .
The Ethiopian Church has a different view , saying that they have had a presence on the roof - top for even longer and that the question of the monastery 's " ownership " has never been properly defined .
From a vantage point overlooking the disputed monastery , I discussed the " situation " with Father Antonias el - Orshalamy , General Secretary to the Coptic Church in Jerusalem .
The monastery is on the roof of the Chapel of St Helena " The Ethiopians were always there as our guests , but then they wanted to take control , " says Father Antonias - referring to the night in 1970 when Coptic monks were all attending midnight prayers in the main Sepulchre church .
With the help of Israeli police , the locks in the Deir al Sultan monastery were changed and the keys given to the Ethiopians .
Subsequent Israeli court rulings , ordering that control be handed back to the Copts , have effectively been ignored - drawing accusations that Israel has shown political bias in favouring the Ethiopians over the ( Egyptian ) Copts .
Whatever the political and religious arguments , the Ethiopians remain in control of the ancient monastery and refuse to budge .
They will not entertain any suggestion that the Copts should have any say over repairs to the monastery and rooftop courtyard .
In that vein , no one from the Ethiopian Church would speak to us .
' Unedifying ' Coptic and Ethiopian monks have come to blows in the past but they are not the only ones who have allowed tensions to boil over .
Fights between monks from different sects in the Sepulchre are not uncommon and passions run high , particularly on important holy days .
Hundreds of thousands come from all over the world to pray in the Church Father Jerome Murphy O'Connor is a professor at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem .
" The whole spectacle is unedifying and totally un-Christian in nature " , says the affable Irish priest , who has witnessed all sorts of church disagreements during his 40 years in the city .
" I 'm not hopeful - either for peace in the Middle East or for peace in the Holy Sepulchre , " laughs Father O'Connor .
The impact of age and of so many pilgrims visiting the rooftop monastery and the Sepulchre Church is taking its toll .
While the main church is said to be structurally sound , many parts of the roof in particular are in need of extensive repair .
The Israeli government says it will pay for the work to be carried out if the Copts and Ethiopians can resolve their differences .
But after decades of hostility neither side is rushing to compromise .

We soon may not have Rep. Tom Feeney ( R - Abramoff ) --- the Florida congressman accused of conspiring to create vote - rigging software , and one of the country 's most corrupt --- to kick around anymore , as reports The Miami Herald on Friday .
But that good news could lead to even better news ...
Orlando Congressman Tom Feeney , a former speaker of the Florida House and one - time running mate of former Gov. Jeb Bush , has become the poster child for the declining fortunes of the Republican Party in Florida .
In 2002 , Feeney carved a Congressional district for himself from a Republican - leaning swath of Orlando .
Now , after three terms in Congress and a barrage of bad publicity , the National Republican Congressional Committee this week pulled plans to advertise on Feeney 's behalf --- proof of their concern that he could lose his seat to Democrats on Nov. 4 .
So with Feeney 's days in Congress , perhaps , finally coming to a close , that could also mean we may get to see him thrown in jail sooner .
In the early days of my coverage of the Tom Feeney / Clint Curtis vote - rigging scandal ( see the documentary film about that story now here , purchase a signed DVD in support of The BRAD BLOG here ) , it was explained to me by a Congressional staffer on the Judiciary Committee that one of the reasons they might have trouble calling Feeney --- a member of the committee himself --- on the carpet was because of the Congresional ethics rules .
" If we file ethics charges charges against another member of Congress , " it was told to me , " and any part of them end up being untrue , we can face ethics charges ourselves . "
Well , with Feeney out of Congress , as is looking more and more the case for him next week , neither Congress , nor anybody else , should have trouble in their quest to bring accountability to this horrible man , right ?
By the way , though we'd have much preferred to see Clint Curtis get the chance to whip Feeney next week , the DCCC 's hand - selected candidate , Suzanne Kosmas , who defeated Curtis in the recent primary , will have to do .
If she can pull it off .
And that 's fine by us !
UPDATE 6:39 pm PT : AP confirms the Miami Herald report about the NRCC giving up on Feeney :
WASHINGTON --- National Republicans have pulled television advertising for four of the party 's incumbents , including Tom Feeney in Florida .
Feeney is among the at-risk Republican incumbents left to fend for themselves by a cash - strapped House of Representatives campaign arm in the crucial final days of the campaign amid a tough political environment for President George W. Bush 's party .
The National Republican Campaign Committee also has canceled planned TV ads to help Reps. Marilyn Musgrave in Colorado , Michele Bachmann in Minnesota and Joe Knollenberg in Michigan , spokeswoman Karen Hanretty confirmed .
Musgrave , Feeney and Knollenberg are extremely vulnerable .
Democrats , who are eyeing double - digit gains in their House majority , have been targeting them heavily .
Feeney is battling Democrat Suzanne Kosmas of New Smyrna Beach .

The virus that causes AIDS is spreading in New York City at three times the national rate  an incidence of 72 new infections for every 100,000 people , compared with 23 per 100,000 nationally  according to a study released on Wednesday by the city ’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .
The findings , based on a new formula developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , estimated that 4,762 New Yorkers contracted H.I.V. in 2006 , the most precise estimate the city had ever offered .
But the city stressed that because the method of estimating infections was new , it could not be said definitively whether the number of new infections in the city had increased or decreased from previous years .
Blacks , and men who have sex with other men , are the groups at greatest risk of contracting H.I.V. , the study found .
A summary of the new data :
¶ Men accounted for 76 percent of new H.I.V. infections and women for 25 percent .
( The figures exceed 100 percent because of rounding . )
This is super sweet , no pun intended .

When it comes to jobs , the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around America or allowing every job to disappear overseas .
The truth is , we wo n't be able to bring back every job that we 've lost , but that does n't mean we should follow John McCain 's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send American jobs overseas .
I will end those breaks as President , and I will give American businesses a $ 3,000 tax credit for every job they create right here in the United States of America .
I 'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start - up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country .
We 'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads , and bridges , and schools , and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country .
And I will invest $ 15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade – jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced ; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid ; jobs building the fuel - efficient cars of tomorrow , not in Japan or South Korea but here in the United States of America ; jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the Middle East in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain .
That 's how America can lead again .
When it comes to health care , we do n't have to choose between a government - run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now .
If you already have health insurance , the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums .
If you do n't have health insurance , you 'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves .
We 'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families , businesses , and the entire economy .
And as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre-existing condition and did n't want to pay for treatment , I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most .
When it comes to giving every child a world - class education so they can compete in this global economy for the jobs of the 21st century , the choice is not between more money and more reform – because our schools need both .
As President , I will invest in early childhood education , recruit an army of new teachers , pay them more , and give them more support .
But I will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools .
And I will make a deal with every American who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college : if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford your tuition .
You invest in America , America will invest in you , and together , we will move this country forward .
And when it comes to keeping this country safe , we do n't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in Iraq .
It 's time to stop spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a huge surplus .
As President , I will end this war by asking the Iraqi government to step up , and finally finish the fight against bin Laden and the al Qaeda terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 .
I will never hesitate to defend this nation , but I will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century , and I will restore our moral standing , so that America is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
I wo n't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy – especially now .
The cost of this economic crisis , and the cost of the war in Iraq , means that Washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without .
On this , there is no other choice .
As President , I will go through the federal budget , line - by - line , ending programs that we do n't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less .
But as I 've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago , the change we need is n't just about new programs and policies .
It 's about a new politics – a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts ; one that reminds us of the obligations we have to ourselves and one another .
Part of the reason this economic crisis occurred is because we have been living through an era of profound irresponsibility .
On Wall Street , easy money and an ethic of " what 's good for me is good enough " blinded greedy executives to the danger in the decisions they were making .
On Main Street , lenders tricked people into buying homes they could n't afford .
Some folks knew they could n't afford those houses and bought them anyway .
In Washington , politicians spent money they did n't have and allowed lobbyists to set the agenda .
They scored political points instead of solving our problems , and even after the greatest attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor , all we were asked to do by our President was to go out and shop .
Double A - OK
Wherein the Grouse surveys his chargeable devices and bemoans the lack of standards
By Chris Hogg
BBC News , Shanghai
There were protests in support of Yang outside the court during his trial A 28 - year - old man convicted of killing six policemen in Shanghai has been executed , Chinese state media reports .
Yang Jia forced his way into a Shanghai police station and stabbed the men .
Police said Yang , who was from Beijing , told them his attack was in revenge for torture he had suffered while being interrogated about a stolen bicycle .
Yang received strong public support inside China , with thousands of comments posted on the internet about the way police treat ordinary people .
Yang had tried to sue the police for psychological damage , but the claim was rejected .
Hailed as a hero
You will be remembered in history as a hero
Comment on Chinese net forum
Reaction : Chinese killer executed Yang Jia had thrown petrol bombs at the police station to create a diversion .
Then he had burst inside and started slashing at officers with a knife .
Six were killed and four injured .
Local media reported claims by Yang that he had been beaten in detention - claims denied by the police .
But the case prompted thousands of people to comment on message boards and blogs .
Many of the comments were removed by the censors .
Some on the internet had even hailed Yang as a hero .
Yang was put on trial in September .
There were protests in his support outside the court .
He was convicted and the case was referred to the Supreme Court .
He received the backing of the artist Ai WeiWei who designed the Olympic Stadium , the Bird 's Nest .
But the state news agency Xinhua says the higher court upheld the sentence .
Yang Jia was executed early on Wednesday .

Angelina Jolie Up Close on Harper 's Bazaar Cover
graces the cover of UK Harper 's Bazaar December issue .
The accompanying interview is titled Angelina Up Close and will be available on stands Thursday .
In it she says : " I am still at heart , and always will be , just a punk kid with tattoos .
I do n't walk around feeling I need to apologize or explain myself . "
The actress has been jet setting within the past few weeks , arriving first in New York for the premiere and promotional work for her latest movie Changeling , including an interview with Matt Lauer of The Today Show .
Her partner Brad Pitt traveled to New York with Angie and their six pack of kids .
He attended the Changeling premiere red carpet affair with his partner Angelina .
While the family was in NYC , an expose of personal family photographs , including some of the actress breastfeeding one of her newborn twins , appeared in W magazine .
They were shot by Pitt at their leased home , Chateau Miraval , in the south of France .
There have also been plenty of family sightings as well .
Check out the kid pics here .
Pitt returned to Berlin ahead of the rest of the family because he is filming a Quentin Tarantino film , Inglorious Bastards .
Angelina made a quick trip alone , traveling to Afghanistan as part of her duties as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador .
The group have reunited in Berlin , where they will reside until Pitt is finished filming .
Who knew North Korea had the second largest hotel in the world ?
Too bad it ’s deserted .
Ryugyong Hotel was one of Kim Jong
Il ‘s plans of really putting North Korea on the World Map .
He thought the best way to do that would be to build the world ’s largest structure .
The Koreans started buillding Ryugyong in 1987 but ceased construction in 1992 due to serious financial difficulties .
The country never recovered from its financial crisis so the work on Ryugyong never picked up , until 2008 when the government decided to resume work on their giant super - structure .
With North Korea ‘s tourism at an absolute low , Ryugyong Hotel will probably be nothing more than a really large building , although Kim Jong
Il has tried to convince the world that his huge hotel is a success by faking images and spreading them in the media .
(1) I Just Want To Make An XMLHttpOmelette : I 've always hated Javascript , and now that I 'm working on a Javascript client for Launchpad 's web service , I know I was right to hate it .
Recently I lost half a day to a mysterious problem that turned out to be XMLHttpRequest truncating my PUT request at the first null character .
Because why would you want to send binary data over the Internet ?
It 's not like some kind of ... tube ... that you can put just anything in .
The Internet is scattershot with uninformed commentary on this issue , which I now supplant with a single clearinghouse of uninformed commentary .
Mozilla developers know about this problem but for some reason , presumably bug - compatibility , added a sendAsBinary method rather than fixing send .
Maybe in five years that will be a standard , but it does n't help me now .
( Also , in experiments I could n't get sendAsBinary to send binary data !
It crashed with NS_ERROR_DOM_INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR !)
One solution is to create a MIME multipart message with one part and a Content - Transfer - Encoding of " base64 " .
Bandwidth - wasty , but effective .
Except , thought I , why bother with the multipart message ?
Just encode the binary data as base64 and send a Transfer - Encoding of " base64 " .
( Content - Transfer - Encoding is explicitly prohibited by RFC2616 ; it was more or less split into Content - Encoding and Transfer - Encoding . )
Now , " base64 " is not an officially registered transfer coding , but using it seems to be in the spirit of the Transfer - Encoding spec , which wants ' to ensure " safe transport " through the network . '
The only difference is that the unsafe thing ( stupid Javascript ) is on one end of the network rather than in the middle .
Here 's another solution that I do n't really understand .
It uses Mozilla - specific hacks to create an input stream containing binary data , which input stream is passed to send ( ) instead of a string which will inevitably be chopped or parsed as a DOM object or something .
For now I 'm going to hope that the problem goes away when I start using a different Ajax toolkit , which we were going to do anyway , but as always I 'm very disappointed when I try to make an HTTP request and something totally random happens that 's not my HTTP request .
Update : Because of this problem it 's apparently common to send binary files using a hidden IFRAME that contains an HTML form .
The binary file is sent as a MIME multipart message over POST , but it 's not base64 encoded -- it 's a regular browser file upload .
Update 2 : Have fun arguing over the legitimacy of my desire to do this instead of investigating the problem , Reddit dudes .
The %00 trick sounds feasible , other Reddit dudes .
I 'll try it .
PS : switching to another toolkit did n't solve the problem because all the toolkits use XHR .
The dangerous market has been and gone .
Only the danger of government meddling remains ...
WE LOVE THIS NUGGET of irony , idiocy or just plain cant so much , we have to repeat it - clutching our sides and doubling - up in laughter , tears streaming down our disbelieving faces :
" The reality of the situation is that an open , competitive , and liberalized financial market can effectively allocate scarce resources in a manner that promotes stability and prosperity far better than governmental intervention ... "
So said Henry Paulson , US Treasury secretary and ex-Goldman Sachs chief , in Shanghai on 7th March 2007 .
Hank was lecturing Chinese officials ( who this week allowed short - selling on their domestic equity markets for the first time ) at the so - called China - US Strategic Dialogue summit .
Of course , Paulson bent their ear before Bear Stearns " Enhanced Leverage " mortgage - bond hedge funds blew up in June ' 07 .
The following month , Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Fed , made his first guess - timate of total bank losses - " in the order of between $ 50bn and $ 100 bn " - to come from the subprime collapse .
Now the terrified trio of Bush , Bernanke and Hank want $ 700 bn just to re-finance the US investment banks and their foreign landfill sites , let alone home - buyers , mortgage lenders and house builders .
Yet five UK banks alone hold $ 175bn of qualifying junk - fully one quarter of the sum requested .
So no wonder Bill Gross - boss of Pimco , the world 's biggest bond fund , and a cheerleader for governmental intervention ever since Bear Stearns ' hedge funds went " hiccup ! " - says the " troubled asset relief program " will need another $ 500bn on top , just for starters .
( Wherever did they get that name - " troubled asset relief program " - by the way ?
Maybe " someone " in the room ... now as changed from their former self as George Bush is forgetful of his role in creating this mess ... was reminded of a drying - out clinic from long , long ago ...)
Paulson 's ideological grand - standing in Shanghai last year preceded a few other events that may have forced his Damascene conversion .
With $ 700 billion ... if not $ 1.2 trillion or the end of civilization itself at stake ... these events are worth recalling :
The first of five " big freeze " spikes in world money market interest rates ( Aug. 9th , ' 07 ) ;
Collapse of UK mortgage bank Northern Rock - last visited by UK regulators two years before ( Sept . ' 07 ) ;
Stan O'Neal 's resignation from Merrill Lynch ( Oct. ' 07 ) ;
Bush administration launches of Hope Now to help " one million [ US ] home - owners stay in their homes " , plus the downgrade of " monoline " bond insurance credit ratings ( both Dec. 07 ) ;
Biggest one - day fall in major world stock markets since 9/11 ( Jan. 21st ' 08 ) ;
G7 leading nations forecast $ 400 bn credit losses in total ( Feb . ' 08 ) ;
Final collapse of Bear Stearns into the welcoming - and Fed- assisted - arms of J.P. Morgan for 10 ¢ in the dollar ( March ' 08 ) ;
Last gasp of 100 % loan - to - value mortgages here in the UK ( Apr. ' 08 ) ;
Swiss giant UBS raises $ 15 bn after suffering $ 37bn in losses ( May ' 08 ) ;
FBI arrests more than 400 people , including bankers and brokers , for mortgage fraud ( June ' 08 ) ;
Collapse of IndyMac - not even on the US watchdog 's list of " at risk " banks 10 days earlier ( July ' 08 ) ;
First 10 % twelve - month drop in average US home prices since the 1930s ' Depression ( Aug. ' 08 ) ; and then
The nationalization of Fannie & Freddie , the collapse of Lehmans , the seizure of AIG , the fire - sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America , the fire - sale of London 's HBOS to Lloyds TSB , and now the collapse of Washington Mutual into - surprise !
- the welcoming arms of J.P. Morgan ( Sept. ' 08 ) .
All this while , of course , the developed world 's central banks were pouring cash into the credit market , trying to fix Problem No.1 at the top of our list above .
It just keeps coming back , however .
Because the people who know best the liquidity and solvency of major banks - the other banks - refuse to lend whatever money they get , hoarding it instead for fear of a run at their own branches .
" British banks have squirreled away nearly £ 6bn [ $ 11bn ] with the Bank of England rather than lend it to each other for more than a few days , " reports the Financial Times , " using its safe but low - interest deposit standing facility in a sign of the fear gripping money markets . "
Little surprise that inter - bank lending rates are holding near an eight - month high for US Dollars - despite the Fed now offering more than $ 290bn to foreign authorities for their own domestic money markets - while the banks ' price for borrowing Euros has reached a record high for the single currency , launched in 1999 .
And all this while as well , of course , the Federal Reserve has been busy slashing US interest rates ... finally joined by the UK , Aussie and New Zealand authorities in making debt cheaper even as the free market - both the interbank market and the commercial market of home - loans , overdrafts and corporate lending - pushed in the other direction .
This privilege , allowing central banks to set the price of money whenever it thinks the economy needs tweaking , might seem to jar with Paulson 's tidbit from Shanghai .
But shepherding the free market is why central banks , regulators and government itself exists today .
And as they 've proven so adept at this task , guiding the lambs of Wall Street to the slaughter of Florida and California condo's , it would surely make sense to extend their powers - and shepherd the free market a little more closely from here , using their tried and tested skills .
Right ?
" We thought Resolution was just suspended , not delisted , " said a spokeswoman for City watchdog the Financial Services Authority last Friday .
You 'd think they might know .
But no ; Resolution , a UK insurer , was delisted in London after being bought out in May .
Yet it still found its name on the banned list of 29 " no shorting " stocks proscribed by the FSA .
" It will be removed , " said the all - powerful watchdog .
" A revised list will be up on our website later today . "
Meantime in New York - where Hank Paulson's " open , competitive , and liberalized financial market " is also taking a break - the Securities & Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has banning short - selling of GLG , the giant London - based hedge fund , along with 798 other financial stocks and 100 or more stray sheep like GE , GM and Ford .
Funny , but GLG itself paid a $ 3.2 million fine in June '07 for " multiple violations " of the SEC code , after shorting some 14 public offerings in the US and making $ 2.2 m over two years in " illegal " profits .
Still , there is more rejoicing in heaven over one lost sheep found , eh ?
" Markets are usually right , " says Anatole Kaletsky in the London Times , " but sometimes they are dangerously wrong - and they need to be managed with decisive and competent government intervention . "
Ignore Polly - Ana 's morality if you can ; fact is , markets often get dangerous .
Whether they 're right or wrong does n't matter much if you 're buying high and then forced to sell cheaper .
Danger came in Tokyo real estate priced so highly , the Emperor 's Palace was worth more than all of California in 1989 .
It returned to the markets when the Nasdaq got so high , it was discounting tech - stock earnings until A.D. 2146 back in early 2000 .
Markets got dangerous once again when the average house here in the United Kingdom was valued at 8.5 average earnings in the summer of ' 07 , just as WaMu teetered above $ 45 per share , AIG bounced back towards $ 80 , and Lehman Bros .
announced record quarterly earnings for the last ever time .
Here and now , the market - right or wrong - is pricing toxic debt and derivatives at zero or worse .
US subprime mortgage bonds , if marked - to - market - rather than against the apparent " final redemption value " used to help pay $ 66 billion to Wall Street staff in 2007 - are also worth zilch .
That 's why there 's no danger of anyone buying them , no one outside Washington , that is .
And there 's the true danger today .
The dangerous market has been and gone .
It popped when Florida condos stopped selling to buy - and - flip wannabees without a red cent of cash but one million in debt .
Only government meddling - just like Hank Paulson said - risks further danger ; the danger that US taxpayers will pay through the nose ( and through inflation ) for $ 700bn of utterly worthless " investments " .
Any danger of letting the free market do what needs doing , and dissipate the danger in over - priced junk ?
Gallup Daily : 9 - Point Obama Lead Ties Campaign High Voters prefer Obama to McCain by 51 % to 42 %
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking poll shows registered voters preferring Barack Obama to John McCain for president by 51 % to 42 % .
The nine percentage point lead in Oct. 4 - 6 tracking matches Obama 's highest to date for the campaign , and the highest for either candidate .
Obama led McCain by 49 % to 40 % near the tail end of his international trip in late July .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Obama has now held a statistically significant lead since Sept. 24 - 26 polling and has not trailed McCain since Sept. 13 - 15 , roughly coinciding with the intensification of the financial crisis .
McCain has an opportunity to try to reverse Obama 's momentum at tonight 's town hall style debate in Nashville .
-- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 4 - 6 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,747 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Using invisibility to increase visibility
Research into the development of invisibility devices has spurred two physicists ' thought on the behaviour of light to overcome the seemingly intractable problem of optical singularities which could soon lead to the manufacturing of a perfect cat 's eye .
A research paper published in a New Journal of Physics ' focus issue ' Cloaking and Transformation Optics ' called ' The Transmutation of Singularities in Optical Instruments ' , written by Thomas Tyc , Masaryk University , and Ulf Leonhardt , the University of St. Andrews and Singapore National University , shows that it is possible to reflect light from all directions .
Cat 's eyes and glow - in - the - dark clothing are effective because they send light back from where they came to either provide direction to a driver on the road or alert drivers of , say , a cyclist 's presence but although this works well for light from some angles , it does not work well for all .
When light is shone through a glass of water with a straw in it and it appears as though the straw is bent , it is because the speed of light has been affected by the glass and the water that the light has been obstructed by .
Physicists measure the effect that materials have on light using the refractive index , with 1 as the speed of light unobstructed in air , and , approximately , 1.5 as the point on the index when light meets glass and water .
What happens however when the material forces light down to zero or shoots it up to infinity on the refractive index ?
These are called optical singularities and have long been thought impossible to produce but it is what physicists need to understand to create a material that can reflect light from all directions and thereby create the perfect cat 's eye .
Tyc and Leonhardt use ideas from one of the latest trends of optics called transformation optics to transmute the infinity mark on the refractive index into something more practical .
Put simply , the scientists have developed a recipe of materials to create optical illusions – some can be used for invisibility devices , others to make things perfectly visible .
As Tyc and Leonhardt write , " Our method works for optical singularities which are the curse of physics , often seeming intractable , but we have found a way of transmuting optical singularities with just harmless crystal defects as a side - effect . "
Applications will probably first appear in wireless technology and radar , for electromagnetic microwaves instead of light , because the required materials for electromagnetic microwaves are easier to manufacture .

A gang of Jewish teenagers were today jailed by an Israeli court for a 12 - month campaign of neo -Nazi attacks .
The sentencing in Tel Aviv , which comes over a year after the arrest of the eight youths , closed a case that has sparked revulsion across the Jewish state .
The judge , Zvi Gurfinkel , sentenced the teens , aged 16 to 19 , to between one and seven years in prison for a " shocking and horrifying " year - long spree of attacks that focused on foreign workers , gay people , ultra- orthodox Jews and homeless men .
The ring posted pro-Hitler video clips and recordings of their attacks on the internet .
Its members also planned to attack Arabs .
They were arrested in September 2007 and reports said that searches of their homes unearthed Nazi uniforms , knives , guns and the explosive TNT .
Gang members had tattoos popular with white supremacists – including the number 88 , code for " heil Hitler " , H being the eighth letter of the alphabet .
The charges against them included painting swastikas in a synagogue and planning a birthday party for Hitler .
They were charged with offences including conspiracy to commit a crime , assault , racial incitement and the distribution of racist materials .
The group were Jewish immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union .
They migrated under Israel 's law of return , which allows anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent to become a citizen .
One of the teenagers was the grandson of a Holocaust survivor .
The court documents pointed to social adjustment difficulties as a factor behind the attacks .
The judge described the teens , all from Petah Tikva near Tel Aviv , as " terrible " .
" The fact that they are Jews from the ex-Soviet Union and that they had sympathised with individuals who believed in racist theories is terrible , " Gurfinkel said as he handed down his verdict .
The gang leader , Erik Bonite , known as Ely the Nazi , received the maximum sentence .
Since the fall of Soviet communism in 1990 , about 1 m immigrants from Russia and the former USSR have moved to Israel .
Some have risen to prominence in politics and industry while others struggle to integrate , including thousands not considered Jewish by religious authorities .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
In the midst of Wall Street 's agonizing slide last week , there was at least one place in Manhattan where the liquor was flowing , the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple :
Work hard .
Play hard .
" I was a crook , " says Jordan Belfort , once a Wall Street fat cat who made $ 1 million a week before going to jail .
" It 's like fiddling .
Nero fiddled while Rome burned , " said Thomas Graf , vice president and producer of Northmarq Capital .
" We 're smoking cigars while we 're losing our shirts , literally . "
He was among hundreds of mid-level Wall Street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by Cigar Report magazine , published by New York - based Doubledown Media .
And if they seemed a little tone - deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost , at least on paper , most did not seem especially concerned .
" It is a great time , " said Adam Marsh of Empire Capital Partners .
" I think for at least a couple of hours in the evening , we can kind of sit back , have a few drinks , forget what 's facing us on the Street tomorrow . "
Few of the men and women at the party earned millions in Wall Street bonuses on top of their salaries .
But nearly all did very well , they say , at the top of the Wall Street bubble .
And their bosses , along with those who managed Wall Street hedge funds , did even better .
" These guys were spending more than $ 250 billion a year , " Robert Frank said .
" They bought mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach .
They bought art for $ 100 million a painting . "
Frank , author of " Richistan , " says the enormous amounts of money earned by Wall Street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves .
Fall of the Fat Cats
As the market tanked , the champagne flowed .
CNN's Abbie Boudreau goes inside the lives of Wall Street 's rich and shameless .
Saturday and Sunday , 8 p ET see full schedule »
" They just looked at the guy with the bigger house , the nicer Ferrari , the better artwork , " he said .
" And it was all competitive spending . "
One prominent example is the CEO of Lehman Brothers , Richard Fuld .
In 2007 alone , according to the executive compensation firm Equilar , he earned total take - home compensation of more than $ 45 million in salary and bonuses .
Congressional researchers said he earned nearly $ 500 million from 2000 through 2007 .
Fuld told Congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets .
" This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life , regardless of what comes out of this committee , regardless of when the record books get written , " Fuld told Congress during a recent hearing .
Not every Wall Street executive played by the books .
Jordan Belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont .
In the early to mid-'90s , he called himself the Wolf of Wall Street .
He was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering .
He spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005 .
" I was a crook , " Belfort said .
At one time , he says , he was earning more than $ 1 million a week .
Now , he has been ordered to pay back $ 110 million to his victims , and he said he is working on that .
Even the man who first chronicled Wall Street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened .
Oliver Stone , who wrote and directed the film " Wall Street " 21 years ago , says the main character in his story , unprincipled stockbroker Gordon Gekko , has been overtaken by reality .
" I never thought it would go to this level , " Stone told CNN 's Larry King .
" I thought the Gordon Gekkos of the world would die out .
But they got worse . "
So what exactly did the new Gordon Gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums ?
" What they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing , " Frank said .
" Of creating financial products that very few of us could understand . "
" On Wall Street , there 's no cost .
The only cost is the employees , the executives , " said Andy Serwer , managing editor of Fortune magazine .
" So if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $ 5 million , the person who sells it will get $ 2 million . "
But people who earned relatively little on Wall Street are now paying the price as well .
Win Hornig , a 25 - year - old Minnesotan who worked at both Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan , is now out of a job .
He 's launched a Web site called BankerGoneBroke.com to talk about it .
" My life was basically a disaster , " Hornig said .
" I was working all the time , did n't have a lot to show for it .
I came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money . "
While it lasted , the good times on Wall Street made money for traders and , of course , for Americans who had invested in the stock market , mainly through their 401 ( k ) contributions .
But there is a " new normal " these days .
" The party is over on Wall Street -- until it comes back again , " Serwer said .
" I 've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles .
These guys get their cigars and champagne .
They have a great time .
The whole thing blows up .
But then they re-emerge years later .
This one is a really , really bad one .
But I do n't think Wall Street is dead . "

It ’s no secret that I ’m not a fan of the TSA .
While I fully understand the importance of keeping our planes and airports safe , I ’m just not sure the TSA is up to the job .
The agency is also plagued by bad PR , mainly because of incompetent staff members and insane decisions that impact us as travelers .
The latest in a long lineup of bad press for the agency involves TSA screener Pythias Brown .
This 48 year old resident of Maplewood , NJ was supposed to keep bad stuff off the plane , but instead , he was helping himself to valuable items from the bags of people entrusting him with their belongings .
Pythias started small , stealing cameras , laptop computers , gaming consoles and eventually moved on to the good stuff including a video camera belonging to CNN , and a $ 47,900 camera stored inside the bag of an HBO employee .
The items were sold on Ebay , and as you can see from his feedback listing , these were not cheap items .
His greed eventually came back to haunt him , when CNN found one of their cameras listed on Ebay .
With a little help from the local police department and the USPS , Brown was apprehended .
When agents entered his house , they found 66 cameras , 31 laptop computers , jewelry , lenses , GPS devices and more .
The total value of the stolen items is well over $ 200,000 , and if you have ever lost an expensive item when flying from Newark Liberty Airport , you ’ll be thrilled to hear that the TSA is taking the matter “ seriously ” .
News like this just reinforces the need to keep anything of value out of your checked bags .
Of course , this also makes me wonder just how on earth a TSA agent is able to leave the sterile area of his or her local airport with a $ 47,900 camera hidden in their bag .
We passengers get screened , so perhaps it is time to start screening TSA staff when they enter and leave the airport ?
On the night of Monday , October 13 , in the First Congregational Church in Berkeley , Ca. , Naomi Wolf and Daniel Ellsberg were the featured speakers .
Ms. Wolf presented a capsulated version of the ten steps that , in the past , have marked the transition to a fascist form of government .
She pointed out how the United States is showing signs of qualifying for a match on all ten warning signals .
It was noted that there has not yet been massive detention of citizens , only relatively minor incidents .
Then Daniel Ellsberg read questions from the audience and the two speakers discussed their response to the question .
Ms. Wolf was highly enthusiastic about enacting a Constitutional Amendment that would approve the concept of ballot measures on a national level .
She cited the fact that 70 % of the U. S. population is in favor of ending the war in Iraq , but progress toward that goal has been very slow .
She also expressed her displeasure with the apathy toward torture that churches and synagogues have shown .
The attitude was : Who Would Jesus Torture ?
Mr. Ellsburg decried the “ executive despotism ” and characterized the November election as two men vying for the title of king .
The church venue was a bit of heavy handed symbolism for any writer who would want to employ the “ preaching to the choir ” metaphor to describe the ambiance at the event .
The questions concentrated on ways to reverse the alarming rush to fascism that the audience feared is occurring .
The replies were strong on enthusiasm for citizen participation in the governing process and rather anemic on specifics .
Afterwards a very small random sampling of the audience indicated that their enthusiasm did not extend to the level of talking to a columnist from a web site which features harsh assessments of the current President ( and needs citizen participation in the form of monetary contributions to continue fulfilling that role ) .
Previously , the columnist had talked on the phone with two people who are much more skeptical about the possibility that martial law could ever be instituted inside the United States .
The attitude of those two seems to be a much stronger level of disbelief than was on display in the event in Berkeley .
If the columnist understood correctly , it boiled down to bemused annoyance for an idea that only proves that freedom of speech is alive and well inside the United States .
They fell short of the old “ yes , yes , of course ; now run along and play ” reaction .
Jersey Bill reassured the columnist that if and when martial law is declared , he will then do what it necessary to correct the overreaction by whoever takes such a misstep .
Yeah , right , if it happens we can hold our breath for as long as it will take for Jersey Bill to have a St. Paul ’s moment and change into “ Resistance Man ” !
Bill is anxiously awaiting the election results so that he can say to the columnist : “ See , all went well and you are still crazy so I ’ll never be able to convince you that you worry needlessly . ”
Somehow it is very difficult to imagine a retired high school teacher comfortably stepping into the role of an American che Guevara , but based on his emphatic assurances , we ’ll take a wait and see attitude .
If the institution of martial law impinges on the finale of “ Dancing With the Stars , ” then America will not tolerate it .
If not ; well then most Americans will still be able to emphatically reassure Bush critics , that just like the novel title said : “ It ca n’t happen here . ”
Where ’s your patriotic pride ?
Do n’t you know that Americans are not as dumb as the Germans who let Hitler take over ?
Super Chicken always said : “ You knew the job was dangerous when you took it , Fred . ”
Now , the disk jockey will play a John Philip Sousa song and we ’ll march out of here .
Have a good week because if you do n’t we will have to report you to the authorities .
A week ago , Father Geoffrey Farrow stood before his Roman Catholic parishioners in Fresno and delivered a sermon that placed him squarely at odds with his church over gay marriage .
With Proposition 8 on the November ballot , and his own bishop urging Central Valley priests to support its definition of traditional marriage , Farrow told congregants he felt obligated to break “ a numbing silence ” about church prejudice against homosexuals .
“ How is marriage protected by intimidating gay and lesbian people into loveless and lonely lives ? ” he asked parishioners of the St. Paul Newman Center .
“ I am morally compelled to vote no on Proposition 8 . ”
Then Farrow -- who had revealed that he was gay during a television interview immediately before Mass -- added a coda to his sermon .
Advertisement
“ I know these words of truth will cost me dearly , ” he said .
“ But to withhold them . . .
I would become an accomplice to a moral evil that strips gay and lesbian people not only of their civil rights but of their human dignity as well . ”
On Thursday , Fresno Bishop John T. Steinbock removed Farrow , 50 , as pastor of the St. Paul Newman Center , which primarily serves students and faculty at Cal State Fresno .
“ Your statement contradicted the teaching of the Catholic Church and has brought scandal to your parish community as well as the whole Church , ” Steinbock wrote in a disciplinary letter that also admonished Farrow against “ using the Internet as a means of continuing your conflict with the Church ’s teaching . ”
The priest also was stripped of his salary and benefits , and ordered to stay away from all church communities he had served .

Farrow ’s comments at the end of the Oct. 5
Mass have left his congregation bitterly divided .
On Sunday , some parishioners praised Farrow ’s courage for defending the rights of gays and lesbians , while others condemned him for challenging church doctrine without giving warning .
“ It upsets me that we are allowing a ballot proposition to come into our church and divide us , ” said Teresa Huerta , who teaches at Cal State Fresno .
“ We are going through changes right now in society and the church needs to recognize that . ”
Frank Gallegos , a parishioner for 24 years , said he was dismayed that Farrow used the pulpit to deliver his message .

“ He ambushed us , ” Gallegos , 44 , said while leaving the white concrete - block church with his wife and two children .
“ I do n’t wish him ill .
I just wish he had n’t done it during Mass . ”
Parish leaders concluded two morning Masses on Sunday with an apology to parishioners .
Farrow ’s statements , they said , were not in accord with church teachings .
Also , the priest did not inform church elders about his plans before delivering his sermon , said Deacon John Supino , who read a letter from Steinbock reaffirming the Catholic Church ’s support for Proposition 8 .
Quoting Steinbock , Supino said the church teaches that sex is a gift from God to be acted on only by a man and a woman within marriage .
But Proposition 8 , he insisted , does not represent a condemnation of gays or lesbians .
Advertisement
“ The teachings of the church on these matters did not arise with Proposition 8 but have been in place for over 2,000 years , ” Supino said .
Several parishioners inside the church applauded when Supino finished Steinbock ’s statement .
A few rose and left as he was reading it .
Katherine Allison , 46 , hurried out of the church at the end of the 11 a.m .
Mass with her 14 - year - old son and 7 - year - old daughter .
She said she did n’t want to stay to hear the bishop ’s letter .
Allison said her entire family liked Father Geoff , as he was known .
He taught a Bible history class Tuesday nights and seemed to be passionate about his work , she said .
Advertisement
“ There is nothing to apologize for , ” she said .
“ God tells us to speak the truth , and that ’s what he did . ”
Farrow became a priest 23 years ago , working in parishes in Visalia , Merced , Bakersfield and the nearby town of Arvin .
A graduate of St. John ’s Seminary in Camarillo , he also served as a chaplain in the Air Force Reserve at Edwards Air Force Base near Palmdale in the early 1990s .
Farrow , who said he realized that he was gay in boyhood , revealed his sexual orientation only to close friends and family .
He told his parents just four years ago .
“ This was the secret I was going to take to my grave , ” he said .
Advertisement
That changed when he received a June 30 “ pastoral letter ” from Steinbock ’s office in which the bishop condemned the California Supreme Court ’s ruling in May that legalized same - sex marriage , and supported the passage of Proposition 8 , calling marriage between a man and woman the “ foundation blocks for society . ”
He compared the court ’s action to efforts by Nazi Germany and the Communist regimes in Russia and China to alter family arrangements .
“ Let us pray for our Christian marriages and our Christian families , and for our children who will be subjected to brainwashing in our public school system regarding this matter , ” he wrote .
Steinbock ’s letter threw Farrow into a moral quandary , he said , and prompted his sermon .
“ At what point do you cease to be an agent for healing and growth and become an accomplice of injustice ? ” he asked .
Advertisement
Farrow said he knew his comments would generate an uproar .
He started to pack up his office the night before his address .
He cleared his belongings from the church rectory within hours of greeting parishioners after church services .
He left town so quickly that he was unable to find one of his two cats .
He drove to Los Angeles , where he is staying with friends .
Farrow sent Steinbock a letter last week saying that he would resume his pastoral duties unless he heard otherwise .
But in his disciplinary letter , Steinbock said Farrow had abandoned his assignment without offering to discuss the issues .
Steinbock said he had no choice but to suspend Farrow , and he hinted that other penalties could follow , including defrocking him .
Steinbock did not return calls .

The tiny skull of a juvenile dinosaur with a strange set of chompers has delighted paleontologists , who believe it proves that the species was a transitional phase between carnivorous dinosaurs and herbivores .
The Heterodontosaurus has both sharp canine teeth for biting and molars for grinding , suggesting that the species dined on both small reptiles and insects as well as leafy greens .
Says study coauthor Laura Porro : “ It ’s likely that all dinosaurs evolved from carnivorous ancestors .
Since Heterodontosaurs are among the earliest dinosaurs adapted to eating plants , they may represent a transition phase between meat - eating ancestors and more sophisticated , fully herbivorous descendants ” [ Telegraph ] .
The omnivorous dino lived 190 million years ago in the Early Jurassic period , Porro says .
Only two other Heterodontosaurus fossils have been found previously , and those both belonged to adults .
This newly discovered fossilized skullmeasures less than 2 inches in length and belonged to a juvenile weighing less than two sticks of butter …
[ The researchers ] studied the juvenile ’s skull and determined the individual was probably buried alive in a sandstorm , a mode of death that left its remains in “ relatively good condition ” [ Discovery News ] .
The study , which will be published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , settles a debate over the Heterodontosaurus .
The sharp canine teeth had been observed before in the adult specimens , and some paleontologists believed the teeth were a sexually dimorphic characteristic , present only in males and probably used to fight other males over territory and mates .
But the researchers found the juvenile already had a fully - developed set of canines .
“ The fact that canines are present at such an early stage of growth strongly suggests that this is not a sexually dimorphic character , because such characters tend to appear later in life , ” [ study coauthor Richard ] Butler said [ LiveScience ] .
Instead , the teeth seem to have been used for eating .
If the Heterodontosaurus was evolving into an herbivore , it would n’t have been the first dinosaur to do so :
There were other plant - eating dinosaurs at the time of Heterodontosaurus including the long - necked sauropods .
But this little creature was one of the earliest of the ornithischians that soon become very important in the Age of Dinosaurs .
Later [ vegetarian ] ornithischians included the duck - billed dinosaurs , horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops and tank - like dinosaurs such as Ankylosaurus [ Reuters ] .

" Next thing I know , I 'm calling everyone in the league , giving out secrets , " Favre said .
" I 'm willing to help , but it 's awful ridiculous . "
Favre spent nearly 15 minutes answering questions about the FoxSports.com report Sunday that said he called the Lions before their Sept. 14 game against the Packers .
The report said Favre spent more than an hour giving Millen and Lions coaches information on nuances of the offense he used to run .
Green Bay won the game 48 - 25 .
" I did not call the Lions , nor did I call Tony Romo , " a defiant Favre said .
" I do n't know what else to tell everyone , but I 'm not calling people . "
Glazer defended what he wrote .
" I stand by my story 1000 percent , " Glazer told The Associated Press .
" I guess Brett and I will just agree to disagree on certain things .
The way I do my work , I do n't go on what just one person told me .
I investigated this fully and for quite some time .
I spoke with several sources , and when I go with something , I make sure it 's dead - on .
I think my track record speaks for itself . "
Favre said he received a call from Millen while traveling home from the Jets ' training facility , and the two spoke for no more than 25 minutes .
" When Matt called me and was talking about hunting and told me that he lived an hour from here , do n't think for a second I was n't thinking , ' Now , surely he wants to know something , ' " Favre said .
" Yeah , I played for the Packers for 16 years and we played against the Lions a bunch , but it 's no secret what we did against them .
I do n't have a playbook from Green Bay .
I did n't send the playbook .
I did n't call him and say , ' Look , if you do this , you 're going to win the game . '
I did n't do that . "
Green Bay beat Detroit twice last season , including a 37 - 26 victory in November in which Favre set a team record with 20 consecutive completions .
" We went empty formation and just keep throwing completion after completion , " Favre said he told Millen .
" They study film , they know what type of plays .
Once again , I do n't want to make this any bigger than it is . "
As far as Favre knew , he was on the line only with Millen .
" That 's it , " he said .
" Story 's not as good now , is it ? "
He added that if he were " a guessing man , " there 's a chance other people might have been listening in on the conversation .
" I do n't know , " he said .
" I 'm telling you , I did n't have a game plan in my lap , driving home , saying , ' OK , last year , third - and - 3 to [ the ] 6 , we went hold on , light . "
Favre , wearing a green Jets sweatshirt and a navy New York Titans cap , held his composure throughout the news conference .
He clenched his jaw a few times and only once raised his voice in anger , when he was told that former teammate Charles Woodson said if the Lions called Favre , it 's OK , but not if it happened the other way around .
" Go back and tell Charles I did not call them , " an irritated Favre said .
" I did n't call 'em . "
Favre was asked numerous times if he might have said anything that could be perceived as helping the Lions plan for the Packers .
After all , Favre and Green Bay had an ugly divorce in the summer .
" I'm well aware of the perception of what 's going on , " Favre said .
" Are n't you and is n't everyone else ?
Believe me , I 'm trying my best to help this team win , the New York Jets , and spending no time trying to make sure the Packers lose .
I 've got enough on my plate , believe me . "
Both Favre and Jets coach Eric Mangini said that sharing information is common in the NFL , and it is n't against league rules .
" It happens every day , " Favre said .
" It happens more than you know . "
" We do not have a comment , " league spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail .
" Even if it were true , there would be no violation of league rules . "
Favre said the controversy would n't change the way he approaches similar situations .
" Nothing was wrong , " he said .
" If Matt calls me and says , ' Sorry about the big deal , the offer still stands , ' I 'll take the call .
I know he's not in football right now , but , you know , nothing happened .
Nothing happened that was any different than happens any other day .
But the fact I was in Green Bay for so long and what happened this offseason , that makes it a big deal .
" I am who I am .
I 'm part of the Jets .
I 'm trying to get ready for the Chiefs .
I do n't have time to be dealing with other issues , especially other game plans .
I wish them well up there .
I really do . "

The press fights back :
From a new PEW study :
McCain did succeed in erasing one advantage Obama enjoyed earlier in the campaign -- the level of media exposure each candidate received ... Much of the increased attention for McCain derived from actions by the senator himself , actions that , in the end , generated mostly negative assessments .
In many ways , the arc of the media narrative during this phase of the 2008 general election might be best described as a drama in which John McCain has acted and Barack Obama has reacted .
The Lone Ranger A Look Back -- and Forward -- on the Eve of History
For many veterans of the civil rights movement , Obama 's anticipated victory seems like the sudden realization of a dream long abandoned , writes SPIEGEL ONLINE blogger Peter Ross Range .
But the dream comes with a morning after .
I do n’t see how he can even stick with his breakfast decision two minutes ago let alone guiding the US out of this recession .
The more he wobbles , flips and flops , the more erratic and unprepared he looks to everyone including those who should be aligned with him .
This is a desperate person who will say anything in an attempt to win ( or send his wife out to smear ) so be ready for even more outrageous attacks .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) made an overnight change in the homeowner bailout he proposed at Tuesday ’s presidential debate , making it more generous to financial institutions and more costly for taxpayers .
McCain ’s staff says it was always meant that way .
Of course it was meant to be that way .
Of course it was .
There there , John .
Have a cup of warm milk and try again tomorrow .

More than any other factor , it is the understanding of web accessibility obstacles that has best assisted me in the pursuit of making my sites and those of my clients as accessible as possible .
But is n’t that always the way ?
We cannot avoid danger if we cannot recognize it .
That ’s what I tell my son .
I stress that he can do anything he wants to in life , but before jumping in with both feet he would be smart to first identify the risks so that he may avoid them .
As this pertains to web accessibility the risks are , of course , a lack of access to those who need it .

Ministers resigned en masse to see off parliamentary grilling The Kuwaiti government has submitted its resignation to the emir .
However , the official news agency said Emir Sheikh Sabah al - Ahmad al - Sabah would not decide immediately whether to accept it .
The move follows demands by some MPs to question the prime minister over the recent visit of an Iranian Shia cleric accused of insulting Sunni Muslims .
Three Islamist MPs took offence to remarks the cleric made about some companions of the Prophet Muhammad .
The resignations are the latest in a series of political crises in Kuwait .
Ministers led by the Prime Minister , Sheikh Nasser Mohammed al - Ahmad al - Sabah , walked out of parliament as it was about to set a date for the questioning session .
Without the government in attendance , parliament is not able to proceed with any business .
Dissolution ?
In the past , Sheikh Sabah has reshuffled governments or dissolved parliament to head off questioning sessions and the votes of confidence that often follow .
MPs are unable to question the same minister for the same reason following a ministerial reshuffle .
The current cabinet is the third formed since March 2007 .
The walkout of the government was a surprise to everyone .
It 's an indication that parliament might get dissolved
Deputy Abdullah Rai al - Fahma
The Kuwaiti parliament has a reputation for being one of the most independent of any in the Gulf states .
But the willingness by some MPs to question the prime minister , a member of the royal family , is still controversial .
The three Islamist lawmakers have not confined their criticism of the prime minister to theological matters .
They have also accused him of corruption and allowing public services to deteriorate .
There are fears that another political crisis in this oil - producing state could further delay key economic reforms intended to respond to the global economic slowdown .
The government had hoped to pump extra cash into the Arab world 's second largest stock exchange and to set up a new financial regulatory system .

Ex -Romney aide , College Republican head , busted on sex offender charges
A former aide to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who also played a leadership role in Iowa 's College Republicans was arrested by Des Moines - area police earlier in the week on outstanding warrants related to his status as a convicted sex offender .
Matthew Joseph Elliott , aged 26 , and identified in numerous accounts as Matt Elliott , was arrested on Jan. 21 for outstanding warrants relating to his registered sex offender status , according to the Polk County government website .
The Iowa registry of sex offenders also shows that he was convicted of exploiting a minor and given a " low " risk assessment .
The website Truth Caucus and an additional source independently confirmed to RAW STORY that Elliott was the same individual described in a Feb. 2006 account in the Washington Post .
He briefly joined the Iowa presidential campaign staff of Governor Mitt Romney before leaving to run for a seat in the Iowa state legislature .
Additionally , Elliott was a leading College Republican in Iowa while attending Drake University , where he served as student body president .
Elliott also served as director of the Iowa Republicans ' Legislative Majority Fund .
Iowa state records show he was convicted on the sex charges in October 2006 , months after leaving the Romney campaign .
West Des Moines police arrested Elliott while they were investigating the death of 7 - month - old Alexis Gilbert , according to KCCI8 - TV , found dead in her family 's home where Elliott was staying .
Elliott has been questioned , but not charged in relation to her death , which has been ruled a homicide .
Gilbert 's mother , Kristina , is 16 years of age , and her family has refused to explain Elliott 's relationship to the family , according to the Des Moines Register .
Reached for comment by the the Boston Herald on Friday , Romney 's campaign argued that Elliott was never affiliated the campaign , only with Romney 's Commonwealth PAC .

It started with the Google Browser , now security flaws are extending into Google ’s Android phone .
The real question right now is what has happened to Google ’s formerly impeccable record in information security ?
Google has an enviable record in web based information security , flaws are found quick and patched , they work with the outside community , and generally are very aware and proactive of security issues with their web - based applications .
However , the last two applications , the Chrome Browser , and now the phone operating system , Android have been released with serious security flaws .
The android flaws though center on the browser , and on the image processing system both of which have been well known for a very long time .
Chromes issues started out because they were using an outdated web kit , and androids problem seems like it is also centering on the use of outdated and older rendering libraries .
The sad part is that these types of flaws have been known for a while , and the documentation on the flaws in the libraries is also well known .
The use of these libraries and other tools used in systems should never have made it to the light of day if there had been a focus on security first .
Microsoft and the Open Source community get this concept and are aggressive about finding and patching these kinds of issues .
Google not so much based on what we are seeing with their formal software products .
While it is good to sandbox each of the applications within the android framework , it is also well known how to bounce out of those sand boxes and then corrupt the entire framework that the program runs on .
Using a sand box as a security mechanism is more akin to using a speed bump , rather than trying to ensure that the entire framework is secure .
Sandboxes serve their purpose , but should not be the last word in the security of a device .
It would be great to see Google take on these kinds of issues , ensuring that the programs that run on their desktop and cell phones is using good libraries , up to date base software and not ones that are known to have flaws .
This is more of an issue within how code is written in Google for an application rather than anything else .
Google will address them sooner or later if they have not already pushed patches to the system , but the base SDK should be upgraded as well , otherwise there is too much of a risk that the underlying code will be broken , and the sand box violated so that the entire smart phone or browser can be owned by someone else .

Kimberlee Ouwroulis : 44 - Year - Old Stripper Sues for Age Discrimination ( Photos )
, a 44 - year - old stripper , is suing Canadian strip club , New Locomotion , for age discrimination after being fired from her job as an exotic dancer .
Ouwroulis , who began stripping at age 40 , says she was told by her manager " You 're done here , " on the same day another older woman was fired .
She alleges that the manager told her the club was going for a younger look .
Currently working as a dancer in another strip club , Ouwroulis says she plans to be in the business until she 's 47 or 48 .
While I admit she looks pretty good - in a stipper kinda way , her career path does n't seem all that smart .
Stripping is the only business I can think of where the longer you are in it ( and the older you get ) the less money you 'll likely make .

Scientists discover single brain cell dedicated to Jennifer Aniston inside woman 's head
It is a discovery that could explain the enduring appeal of Friends .
Scientists have found brain cells devoted to Jennifer Aniston .
Fans of the actress , who played socialite Rachel Green in the Channel 4 sit-com , are likely to have at least one brain cell that springs into action each time they see a picture of her , research suggests .
Other brain cells are similarly encoded to store memories of individual celebrities , from actress Halle Berry to former US presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan .
On the brain : Fans of Friends actress Jennifer Aniston are likely to have at least one brain cell spring into action each time they see her
Even Star Wars character Luke Skywalker has a cell of his own .
The Leicester University research , contradicts the popular theory that a large network of cells are involved in processing images of people .
Instead , it appears , our brains streamline the process by devoting individual cells to store memories of specific people or places .
Neuroscientist Rodrigo Quian Quiroga ( CORR ) made the finding after showing people being treated for epilepsy hundreds of pictures of famous people and of landmarks .
Tiny electrodes implanted as part of their treatment picked up the electrical activity or ' firing ' of around 100 brain cells in each person .
Tests showed that one woman had a cell that specifically recognised pictures of Jennifer Aniston .
Memorable :
The research claims people 's brain cells are encoded to store memories of individual celebrities like former U.S. president Bill Clinton ( left ) - even when in costume like Halle Berry ( right )
Another woman had a brain cell for pictures of Halle Berry , responding to drawings of her face and an image of just the words in her name .
Even a picture in which the Catwoman actress 's face was almost covered by her costume made the cell fire .
Other celebrities exciting individual brain cells included Pamela Anderson , Oprah Winfrey and Tom Cruise .
Famous landmarks also had their own cells .
The study also showed that the same person can have a number of cells devoted to different celebrities or landmarks .
Professor Quian Quiroga said : ' The patient with the Jennifer Aniston neuron had 19 other cells firing to different things .
' There was one firing to Pamela Anderson , another one was firing to the Tower of Pisa , another to Sydney Opera House and so on . '
Although the researchers only found one Jennifer Aniston or Halle Berry cell per person , they only sampled a fraction of the available brain cells .
This means each person 's brain is likely to have a number cells devoted to their favourite celebrities .
It is likely we also have cells coded to recognise family members .
In further experiments , the researchers have shown it is possible to tell whether a person is looking at a picture of Jennifer Aniston or of Halle Berry simply by monitoring their brain cells .
Professor Quian Quiroga , who will give a lecture on his findings next week , said they could feed into research into the development of prosthetic limbs driven by the brain .
The work could also aid research into Alzheimer 's disease , epilepsy , schizophrenia and other conditions which involve the area of the brain studied .

It 's about an Iraqi citizen who fled Iraq with his family to avoid the death squads of Saddam Hussein , worked day and night to support himself through the University of Derby in the East Midlands of England , invented a device now employed by the British military , and was just awarded the Special Commendation Award at the 2008 Lord Stafford Awards East Midlands for developing the device .
The device is a portable translator worn on the wrist .
It 's called the AHKY , which is Arabic for " speak , and its inventor , 23 year - old Amin Ismail , created the wrist - watch translator to assist military , border personnel , and other officials to communicate instructions to Iraqi citizens in high risk situations , when a human translater is not available .
A human translator is rarely accessible during searches , stops , or other dangerous missions .
The AHKY uses voice recognition software and is programmed with translations like " Do n't shoot ! " " Please stop " " We will not hurt you . "
Amin Ismail created the prototype as part of his course work at University of Derby , where he recently graduated with a degree in design .
After interviewing British soldiers to insure the most important phrases would be included in AHKY , Mr. Ismail and his university instructors introduced his design to Civil Defence Supply Ltd ( CDS ) a multi-million pound company that supplies operational equipment to the British military , police , NATO , United Nations , and the US Defence Department .
CDS decided to collaborate with Mr. Ismail and the University on the production of AHKY , and the invention is now in use !
Wait !
That 's not the end of the story .
As if any inventor would n't love to have his or her invention being used to save lives in war zones and other dangerous situations , Mr. Ismail was hired by CDS , the company known informally as the ' Q " division of James Bond films .
And , if a job with a world supplier of defence technology was n't enough , Mr. Ismail received a Special Commendation Award for his invention , during the 50th annual presentation of the Lord Stafford Awards , presented by Lord Digby Jones , British Minister for Trade and Investment .
The Special Commendation was presented on September 11 , 2008 , as Mr. Ismail 's family watched proudly from the audience .
Ismail was gracious in his acceptance of the award .
He said :
“ This project has been a small way for me to thank the British soldiers for their honourable work to bring freedom to the Iraqi people .
The soldiers working here do so in high risk situations where the slightest misunderstanding might lead to tragedy .
If this device can help save innocent lives in a conflict situation I will be so proud . ”
Mr Ismail , you have made many , many people proud of you already !

WASHINGTON , Nov 13 ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan 's geography and socioeconomic conditions will make it hard for the U.S. military there to duplicate policies that helped stem Iraq 's insurgency , a senior Pentagon official said on Thursday .
Eric Edelman , undersecretary of defense for policy , said even during Iraq 's most violent period , it was clear that Afghanistan would require much longer international attention than Iraq .
" It 's not going to be an easy , cookie - cutter transfer " he said of hopes that Gen. David Petraeus , the overall commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq , will be able to apply to Kabul policies that worked in Baghdad .
Edelman told reporters that in contrast to Iraq 's huge oil and gas resources , centralized government and well - educated population , Afghanistan has grave poverty , little history of centralized rule and 80 percent illiteracy .
Afghanistan 's forbidding terrain and the fact that Taliban and other militants base themselves in rural areas also posed greater challenges to U.S. forces than Iraq 's largely urban insurgency , said Edelman .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , who takes over in January , has promised to withdraw combat troops from Iraq on a timetable that could be completed in 16 months and to bolster forces battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in Afghanistan .
Obama has also suggested he was open to talks with more moderate Taliban leaders to explore whether the Petraeus strategy of talking to enemies that is credited with helping turn the situation around in Iraq would work in Afghanistan .
Edelman said efforts at seeking political reconciliation would make sense at some future point , but that the Afghan government should take the lead and " the question is when is that point and to whom do you talk . "
Afghan 's regionalism and complex ethnic and tribal make - up further muddy the waters when it comes to trying to separate potentially reconcilable groups from hostile foes .
" Iraq is complicated enough .
Afghanistan is more complicated , " Edelman said of tribal and ethnic divides .
U.S. commanders in Afghanistan have requested 12,000 to 15,000 additional U.S. troops on top of the 31,000 now in Afghanistan and a brigade expected in February .
Edelman , who is retiring and will not serve in the incoming administration , predicted there would be some resistance from U.S. commanders to drawing down troops from Iraq rapidly in 2009 , when Baghdad holds three sets of elections .
" There will be a tension between trying to get more U.S. forces to Afghanistan quickly ... and the requirements that the commanders in Iraq feel that they have in order to get through a very important year in Iraq , " he said .

Plenty of evidence to impeach Bush
Letter to the Editor
I just could n't let this get by : a recent call to stop calls for impeachment of Bush by Joe of Elk Grove Village .
He states that there is no indisputable proof to impeach Bush .
Well , I have one bit of proof :
How about when asked if he was still in the hunt for Bin Ladin ?
His response was and " I do n't give it much thought anymore . "
That , my friend , is reason enough for me .
One of the things he is sworn to do is protect America from its enemies and he does n't think about it much anymore .
Are you kidding me ?
Or maybe lying to America about weapons of mass destruction and taking us into a war we should not be in .
It has cost some 4,200 fine military soldiers their lives and some 28,000 to be very seriously injured and who knows to what extent it has cost the Iraqi people , That 's just for starters .
I 'm sure though if he were brought before Congress or a court , he would follow the steps of all the rest who have come and gone in this administration .
He would simply say " I do n't remember " or " I do n't recall " or what seems to be the new strategy , blame the Democrats .

Sarah Palin in Des Moines whippin ' up fear of communism if heaven forbid Obama gets elected ... you betcha ' .
Partial transcript courtesy of Sam Stein over at the HuffPo but I thought a bit more of this fear fest was worth sharing than they posted there .
See , under a big government , more tax agenda , what you thought was yours would really start belonging to somebody else , to everybody else .
If you thought your income , your property , your inventory , your investments were , were yours , they would really collectively belong to everybody .
Obama , Barack Obama has an ideological commitment to higher taxes , and I say this based on his record ...
Higher taxes , more government , misusing the power to tax leads to government moving into the role of some believing that government then has to take care of us .
And government kind of moving into the role as the other half of our family , making decisions for us .
Now , they do this in other countries where the people are not free .
Let us fight for what is right .
John McCain and I , we will put our trust in you .
This is pretty rich coming from someone who had no problem " spreadin ' the wealth around " from the oil companies to the citizens in Alaska .
Complaints of " big government spenders " ring pretty hollow from someone who left her small town $ 20 million in debt .
And to make this whole thing all the more lovely , at the 2:38 mark in the video , it sounds like one of her supporters yells out " He 's a n** ger " .
Please .
Make .
It . Stop .
I 've had enough of the fear mongering and the race baiting .
I do n't know about anyone else , but to me this whole meme they 've latched onto with the " spreading the wealth around " comments , and the latest cries of socialism , or communism , or whatever " ism " of the day they want to try to slap onto Obama ... it all just reeks of racism .
The dog whistle they 're blowing for the folks this hits home with is this : " Obama wants to give your hard - earned tax dollars to all of the lazy Negroes who want to sit home all day and collect welfare while you white people have to go to work every day to support them . "
Of course , this is not what Obama is advocating when he promotes tax breaks for the middle class .
I truly hope that most of this country has grown as weary of this type of class warfare as I have .
It 's pitting one group of working people against another , and against the poor .
Divide and conquer .
It 's all they have left .
The State 's Republican SoS Helped Shut Down FL 2000 Recount , Imposed Disenfranchising Photo ID Restrictions at Polling Places , and Is Now Pushing RICO Prosecution of ACORN ...

What 's the matter with Indiana ?
Nothing .
Unless you want to vote .
And happen to fall onto anti-democracy champion , Republican Sec. of State Todd Rokita 's hit list ...
TPM Muckraker proves the value of LexisNexis today by digging up a 2002 South Bend Review news story highlighting the Rokita 's involvement in the Florida 2000 Presidential election fiasco [ emphasis ours ] :
Working on his own time , [ Rokita ] also assisted George W. Bush 's campaign during the infamous Florida election recount in 2000 .
Rokita is proud of that , especially because the U.S. Supreme Court cited Indiana election law when it decided the election in Bush 's favor .
The Republican Rokita was elected to the state 's top election position just a few short years later , in 2002 .
He 's been very , very busy , in the last few years in the battleground state , pushing for the most restrictive photo I.D. voting laws in the nation .
Rokita has been hard at work again , sendingsending a letter [ PDF ] to NW Indiana U.S Attorney David Capp , the Indiana Attorney General Steve Carter , the FBI , and the Lake County , IN , Prosecutor requesting prosecution of ACORN under RICO statutes , declaring that his office " has found evidence of multiple criminal violations , including possible state and federal racketeering laws , in conjunction with hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications filed in Lake County . "
At issue are two apparently opposing statutes in Indiana law --- a requirement to turn in voter registration forms vs. knowingly submitting fraudulent applications . "
The full story follows ...
From the Indy Star :
Rokita : Acorn linked to voter irregularities Secretary of State Todd Rokita said today that a preliminary investigation by his office has found evidence of multiple criminal violations , including possible state and federal racketeering laws , in conjunction with hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications filed in Lake County .
The findings and a request for prosecution are detailed in a letter Rokita , Indiana ’s top election official , sent last week to Lake County Prosecutor Bernard A. Carter , U.S. Attorney David Capp and Michael Welch , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Indianapolis office .
...
Acorn officials contend they are required by law to submit all applications it collects , and a spokesman said they made efforts to call attention to applications that appeared to be problematic .
The official said Acorn was the victim of unscrupulous employees and the organization fired at least five of those involved with the Lake County drive .
Rokita 's letter , however , states that " complying with the law to submit legitimate applications does not allow Acorn officials to evade the law against knowingly submitting fraudulent applications . "

Muckraker , the Obama Campaign held a conference call on Monday to protest what they call " an orchestrated effort on the part of Republican officials across the country to work with the McCain - Palin ticket and the Republican National Committee to disseminate this message of fraud ... "
The Times of Northwest Indiana reports that in a conference call with reporters this afternoon , Bob Bauer , the campaign 's top election lawyer , said : " We have seen an orchestrated effort on the part of Republican officials across the country to work with the McCain - Palin ticket and the Republican National Committee to disseminate this message of fraud . "
Bauer called the effort " a fear campaign . "
Lake County has already been a hotspot for GOP attempts at voter suppression .
Last week , the state Supreme Court declined to support a Republican bid to shut down early voting centers in three strongly Democratic cities in northern Lake County .
More from the NWI Times :
" Unfortunately , this seems to be partisan attack on minority voter registration activities , " ACORN spokesman Brian Kettenring said Monday .
" We would point out that we have brought to attention approximately 2,100 cards that we ourselves have identified as problematic , including the Jimmy John card .
What seems to have happened here is the process has been politicized and our own quality control procedures are being turn against us . "
ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , has blamed the bulk of the invalid registration on a handful of unscrupulous canvassers , who were paid $ 8 to register voters .
Kettenring said state law requires the group to turn in every application collected , so it segregated the sketchy forms before submitting them to Lake County officials .
The Indiana Law Blog helpfully points to the relevant portion of Rokita 's letter , in which the Republican Secretary of State argues that , even though ACORN says it complied with the law requiring that all forms be submitted , the organization is not absolved of " knowingly submitting fraudulent forms , " a Class D felony :
IV .
ACORN'S Public Defense is not Relevant to the Violations of Law If ACORN is contending that it brought this matter to the attention of local election officials , then NWI - ACORN will surely wish to assist law enforcement in bringing the bad actors inside the organization to justice .
ACORN has also claimed to be in compliance with Indiana law IC 3 - 14 - 2 - 5 ( b ) .
But contrary to the claims of ACORN , a person who complies with the law to submit completed voter registration applications is not able as a result to evade the law against knowingly submitting false or fraudulent applications .
Indiana Code 3 - 14 - 2 - 5 ( b ) provides that a person who " fails to file or deliver to the proper officer a . . . form of registration after the . . . form has been executed commits a Class A misdemeanor . "
The law exists to prevent " lost " applications of those thought to be supporters of an opposing party candidate , for example .
Indiana Code 3-14-3-1.1 makes it a Class D felony for a person to knowingly procure or submit " voter registration applications known by the person to be materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent " and IC 3 - 14 - 2 - 1 makes it a Class D felony for a person to conspire with another in such behavior .
Every person has the duty under the law not to aid or assist others in breaking the law .
Clearly , ACORN representatives continued to submit applications they knew to be fraudulent to voter registration officials rather than submit evidence and contact information for possible suspects to local law enforcement officials ( who have offices in the same building ) .
Simply put , complying with the law to submit legitimate applications does not allow ACORN officials to evade the law against knowingly submitting fraudulent applications .
[ ILB - Emphasis in the original . ]
For its part , ACORN has responded that Rokita " appears to have changed his opinion on this question two weeks before the election " :
...
Echoing prior statements by ACORN , Kettenring also said " what 's clear is that there is a coordinated Republican effort to go after , to manufacture a crisis of voter fraud . "
The group said it detailed its quality control procedures and said that election officials in Lake County had refused the group 's documentation flagging applications the group considered questionable and refused to meet with ACORN to discuss how to handle the applications ACORN had flagged .
It also said it looked forward to cooperating with Indiana authorities in prosecuting employees " who have defrauded us " by filing faked forms .... Echoing prior statements by ACORN , Kettenring also said " what 's clear is that there is a coordinated Republican effort to go after , to manufacture a crisis of voter fraud . "
" Bogus voter registration applications are not fraud , period , " Kettenring said , distinguishing between a fraudulent application and the later act of someone casting a ballot on the basis of a fraudulently procured registration that was submitted and resulted in a tainted registration being placed on the voter rolls .
" And , so what you really have is a hysteria about a non-issue , " Kettenring added .
Rokita 's heavily redacted letter is also posted with the NWI Times article , and can be viewed here [ PDF ] .
Here 's the statute Rokita cites :
IC 3-14-3-1.1 Procuring or submission of false , fictitious , or fraudulent registration application ; procuring , casting , or tabulating false , fictitious , or fraudulent ballot Sec. 1.1 .
A person who knowingly does any of the following commits a Class D felony : ( 1 ) Procures or submits voter registration applications known by the person to be materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent .
(2) Procures , casts , or tabulates ballots known by the person to be materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent .
As added by P.L.103-2005 , SEC.32 .
And the seemingly contradictory statute cited by ACORN , requiring that all registration applications must be submitted by law :
IC 3 - 14 - 2- 5 Destruction or failure to file or deliver registration form or absentee ballot application after execution Sec. 5 . ( a ) A person who recklessly destroys or fails to deliver an absentee ballot application to the proper officer after the application has been executed by another individual in accordance with IC 3 - 11 - 4 commits a Class A misdemeanor .
( b ) A person who recklessly destroys or fails to file or deliver to the proper officer a registration affidavit or form of registration after the affidavit or form has been executed commits a Class A misdemeanor .
As added by P.L.5-1986 , SEC.10 .
Amended by P.L.103-2005 , SEC .24 .
SAN FRANCISCO  Pushing ahead in the decades - long effort to get computers to understand human speech , Google researchers have added sophisticated voice recognition technology to the company ’s search software for the Apple iPhone .
Users of the free application , which Apple is expected to make available as soon as Friday through its iTunes store , can place the phone to their ear and ask virtually any question , like “ Where ’s the nearest Starbucks ? ” or “ How tall is Mount Everest ? ”
The sound is converted to a digital file and sent to Google ’s servers , which try to determine the words spoken and pass them along to the Google search engine .
The search results , which may be displayed in just seconds on a fast wireless network , will at times include local information , taking advantage of iPhone features that let it determine its location .
The ability to recognize just about any phrase from any person has long been the supreme goal of artificial intelligence researchers looking for ways to make man-machine interactions more natural .
Systems that can do this have recently started making their way into commercial products .
Socialism is a very difficult thing to achieve .
Up until now there have been two attempted paths towards reaching that goal : Revolution and Reformism .
Neither has succeeded .
The first path ( usually ) fell victim to counter - revolution and nowadays lacks enough traction in its necessary base , the working class .
The second path always gets corrupted and sidetracked too much and simply ends up perpetuating the status quo while keeping the name .
There is however one method which not only has not been attempted yet but also shows considerable promise of success .
The peer - organised , distributed , lead - by - example method of Free Software .
For those not familiar with the history of the Free Software movement , the basic thing you need to be aware of is that it was initiated in a completely hostile environment ( of propriertary software ) , without any help “ from - above ” .
It was simply based on a simple ruleset that ensured that the fruits of this effort would not be corrupted or misappropriated and thus lead to fragmentation .
The GPL .
Thus , there was no need for leaders or sponsors .
This result - oriented method has been a tremendous and monumental success .
From an obscure hacker ’s hobby in universities and basements , in 20 short years it has become a force to be reckoned with , respected and supported by major software players while still ensuring that they cannot abuse it for their own ends .
I believe there is here a method that not only has not yet been attempted but perhaps might be the key to finally breaking the stranglehold of Capitalism .
The method is simply to work within the system .
Show people how much better Socialism can work and then , once they have given it a try for practical reasons , introduce them to the ideology behind it .
Now do not be alarmed .
I am not talking about reformism but about subversion .
Let me explain :
The Free Software movement is based on Copyright law .
It gains power and utility by using the same system it was created to oppose !
How does it achieve this ?
By placing additional terms and restrictions on its supporters in order to ensure that the effort they put towards the movement will always remain with the movement and not leave with them .
Like a Judo master , it uses the considerable power of the system to defeat it .
Supporters come because the development method of Open Source is simply superior , it is easy to join , progressive and free .
Then , not all of them , but a sufficient amount get to hear about the philosophy behind it , adopt it and continue spreading it .
And guess what .
It not only worked but this socialistic culture has spread outside of Software ( See Wikipedia , Creative Commons etc ) .
To put things into perspective , lets see how the current two paths to Socialism would have worked when attempting to achieve a Free Software world .
Revolution :
The Software developers would forcibly or simply arbitrarily take the source code of the programs they had been hired to write and distribute it to their peers .
This would of course trigger a “ counter - revolution ” where the software bourgeois would attempt to stop such a unaccepted distribution .
Reformism : The Software developers would attempt to become company executives or shareholders with the purpose in mind to liberate the source code to their peers when they had enough power .
Unfortunately , not only power corrupts but the people in charge would never allow one who is incorruptible to achieve power .
Not only would it have been extremely difficult for either of these methods to succeed ( as has been the case with similar Socialist movements ) but without having a GPL to back them up , simply releasing the source into public domain would allow the effort to be subverted by the remaining active forces , thereby giving them a competitive advantage over our ( alternative universe ) free software movement .
I hope you ’re still with me .
So how can socialism use a similar method ?
How about working within Capitalism ?
Here ’s a rough idea
Create a constitution of similar ideals to the GPL that is a legally binding contract .
The whole point of this constitution would be to prevent the labour put into Socialism to be turned against it .
For example , have the clause that once a person becomes a member , he agrees to redirect all wealth acquired as a member back to the group .
He retains previous wealth ( so if at any point he decides to leave , he can be as when he first joined ) .
Thus while a member , he eschews private property .
Create a commune based on this constitution .
People joining this commune will have their future acquired wealth redirected back to this commune which should then ensure that individual members have a much higher standard of living on the bottom end than any other system .
If the commune has rules such a direct democracy and the like , based on Socialist ideology , it should also ensure that it is not corrupted .
Because of the superior bottom level of the commune , more people living in the bottom end of the current society will wish to join .
Such individuals can easily then be monitored to make sure that they follow the constitution and rules and slowly bring them into the ideology so that they follow the rules on their own volition .
To preserve direct democracy , Communes that become too large should be able to split and create smaller ones .
A clause in the constitution could be that any number of people can leave the commune with a direct percentage of the current wealth provided they create a new commune under the same constitution .
Thus the number of people living in such communes could increase without necessitating the formation of a state system within .
Slowly , though such a system more and more communes would form until it becomes the obvious choice for the proletariat to belong in one for their own security .
People could still choose to stay outside , but they would be at a competitive disadvantage .
Once these communes start owning enterprises and reap their own surplus value , they will be capable of stealing the lifeblood of Capitalism .

I have been writing about Christians for more than 20 years now .
I am married to one ; I was brought up as one , more or less .
Half a dozen of the most admirable , brave and honest people I know are Christians , and I do n't think for a moment that I am either smarter or better than they are .
If I am right , and they are wrong , this is due to no great merit on my part .
It is certainly not because I am less prone to illusion than they are , or more firmly attached to the truth .
I know I can generate quite enough illusions of my own without supernatural help .
These are n't mere preliminary throat - clearings .
They are a deep and important part of the reason why I think the world would be a worse and poorer place if Christianity were to vanish from it , even though , as I say , I am not a Christian myself .
Why not ?
I was brought up in a household that took religion seriously .
My father , who had spent his childhood in Belfast , regarded Christianity as important but wrong .
One of his earliest memories was of being pushed to the floor of a tram which was running down a street with the Protestants on one side shooting through the windows at the Catholics on the other and – ecumenically – vice versa .
He still went to church in his official capacity as a diplomat , but he never for a moment supposed that a grownup could take the doctrine seriously .
It had not been his observation that the meek inherited the earth or any significant part of it .
Nor have I seen as a journalist anything to prove him wrong .
My mother felt that belief was noble , church attendance a duty , and Christian ethics compelling , but she could n't , so far as I know , believe that the story was actually true .
I was sent to schools with compulsory chapel , which I disliked , though I loved the prayer book and rhythms of the King James Bible .
I still do .
When I was about 13 , I sat a scholarship exam to a second - rate public school , and got one on the strength of what was called the " divinity " essay .
This was my first real moment of doubt .
I remember looking at the piece , after 45 minutes of frantic scribbling , and thinking " This is very good ; very powerful .
But I do n't have the faintest idea of whether any of it is true " ; and it seemed to me that the chaplain who praised it could n't have any idea either .
Later in my adolescence , I discovered Jung , Robert Graves and The Golden Bough on mythology and Bertrand Russell 's essays ; Aldous Huxley and LSD for high - minded mysticism .
As a result , I thought myself far above any narrow little doctrines such as Christianity .
I would have said then that I was spiritual , but when I grew up a little more , I came to repudiate all that kind of romanticism in favour of a grim and rationalistic sobriety .
I read Gibbon and lots of Karl Popper .
I came to believe that we had a duty not to believe in miracles .
At the same time , I came to appreciate and to some extent understand the psychological realism of Christianity .
The fact of original sin still seems to me one of the most obvious and important things about human nature , even there was no garden , and no Adam , nor an Eve .
I can't believe in physical resurrections , but psychological ones keep people alive .
When I became a religious affairs correspondent , and started to meet Christian intellectuals , I came to realise that some at least believed nothing I found abhorrent or ridiculous .
They no more take the Bible as a work of history than I do .
There were some with whom I could and can talk seriously in the confidence that we understand the world in almost exactly the same light and see it disfigured by the same shadows .
It would be wrong and invidious to name living people , but the late Lord Runcie was one of the most admirable men I have ever known , and if Jesus was good enough for him that 's a powerful argument .
Yet still I wo n't join .
In need only reread some parts of CS Lewis to know that if that hectoring certainty is right , I would rather be wrong .
Most of the bishops I have known have been a sorry lot .
It is hard to believe that they are right about anything much and I would certainly not wish to associate myself with the modern Church of England and all its squalid vanities .
I left the 1998 Lambeth Conference determined to do nothing which might have me mistaken for a Christian .
No doubt the feeling is mutual .
This would n't matter if they were representatives of a great tradition .
But I find I can't believe in the tradition , either .
Looking at what Christians have actually believed about the world , and the ways that they have in practice understood their doctrines , I know that almost every Christian now alive would have been considered a heretic 500 years ago ; and that the witch - burners of the 17th century would themselves have been heretics 500 years before .
For similar reasons , I can't accept the intellectual authority of the Roman Catholic church .
Calvinism , while it it intellectually satisfying , is emotionally repugnant to me .
In the end , I suppose , my objections to God are , as they must be , theological : the workings of divine providence are just a little too inaccessible to human reasoning .
The problem of suffering remains insoluble .
There is no possible theodicy .
But I can't , either , take the Dawkinsian view that the problem of suffering is an illusion generated by the illusion of God .
You can't mend the heart in a heartless world by observing that the world is in fact heartless .
That 's not the point .
I suppose I end up saying that I accept the Christian account of the problem ; I just can't accept Christianity 's account of the solution , and so I remain , by the grace of God perhaps , an atheist .

Credit cards not only let you buy things on credit -- you have 52 days of free credit if you use them smartly -- but also allow you to pay a bare minimum -- 5 percent -- of your outstanding due .
This is what lures most credit card users into a debt trap which many find difficult to get out of .
In difficult times when you are short of means to pay for your credit card bills , paying minimum gives you a breather .
However , it may not save you from finding a concrete solution for paying your credit card debt .
Soon you may find yourself reeling under a debt trap .
Assuming that paying minimum of your outstanding amount is a good option is like digging your own grave .

In a report to the Army last year , Dr. Arkin described some of the potential benefits of autonomous fighting robots .
For one thing , they can be designed without an instinct for self - preservation and , as a result , no tendency to lash out in fear .
They can be built without anger or recklessness , Dr. Arkin wrote , and they can be made invulnerable to what he called “ the psychological problem of ‘ scenario fulfillment , ’ ” which causes people to absorb new information more easily if it agrees with their pre-existing ideas .
His report drew on a 2006 survey by the surgeon general of the Army , which found that fewer than half of soldiers and marines serving in Iraq said that noncombatants should be treated with dignity and respect , and 17 percent said all civilians should be treated as insurgents .
More than one - third said torture was acceptable under some conditions , and fewer than half said they would report a colleague for unethical battlefield behavior .
Troops who were stressed , angry , anxious or mourning lost colleagues or who had handled dead bodies were more likely to say they had mistreated civilian noncombatants , the survey said ( PDF ) .
( The survey can be read by searching for 1117 mhatreport at www.globalpolicy.org.)
“ It is not my belief that an unmanned system will be able to be perfectly ethical in the battlefield , ” Dr. Arkin wrote in his report ( PDF ) , “ but I am convinced that they can perform more ethically than human soldiers are capable of . ”
Image MORE ETHICAL ?
Ronald C. Arkin , a computer scientist at Georgia Tech , is designing software for battlefield robots .

Dr. Arkin said he could imagine a number of ways in which autonomous robot agents might be deployed as “ battlefield assistants ”  in countersniper operations , clearing buildings of suspected terrorists or other dangerous assignments where there may not be time for a robotic device to relay sights or sounds to a human operator and wait for instructions .
But first those robots would need to be programmed with rules about when it is acceptable to fire on a tank , and about more complicated and emotionally fraught tasks , like how to distinguish civilians , the wounded or someone trying to surrender from enemy troops on the attack , and whom to shoot .

When the McCain campaign used Sarah Palin to denigrate community organizers , it targeted a constituency that knows how to win political fights .
Consider McCain ’s all - out offensive against ACORN .
McCain claims the group is jeopardizing “ the fabric of democracy , ” and right - wing media outlets repeatedly accuse ACORN of “ voter fraud . ”
But ACORN ’s seasoned organizers have used media events , conference calls , and e-mail alerts to shift the debate , and put McCain on the defensive .
For example , ACORN gave the media a video of McCain praising its advocacy for low - income people at one of the group ’s 2006 events ; this made McCain ’s campaign season attacks appear hypocritical .
In addition , ACORN re-focused the media on three key issues it had neglected : the Bush Administration ’s firing of U.S. attorneys for refusing to prosecute bogus voter fraud claims , the Republican Party ’s recent history of making false charges of voter fraud , and the GOP ’s overall voter suppression strategy .
ACORN has taken its share of hits along the way , but its counter - attacks on McCain have clearly reduced the candidate ’s support .
ACORN ( the Associated Community Organizations for Reform Now ) has been around for 38 years , but it seems that many people did not know about its work until the McCain - Palin campaign targeted it for attacks .
These attacks have focused on the group ’s alleged involvement with voter fraud , a charge entirely based on the submission of some manifestly false voter registration forms by Project Vote , a group affiliated with ACORN .
ACORN Goes on Offensive
At first , the notion that ACORN was involved with submitting voter registration forms for “ Micky Mouse ” and other obviously non-eligible voters put the group on the defensive .
But ACORN quickly turned this around , informing media that most states require those collecting registration forms to turn them in even if they know they are invalid .
The media also noted the distinction between submitting a false registration form and an ineligible voter casting a ballot .
Cases of the latter have been extremely rare , while the former is a crime with no political consequence .
Having repelled the essence of McCain ’s charges , a less savvy group would have kept quiet and waited for the controversy to blow over .
But ACORN includes organizers with decades of experience in grassroots campaigns , and they saw an opportunity to use McCain ’s false attacks to inflict their own political damage .
First , ACORN reminded the media that the entire US Attorney scandal–ignored this campaign season –was based on Bush Administration anger that said officials refused to prosecute bogus voter fraud claims .
This tactic put McCain ’s attacks in a broader political context that weakens the credibility of his charges .
Second , ACORN produced a video showing McCain praising the group at a 2006 event .
The October 21 Colbert Report had a field day with the video , whose net impact is to portray McCain as a hypocrite , if not a liar .
Third , ACORN got the media to focus on two other neglected stories : the Republican history of charging voter fraud , and of engaging in voter suppression .
Suddenly , the media was less concerned about Micky Mouse registering to vote than about the 1.3 million new registrants secured by Project Vote who the Republicans sought to disenfranchise .
ACORN ’s media strategy was clearly helped by the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Ohio ’s new registrants , but the group ’s work gained this court ruling more prominent national coverage .
Voter suppression was off the media radar screen until ACORN began responding to McCain ’s attacks .
ACORN ’s efforts led the Obama campaign to formally raise the issue and to challenge a Justice Department leak that claimed the agency was “ investigating ” allegations of voter fraud at ACORN .
ACORN organizers succeeded in aligning the Obama campaign and soon much of the media with the cause of voter ’s rights , and made McCain - Palin appear to be opposed to increased voter registration .
It was now McCain - Palin , rather than ACORN , who the media was portraying as undermining the “ fabric of democracy . ”
Since McCain ’s attacks on ACORN began , his favorability numbers have plunged and his campaign has fallen into disarray .
ACORN was only one factor in this , but its organizers did help further the public sense that McCain was running a negative campaign focusing on trivial issues rather than on the economic crisis and other concerns at the top of voters minds .
At this point , McCain must wish the ACORN issue would simply go away .
But as ACORN organizers know , once one ’s constituency is attacked , it is not the assailant who decides when the conflict ends .
And ACORN now seems to be having too much fun turning the tables on McCain - Palin to stop .

Convention Arrest Charges to Be Dropped in ABC Case WATCH : Producer arrested taking video of Democratic senators on downtown street .
Oct. 16 , 2008  -- Criminal trespass charges filed against ABC News producer Asa Eslocker during the August Democratic Convention will be dropped by the Denver City Attorney , lawyers for Eslocker said today .
" We are enormously gratified that the Denver city attorney has agreed to drop these outrageous charges , " said ABC News senior vice president Jeffrey Schneider .
Eslocker was grabbed around the throat and put in handcuffs by a Denver police department sergeant as he and a camera crew attempted to take pictures from a public sidewalk of Democratic Senators and wealthy donors arriving at a secret meeting at the city 's Brown Palace hotel .
" I was only doing my job , trying to cover an extremely important aspect of American politics , " said Eslocker .
" I 'm glad this is over . "
An ABC camera crew recorded the incident on tape and it has been seen around the world .
( Click here to watch video of the arrest . )
" The individual officers violated Mr. Eslocker 's First Amendment rights , illegally ordered him away from the Brown Palace , wrongfully charged him with crimes and arrested him in a violent and thuggish manner , " said Eslocker 's lawyers Daniel Recht and Steve Zansberg .
" The general public should be outraged an offended , " they said .
The lawyers said they were notified Thursday the Denver city attorney would move to drop the charges at a court hearing in Denver Friday .
" We are glad common sense prevailed , " said ABC's Schneider .
A public information officer for the Denver police department said he had " no comment " on the decision to drop the charges or the allegations officers have behaved illegally .
Eslocker was part of an ABC News investigative team reporting on the connections between large donors and Democratic party officials for the " Money Trail " series on the ABC World News with Charles Gibson .

ROCKVILLE , Maryland ( Reuters ) - A major study links a chemical widely used in plastic products , including baby bottles , to health problems in humans like heart disease and diabetes , but U.S. regulators said on Tuesday they still believe it is safe .

The chemical bisphenol A , or BPA , is commonly used in plastic food and beverage containers and in the coating of food cans .
Until now , environmental and consumer activists who have questioned the safety of BPA have relied on animal studies .
But the study by British researchers in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that among 1,455 U.S. adults , those with the highest levels of BPA were more likely to have heart disease , diabetes and liver - enzyme abnormalities than those with the lowest levels .
U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said they would review the new findings , which were not yet published when the agency issued a draft conclusion in August that BPA is safe at current exposure levels .
“ We have confidence in the data that we ’ve looked at and the data that we ’re relying on to say that the margin of safety is adequate , ” FDA official Laura Tarantino said at a meeting of experts advising the agency on whether it made the right call .
“ There are things you can do if you choose to reduce your level of bisphenol A , ” Tarantino said .
“ But we have not recommended that anyone change their habits or change their use of any of these products because right now we do n’t have the evidence in front of us to suggest that people need to . ”
Panel chairman Martin Philbert declined to say what the committee ’s next move would be .
BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastic , a clear shatter - resistant material in products ranging from baby bottles to medical devices .
BPA can mimic the hormone estrogen in the body .
LEACHING INTO LIQUIDS
People can consume BPA when it leaches out of the plastic into baby formula , water or food inside a container .
Some retailers and manufacturers are moving away from products with BPA .
Canadian officials have concluded BPA was harmful .
Steven Hentges of the American Chemistry Council , an industry group , said the study ’s design did not allow for anyone to conclude BPA causes heart disease and diabetes .
“ On the other hand , though , bisphenol A has been very intensively studied in a very large number of laboratory animal studies .
And the weight of evidence from those studies ... continues to support the safe use of products containing bisphenol A , ” he said in a telephone interview .
The British researchers , who acknowledged their findings are not proof that the chemical is causing the harm , analyzed urine samples from a U.S. government health survey of adults ages 18 - 74 representative of the U.S. population .
The 25 percent of people with the highest levels of bisphenol A in their bodies were more than twice as likely to have heart disease , including heart attacks or type 2 diabetes , compared to the 25 percent with the lowest levels .
At the FDA panel meeting , several scientists and activists said the FDA ignored animal studies finding health concerns and some called for the chemical to be banned in food containers .
Democratic U.S. Rep. John Dingell of Michigan , who heads the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , said the FDA has “ focused myopically on industry - funded research . ”
Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley , ranking member of the Committee on Finance , released a letter he wrote to FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach asking why the agency has not appointed a safety panel to review BPA .
Tarantino said nothing was ignored but industry - funded studies finding no harm were important in the conclusions .
The panel is expected to present its advice to the FDA next month .
Tarantino , head of the FDA ’s office of food additive safety , said there is talk of government scientists doing their own BPA safety studies , but that could take years to conduct .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
An international team , led by astronomers at the MIT Haystack Observatory , has obtained the closest views ever of what is believed to be a super - massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy .
The astronomers linked together radio dishes in Hawaii , Arizona and California to create a virtual telescope more than 2,800 miles across that is capable of seeing details more than 1,000 times finer than the Hubble Space Telescope .
The cosmic target of the observations was the source known as Sagittarius A* ( " A - star " ) , long thought to mark the position of a black hole whose mass is 4 million times that of the sun .
Though Sagittarius
A* was discovered three decades ago , the new observations for the first time have an angular resolution , or ability to observe small details , that is matched to the size of the black hole " event horizon " -- the region inside of which nothing , including light , can ever escape .
The concept of black holes , objects so dense that their gravitational pull prevents anything including light itself from ever escaping their grasp , has long been hypothesized , but their existence has not yet been proved conclusively .
Astronomers study black holes by detecting the light emitted by matter that heats up as it is pulled closer to the event horizon .
By measuring the size of this glowing region at the Milky Way center , the new observations have revealed the highest density yet for the concentration of matter at the center of our galaxy , which " is important new evidence supporting the existence of black holes , " said Sheperd Doeleman of MIT , lead author of the study that will be published in the Sept. 4 issue of the journal Nature .
" This technique gives us an unmatched view of the region near the Milky Way 's central black hole , " Doeleman said .
" The new observations have a resolution equivalent to being able to see , from Earth , a baseball on the surface of the moon . "
The key to making these observations is a technique called very long baseline interferometry , or VLBI , which links simultaneous observations from several radio telescopes that can be thousands of miles apart .
The signals from these radio dishes are combined to create a " virtual " telescope with the same resolving power as a single telescope as large as the distance between the participating dishes .
As a result , VLBI can reveal exquisitely sharp details .
To create the continent - sized telescope , the team developed and installed special equipment at four observatories : the Arizona Radio Observatory 's Submillimeter Telescope ( ARO - SMT ) of the University of Arizona , the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter - wave Astronomy ( CARMA ) in California , and both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope ( JCMT ) and the Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) in Hawaii .
The new observations were done using very short radio waves of 1.3 millimeters wavelength , which can penetrate the fog of interstellar gas that blurs observations at longer wavelengths .
Like a distant light seen through a dense mist , longer - wavelength views of the Galactic Center are dimmed and distorted .
" The short wavelength observations combined with the large distances between the radio observatories is what makes this virtual telescope uniquely suited to study the black hole , " said Lucy Ziurys , Director of the Arizona Radio Observatory and a co-author of the study .
Though it takes light more than 25,000 years to reach us from the center of the Milky Way , the team measured the size of Sagittarius A* to be only one - third the Earth - sun distance -- a trip that light would make in only three minutes .
The astronomers concluded that the source of the radiation likely originates in either a disk of matter swirling in toward the black hole , or a high - speed jet of matter being ejected by the black hole .
" Future observations that create even larger virtual telescopes will be able to pinpoint exactly what makes Sagittarius A* light up , " Doeleman said .
" Most galaxies are now thought to have black holes at their centers , but because Sagittarius A* is in our own galaxy , it is our best chance to observe what 's happening at an event horizon . "
" This pioneering paper demonstrates that such observations are feasible , " commented theorist Avi Loeb of Harvard University , who was not a member of the discovery team .
" It opens up a new window for probing the structure of space and time near a black hole and testing Einstein 's theory of gravity . "

More Hassle , Fewer Flights
This Holiday Season
Fewer flights will be in the sky this holiday season .
Oct. 19 , 2008  --
Longer lines , higher prices and fewer route options await airline travelers this holiday season as carriers cut back on flights .
According to a USA Today analysis , 11 percent fewer flights will be available this Thanksgiving compared to last year .
That translates to 2.6 million fewer nonstop seats on domestic routes from the Thursday before Turkey Day until the Sunday after the holiday .
" Because of the extraordinary jet fuel prices that airlines saw earlier this year , they have cut 3,000 flights a day during this upcoming Thanksgiving travel season , " said USA Today airline reporter Marilyn Adams .
And after two previous winters of havoc at the nation 's airports , thanks to the shrinkage of flights , the margin of error will be even thinner this year .
" It means that there is any glitch in your trips such as snow storm or a flight delay or a cancellation or you are bumped from your flight it will be harder to get to where you are going , " Adams said .
The cuts are happening across the country with dramatic decreases at Chicago 's O'Hare , Houston , Dallas and Fort Worth airports .
If you want to fly from Charlotte , N.C. , to New York City , there will be only half as many flights this year .
US Airways has cut 40 percent of its Thanksgiving Day flights .
" Sounds terrible and kind of frightening , but what you have to remember there is a lot of those flights were pulled out because they were not profitable routes .
That basically means they were flying nearly empty for the airlines it just did n't make sense to fly them , " said Amy Ziff , Travelocity editor - at - large .
The changes come despite an early holiday gift for carries — lower oil prices .
" Oil prices , crude oil prices are heading down , but the airlines had to make decisions months ago when jet fuel prices , " Adams said .
Travel experts recommend planning your trip as soon as possible and not booking the last flight of the day in case of cancellations .
Getting to the airport early , allowing enough time to connect , packing light and avoiding checking a bag could make your travels easier , too .
The former UDA member , who attained notoriety in 1988 after killing three mourners when he launched a gun and grenade attack on an IRA funeral at Milltown cemetery in west Belfast , said his appearance at Stormont was a piece of theatre intended to expose the hypocrisy of the politicians .
Taking a short break from my artwork craze ( but I promise more is to come ) , I reviewed some of the new features and changes in Python , brought by versions 2.6 and 3.0 .
There are many interesting features , but a very specific one caught my eye : the ability to modify existing properties .
From the documentation :
Properties now have three attributes , getter , setter and deleter , that are decorators providing useful shortcuts for adding a getter , setter or deleter function to an existing property .
You would use them like this : class C ( object ) : @property def x( self ) : return self ._x @x.setter def x( self , value ) : self ._x = value @x.deleter def x( self ) : del self ._x class D( C ) : @ C.x.getter def x( self ) : return self ._x * 2 @x.setter def x( self , value ) : self ._x = value / 2
I found this very interesting .
If you ’re , for some reason , a frequent reader of this blog , you ’d remember how in a previous post I suggested a hack to allow namespaces inside Python classes .
However , it was largely incomplete because I could n’t get it to work for properties .
Perhaps now I can ?
Now , do n’t let that pretty decorator syntax mislead you .
Doing :
@x.setter def x( self , value ) : self ._x = value
is exactly identical to doing :
def x_set ( self , value ) : # Name changed to preserve ' x ' self ._x = value x = x.setter ( x_set )
And this is exactly what I was missing to complete my code .
So here is the new make_namespace , applying also to properties :
( This was only tested on Python 3 , but should also work for Python 2.6 .
It will not work on version 2.5 or lower )
import types def make_namespace ( self , ns_cls ) : " This code iterates all functions and properties in ns_cls and binds them to self " for attr_name in dir( ns_cls ) : attr = getattr( ns_cls , attr_name ) if type ( attr ) == types .
FunctionType : setattr( ns_cls , attr_name , attr.__get__( self ) ) elif type ( attr ) == property : setattr ( ns_cls , attr_name , attr .getter ( lambda x : attr.fget( self ) ) . setter ( lambda x , v : attr.fset ( self , v ) ) .deleter ( lambda x : attr.fdel( self ) ) ) return ns_cls ( )
Notice that I can chain getter , setter , and deleter , because they all return a property object .
And here is a possible usage :
class YetAnotherGuiWindow : def __init__ ( self , pos , size , ... ) : ... self._size = size self. spatial = make_namespace( self , self.spatial ) class spatial : ... def _get_size ( self ) : return self ._size def _set_size ( self , size ) : self._size = size size = property ( _get_size , _set_size ) ... ... # Meanwhile , in my console >>> g.spatial.size = ( 100,100 ) >>> g.spatial.size ( 100 , 100 ) >>> g.spatial.size = ( 140,10 ) >>> g.spatial.size ( 140 , 10 ) >>> g._size ( 140 , 10 )
I hope you ’ll find this useful !

A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
This week , we ’re happy to have Chris O’Sullivan from UK .
Satish Talim >>
Welcome , Chris and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Chris >>
I ’m Chris O’Sullivan , an Average Joe Ruby on Rails developer working for a media agency in London , UK .
I came to RoR development early last year after a long spell doing Windows development in .
Net and Delphi .
You can read my blog .
Willian Molinari , Brazil >>
How should one go about learning the Ruby language ?
What material ( books , eBooks , online tutorials etc. ) would you recommend ?
Chris >>
Like a gigantic proportion of the Rails community I came to Ruby because I wanted to learn about Rails – and in my arrogance I tried to create Rails applications without first figuring out Ruby .
Do n’t follow my foolish example , and pick up a Ruby book first !
After several false Rails starts I eventually picked up Mr Neighbourly ’s humble little Ruby book from Lulu ( written by Jeremy McNally ) and found it to be a tremendous resource .
I also owe a tonne to Ryan Bates ’s Railscast .
Every week he manages to put together a magnificent video tutorial .
It ’s worth watching each and every episode , even if you ’re not interested in the topic , as you ’ll learn a tonne about Ruby and Rails best practices .
Another excellent reference is David Black ’s Ruby for Rails .
A lot of stuff in Rails just feels like voodoo magic , but David explains with blessed simplicity how Ruby enables all this magic to happen .
The best way to learn about a language though is to make something !
Get started making a simple application , and you ’ll learn gabillions more than just reading books or watching screencasts .
Willian Molinari , Brazil >>
What has been your biggest challenge while working with Ruby ?
Chris >>
The biggest challenge for me has been to trying to drop my statically typed habits .
It ’s entirely easy to program Ruby with a C# or Java style – but you miss out on all the wonderful juciness of Ruby .
One of the classic examples is the Enumerable class .
Coming from a statically typed language I kept finding myself write code like this :
for i in collection puts i.to_s end
When you can so easily do something like :
collection.each { |i| puts i.to_s}
I ’d also want to use standard inheritance to dry up my code – forgetting about the wonderous powers of mixing in modules .
Jerry Anning , USA >>
Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby , including different frameworks , gems and external libraries ?
Chris >>
It ’s incredibly important to be a test - a- holic .
Test everything !
Berate yourself if you write code that is n’t tested .
Testing stuff can be real freaky hard though , but keep at it !
I ’m a huge fan of shoulda ( although it ’s quite Rails focused ) .
Learn about the whys and wherefores of mocking as well , your tests will thank you for it .
Mocha is what I use with my mocking and stubbing .
Satish Talim >>
Most beginners in Ruby , would like to contribute their time , skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so .
Could you suggest some ?
Chris >>
There ’s a gabillion open source projects to choose from , and they can all be found at github !
Thanks to git ( and github ) , contributing to a project has never been easier !
For most beginners , the problem is n’t necessarily which project to contribute to , but ‘ what ’ to contribute .
A simple but affective way to contribute to a project is to write documentation .
99.99 % of open source projects are severely under documented – but thanks to the beauty of rdoc , most Ruby source code has the documentation built in .
Another way of contributing to a project is by helping out with test coverage .
Run a script like rcov on a project and you ’ll see which bits of code are n’t covered with tests .
Believe me , it ’s not a trivial thing to contribute to test coverage , and you ’re also less likely to contribute damaging code if you ’re worried about that sort of thing .
Victor Goff , USA >>
How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place , and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work ?
Do you see trends in administration or other work ?
Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby ?
Chris >>
Thanks to the plethora of Virtual Machines out there I see Ruby as taking a larger role in the enterprise .
With JRuby and Iron Ruby it ’s already possible to contribute to large enterprise applications using the sweetest of languages .
The power of Ruby also means that you end up with more maintainable code , which will lead to cost - savings across the board which I ’m sure large corporations will seize upon .
Satish Talim >>
What can / should job candidates ( for Ruby ) do to distinguish themselves from their competition ?
Note :
The candidate has done his / her homework on the company that they are interviewing with .
The candidate understands what they ’re looking for , and the candidate is prepared to show them that he / she fits the bill , based on the candidate ’s skills and experience .
What else can the candidate do , to set themselves apart from other equally well - qualified and well - prepared candidates ?
Chris >>
The best way to distinguish yourself is to be a ‘ giver ’ developer .
What do I mean ?
For years and years I was a ‘ taker ’ developer .
Every day I ’d scour the internet looking for solutions to my problems , but never contribute anything back to the community .
I owe so much to random strangers all over the world !
Eventually I realised that the more I gave the community , the more I got back .
To be a ‘ giver ’ developer do stuff like :
write blog posts about the problems that you ’ve solved – chances are that if you had the problem someone else did as well .
If you do n’t have a blog ( or do n’t want one ) answer problems in forums instead .
go on IRC and help newbie developers .
These newbies are the future awesome developers , and one day they ’ll be teaching you a thing or two !
contribute to open source projects that you use a lot .
The more you contribute to a project , the more you ’ll learn about it .
Get into the habit of being a giving developer and before you know it , you ’ll find that people will be coming to YOU with job offers rather than the other way around !
Future employers will be able to google your name / handle and see all the good stuff you ’ve worked on .
Satish Talim >>
Do you have any other suggestions for these participants ( would - be Ruby developers ) ?
Chris >>
The biggest suggestion I can offer Ruby developers is to read lots and lots of source code .
Coming from a . net world where source code is typically kept under lock and key , I had n’t developed the habit of looking at source code .
Now I read as much as I can !
A classic example is the Rails application – so many times I ’ve found myself frustrated with the documentation of a given helper , but then realised that the best way to find out how a method works is to just read the source code .
The more code you read , the more cool practices you ’ll pick up , and the better you ’ll become .

In the past five years , the mettle of mobile Linux has been tested — and it has deservedly earned a shining new reputation as a real technology of choice — an embedded operating system and a flexible platform for truly open innovation .
Linux has even gained the status of the de facto operating system for the growing MID ( mobile Internet device ) market and for bringing intelligent devices to market faster and more cost - effectively .
There has never been such a historic moment and opportunity for Linux to shine and succeed in the market — but can mobile Linux developers rise to the challenge and deliver the user experiences the market is waiting for ?
As the Internet and Internet services continue to play an ever increasing role in our everyday lives , the need to access the Internet regardless of time and place is also increasing .
If you think about it — how often do you turn to the Internet in any given day to get what you need — whether it ’s directions , information about weather , tunes or to catch up on the news ?
Well , hold on to your hats , the mobile landscape is set to change significantly and rapidly over the next few years as demand for compelling Internet experiences and greater ease of use of mobile devices continues to grow with a voracious appetite and mobile usage explodes .
Key Factors
“ Eye candy ” and usability will be the critical success factors in the mobile market — putting the emphasis squarely on demanding more from the user interface .
Flexible and open user interface technologies will be the key enablers behind the newest , most compelling user experiences .
And what openness delivers is the ability to enable developers to focus on the essential end user experience as well as allow for new kinds of differentiation .
Something to note is that this use of open technologies ’ powered development of mobile devices means less investment in other core technologies .
For example , open technology use means browser engines and operating systems can be shared — differentiation and value added services can now lie on top of underlying layers .
Open interfaces and open source code enable developers to focus on innovation , which improves the user experience — and now the basic question in product development changes from “ how ” to “ what . ”
To be perfectly clear — openness does n’t mean that all mobile phones are going to be similar .
Real openness , without any forced background services or start buttons , enables differentiated devices and solutions that equally benefit device manufacturers , operators and end users .
The more open the platform , the more differentiated the experience will be .
One major challenge in today ’s mobile Linux market is fragmentation — especially at the user interface layer .
And introducing totally new user interface technologies only goes further to increase that fragmentation .
Differentiation in a fragmented market is difficult and requires a great deal of work ; and as applications do n’t work on many platforms , this prevents a well - functioning application market from forming .
The fragmentation has to be reduced and the good news is that it will be — Maemo , Moblin , LiMo and ARM Internet Linux Platform are already using the same Gnome - based architecture .
In the user interface layer , increasing use of Web technologies will reduce fragmentation .
2009 is already shaping up to be an interesting year in terms of how the fragmentation issue will be addressed .
Innovation Through Openness
Today , we see openness has climbed its way up into the middleware layer .
In the near future , we expect to see openness spreading to the application layer .
Pushing openness upward in the software stack will accelerate innovation .
Open API interfaces toward reusable cross platform application components will inspire totally new kinds of mobile services and applications .
A simple high - level SDK of the iPhone has already fostered the innovation process to produce thousands of new applications .
The day we have open interfaces towards device resources such as location information and connectivity — the mobile market will never be the same .
For the last several years the mobile industry has been hunting the killer application .
But do n’t look for a single killer application ; instead there will be several thousands of killer applications created through open innovation .
This will cause fragmentation in the end user market — but from an end user point of view — this kind of fragmentation is good , it means freedom of choice .
In order to get there — the fragmentation in the mobile software stack needs to be reduced as noted previously .
Freedom and openness require responsibility toward the end users .
Creating a good user experience on open mobile devices requires extremely focused planning and strong expertise throughout the whole stack , all the way from kernel to the user experience design .
The market does n’t change in a day but being closed - minded about openness just does n’t make sense .
In order to ensure a successful future for mobile Linux , it is essential that the different parties play together .
The corporate world and the open source world should n’t argue about the aspects of openness , in the end , they both have the same interests : to increase openness and innovation , reuse software and avoid reinventing the wheel yet again and again .
The time is ripe to define how openness can be further increased to ensure the success of the entire mobile Linux market .

Criminal addiction : Pragmatic solutions vs. Conservative strategies
I was a drug dealer throughout the ’ 90 s –a big one .
I trafficked marijuana in small and large quantities across Canada and south of the border .
Now I am a reformed , honest , taxpaying student with concerns about the drug- control policies of the Conservative Party .
Having financially sustained myself for more than a decade within the narcotics industry , I consider myself somewhat of an expert on the economics involved .
I therefore feel it necessary to warn those who voted for the Conservative Party –those who believe Harper ’s drug- prohibition stance will work –that his policies will have the opposite effect intended .
Please do n’t immediately write this argument off as more liberal - biased rhetoric .
I would like nothing more than to see drugs off our streets and the criminals that market them locked away from society .
I am no bleeding - heart liberal when it comes to dealing with what has quickly become the most pressing and persistent societal crisis in Western culture : addiction .
One good look at the circumstances facing business owners , health - care workers , the police , courts , and individuals who live and work in our inner cities will tell you that this is certainly a crisis that needs to be addressed in an aggressive fashion .
Realistic and pragmatic solutions based on empirical evidence must be pursued wholeheartedly .
Populist strategies based on fear , as well as reified , antiquated initiatives only exacerbate the problem and waste more precious tax dollars .
Now , a little lesson in the economics of the drug industry : the more drugs cost , the more money there is to be made , and the more organized and aggressive drug dealers become .
As with any commodity , the price of drugs is based on supply and demand .
When it is harder to supply drugs , the cost goes up proportionally .
If the sentences and risks associated with dealing drugs increase , the drugs become more valuable , and when drugs cost more , addicts are forced to engage in more lucrative criminal activities .
Rather than begging for change throughout the day to get $ 20 to buy enough heroin for the night , addicts will pursue methods of acquiring larger amounts of cash , such as shoplifting , vehicle theft , drug dealing , prostitution , and breaking and entering .
If the heroin costs $ 40 instead of $ 20 , addicts will get $ 40 .
If the heroin costs $ 200 , they will get that amount of money by any means possible .
Regardless of the cost of drugs , the risk of incarceration , or the damage done to society , addicts will find a way to get high .
I guarantee it .
But if knee - jerk , reactionary policies based on fear and outdated punitive paradigms fail us , then what is the answer ?
There are a few .
First of all , our provincial prisons have become a breeding ground for criminal culture .
The longer the sentences given to criminals , the more likely they are to reoffend .
That is a fact .
The reason for this ?
When we lock up addicts for periods of two years less a day , they go to the provincial correctional system .
Almost all drug convictions fall into this category of sentencing .
Once the prisoner enters the provincial prison system , they are cut off from almost all contact with any pro-social support they may have had .
To communicate with their families from prison , inmates must call collect , talk in front of other inmates , and be quick about it , as a long line of people waits impatiently to make their own phone calls .
Moreover , the recipient of the collect call must pay rates far higher than the usual long - distance rates offered by regular phone companies .
Even if the call is local , it will cost around 80 cents per minute .
This situation isolates inmates from the people they need the most–their families .
Just when a person is the most susceptible to hearing from loved ones what is needed to change their life around , communication becomes limited and unreasonably expensive for the people trying to help .
Instead of talking to family and finding comfort and wisdom , inmates then turn to the criminal community that surrounds them .
Inmates are socialized by prison culture to be tough , violent , and subversive to authority , and they are expected to embrace the criminal life and drug subculture that landed them in prison .
Any sign of rejecting these ideals is viewed with suspicion and it is most often reacted to with violence , extortion , and coercion .
For inmates cut off from any significant pro-social entities and embedded in an unforgiving criminal culture , rehabilitation becomes nearly impossible .
Moreover , in our provincial prison systems there are no addiction programs .
You have to commit a crime that gets you at least three years before you stand a chance at seeking help through counselling .
By the time long sentences for drug offences are handed down , it is often too late for mandated drug - treatment programs to have any effect : the initial shock of going to prison has long worn off and relationships have developed with fellow inmates that displace any potential relationships with drug counsellors .
And if we increase the sentences of first - time offenders to federal sentences , the already stretched resources that provide drug - treatment programs will collapse ; furthermore , an overcrowded prison will diminish the effects of treatment .
The real answer to this problem must be implemented in stages .
The first stage is to separate drug dealers in our criminal justice system from their customers , the addicts .
Those suffering from addiction need to be treated as victims of a disease–locked away from society where they can do no harm–but treated as medical patients nonetheless .
It should be the mandate of the criminal justice system to fortify pro-social connections of inmates .
Once it has carefully been established that a family member or friend is not involved in criminal activity , every effort should be made to provide an environment where positive interactions between inmates and loved ones can occur .
Sometimes a person needs to relearn how and why we care about our community ; someone they respect who already does can be the best teacher .
If a good person cares enough to try to positively affect the life of an inmate , it will have more effect than any government - mandated program ever could .
Allow someone to care about them and they will learn to care about themselves .
The next step is to devalue the currency of criminal organizations .
Legalize drugs and make them accessible and free to those who are mildly and hopelessly addicted to them .
Provide housing , food , and drugs to addicts , who would normally get them through criminal actions .
Do this in a manner whereby the addict becomes licensed by the government to receive the narcotics they require .
The licensing will come with obligations , such as drug treatment , police interviews , and time spent weekly with social workers who can implement recovery plans based on the unique situation of the individual involved .
If addicts will risk years of freedom and their very lives to engage in criminal activity to acquire drugs , surely they will agree to licensing obligations to get drugs for free .
Implement this plan and the illegal narcotics economies that flourish in our inner cities will begin to collapse .
With no one left to buy the drugs , criminal organizations will set their sights on other countries still pursuing prohibition - style strategies where drugs are more valuable .
It ’s as simple as that .
It would be naive to believe that any strategy will completely eradicate the addiction problem in our culture .
Legal drugs such as alcohol , nicotine , and sugar still lead the pack in lives damaged by consumed substances .
But , if we are pragmatic , realistic , and willing to adapt to the wisdom espoused by academic communities that have studied this phenomenon for decades , we are not helpless .
If we resign ourselves to fear and the ideas outlined by the Conservative Party in the $ 63.8 - million National Anti-Drug Strategy , we will remain powerless and demonstrate that we have learned nothing from decades of combating a drug - fuelled , criminal economy .

I can't wait to see this ; I truly believe it will be a huge success .
But two things kinda bugged me :
1 ) I 'm real tired of the whole slow - mo - hero - drops - into - frame - from - above gag ( Nite - Owl ) .
It was cool when Kate Beckinsale did that in Underworld 2 and just kept walking without pausing to " plant " her landing .
But now every superhero in cinema has to do this move .
Maybe it's all part of Snyder 's " deconstructing " superhero movies and all , but I have to consciously convince myself of that in order to not be annoyed by the cliche ' .
2 ) I did n't like the fact that they changed Rorschach 's use in the graphic novel of the term " mask " as slang for costumed hero ( as in , " Somebody is killing masks . " ) , and instead went for the literal phrase .
Strikes me as dumbing the movie down for the hundred or so people who 've never been exposed to the American superhero cultural meme .

New York ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices fell for the 52nd straight day , according a survey released Saturday by the motorist group AAA .
The average price of regular unleaded decreased to $ 2.282 , a 3.2 cent drop from Friday , according to the national survey , which is based on credit card swipes at gas stations .
Before this week , the last time prices were this low was on February 24 , 2007 , according to AAA .
Over the last 52 days , prices have sunk $ 1.57 , a 41 % decrease .
Demand for gasoline has continued to slip , despite the fall in gas prices .
MasterCard 's weekly survey of gas station credit card swipes showed demand down 3.9 % last week , compared to the same period last year .
Prices have dropped 44.5 % , or $ 1.83 , from their record high of $ 4.114 a gallon set July 17 .
The average price per gallon dropped below $ 3 on Oct. 18 , the first time in nearly nine months .
By state , Alaska reported the highest average gas prices , $ 3.36 per gallon , while Missouri boasted the cheapest , at $ 1.966 a gallon .
Gasoline prices have fallen while average crude prices have done the same in the past four months .
U.S. crude for December delivery settled at $ 61.04 a barrel in New York trading on Friday , down from its high of $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 .
Only two states , Alaska and Hawaii , have average gas prices above $ 3 per gallon , while 43 states report prices below $ 2.50 per gallon .
The AAA figures are state - wide averages based on credit card swipes at up to 100,000 service stations across the nation .
Many drivers have reported even lower prices across the country .
Thursday , 27 Nov , 2008 Current Events
Russia and Venezuela agreed upon using their national currencies - Russian rubles and Venezuelan bolivars - as the main currencies for businesses between the two countries .
During last meetings of the officials , it was also discussed the creation of financial reserves in national currencies .
This was communicated by the President of Russian Federation Dmitri Medvedev on a press - conference in Caracas , after a meeting with the President of Venezuela , Ugo Chavez .
Medvedev also stated that military and technical partnership between the two countries is not to be treated as a potential threat to other countries .
The Russian President said that if it would be beneficial to the development of Latin American countries and if it would not be in conflict with the concept of world 's multipolarity there were chances that Russia would participate at the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) as an associative member or in any other possible way .
In addition Medvedev said that Chavez ' idea that the OPEC countries should try to achieve the goal of setting the prices for oil to $ 80 - $ 100 / barrel .
Medvedev expressed his concern about the low oil prices , though he stated that he would like oil prices to be ' neither too low , nor too high ' .
It should be mentioned that on 25 November , Chavez stated that low oil prices ' are not tragic for Venezuela ' .
On the other hand the experts ' prognosis was that low oil prices could dramatically impact the economy of this country , as about 50 % of Venezuela 's revenue comes from oil exports .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
While letting infants sleep on their backs has cut the danger of sudden infant death syndrome , measures as simple as using a fan or opening a window could further reduce it , according to a study published on Monday .
Infants who slept in a bedroom with a fan had a 72 percent lower risk of SIDS , also known as crib death or cot death , compared to babies sleeping in rooms without a fan , Kimberly Coleman - Phox and colleagues at Kaiser Permanente ’s Division of Research in Oakland , California found .
This was regardless of sleep position .
Opening a window reduced the risk by 36 percent , they added .
The researchers interviewed nearly 500 mothers , some of whom had lost infants to SIDS .
Their study , published in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine , speculated that ventilation prevents the pooling of carbon dioxide around a baby ’s nose and mouth , decreasing the chance of breathing in exhaled air .
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , which helped pay for the study , said the ventilation findings need to be confirmed by additional research .
It said there still is no substitute for the most effective means known to reduce SIDS -- placing infants to sleep on their backs .
Other measures include using a firm mattresses and avoiding soft bedding such as comforters , preventing overheating , and not smoking while pregnant or around babies .
In the United States the rate of SIDS dropped by 56 percent from 1992 to 2003 after education efforts were launched promoting the on - the - back sleeping position .
Despite that , SIDS is still the leading cause of death among U.S. infants in the first year of life , and the third - leading cause of overall infant deaths generally .
John McCain has repeatedly said , probably accurately , that Hamas would prefer Obama as the next president .
But unfortunately for McCain , an even more prominent terror organization has offered a more - or - less endorsement — of McCain himself .
Oops .
As The Washington Post noted :
“ Al - Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming election , ” said a commentary posted Monday on the extremist Web site al - Hesbah , which is closely linked to the terrorist group .
It said the Arizona Republican would continue the “ failing march of his predecessor , ” President Bush .
The commentary is on a password - protected site that is one of the most authoritative for Al Qaeda .
It ’s not 100 percent sure that this is the view of Osama bin Laden , but there ’s a supposition that al - Hesbah generally reflects the views of Al Qaeda ’s leadership .
And among security specialists , the endorsement is no surprise at all .
There has been much discussion among experts about whether Al Qaeda will “ vote ” in the run-up to election by engaging in a terror attack in the United States , so as to help McCain .
The same essay on al - Hesbah specifically called for a terror attack in the U.S. ; as the A.P. put it : “ Al - Qaida supporters suggested in a Web site message this week they would welcome a pre-election terror attack on the U.S. as a way to usher in a McCain presidency . ”
The idea is that Al Qaeda would be hurt by the election of Obama , because he does n’t fit Arab or Muslim images of white colonial oppressors , and thus is n’t so useful in recruiting suicide bombers .
There ’s generally a sense that an American leader with a more military instinct , inclined to firing cruise missiles , is the best recruiting tool .
In 2004 , Al Qaeda issued a video shortly before the general election , and some thought it was Al Qaeda ’s attempt to re-elect Bush .
Maybe it worked , because it probably reminded voters about security issues , and Bush polled much better on national security than John Kerry did .
Joseph Nye , one of the smartest analysts around , has warned that Al Qaeda may try to intervene this time with a terror attack before the election , and I ’m afraid that ’s a valid concern .
An attack would probably shift a few percentage points to McCain from Obama , and in a close election that would make a difference — particularly if the terror attacks were in , say , Pennsylvania , Florida and Virginia .
Let ’s hope that Al Qaeda does n’t have assets in place to mount an attack , but I ’ll breathe more easily after election day .
The National Security Network has an excellent discussion of the issue .
Olbermann : Fox host does n't bother to ' hide his racism ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This When Fox 's Neil Cavuto garnered the coveted " Worst Person in the World Title " from MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Monday it was n't the first time , but Cavuto 's latest misstep exceeds even his own previous appearance in the slot .
In an attempt to blame the Democrats in Congress for the current economic meltdown , Cavuto told Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - CA ) last week that he should have warned bankers about possible problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
" I 'm just saying , " Cavuto insisted , " I do n't remember a clarion call that said , ' Fannie and Freddie are a disaster .
Loaning to minorities and risky folks is a disaster . ' "
" Wow , " commented Olbermann .
" Usually they hide their racism a little bit better at Fox . "
The two runners - up to Cavuto for Monday 's Worst Person title were Fox 's Steve Doocy -- for claiming comedian - turned - politician Al Franken must have broken some law by giving Saturday Night Live the idea for a tv sketch lampooning John McCain -- and a South Carolina GOP official who suggested that Sarah Palin 's family problems might make his own drunk driving arrests less of an issue with the voters .
Raw Story reported on both incidents yesterday .

Today we 're going to look at a surprising relative newcomer on the World Wide Web : Conservapedia , a Young Earth Christian encyclopedia , built on the model of Wikipedia .
But I caution you :
We need to start by setting the stage with the appropriate tone .
Let 's browse to Conservapedia 's article on the theory of evolution .
What picture do you think they might have on this page ?
An image of a DNA helix ?
A picture of Charles Darwin ?
Wrong :
It 's a photograph of Adolf Hitler screaming into a microphone .
No fooling .
( Since this podcast was released , Conservapedia has edited that page , putting Darwin 's picture at the top where it belongs , and moving Hitler way down toward the bottom of page , where he still does n't belong . – BD )
Conservapedia 's purpose is to be a conservative Christian version of Wikipedia that promotes Young Earth anti-science .
But in an effort to distance themselves from this egregious intellectual dishonesty , they 've posted a special page called How Conservapedia Differs from Wikipedia that lists an entirely different set of reasons for its existence , that makes no mention of any conservative Christian agenda , as if such a thing has never occurred to them .
The page is mostly a list of false charges leveled against Wikipedia .
They say Wikipedia is a money - making scheme ; Wikipedia encourages long - winded , obfuscating articles ; it contains gossip , journalists ' " biased " opinions , obscenities and pornography ; Wikipedia subjects its articles to extreme liberal censorship ; the purpose of Wikipedia 's talk pages are to create a forum for its editors to bully its users ; and my personal favorite , that Wikipedia monitors the personal blogs of its readers and bans them from using Wikipedia if they exercise their free speech on their blogs !!
Well , if nothing else , these charges certainly do distract attention from Conservapedia 's Christian anti-science bias .
Another difference between the two is their size , both in number of articles and length .
For example , on the date I checked , Google listed 50,000 pages on Conservapedia.com , and 14,200,000 on Wikipedia.org , giving Wikipedia almost 300 times the number of pages as Conservapedia .
To get a fair estimate of the difference in comprehensiveness of their articles , I did a number of random searches .
Wikipedia 's article on Walt Disney is 8,570 words long .
Conservapedia 's article is only 195 words long , and contains little more than an anecdote about his wedding , a list of 8 of his movies , and a warning that since his death , The Walt Disney Company has promoted pro-gay activism .
This was just one random search off the top of my head , and I was struck by Conservapedia 's ability to siphon all the juice out of any topic until only the bitterest right - wing dregs remain .
But Conservapedia is not really about finding liberal skeletons in closets ; it 's really about promoting Young Earth fundamentalism .
For example , their article on the planet Earth contains no fewer than 9 Bible references , and almost all of the external references are from ( not scientific sources as you 'd expect ) but other Young Earth fundamentalist websites , mainly AnswersInGenesis.org , CreationScience.com , and CreationOnTheWeb.com .
The age of the Earth is given with a pretense of also presenting real science as follows :
Young Earth creationists believe , on the basis of the biblical account in Genesis and biblical geochronologies , that the entire Earth , including animal , plant , and human life , was formed in six days , around 4000 B.C. Mainstream scientific journals , committed to a naturalistic worldview , contend this view .
Most scientists believe that the Earth formed by natural processes instead of being supernaturally created .
However , as one scientist noted , “ ... most every prediction by theorists about planetary formation has been wrong . ”
Note the assertion that the mainstream scientific journals " contend " the Young Earth story because they 're " committed " to a worldview that is not about promoting Christianity .
I commend Conservapedia for conceding that most scientists are not of the opinion that the Earth was formed supernaturally , but even then they throw in a quote from CreationScience.com that most scientific theories about the Earth are eventually proven wrong , and they bolster this quote with an argument from authority by crediting it to " a scientist " .
Conservapedia has a fine article on radiometric dating .
It says almost nothing about radiometric dating ; it lists only five types , giving no useful information about what they are , what they 're used for , or how and why they work ; the entire article is simply a lecture that they are all uselessly unreliable .
This argument is made with explanations like the following :
This formula depends on the laws of physics remaining constant over time ...
Some creationists have argued that God increased the rate of potassium - argon decay during the first few days of Creation , thus causing the potassium - argon dating method to give erroneously old date readings .
They did n't give a Biblical citation for that particular factoid .
If some listener knows what authority they referenced that talks about God 's manipulation of potassium - argon decay rates , come to Skeptoid.com and post it in the comments for this episode .
If we 're playing Name the Logical Fallacy , this is called a special pleading .
A special pleading states that my claim is true because some higher power ( that you can't comprehend ) makes it true , no matter what you say .
Potassium argon dating is unreliable because God will do whatever is necessary to make your readings wrong .
Really .
They have a page of rules for editors , but predictably , they call it the Commandments .
Most of them are good , what you 'd expect from a wiki ; like always cite your sources ( though almost all sources cited in Conservapedia articles are from Young Earth Creationist websites ) , your posts should be clean , concise , no foul language , no personal opinions or advertisements .
But I thought this was funny :
When referencing dates based on the approximate birth of Jesus , give appropriate credit for the basis of the date ( B.C. or A.D. ) .
" BCE " and " CE " are unacceptable substitutes because they deny the historical basis .
It 's actually more than just funny .
CE and BCE , similar to the better known BC and AD , stand for the " common era " and " before the common era " of the proleptic Gregorian calendar .
BCE and CE have been in use since the year 1615 , beginning with non-Christian cultures , and has since become an international convention because it does not force everyone to comply with one particular religious standard .
When he read a student 's paper that used common era notation , Christian activist Andrew Schlafly founded Conservapedia in 2006 , initially as an online resource for homeschooled Christian students .
Addendum :
As it adds additional insight into Andrew Schlafly 's likely motivations , it 's worth pointing out that his mother was Phyllis Schlafly , the lawyer who successfully killed the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s .
–BD
Correction :
An earlier version of this said that BCE / CE was part of the international date standard ISO 8601 .
Incorrect .
ISO 8601 says instead to use a positive or negative sign in front of the year .
–BD
Schlafly felt that teaching evidence - based science represents a biased view that wrongly excludes Christianity , and so his vision of Conservapedia was to avoid this bias by looking at every topic through a conservative Christian perspective .
And the more you go through Conservapedia , the more you see that avoiding bias is what it 's really about ; but a very curious and specific brand of avoiding bias .
It avoids the bias of giving fact more validity than fiction .
Throughout its articles , Conservapedia presents both the Young Earth version of a subject , and then the scientific version , and treats them more or less equally , as if fallacy is no less valid than fact .
To find another example , I looked up Tyrannosaurus Rex to see what Conservapedia has to say on when it lived :
Young Earth Creationists believe that they became extinct sometime since the Great Flood , dated to approximately 4,500 years ago .
Evolutionary scientists believe that the T - rex lived at the end of the Cretaceous period , dated to approximately 65 million years ago , and that modern birds are the descendants of dinosaurs such as T-rex .
You might as well say " One small extremist religious fringe group believes X , but science tells us Y. "
Conservapedia presents these as equally weighted , competing theories which should both be taught to students under the guise of " presenting both sides of an issue " .
Science does not have two sides .
Science has one side .
If Conservapedia truly wants to avoid bias , then why are they only presenting the Young Earth fundamentalist belief alongside science ?
Why not also present the Islamic story , the Mandinka story from Africa , the Voodoo story , the Hawai'ian story of Pele , or Scientology or Raëlism ?
I 'll tell you why .
It 's because Conservapedia exists only to promote Christian Young Earth anti-science .
Why would anyone want to teach anti-science ?
The vast majority of Christians worldwide accept the evidence - based age of the Earth and the universe , and accept modern sciences , and many work in scientific fields .
What do most Christians think of Conservapedia ?
Do they feel it gives them a bad name ?
Are they primarily supportive of its proselytzing mission , and less concerned with the accuracy of whatever facts it presents ?
My sense is that most Christians are not really aware of Conservapedia .
Its take on science certainly does not represent that of most Christians , let alone most conservatives , since we know that the Young Earth crowd is only a small fringe minority .
The danger is that Conservapedia 's mere presence and self - assertion of unbiased authority might mislead an uninformed web surfer into accepting that some of these Young Earth myths are valid science , or even just give the impression that the Young Earth thing is more widely accepted than it really is .
Both of these are crimes against intelligence , and anyone who contributes to Conservapedia is guilty of willfully eroding the collective intellect , to the detriment of all .

With the announcement by Sen. Chris Dodd that congressional negotiators have reached a fundamental agreement on the federal bailout for the financial sector , it is clear that Republican presidential candidate John McCain took a big gamble on the crisis and lost .
Emerging from a 2 hour negotiating session , Dodd said , “ We are very confident that we can act expeditiously . ”
Republican senator Bob Bennett said , “ I now expect that we will indeed have a plan that can pass the House , pass the Senate ( and ) be signed by the president .
” The deal came without the intervention of either presidential candidate .
However , the sides are still discussing regulatory measures , and how to phase in the $ 700 billion cost , but this is essentially a done deal .
The person who looks bad in all of this is John McCain , who apparently either did n’t know or care how close an agreement was .
By saying yesterday that the bill would not pass , so he was suspending his campaign and calling for a delay of Friday ’s presidential debate , he gambled and lost .
It turns out the McCain campaign completely misread the situation .

McCain was taking a chance that the bill really was stalled , and then he could ride in and save the day .
By trying to whip this thing into a 9/11 style crisis , McCain could project the image of leadership in a desperate time .
The problem is that the government was already close to a solution without John McCain ’s input .
In fact , his drastic overreaction makes McCain look more out of the loop , and brings into question his judgment .
The moves by his campaign yesterday appeared to be a knee jerk reaction by a candidate that was completely out of the loop .
In contrast , Obama seemed more plugged in to the situation .
McCain ’s call to postpone the debate now has the look of a shallow political tactic .
The Republican ’s campaign was trying to turn the attention of the electorate back to the character issue , and McCain did reveal a great deal about his character .
McCain was willing to overstate a crisis to benefit his campaign .
This is a fine example of the attitude of campaign over country that has personified the McCain / Palin ticket .

When a Congressional investigation revealed in June that Dr. Joseph Biederman , a world - renowned child psychiatrist , had earned far more money from drug makers than he had reported to his university , he said that his interests were “ solely in the advancement of medical treatment through rigorous and objective study . ”
But e-mail messages and internal documents from Johnson & Johnson made public in a court filing reveal that Dr. Biederman pushed the company to finance a research center at Massachusetts General Hospital , in Boston , with a goal to “ move forward the commercial goals of J.& J. ”
The documents also show that the company prepared a draft summary of a study that Dr. Biederman , of Harvard , was said to have written .
Dr. Biederman ’s work helped to fuel a fortyfold increase from 1994 to 2003 in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder and a rapid rise in the use of powerful , risky and expensive antipsychotic medicines in children .
Although many of his studies are small and often financed by drug makers , Dr. Biederman has had a vast influence on the field largely because of his position at one of the most prestigious medical institutions .
( Newser ) – If you want white truffle shavings sprinkled over your Thanksgiving leftovers , the biggest specimen found in Italy this year is up for auction tomorrow .
You 'll need some big bucks — and perhaps the moxie to outbid David and Victoria Beckham .
The delectable fungus weighs about 2 ½ pounds and is expected to spark a bidding war , ANSA reports .
The auction will be conducted by satellite , with bidders in Rome , Abu Dhabi , Macao , and London .
Organizers hope to raise the truffle - production profile of the tiny Molise region , where this specimen was unearthed .
" The fact that there are truffles , and ones of excellent quality , in Molise will be news to many consumers , " said a rep .

WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind. , Oct. 16 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists say they have developed a method of producing competitively priced energy from municipal , agricultural , and forest wastes .
Researchers from Purdue University and the Rochester Institute of Technology say their flexible carbon - to - liquid fuel process could replace 20 percent of the transportation fuels consumed annually in the United States .

Purdue Professor Fu Zhao , the study 's lead author , said the technology could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent .
" This technique is more flexible than conventional methods because we can process a wider range of very different feedstocks and , at the same time , we can generate a wider range of end products -- not just gasoline and diesel .
but ethanol and hydrogen , " said Zhao .
" Or we could generate electricity directly from the gas produced . "
The scientists said their new system heats paper , wood , plastic and rubber into a gas .
Hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases , referred to as synthesis gas or syngas , are separated and fuel a turbine that generates electricity , or are converted to gasoline , diesel fuel , jet fuel or biofuels .
The research was reported last month in Busan , Korea , during the 6th Global Conference on Sustainable Product Development and Life Cycle Engineering .
