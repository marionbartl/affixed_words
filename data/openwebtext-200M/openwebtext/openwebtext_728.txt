WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. nonfarm payrolls plunged by an astonishing 533,000 in November -- the worst job loss in 34 years -- the Labor Department reported Friday .
It was only the fourth time in the past 58 years that payrolls had fallen by more than 500,000 in a month .
Since the recession began 11 months ago , a total of 1.9 million jobs have been lost .
Job losses in September and October were revised much lower .
In addition to the 533,000 lost jobs , an additional 621,000 workers were pushed into part - time work and 422,000 simply dropped out of the labor force .
" This is almost indescribably terrible , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics .
" The pace of job losses is accelerating alarmingly . "
Over the past three months , 1.26 million jobs have been lost , a pace of job destruction exceeded only once since 1945 .
" The threat of a widespread depression is now real and present , " said Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland .
The recession " is going to be long and drawn out , " wrote Jennifer Lee , an economist for BMO Capital Markets .
The unemployment rate rose from 6.5 % in October to 6.7 % in November , the highest jobless rate since October 1993 .
Read the full report .
Job losses were widespread across industries in November .
Fewer than a third of industries were hiring in November .
In services - producing industries , 370,000 jobs were lost , a record excluding one month in 1983 when nearly three - quarters of a million workers at AT&T went on strike .
The grim report could set the stage for further responses from Washington to address the recession .
The Bush administration promised " aggressive " action , and pressure increased on the incoming Obama administration to craft a sizable fiscal stimulus plan .
The large loss of jobs could also boost the chances for the automakers to get a loan from the federal government .
The Federal Reserve is likely to lower its interest rate target at the Dec. 16 meeting , economists said .
The employment report was much worse than expected .
Economists expected job losses of around 350,000 in November .
They expected the unemployment rate to rise to 6.8 % .
See Economic Calendar .
" We expect labor market conditions to be dreadful for many months to come and consequently for consumer spending to continue to decline , " wrote Josh Shapiro , chief economist for MFR Inc .
“ ' The pace of job losses is accelerating alarmingly . ' ” — Ian Shepherdson , High Frequency Economics
Job losses in September and October were revised sharply lower by a total of 199,000 .
Over the past three months , payrolls have fallen by an average of 419,000 per month , compared with average monthly losses of 82,000 earlier in the year .
An alternative gauge of unemployment -- which includes discouraged workers and those whose hours have been cut back to part - time -- rose to 12.5 % from 11.8 % .
The number of workers forced to work part - time rose by 621,000 to 7.3 million .
Total hours worked in the economy fell 0.9 % in November and are down 2.8 % in the past year .
The average workweek fell to a record - low 33.5 hours in November .
The decline in working hours is consistent with a 5 % annualized drop in gross domestic product , wrote John Silvia , chief economist for Wachovia .
Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents , or 0.4 % , to $ 18.30 .
Average hourly wages are up 3.7 % in the past year , close to the 3.8 % rise in the consumer price index .
In goods - producing industries , 163,000 jobs were lost , according to a survey of work places .
Manufacturing lost 85,000 workers , while construction lost 82,000 .
In the services , 136,000 jobs were lost in business services , including 101,000 in employment services , such as temporary jobs .
Financial services cut 34,000 jobs .
Retail shed 91,000 jobs , including 24,000 at auto dealers .
Leisure and hospitality industries cut 76,000 jobs
Health and education services industries added 52,000 jobs .
Government added 7,000 .
In a separate survey of households , the government found that employment fell by 673,000 , the largest lost since August 2001 .
Unemployment rose by 251,000 to 10.3 million .
Unemployment has increased 2.7 million during the recession and 2.7 million more have been forced into part - time work .
In November , the labor force fell by 422,000 .
The employment - population ratio fell to 61.4 % in November from 61.8 % .
The labor force participation rate fell to 65.8 % from 66.1 % .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- Miami police issued a plea for information Saturday after at least one person with an assault rifle opened fire on a crowd of people on a streetcorner Friday night , killing two teens and wounding seven other people .
Evidence markers dot the Miami street where nine people were gunned down with an AK - 47 Friday night .
" We need the community to come together , someone come forward and give us a tip , " Miami Police Officer Kenia Alfonso told CNN .
" There are a lot of people in that area .
Someone must have seen something , someone must know who could 've done this horrific crime . "
Alfonso said two teens , ages 16 and 18 , died in the attack , which broke up a game of craps in front of a grocery store about 9:50 p.m. Friday in the city 's Liberty City neighborhood .
Five of the shooting victims were still in the hospital Saturday night , according to CNN affiliate WSVN .
Others told WSVN that a masked man with an AK - 47 burst onto the scene and ordered everyone to the ground .
" Boy came round the corner ; he was like , ' Get down , ' and he just started shooting , " 16 - year - old victim Andrew Jackson told WSVN .
Watch as resident describes scene as " war zone " »
Six of the nine shot were current or former Northwestern Senior High School students , Alfonso said .
" It was like a war zone , " resident Joan Rutherford told WSVN .
" I witnessed this guy laying there with his face , looked like it was completely tore off .
His eyes was all I could see , and he had a grip on some money and gasping and trying to lift his head up to say something . "
Police Chief John Timoney said that at least one man with an AK - 47 " discharged numerous rounds , then ran around the corner .
There were some more rounds discharged there from an AK - 47 and another weapon . "
One of those wounded was in critical condition Saturday and undergoing surgery , Timoney said .
" We are convinced that because of the amount of people out here last night that there is somebody that knows the individuals or individual involved , and we need them to come forward , " Timoney said , according to WSVN .
" These are weapons of war , and they do n't belong on the streets of Miami or any other street in America , " Mayor Manuel Diaz said .

Alfonso said police did not know the motive for the shooting and had no suspects .

" Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , " we 're told .
But the stimulus package amounts to little more than 1 pc of GDP .
Yet our borrowing requirement – again , in a single year – has ballooned by more than 5 pc of national income .
And that 's not including the hundreds of billions of extra borrowing now planned for 2010 / 11 , 2011 / 12 and all the way to the middle of the next decade .
From his living room in Leisure World in Seal Beach , Larry Black has watched the anti-Proposition 8 protests on his TV .
He 's read about the legal challenges to overturn the measure .
And he has a thought .
" It 's ridiculous , " said Black , 66 .
" It 's the people 's vote . . . .
That 's the way it should be .
That 's it . "
Voters in Orange County passed the measure banning gay marriage last week by a margin of 14 percentage points , a larger victory than statewide .
On Main Street in Seal Beach on Monday , a sampling of supporters vented their frustration over the contentious issue dragging on after a clear win at the polls .

A prototype of a therapeutic ultrasound device , developed by a Cornell graduate student , fits in the palm of a hand , is battery - powered and packs enough punch to stabilize a gunshot wound or deliver drugs to brain cancer patients .
It is wired to a ceramic probe , called a transducer , and it creates sound waves so strong they instantly cause water to bubble , spray and turn into steam .
Tinkering in his Olin Hall lab , George K. Lewis , a third - year Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering and a National Science Foundation fellow , creates ultrasound devices that are smaller , more powerful and many times less expensive than today 's models .
Devices today can weigh 30 pounds and cost $ 20,000 ; his is pocket - sized and built with $ 100 .
He envisions a world where therapeutic ultrasound machines are found in every hospital and medical research lab .
" New research and applications are going to spin out , now that these systems will be so cheap , affordable and portable in nature , " Lewis said .
The development of one of his portable devices is detailed in the journal Review of Scientific Instruments ( 79-114302 ) , published online Nov. 11 .
Lewis , whose paper is co-authored by his adviser , William L. Olbricht , Cornell professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering , also presented his research in a talk at the November meeting of the Acoustical Society of America .

Ultrasound is commonly used as a nondestructive imaging technique in medical settings .
Sound waves , inaudible to humans , can generate images through soft tissue , allowing , for instance , a pregnant woman to view images of her baby .
But the higher - energy ultrasound that Lewis works with can treat such conditions as prostate tumors or kidney stones by breaking them up .
His devices also can relieve arthritis pressure and even help treat brain cancer by pushing drugs quickly through the brain following surgery .
Lewis suggests that his technology could lead to such innovations as cell phone - size devices that military medics could carry to cauterize bleeding wounds , or dental machines to enable the body to instantly absorb locally injected anesthetic .
Lewis miniaturized the ultrasound device by increasing its efficiency .
Traditional devices apply 500 - volt signals across a transducer to convert the voltage to sound waves , but in the process , about half the energy is lost .
In the laboratory , Lewis has devised a way to transfer 95 percent of the source energy to the transducer .
His new devices are currently being tested in a clinical setting at Weill Cornell Medical College .
Under the direction of Jason Spector , M.D , director of Weill Cornell 's Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery and assistant professor of plastic surgery , Peter Henderson , M.D. , the lab 's chief research fellow , is using one of the devices in experiments that aim to minimize injury that occurs when tissues do not receive adequate blood flow .
Their lab is performing tests in animals to determine whether low doses of the chemical hydrogen sulfide , known to be toxic at high doses , might be able to minimize such injury by slowing cellular metabolism .
Doctors are hopeful that the ultrasound from Lewis ' portable device will enable hydrogen sulfide to be targeted to specific parts of the body , allowing doctors to use less of it , and cutting down on toxicity risks , Henderson explained .
The medical doors that Lewis ' device may one day open are groundbreaking , Henderson said .
" People are realizing that when harnessed appropriately , you can use ultrasound to treat things as opposed to just diagnose them , " Henderson said .
" It 's a wide - open field right now , and George 's device is going to play a huge role in catalyzing the discovery of new and better therapeutic applications . "
Did Roman Abramovich , the world ’s 15th richest man ( and Russia ’s second wealthiest ) , get an offer he ca n’t refuse ?
An unknown Latvian called Andris posted a letter on petitonline.com which reads :
Dear Roman Abramovich .
As you may already know our homeland Latvia went bankrupt and is currently holding talks with the International Monetary Fund on the sale of our country for 7.5 billion euros ( $ 10.7 billion ) . [..]
I would like you to consider the possibility of purchasing Latvia : the population are hard working and pleasant , environmentally clean area and plenty of space to dock your yacht .
A prank , right ?
But one that got signed by 1,025 people ( and counting ) .
It ’s mostly Russian names – and since anyone can sign ( I know ; I tried ) , this is of course the perfect foil for a latest dig in the ongoing flamewar between Latvia and Russia .
Then again , since the 40 % or so Russian - speaking residents of Latvia have been largely and vocally dissatisfied ever since independence , there should n’t be a lack of signatories from Latvia either .
Not , moreover , that this is a first .
As the bloggers at Eternal Remont point out :
Apparently this is not the first time Latvians have joined together to petition a foreign individual or state takeover .
Also this year , over 2000 Latvians petitioned for Swedish occupation .
And this particular Baltic tradition goes back further than that , in one of my favourite bits of party political history .
When the Estonians held their first national elections after independence in 1992 , those were understandably won by conservative nationalists .
But coming in sixth in a fragmented landscape was the Estonian Royalist Party .
The Royalists proposed establishing Estonia as an absolute monarchy .
Of course there was the slight dilemma of Estonia never having had a royal family , so instead the party suggested the Swedish Crown Prince Carl Philip could become King of Estonia . *
The Royalists won no less than 7.1 % of the vote , and 8 of the 101 seats in parliament .
It ’s probably the all - time record score for a party taking the piss – Screaming Lord Sutch must have been jealous .
The party spent all of 1 crown on its election campaign – but it did have three comedians , and made a name for itself with raucous street actions , such as an “ eating strike ” .
It far outdid similar parties that cropped up for a bit in Eastern Europe at the time , such as the Polish Beer - Lovers ’ Party ( which made it into parliament as well ) and the Latvian Fools ’ Party .
The latter deserves props for proposing to increase the number of parliamentarians from 100 to 10,000 , so that every Latvian would get his turn within a decade .
( On a serious note , an Umelec article from a couple of years ago well describes the tradition this kind of movements arose from , with Poland as example . )
In 1994 , the Royalists still wrote to one of the British royals , Prince Edward , to tell him that if they ’d win the next elections , they would ask him to become King of Estonia .
“ It is believed the Prince did not reply , ” Wikipedia notes ; but according to Janna Holmstedt and Po Hagström at Trial and Error , “ a spokesman for Buckingham Palace termed this “ a charming but unlikely idea ” . ”
The Royalists scored a disappointing 0,8 % in the 1995 elections and subsequently disappeared from the scene .
Obviously , Queen Elizabeth ’s fault .
Yet another reason for republicanism – if they felt they were too good for the Estonians , they do n’t deserve Britain either .
____
* Edit :
This info is from the Trial and Error site I linked , of the Swedish artists Janna Holmstedt and Po Hagström ( as an election geek and student of Eastern Europe Studies at the time , I remember this strange Estonian Royalist Party vividly , but you ’d be surprised how hard it is to find English - language info online on it now , even the Wikipedia entry is incomplete ) .
But A2 K poster Saab points out a mistake in this sentence – Carl Philip is not actually the Swedish Crown Prince ; ever since a change in the law in 1980 to introduce equal primogeniture , he ’s second in the line of succession , after his elder sister , Crown Princess Victoria .
Media organizations and public interest groups Thursday filed " friend of the court " briefs in the Joel Tenenbaum file - swapping case , supporting a judge 's earlier decision to allow some video from the case to be streamed live over the Internet .
Tenenbaum , a Boston University graduate student , is represented by Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson and a group of law students .
Nesson has pushed for the entire trial to be streamed online , though Judge Nancy Gertner initially agreed only to broadcast a single hearing .
The feed would come from cameras already installed in the courtroom and would be available to anyone from the Harvard 's Berkman Center .
( Other sites would also be free to host the stream . )
The RIAA objected to the plan on numerous grounds , including that such a stream would prejudice potential jurors , benefit the defendant and not the plaintiff , and allow various journalists , bloggers , and Internet mashup artists to make the group look bad .
It appealed to the First Circuit , which is currently considering the issue .
Two outside groups weighed in on the issue yesterday , both in favor of allowing the Internet video .
The first group included the Associated Press , Gannett , Hearst , the New York Times , NBC Universal , NPR , and other news outlets .
Their combined brief made the basic points that the recording industry has generally sought publicity for such cases , and that the way to prevent bias and distortion in the media is by transparency , not control .
" Petitioners ’ complaint that the order has already ' provoked a rash of publicity ' for the Berkman Center website , appears more than slightly disingenuous given that Petitioners themselves have repeatedly sought out publicity for this and hundreds of similar cases , " says the group 's brief .
And the " further objection that providing Internet access will allow ' editing and manipulation ' of the recording by journalists is a true red-herring , " it continues .
Journalist can already edit court transcripts , or can provide a one - sided portrayal of a case based on their own notes .
" If the Petitioners ’ argument carried any weight , it would logically require courts to exclude reporters and bloggers from every judicial proceeding , lest subsequent reports include ' statements . . . taken out of context . '"
In the view of the news organizations , the easiest way to prevent distortions is simply to open the proceedings even more .
Rather than forcing interested readers to reconstruct the case from a journalist 's accounts , provide an easy way for them to watch the trial itself .
The video would also give the RIAA an easy way to rebut inaccurate portrayals of the trial .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has also weighed in on a joint brief with Free Press , Internet Archive , Public .
Resource .
Org , and even one - time McCain IP lawyer Ben Sheffner .
Despite the differing views that the parties take on the overall RIAA litigation , they agree that opening the case up to public scrutiny is a good thing .
Internet Archive and Public .
Resource .
Org have also agreed to host the video in a bid to allay RIAA fears about Berkman Center bias .
Although the RIAA insists that the video would benefit Tenenbaum and harm the music industry , the brief argues that the opposite might well be true .
" Yet especially given the Petitioners ' vocal public media strategy in support of the cases , it is difficult to see why members of the general public would be more likely to agree with the defendants than with the plaintiffs in this case if they see an actual hearing for themselves . "
The First Circuit is expected to rule on the issue soon .

The Dangers of Windows AutoRun
By Will Dormann on April 24 , 2008 7:12 PM
こんにちは。私は CERT / CC 脆弱性調査チーム の Will Dormann です。数か月前にディジタル写真による感染事例がメディアで報告されました。私は悪意あるコードが実行された方法について知りたかったので、Microsoft の AutoRun および AutoPlay 機能についての調査を開始しました。
Windows95 で導入された AutoRun は、大き く2つの性質があります。
CD-ROMドライブのような特定の種類のデバイスにおいては、デバイスが接続されるかメディアが挿入されると、Windows は Autorun.inf ファイルで指定されたプログラムを自動的に実行します。この機能のセキュリティに対する影響は、物理的にコンピュータにアクセスできる者は、CD-ROMをドライブに挿入することで悪意あるコードを実行できるという点です。しかし、コンピュータへ物理的にアクセスできるということは、攻撃者にあらゆることができる能力を与えることだと、我々はすでに知っていますよね。
Windows のエクスプローラにおいてドライブアイコンがクリックされたときに、Windows は Autorun.inf ファイルで指定されたプログラムを実行します。この場合、コードの実行にはユーザの操作が必要となります。しかし、ドライブのアイコンをクリックすることはドライブの内容を表示すると一般的には思われており、コードが実行される
AutoRun の動作は予想外でしょう 。
AutoRun の動作を調査するにあたり、私は2つの面白いことに気付きました。
U3ドライブの悪意ある使用方法に関する情報は、特に目新しいものではありません。しかし、AutoRunがどれくらいシステムで無効にされていますか。問題を混乱させているもうひとつの側面は、どのように
AutoRun 機能を正しく効果的に無効にするのかが明確にされていない点です。VU#889747は当初、私のテストで効果的とみえた手順をリストにしました。しかしそれらにはMCNメッセージを抑制してしまう副作用があり、CD-ROM
や DVD が変更されたことを Windows が検知できなくなりました 。
我々の読者の一人 がAutoRunを無効にする、もっとも原因に近い方法、AutoRun.infファイルそのものに対する方法、を提供してくれました。以下のレジストリキーをインポートすることによって、Autorun.inf ファイルが AutoRun および AutoPlay 機能の決定に使われることはなくなります。
REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\Autorun.inf ] @=" @SYS:DoesNotExist "
この設定はネガティブな副作用を引き起こさずに
AutoRun 機能を抑制できるように思います。この回避方法の詳細については、Nick Brown のブログ の Memory stick worms に記されています 。
2008 年11月21日更新
Microsoft Windows は AutoRun の情報を接続されたデバイスからキャッシュするかも知れません。これによる影響は、前述の方法で
AutoRun を無効にした後も過去にコンピュータに接続していたデバイス( USBメモリ、ネットワーク共有、その他 ) において AutoRun 機能がまだ働くかも知れないということです。この理由から、MountPoints2 レジストリキーを各ユーザのレジストリから削除することによってキャッシュを削除することをお勧めします。

( CNN ) -- Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss claimed victory Tuesday in the Senate race in Georgia against Democrat Jim Martin , killing Democratic hopes of gaining enough seats to halt filibusters .
Voters " delivered a strong message that conservative Georgian values matter , " Chambliss said .
" People all around the world truly had their eyes on Georgia , and you have delivered tonight a strong message to the world that conservative Georgian values matter , " Chambliss said .
" Now comes the hard work . "
Chambliss said he is prepared to work with Barack Obama when he becomes president , but not in all matters .
" When he wants to raise your taxes , when he wants to tinker with the Second Amendment , when he wants to make proposals with respect to health care that is going to take your choice of choosing your doctor away form you , then I 'm going to be the 41st senator to stand up and say no . "
Watch Chambliss give his victory speech »
Chambliss ' remarks followed a concession speech by Martin .
" Tonight , the voters of Georgia have spoken , " he told supporters .
" I accept the decision that has been made . "
Watch Martin give his concession speech »
The election is playing off the results of November 4 , when Chambliss failed to win a majority of the vote in a three - person race .
Democrats have so far picked up seven Senate seats in this year 's election , with the Republican seat in Minnesota still undecided .
In Minnesota , freshman GOP Sen .
Norm Coleman topped his Democratic challenger , Al Franken , by just 215 votes , triggering an automatic recount that will extend well into December .
Had Democrats taken the Georgia and Minnesota contests , they would have reached their pre-election goal of controlling 60 Senate seats , which would be a filibuster - proof majority .
A filibuster is a move by the minority party in the Senate that brings the chamber to a standstill by blocking votes on legislation .
Watch CNN's John King report on the runoff »
Chambliss won a plurality on Election Day , but Georgia state law requires a majority -- 50 percent plus one vote .
Because of the inclusion of a third - party candidate , Chambliss fell just shy of that threshold , forcing a runoff election .
See results from Tuesday 's runoff election
Chambliss promised to be a firewall against the Democrats in Washington , while Martin aligned himself with Barack Obama and the president - elect 's message of change .
Both sides brought in big - name surrogates to help motivate base voters .
Sarah Palin , the Alaska governor and former Republican vice presidential nominee , teamed up with Chambliss at four campaign events across Georgia on Monday .
Watch more on Palin 's return to the trail »
" You Georgians are going to have the opportunity to determine the direction this country is going to take , " Palin said during a campaign rally in Perry , in south Georgia .
" This election is that important , and I know come tomorrow night , Georgians are going to speak , and Georgia 's going to speak with a loud and clear voice .
We want to make sure we have at least 41 Republicans in the United States Senate to make sure that we shape bad legislation , or kill bad legislation . "
Chambliss had urged Palin to come to Georgia and help him get out the conservative vote .
Sen .
John McCain returned to the trail to campaign with Chambliss just nine days after losing the presidential election to Obama .
Other former presidential hopefuls -- including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- also have hit the trail for Chambliss in the past month .
Giuliani , Huckabee and Romney could all make another presidential bid in 2012 , and Palin could be joining them .
iReport.com : Did you vote in Georgia ?
Martin also received some major - league help .
Both former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore have separately teamed up with him .
And while Obama resisted Martin 's invitation to come down to Georgia in person , the president - elect did lend his voice to a 60 - second radio ad that ran for more than a week .
And many who worked in Georgia for Obama during the general election campaign assisted Martin .
On Monday , Martin teamed up with Rep. John Lewis and other prominent Georgia Democrats before ending the day at a rally at the State Capitol in Atlanta with rapper Ludacris .
Martin called Palin's four campaign stops Monday a sign of desperation for Chambliss , adding that " bringing Sarah Palin is not going to help him , because the voters of Georgia want someone who will stand up for them in Washington ; someone who understands their issues . "
Analysts said turnout was crucial to the outcome of this election , raising the question of whether big - name surrogates make a difference .
" Generally they can help boost turnout , because of all the media attention , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
" Turnout in a runoff election is often very low compared to a presidential election , and each side needs to get as many of their voters to the polls as possible . "
This is Georgia 's first runoff election for a U.S. Senate seat since 1992 , when incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler won a plurality of the vote on Election Day but lost the runoff election to Republican Paul Coverdale .

Could ' Tentacle ' UFO Have Destroyed UK Wind Turbine ?
January 6th , 2009 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Several residents of a remote English village have reported sightings of a bizarre tentacle - shaped UFO above a local wind farm , on the night before a wind turbine was mysteriously destroyed .
Engineers from energy suppier Ecotricity are investigating why a blade more than 20 meters ( 66 ft ) long fell off the turbine at a wind farm in Conisholme Fen , Lincolnshire , early on Sunday morning .
In the meantime , locals are coming to their own conclusions after many of them saw strange flashing tentacle shaped lights above the wind farm on the night before the damage occurred .
John Harrison , a resident of nearby Saltfleetby , said he looked out of his window on Saturday night to see “ a massive ball of light , ” and “ tentacles going right down to the ground ” over the site .
“ It was huge ” he said “ At first I thought it must have been a hole where the moon was shining through but then I saw the tentacles – it looked just like an octopus .
“ It was an incredible site ; I have never seen anything like it before .
I have no idea what it was , all I can say is what I saw ” .
However , officials are remaining tight - lipped about the cause of the damage .
A spokesman from Ecotricity said , “ This has never happened before so we really have no idea what might have gone wrong .
We will conduct a thorough inspection of the turbines to see if there is a problem and put it right . ”
Damage to wind turbines , although rare , is more common than many would anticipate .
This link provides dramatic footage of a wind turbine appearing to spin wildly out of control before shattering and falling to the ground .

Programmers are Tiny Gods
In this series , I ’m exploring the stories about work I find myself coming back to a lot .
I call them Things I Learned the Hard Way .
I ’ve already talked about designers and how their critique training makes them impossible to work with .
Now let ’s look at the other side of the coin : programmers .
In Genesis , God creates things in a certain order .
Why plants before animals ?
I dunno .
It just seemed right to Him .
( Do n’t worry , it ’s just a metaphor . )
Programmers are the same way .
In any programming language , there will be many ways to solve a problem .
The right way to do it is a personal decision , made by the programmer , just like in Genesis .
Programmers are the Gods of their tiny worlds .
They create something out of nothing .
In their command - line universe , they say when it ’s sunny and when it rains .
And the tiny universe complies .
So it ’s no wonder that , in team meetings , programmers can behave like fickle Gods .
“ No we could n’t possibly do it that way , ” they ’ll say .
And they may have reasons , or maybe it ’s just not the way things are done in their universe .
So if you ’re working with a programmer , you have to treat him or her like a God .
You have to pray .
You can not issue edicts .
You have to come on bended knee .
“ Here ’s the problem I have .
I need a solution .
Please help . ”
The good news is , programmers want their work to be used , and the good ones know that the design matters .
So programmers and designers actually have the same goal : getting the stuff used .
If each can honor the talents of the other , great things can happen .
A good technique I ’ve found is to be very specific with the result I ’m looking for , and the reasons why .
“ When a user clicks X , Y should happen immediately , because if there ’s a lag , we ’ll lose people . ”
Like designers , if you give a programmer a problem with parameters , they ’ll apply every bit of genius they have to solve it in the best possible way .
If you tell them how to do it , you ’ll suffer the wrath of an angry God .

DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Friday that U.S. efforts to prop up its failing auto industry with bailout money amount to a form of protectionism that threatened to distort the global economy .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she remained fully committed to free market principles .
In a keynote speech on the third day of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland , Merkel said that open markets had to be protected and urged governments to work together to build a more robust and responsible global financial system .
Calling for an " open world economy , " Merkel said : " We must not allow market forces to be completely distorted .
For instance , I am very wary of seeing subsidies injected into the U.S. auto industry .
That could lead to distortion and protectionism . "
Merkel said the central task facing politicians was to restore the ability of markets to function and said the crisis required " exceptional measures . "
She also said that Germany 's " social market economy " could serve as a model for a future international financial system in which governments guarded both the " social and economic order " and proposed the creation of a U.N. economic council modeled on the Security Council .
" We want to have an eye firmly on the future so that we get out of this crisis stronger than when we went in , " she told delegates .
" We have to have a clear idea of where we are going to go so that we do n't make the same mistakes as in the past . "
Despite the scale of the crisis , Merkel said that " incredible opportunities " were opening up , adding that growing up in East Germany to become the chancellor of a unified German state had proved to her that nothing was impossible .
Earlier , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged global political and business leaders to work together to fix the financial system as the economic crisis returned to the top of the agenda in Davos .
Brown is due to host G - 20 leaders in London in April and told reporters that he would use the economic summit to press for concerted international action and tougher global financial regulations .
" Politicians and business leaders have an urgent requirement to rise to the challenge of leadership , " Brown said .
" History is not destiny .
We have a choice about what happens next .
This is not only a time for analysis and retrospection but a time for action . "
" This is a time not just for individual and national measures to deal with the global financial crisis .
This is the time for the world to come together as one . "
Brown , whose government has acted to prop up the UK's ailing banks with a rescue package of partial nationalization and this week announced a £ 2.3 billion ( $ 3.3 billion ) bailout for the country 's auto manufacturers , urged countries to avoid retreating into protectionism , warning that restrictions on global trade would only worsen the economic crisis .
Watch Brown talk about solving crisis »
Delegates have already heard from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao -- two of more than 40 heads of state or government attending this year 's forum .
Also on Friday , Microsoft founder Bill Gates and wife Melinda Gates urged leaders not to allow the economic crisis to distract them from African development .
" Put simply , aid works , " said Melinda , who now co-chairs the philanthropic Gates Foundation with her husband .
" We must continue foreign aid assistance .
It 's difficult to keep this on the front pages right now but it 's never been more important . "
Meanwhile former U.S. vice - president and environmental campaigner Al Gore warned that a consensus on tackling climate change was needed between developed and developing nations before this year 's talks in Copenhagen on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol .
" What is most important is that this year is not wasted .
We are running out of time , " Gore warned .
All About Gordon Brown
I 've been saying this for months : Lee Adama is by far the shallowest character on Battlestar Galactica that we 've been tricked into liking , partially because of his sexy man - brow and ability to look hot while beating up girls .
But now , Entertainment Weekly has fingered Lee Adama along with Squidward Tentacles , McDreamy and Lauren Conrad in their controversial list of " 24 TV Characters Who Just Turn You Off . "
Honestly , if donning a fat suit was the most compelling character development that happened to you in four seasons , you 've got issues — but I know how to fix Apollo , and why he 's broken in the first place .
EW put their feelings about Apollo pretty plainly :
The only reason I do n't want Lee to die is that Laura would have to put up with Bill crying about it .
All Lee cares about is appearing to be on the moral high ground .
He has no integrity as a person .
No wonder his father does n't respect him .
Advertisement
Here , here !
Finally someone is saying it , I heartily agree Lee sucks and god for so many reasons .
Bad Boy For A Minute : Remember his bad boy attitude in the series premiere ?
It was so short - lived that I did n't care at all about his " I 'm not my father 's son " bad attitude .
What happened to that ?
Because every moment after that he flip - flops massively on his feelings towards his dad , often for the most ridiculous reasons .
He Is A Pussy : First off , the yelling and crazy jumping when Starbuck and Lee were doing the deed was so awful — and uncomfortable .
Sure , it was cute when she was doing it because she 's adorable but ugh , barf — just watching him take it again and again as Starbuck walks all over him is so sad , and not in a good way .
He Was Cheating In A Really Lame Way : Starbuck is screwed up , there 's no denying it .
Who would n't be messed up after they were beaten by their mother , drugged and robbed of their ovary , and then imprisoned with a cylon and their supposed love child — only to find out that this child that has been holding your sanity together is actually not yours ... or is it ?
Oh and then you die and come back to life .
So yeah , she 's a little off her game .
So if she needs to find relief from her mistaken marriage in the arms of a childhood friend , then so be it .
But what 's Lee 's excuse ?
Sure , a lot of his family is dead , but so is EVERYONE'S .
Give me a reason to root for you , Lee , because right now watching you half heartedly cheat on your wife and then inexplicably leave her is snoresville .
He 's Preachy :
Oh god who could forget the 10 - minute monologue that was Lee Adama testifying at Baltar 's hearing ?
Sure he made a lot of really valid points , but why is he the only one that gets to talk about this ?
And forever , no less .
Plus his ridiculous " little lost lamb " act in the world of politics is insulting .
He 's watched people die in battle for chrissakes , is he really that naive ?
And then when he does finally " get it " that his attempt at strong - arming President Roslin with his whole " the people have the right to know " BS is boring and totally misguided .
Again , your father is Big Man Adama — do you not see how this works stop with the moral rationale and get your hands dirty pretty boy .
His high and mighty act is exhausting .
But hey do n't take our word for it : according to the podcast for Revelations , Ron Moore himself was confused on the direction for Lee .
Apparently making him wear hideous suits and spout off dollar - store morals was the way to go .

How would we fix this problem ?
Simple .
BRING BACK FAT LEE .
The loss of Fat Lee Adama in one episode was the worst thing that could ever happen to Apollo .
Watching Lee lounge around and get soft was totally riveting .
Plus the disgust his father had for him was a whole new and interesting angle that was actually plausible .
Not just the usual " Wah , I 'm mad at my dad " crap .
So you heard it here first —
Fat Lee wins over regular Lee any day .
Plus then maybe he 'll have to get some new suits .

Failure may be an orphan , but McCain campaign veterans seem to be doing their best to pin blame for defeat on their MAVERICK VP choice Sarah Palin .
Fox News Channel political correspondent Carl Cameron today disclosed the first of what he predicts will be an " avalanche " of unflattering stories about the Republican vice presidential nominee :
Off - the - record tips from McCain aides that Palin did not know Africa was a continent or the constituent countries in the NAFTA treaty .
He later told Bill O'Reilly Palin did n't know the constituent nations of North America , either .
More damning , from a campaign perspective ?
Far worse for the campaign was that Palin did not allow aides to prep her for her disastrous interview with Katie Couric , thus exposing her ignorance — or " lack ... of knowledgeability " as Cameron diplomatically puts it — to the general public .
This intractability was supposedly followed by Palin temper tantrums when things , inevitably , went poorly .
If bitter ex-McCain people are trying , as it seems , to torpedo Palin 's chances of running in 2012 or 2016 , it 's hard to see how these leaks will accomplish that .
If repeated on - camera stupidity by Palin was n't enough to destroy those hopes , unverified and anonymously - sourced tales from the campaign trail are hardly going to do the trick .
But they 'll sure be entertaining !
( Video at top , via Eric Spiegelman and Huffington Post . )
The presidential race entered a critical three - day period in September when the economic crisis cast the candidates ' differences in sharp relief .
On Sept. 24 , with financial markets verging on panic and the economy thudding , Democratic Sen. Barack Obama placed a call to rival John McCain .
He wanted to suggest they issue a joint statement on proposed financial - bailout legislation .
As hours went by without a return call , Obama aides emailed each other , asking , " Have you heard anything ? "
One answered : " The McCain camp is cooking ...
25 years ago today , on Jan. 24 , 1984 , the first Macintosh computer went on sale .
Now better known as the “ Mac , ” the name came from the Apple employee who created the project , Jef Raskin , who wanted to name it after his favorite kind of apple , McIntosh , but had to tweak the name for legal rights .
This original Macintosh came with 128 kilobytes of RAM ( it would later become known as the Macintosh 128K ) and featured a 8 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor .
It had a 9 - inch black and white CRT screen and featured a 400 kB , single - sided 3.5 - inch floppy disk drive .
The price ?
$ 2,495 , which in today ’s dollars would have been well over $ 5,000 .
The computer featured the signatures of the entire Apple Macintosh division molded inside the case .
Those name include Raskin , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs , Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and many others .
Below watch Jobs unveil the first Macintosh , as well as some other notable Mac videos throughout the years .

10 Bizarre But Useful Appliance Combinations
In a world of high consumer demand and market competition , manufactures are constantly looking for ways to break the mold and create unique products that will appeal to buyers .
Unfortunately , many of these mold - breaking creations end up as massive failures on a Most Useless Inventions list .
The appliance industry , however , seems to have struck gold with a recent slew of strange appliances that are actually pretty handy .
Say goodbye to the noodle hair guards and personal rain savers , and say to hello 10 bizarre but useful appliance combinations .
1. Microwave Oven & Toaster
It ’s probably one of the most debated decisions during small appliance purchasing – microwave oven or toaster ?
Both have their own set of perks and a lot of people just end up buying both , but for a home that ’s low on counter space or funds , you will ultimately have to decide which is more important .
That was until LG decided to take the best from both worlds and develop a combination Microwave Oven & Toaster .
Now families around the world can enjoy evenly toasted bagels and perfectly cooked pizza pops at the same time .
2. Radio & Toaster
Who does n’t like to start the day with a slice of toast and the morning news ?
Well , thanks to Hammacher Schlemmer , you can now enjoy both AM pleasures with one energy - saving , space - saving appliance , the Radio Toaster .
It comes with all the usual bells and whistles of both appliances but it ’s all packed into one cool looking design .
It guarantees perfectly toasted bread every time and even has a removable crumble tray for easy clean up .
What more could you ask for ?
3. Coffee & Egg Toastenator
How about an appliance that not only makes your toast , but brews your coffee and fries your egg too ?
You can thank the always - clever Japanese and their forward thinking for this ultimate three - in - one breakfast making machine .
This little space - efficient wonder has a coffee machine on one side , a toaster oven on the other and a mini griddle on the top to help you save time and energy – both in high demand during the morning routine .
4. In - sink Dishwasher
Another perfect combination for those who do n’t have a lot of room to spare is the In - Sink Dishwasher from KitchenAid .
It ’s the only one like it on the market and comes with a pretty hefty price tag – $ 1,800.00 – but for singles or couples living in tight quarters , this could be a practical addition .
The racks are removable so you can still use the sink and it comes with a cutting board on top for even more space saving .
But unless your hate for washing dishes by hand is worth $ 1,800 , we suggest putting off purchasing one of these until the price drops a bit … or a lot .
5. Refrigerator & Range
Like light and dark or big and small , there are some things that just ca n’t be mixed together but thanks to Whirlpool , hot and cold are no longer one of those .
The Whirlpool Gold Polara is a combination range and refrigerator that will keep your food fresh and cool all day long and then cook it to perfection just in time for supper .
It comes with a fully functional cooktop and is ideal for busy families that do n’t have time to thaw and cook meals .
6. Refrigerator & Microwave
Options for stacked , space - saving appliances are no longer limited to the washer and dryer .
You can now purchase a Summit Refrigerator / Microwave combination to help save room with two home appliance necessities .
Simply stacked with the refrigerator on the bottom and microwave on top , this is an exceptionally functional and affordable appliance combination .
7. Pasta Maker Station
Perfect for chefs or anyone who loves to cook and eat Italian food , the Zanussi Pasta Station is an all - in - one , buffet - style pasta makin’ station .
It allows you to combine a variety of appliances such as pasta cookers , electric ranges , ovens , a Bain Marie ( double boiler ) , storage cupboards and more into one unit for a professional cooking experience .
8. Toilet & Washer
Lovingly called the ‘ Washup ’ , the combo appliance industry has entered a whole new frontier with this toilet - washer combo .
After the initial ‘ Ew ’ factor wears off , the idea behind this appliance is actually very intelligent .
The water used to wash your clothes is reused to flush the toilet .
It ’s sustainable , eco-friendly and because of its stacked design , space saving so it ’s perfect for apartments or any home looking to ‘ go green ’ and save on their water bill .
9. Tea Maker & Life Line
Give another nod to the innovative Japanese for this combination Tea Maker & Life Line .
The weird mix may have you confused but like most Japanese inventions , the idea behind it is pretty smart .
It was designed to give peace of mind to those worried about their ( tea drinking ) elderly parents who live alone by sending an alert via email or cellphone message when the tea maker is being used .
It will let you know when it was turned on and how long it has been keeping warm , allowing you to know that your parents are safe and sound .
10 . Dishwasher & Oven / Cooktop
Carad has developed the Frankenstein of all combination appliances – a fully functional three - in - one dishwasher , oven and cooktop for the really space - deficient home .
Currently available for purchase , it has a dishwasher with a 27 cm dinner plate capacity on the bottom , an oven in the middle , and a hot plate cooktop on top .
Pick up one of these with a refrigerator - microwave combo and your kitchen will be complete !
Here it is : Google 's strategy to take over the world .
Or at least , this is Google 's plan according to French consulting firm faberNovel , who summarize the Big G's plot - from YouTube , to the Facebook threat , to competing with Microsoft , to Google 's iron grip on the online advertising market - and much more - in a mere 34 slides .
Did they capture the essence of the world 's favorite search engine ?

1 of 1 2 of 1
In fairness , it was idiotic to expect an all - time classic from the lunatic famously described by Scott Weiland as a “ fat , Botox - faced , wig - wearing fuck ” .
Still , no one expected Axl Rose ’s Chinese Democracy to be one of 2008 ’s most high - profile busts .
You want embarrassing ?
Well , having a Stone Temple Toilet get off a good one at your expense is definitely an indignity for the ages .
But that ’s nothing compared with spending 14 years working on a record and then finding out no one gives a shit when you ’ve finally finished diddling with it .
For reasons that only begin with the fact no one ever expected it to be released , Chinese Democracy was billed as the most anticipated record in the history of rock ’ n ’ roll .
And what happens ?
During its first week out , the official return of Guns N’ Roses gets its ass kicked by teenaged country - pop crooner Taylor Swift .
Fearless , the sophomore album from the 18 - year - old former Jonas brother fuck - buddy , moved 267,400 copies , besting Chinese Democracy ’s sales of 261,200 .
Hell , Kelly Clarkson ’s last disc , My December , put up better numbers in 2007 , and the general consensus was that it not only dumped the bed , but did so with enough velocity to impress that guy in Trainspotting .
Pouring a Costco - sized box of Sifto salt into a gaping wound , Rose ’s big return was n’t even the second - most - popular record of its debut week .
Kanye
West took top spot with 808s & Heartbreak , selling 450,000 units of an album that ’s received the kind of fan reception the villagers of Transylvania gave Frankenstein .
So what ’s been the problem ?
Well , you can start with the reality that the generation that made Guns N’ Roses the most deservedly mammoth rock band of its time has moved on .
Forget puking up Hi-Test on their jean jackets while flunking out of Parking Lot 101 ; the skids who made “ Sweet Child O’ Mine ” the slow - dance favourite of Frank Hurt secondary school back in 1988 are busy today squiring their kids to soccer practice in rusted - out Volvos and working to keep up mortgage payments on their Annacis Island Airstreams .
As far as building a new fan base goes , spending a decade and a half in a mansion fiddling with your cornrows is n’t exactly the best way to keep yourself on the radar of the MySpace nation .
Rose ’s decision to make like J. D. Salinger is n’t the sole reason Chinese Democracy is shaping up to be hard rock ’s equivalent of Heaven ’s Gate .
After watching fellow metal - minded fossils AC / DC strike platinum by selling their latest album exclusively at Wal - Mart , he chose to make Chinese Democracy available only at Best Buy .
Wal - Mart turned the release of Black Ice into an event , complete with mini AC / DC stores offering everything from belt buckles and pint glasses to ginch and backstage blowjobs .
According to Billboard , Best Buy pulled an Artie Fufkin by assuming a couple of well - placed posters would lead to a Long Island–style Thanksgiving stampede .
Ultimately , though , there ’s really only one person to blame for Chinese Democracy , and that ’s Rose .
As the album credits show , Kurt Cobain ’s favourite misogynist went through more musicians than Winona Ryder during the record ’s endless gestation .
Hell , there are five guitarists on the title track alone .
Despite that , Chinese Democracy is basically a glorified solo record , doubly offensive considering the band ’s original lineup featured some of the most iconic figures in rock ’ n ’ roll .
The problem with having an ego the size of Rosie O’Donnell ’s ass is that it ’s difficult to accept that Slash was arguably the coolest part of GN’R .
At least Saul Hudson never took to the stage wearing a fur coat and ball - hugging biker shorts .
What originally made Guns N’ Roses great was a dangerous , raw chemistry , the kind that comes from locking five desperate losers in a practice space on a diet of greasy takeout and bad bourbon .
Chinese Democracy sounds safe , disappointingly straightforward , and , most egregiously , more processed than Britney Spears stuffed to the tits with Kraft Singles .
Take a bow , you fat , Botox - faced , wig - wearing fuck , you ’ve just managed to ruin what was once one of the most bankable brand names in the history of rock .

There are literally millions of examples of interesting side - effects of the evolutionary process .
Vestigial organs , advanced behavioral characteristics , development cycles , etc .
Here are some examples :
Remnants of alternate gender
In human males , there is a blind duct , called the vagina masculina , attached to the prostate .
It is the male vestigial remnant of the female vagina and uterus .
All fetuses begin with a set of mullerian ducts .
In males , the mullerian ducts do n't develop ( into a vagina and uterus ) because Anti Mullerian Hormone is present .
If Anti Muller Hormone is n't present the fetus can be born with Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome , which indicates you have an XY male with normal external genitalia , but a malformed or small uterus , upper vagina or cervix developed near the pubic bone .
The female counterpart is the Wolffian Duct , which develops into the prostate , epididymis , vas deferens etc in males , and regresses in females .
In female , it can be present either as Skene 's glands or as Gartner 's Duct .
It 's a cool thing to think about , because it means that regardless of actual genes , many intersex conditions are a result of hormone reception and expression ( which are related to genetics usually , but occasionally an environment - related issue ) .
A related form of hermaphroditism present in some supermodels is Androgen insensitive hermaphroditism , where an XY male fetus is exposed to testosterone in the womb , but has no receptors for the testosterone or other androgens and develops as a female with external genitalia , but usually lacks a uterus and occasionally has a malformed cervix .
These people are women , mentally and identify as female , but a karyotype will show they have an X and a Y .
Cicada life cycle
The cicada life cycle is an example of a really cool evolutionary phenomenon .
Some species of cicada emerge from the ground only after 13 years , and some emerge only after 17 years .
Both of these are prime numbers .
This means that a predator cannot become adapted to preying on cicadas as a food source very easily .
For example , a cicada with a 15 - year life cycle could be preyed upon by a predator with a three - or five - year life cycle , but the 13 - and 17 - year cycles allow them to stop the predator life cycle from synchronizing .
Men can lactate
Even though men are almost never ever responsible for breastfeeding their children , evolution has n't eliminated mammary glands in men , presumably because they do not carry a selection advantage or disadvantage and thus are not acted upon by selection forces .
The diving bell spider
It 's basically a spider that makes a kind of " aqua lung " / scuba tank out of its web and uses it to live underwater most of its life even though it uses air to breathe .
The diving bell spider uses a special web that actually exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide through osmosis while underwater and never needs to be refilled to provide breathable air .
Humans arbitrarily claim they 're " special "
Humans are forever looking for ways to make their species seem special , by making up stuff like " we are the only species that uses tools " or " we are the only species that can plan for the future " .
Neither of these are true , but more importantly , these types of things are entirely arbitrary .
We think tool usage is important because it makes us special , not the other way around .
Not to mention that other animals do make and use tools as well as plan for the future .
Yeast control mutation rate
The molecular basis for evolution is basically typos made while replicating DNA that result in mutations .
Complex organisms have sophisticated spell - checkers built in to limit how much this occurs .
Yeast , when put in conditions that are just barely tolerable ( temperature or pH off ) are actually able to switch off their spell - checkers , deliberately increasing their mutation rate in the hopes of hitting a favorable adaptation .
Smart bacteria
With the way adaptive immunity works , if a small amount of bacteria infected you and started pumping out toxin , in most cases you'd be immune before the concentration became high enough to harm you .
At some point , Pseudomonas aeruginosa worked this out and began using quorum sensing , basically population - wide chemical signaling , to keep tabs on how many of them there are .
They hold off releasing toxin until there 's enough of them and then they all flood your system with it at once before your immune system has its boots on .
Race and location
Race is an evolutionary trait and depends on the country of origin .
Africans have darker skin to protect them from danger from the sun 's rays .
[ 1]
The wider , flatter nasal structure helps the body draw in more moisture in the desert climes .
The tighter curls enable the body to give off heat while holding moisture to the skin .
Nordic people have light skin and hair to draw in the sunlight since they need more of the sun 's benefits .
The smaller nasal structure protects the body from drawing the cold air into the lungs while helping the body retain what moisture it can .
The ability to grow long , straight hair acts much like a pelt of a wolf or a woolly mammoth to keep the elements out .
Alternation of plant generations
The earliest plants had two separate and distinct life cycles ... a gametophyte , which produces male and female gametes , and a sporophyte , which produces spores .
Spores develop into gametophytes , and gametophytes produce gametes that mix and the resulting fertilized egg becomes a sporophyte .
The thing is , this system is still maintained as plants have evolved .
Mosses were the most primitive , since they can't grow to be very large and require water as a medium for the gametes to mix .
The next stage of plant evolution were ferns , which have actual vascular tissue and can therefore stand taller , absorb more sunlight .
More importantly , adult ferns produce spores , and these spores mix to make tiny gametophytes and the cycle progresses as normal .
Next stage is pollinating plants .
Pollen grains themselves are tiny male gametophytes .
The large , adult plant is itself a sporophyte .
Eventually you see flowering plants , which no longer have to expend so much energy to fertilize adjacent plants , and the alternation of generations is maintained .
The above series is an example of how evolution builds on and around a singular system , modifying it as time goes on .
Orca whales speciating
There are at least 3 races / subspecies / species of orca [ killer whale ] .
If they are not separate species yet , we are seeing a step of evolution in progress .
The first type , known as residents , live in coastal waters and feed exclusively on fish .
They live in large families and are vocal nearly all the time .
They live in very localized areas and only migrate according to where their food source travels .
The second are known as transients .
They wander over larger ranges , and eat small marine mammals .
They are still a mainly coastal species .
They live in smaller groups and are often silent .
The third type are known mainly as offshores , and like their name , prefer deeper oceanic ranges .
Why ?
They prey exclusively on whales .
Nearly nothing is known about their social structure .
The three types never ever engage in any kind of social activity or breeding .
They are all genetically distinct from each other .
Research is currently being conducted to decide whether their differences are enough to warrant separate species status .
Mantis shrimp eyes
Mantis shrimp are the only known animals with hyperspectral colour vision .
Their eyes ( both mounted on mobile stalks and constantly moving about independently of each other ) are similarly variably coloured , and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
They permit both serial and parallel analysis of visual stimuli .
Each compound eye is made up of up to 10,000 separate ommatidia of the apposition type .
Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by six parallel rows of highly specialised ommatidia , collectively called the midband , which divides the eye into three regions .
This is a design which makes it possible for mantis shrimp to see objects with three different parts of the same eye .
In other words , each individual eye possesses trinocular vision and depth perception .
The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of forms and motion , not colour vision , like the eyes of many other crustaceans .
Rows 1 - 4 of the midband are specialised for colour vision , from ultra-violet to infra-red .
The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom is divided into three different pigmented layers ( tiers ) , each adapted for different wavelengths .
The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters ( intrarhabdomal filters ) that can be divided into four distinct classes , two classes in each row .
It is organised like a sandwich ; a tier , a colour filter of one class , a tier again , a colour filter of another class , and then a last tier .
Rows 5 - 6 are segregated into different tiers too , but have only one class of visual pigment ( a ninth class ) and are specialised for polarisation vision .
They can detect different planes of polarised light .
A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the dorsal and ventral hemispheres of the eye .
Cacao tree
The Cacau tree has a symbiotic relationship with the micro-organisms in the soil near it .
The cacao tree has some of the most primitive roots in the plant world .
Without the micro-organisms assisting the trees roots there would be no chocolate in the world .
Ants take slaves
Ants start wars involving massive numbers and deaths .
They even take slaves / POW during battle and force them to do the colony 's grunt work . [ 2 ]
Seeds needing fire
There are several types of trees and herbaceous plants whose seeds will only germinate after a fire , meaning that the occasional wildfire is necessary .
Some species , such as the jack pine , even rely on fire to spread their seeds .
The jack pine produces " seratonous " ( resin - filled ) cones that are very durable .
The cones remain dormant until a fire occurs and melts the resin .
Then the cones pop open and the seeds fall or blow out . [ 3 ]
Birds can't taste hot peppers
Pepper plants ( the hot kind ) produce a chemical called capsican in their fruit , which causes a burning sensation - but only in mammals .
Apparently , natural selection decided that birds spread pepper seeds better than mammals , so capsican developed in the seeds and flesh of the pepper .
Birds do n't have the chemoreceptors for it to cause the burning , so eating super hot peppers does n't phase them at all .
Wasps and roaches
A recent study proved using radioactive labeling that the wasp stings precisely into specific ganglia of the roach .
She delivers an initial sting to a thoracic ganglion and injects venom to mildly and reversibly paralyze the front legs of the insect .
This facilitates the second venomous sting at a carefully chosen spot in the roach 's head ganglia ( brain ) , in the section that controls the escape reflex .
As a result of this sting , the roach will first groom extensively , and then become sluggish and fail to show normal escape responses .
In 2007 it was reported that the venom of the wasp blocks receptors for the neurotransmitter octopamine .
The wasp proceeds to chew off half of each of the roach 's antennae .
The wasp , which is too small to carry the roach , then leads the victim to the wasp 's burrow , by pulling one of the roach 's antennae in a manner similar to a leash .
Once they reach the burrow , the wasp lays a white egg , about 2 mm long , on the roach 's abdomen .
It then exits and proceeds to fill in the burrow entrance with pebbles , more to keep other predators out than to keep the roach in .
With its escape reflex disabled , the stung roach will simply rest in the burrow as the wasp 's egg hatches after about three days .
The hatched larva lives and feeds for 4 - 5 days on the roach , then chews its way into its abdomen and proceeds to live as an endoparasitoid .
Over a period of eight days , the wasp larva consumes the roach 's internal organs in an order which guarantees that the roach will stay alive , at least until the larva enters the pupal stage and forms a cocoon inside the roach 's body .
Eventually the fully - grown wasp emerges from the roach 's body to begin its adult life .
Development is faster in the warm season .

REPUBLICANS looking for a friendly shoulder to cry on in the coming months could do worse than look up their ideological cousins across the Atlantic .
For the Conservative Party in Britain knows what it feels like to be wiped out in a watershed election by a charismatic opponent whose victory brings jubilant scenes on the streets and heady talk of a new dawn .
For the Tories , the cataclysm came 11 years ago when Tony Blair buried them in a landslide .
Since then , they have suffered two more general election defeats , enduring their longest spell in the parliamentary wilderness since the mid-19th century .
What might panicked Republicans learn from the Tory experience ?
That apparently the first response to electoral disaster is denial .
In the immediate aftermath of 1997 , a few brave Tory souls dared venture that the party would have to undergo radical change , that it had to inch toward the center and demonstrate that it was not as out of touch as the critics alleged .
The party ’s new leader , William Hague , duly tried to prove his credentials as a modern chap by wearing a baseball cap  a curious definition of modernity , admittedly , but let that stand as evidence of how passé the Tories circa 1997 seemed  and by attending the Notting Hill Carnival , a big event for black Londoners .
It was “ compassionate conservatism , ” British - style .
GAZA CITY ( CNN ) -- Israel launched an airstrike Tuesday night on southern Gaza after clashing with Hamas militants in central Gaza , Palestinian sources and Israel Defense Forces said .
Medical workers wheel a wounded man to hospital in the central Gaza strip on Tuesday after clashes .
Four were killed in the airstrike , which occurred east of Khan Younis , Palestinian sources said .
They said a drone and an apache helicopter could be seen .
Earlier fighting between Hamas militants and Israel Defense Forces killed one militant and injured three , bringing the total death toll to 5 .
The fighting occurred after dark when Israeli troops entered the eastern part of the Dir Albalah refugee camp in central Gaza , Palestinian sources said .
IDF said it launched a small operation Tuesday evening after its forces uncovered a " ready - to - be- used tunnel " several meters from a security fence .
The IDF said the tunnel -- dug from a civilian home -- was meant for abducting Israeli soldiers .
The IDF said it exchanged fire with militants during the operation , which it said lasted a few hours .

SYRACUSE , NY -- A 16 - year - old boy was in University Hospital awaiting surgery this afternoon after a BB he shot ricocheted off a tree and struck close to his eye , Syracuse police said .
The boy , whom police have not immediately identified , was wounded about 2:30 p.m. in the backyard of 203 Crafton Ave. , Lt. Joe Cecile , speaking for Syracuse police , said .
He had been shooting a BB rifle with his uncle when a shot ricocheted off a tree , Cecile said .
The BB lodged very close to the boy 's eye , and may have entered the eye socket , but did not seem to affect the eye , Cecile said .
LAS VEGAS – Other computer manufacturers might think the Tablet PC is dead , but Asus has its own ideas .
At a press conference here at CES 2009 , Asus showed a prototype version of the EeePC T91 , a convertible tablet - style notebook .
Its 8.9 - inch swiveling screen folds up to expose a keyboard , like any other notebook or netbook – but it can rotate around and folds back over the keys , turning the device into a tablet .
You know you want one .
Unlike other tablets , it is touch - sensitive , meaning you can use your finger ( or fingers ) to tap on icons , select text , and perform other mouse actions .
You can also use an included stylus , if you prefer .
Also unlike other tablets , the T91 will weigh just 2.1 pounds .
It will run on Intel 's Atom Z520 processor , which means that the T91 will be relatively underpowered , like other netbooks .
It will likely be running a version of Linux , like other Eee PCs , and pricing will be low – in line with other netbooks , Asus representatives are saying .
Bonus features include a TV tuner and GPS .
A related model , the T101 , will have similar features ( minus the TV tuner and GPS ) but a larger , 10.1 " swivel screen .
The T91 will be available around March 2009 , and the T101 will follow shortly thereafter .
The company , which singlehandedly invented the ultra-cheap , ultra - light netbook category with the Eee PC , is betting on multitouch as the next big thing .
And why not ?
Apple 's iPhone has shown that a well - executed touch - screen interface can do a lot to make a computer so fun and easy to use that people cease to think of it as a computer .
In addition to its multitouch - capable tablets , Asus also showed off a prototype of a strange , two - brained computer with a secondary , 4.3 - inch display embedded just below the keyboard .
In this prototype ( no actual product is planned yet , Asus says ) , the mini display is also the computer 's touchpad .
And it has its own processor , which you can use without booting up the main computer – so you can listen to music , check your calendar or check your email , all from this tiny , parasitic iPhone - like display embedded in the base of your notebook .
The advantage that offers is that it will be instantly on ( no boot time required ) and it wo n't use much power .
The touchscreen computer can also be used to select a movie from your hard drive or DVD drive and then display it on the big screen , again without using the computer 's main processor or going through a lengthy boot process .
Whether anyone will actually go for these strange hybrids is another question .
But one thing 's clear : Asus is not afraid of mixing things up a little .

Britain faces an unemployment " bloodbath " in the new year with many tens of thousands of jobs axed in the public and private sectors , according to a cabinet minister .
Senior government figures are braced for a dramatic lengthening in dole queues in the first quarter of 2009 , as employers delay announcing redundancies until after Christmas .
Thousands of civil servants and town hall workers will share the pain as government efficiency savings bite , while struggling retailers and manufacturing industry are heading for heavy redundancies .
The ranks of the unemployed will be swollen by up to 27,000 staff from Woolworths , which closes its last stores on 5 January , and 1,400 employees of the furniture retailer MFI , which shut last week .
The Cabinet expects job losses to accelerate in the harsh trading conditions of 2009 .
One cabinet member told The Independent : " We know there will be a bloodbath of job cuts in January and February .
A lot of companies are holding back until after Christmas . "

Contradicting saloon - bar wisdom , which says public jobs are safe , the public sector will not be immune from waves of redundancies , with unions warning of more than 5,000 planned job losses among town hall workers alone .
They could be the tip of the iceberg as councils face tough financial settlements from central government .
Oldham council is axing 543 jobs while Denbighshire council wants to cut 450 posts .
Northumberland County Council is preparing to shed 800 employees with 510 going at neighbouring Newcastle City Council .
There will be 400 staff cut in Peterborough and Aberdeen , 300 from Wolverhampton Council with a further 150 next year , up to 190 posts lost in Coventry and 100 in North Somerset .
Other councils planning redundancies include Worcester ( 84 ) , Amber Valley ( 72 ) , Swindon ( up to 50 ) and Ealing ( 40 ) .
Elsewhere in the public sector up to 2,000 mainly white - collar posts will go at Transport for London .
Seventy hospital staff in Whitehaven , Cumbria , have lost their jobs and the union Unison is warning that NHS staff could be under threat from long - term spending cuts .
Widespread redundancies are expected in the Civil Service , where union leaders fear nearly 10,000 jobs will go in courts and the prison and probation services because of cuts at the Ministry of Justice .
An estimated 3,500 more will be axed to meet efficiency savings at HM Revenue and Customs .
The number of people out of work stood at 1.86 million last month and may have already passed two million .
The Federation of Small Businesses forecasts that 30,000 small firms could fold in 2009 , with the loss of 160,000 jobs .
Its spokesman , Stephen Alambritis , said : " It will be a very , very difficult year – there 's a foreboding about February and March in particular . "
Although transport is considered a strong sector in a recession , that has not stopped National Express announcing plans to shed 300 posts .
EWS , the Doncaster - based rail freight company , is in consultation with rail union TSSA about axing 530 jobs .

Insolvency experts believe another 10 to 15 well - known retail chains could follow Woolworths into the history books as shoppers rein in spending .
Speculation is rife that the music retailer Zavvi , fashion group The Officers Club and the sportswear outlet JJB are heading for a financial crunch .
The UK's two pharmaceutical giants , GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) and AstraZeneca have flagged up big redundancies .
AstraZeneca said last month that the first of 250 manufacturing jobs will be lost next year , while GSK has said it will close two factories with as many as 620 redundancies in Dartford and 200 in Barnard Castle .
Brian Strutton , the national secretary of the GMB , reported that branches up and down the country were reporting councils planning to cut jobs in 2009 : " Reasons given go from the tightening of government grants to the credit crunch , to the Icelandic banks effect . "
Mark Serwotka , general secretary of the PCS union , which represents civil servants , said : " Budget cuts , planned when the economy was in better shape , will not only result in the Government adding to the growing unemployed , but also undermine service delivery at a time of most need . "
Already 63,000 jobs have gone in the City of London , with more redundancies coming in the financial sector .
Abbey , which is now owned by Spain 's Banco Santander , has said that it will cut 1,900 UK jobs next year with Credit Suisse and HSBC expected to lose 1,150 positions in the first quarter .
Stephen Overell , the associate director of the Work Foundation think - tank , said temporary workers and new staff had so far borne the brunt of job cuts .
But he warned : " It is going to get much worse before there is any hope of recovery . "
The town of Suifenhe , a former Russian imperial outpost on the Trans - Siberian Railway , has belonged to China since the nineteen - forties , and occupies a broad valley in northern Manchuria .
From a distance , its homes and factories appear to cling to a rail yard , with tracks fanning out into a vast latticework of iron as they emerge from the Russian border .
Suifenhe is a place of singular purpose .
Nearly every train from Russia brings in just one commodity : wood — oak , ash , linden , and other high - value species .
There is also poplar , aspen , and larch , and occasionally great trunks of Korean pine , a species that was logged by the Soviets until there was almost none left to cut down .
In a year , more than five billion pounds of wood cross over from Primorski Krai , the neighboring province in the Russian Far East .
Hundreds of railcars enter Suifenhe every day , many loaded beyond capacity with logs .
The wood is shuttled between mills by hand , often six men to a log .
Other workers , many of whom are migrants from elsewhere in China , operate cranes to empty the rail carriages , and at sundown they bring the machinery to rest , with beams pointing upward , like arms outstretched , waiting for the rush of timber that will arrive the following day .
On a warm afternoon last May , an environmental activist named Alexander von Bismarck and a man whom I will call Wu De entered Suifenhe by taxi .
They had brought with them surveillance equipment ; they were working for a nonprofit group called the Environmental Investigation Agency , which tries to uncover how plants , wildlife , and industrial chemicals are smuggled .
Von Bismarck is the organization ’s executive director , and one of the world ’s leading experts on timber smuggling .
He is thirty - six years old , trim and tall , with fiery red hair , but he possesses a quiet bearing that allows him to recede in a crowd .
( Most people know him as Sascha , but a few friends call him RoboCop , because once , while in the tropics , he insisted on jogging in hundred - degree heat . )
Wu is from Southeast Asia , but he is fluent in Mandarin Chinese .
Both men had prepared false identities , as employees of Axion Trading — one of several companies created by E.I.A. as fronts .
Chances are good that if an item sold in the United States was recently made in China using oak or ash , the wood was imported from Russia through Suifenhe .
Because as much as half of the hardwood from Primorski Krai is harvested in violation of Russian law — either by large companies working with corrupt provincial officials or by gangs of men in remote villages — it is likely that any given piece of wood in the city has been logged illegally .
This wide - scale theft empowers mafias , robs the Russian government of revenue , and assists in the destruction of one of the most precious ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere .
Lawmakers in the province have called for “ emergency measures ” to stem the flow of illegal wood , and Russia ’s Minister of Natural Resources has said that in the region “ there has emerged an entire criminal branch connected with the preparation , storage , transportation , and selling of stolen timber . ”
When von Bismarck and Wu arrived in Suifenhe , they saw traces of this immense crime — a destructive black market merging into the global economy .
This is what they had come to investigate .
John le Carré once described a spy as a “ silent spectator , ” someone who builds himself a persona from “ all the odd bits of his life that are left over after he has given the rest away . ”
When constructing his aliases , von Bismarck often draws upon his personal history .
( He has asked me not to explain which bits , so as not to ruin his cover . )
As the great - great - grandnephew of Otto von Bismarck , the Iron Chancellor , he can trace his genealogy back at least seven hundred years .
He is the grandson of Klaus von Bismarck , a German military officer who fought during the Second World War but was a staunch anti-Nazi who later became president of the Goethe - Institut .
Sascha ’s father , Gottfried , is a business executive and engineer who helped equip West German submarines with sonar .
His mother , Kai Maristed , is an American novelist — a daughter of James Abegglen , who served in the Pacific as a marine and later became a specialist on Japanese business culture and a vice - president of the Boston Consulting Group .
Sascha was born in Munich , but his parents divorced soon afterward , and , following a difficult custody battle , he split his youth between Germany and the United States .
He said , “ There was this sort of existence of going back and forth between two poles , two very different worlds , and arriving in this other camp , and loving both sides , and speaking to both sides , and becoming very aware of the hurt on both sides . ”
Von Bismarck developed a quiet manner and an unwavering earnestness .
He entered Harvard in 1990 , with an interest in biology , but he was restless and repeatedly took time off .
He tried his hand at competitive horse jumping and thought that the Olympics might be a realistic goal .
He assisted in a study of aquatic life in Lake Victoria .
He joined the Marines , hoping to become involved in military intelligence , but left after two years .
When he first learned about E.I.A. , in 1995 , from an article in a German newspaper , he immediately flew to its main office , in London , for an interview , again ready to suspend college .
( He graduated from Harvard in 2002 . )
“ The office was like a newsroom , ” he recalled .
“ Everyone was running around and screaming and taking calls . ”
At the time , E.I.A. was a little more than ten years old .
Its founders — Allan Thornton , an environmentalist from Canada ; Dave Currey , a photographer from the United Kingdom ; and Jennifer Lonsdale , a former cook — had ties to Greenpeace , and were influenced by its aggressiveness , but felt lost in its size .
Thornton had considered calling their organization the Conservation Investigation Agency , he told me , but ruled it out because the initials “ would be a never - ending joke . ”
Still , E.I.A. is sometimes mistaken for a government agency , “ which is normally not to our advantage , ” von Bismarck said .
“ Once , while going up a river in the Mosquito Coast , we tried to radio a pilot to tell him who we were : E.I.A .
He told us that listening in on those calls were drug smugglers , and he was certain they thought we were American agents trying to stop the cocaine coming through .
We had even seen cocaine floating in the lagoons . ”
Not long after he joined the organization , von Bismarck began working on campaigns designed to curtail deforestation .
Currently , a third of the world ’s landmass is forested , which may seem substantial but represents a stark historical decline .
During the past ten thousand years , the planet ’s original forest cover has decreased by nearly half .
While Rome grew , Horace wrote of the farmer who “ subdues his woodland with flames and plow . ”
In medieval China , the poet Mencius described “ bald ” landscapes — a reference to forests cleared for fuel and grazing .
In Europe and North America , deforestation occurred at a rapid pace centuries ago , but no cycle of forest loss has been as dramatic as that of the modern era .
Much of the world ’s forest cover has been destroyed in the past two centuries — since 1990 the planet lost nearly half a million square miles of forest , an area twice the size of France .
Michael Williams , an emeritus professor of geography at Oxford and the author of “ Deforesting the Earth , ” refers to the period of deforestation following the Second World War as “ the great onslaught . ”
A fifth of the world ’s wood comes from countries that have serious problems enforcing their timber laws , and most of those countries are also experiencing the fastest rates of deforestation .
Until a decade ago , many governments were reluctant to acknowledge illegal logging , largely because it was made possible by the corruption of their own officials .
As early as the nineteeneighties , the Philippines had lost the vast majority of its primary forests and billions of dollars to illegal loggers .
Papua New Guinea , during roughly the same period , experienced such catastrophic forest loss that it commissioned independent auditors to assess why it was happening ; they determined that logging companies were “ roaming the countryside with the self - assurance of robber barons ; bribing politicians and leaders , creating social disharmony and ignoring laws in order to gain access to , rip out , and export the last remnants of the province ’s valuable timber . ”
In 1998 , the Brazilian government announced that most of the country ’s logging operations were being conducted beyond the ambit of the law .
E.I.A. began to focus on illegal logging after receiving a plea for help from scientists working in the jungles of Southeast Asia .
In 1999 , Biruté Mary Galdikas , a leading expert on orangutans and an acolyte of Louis Leakey , told Thornton that men with chain saws were cutting into protected Indonesian forests where she had been conducting her research .
“ It turned out that someone had just illegally redrawn the boundary of the park so that the local timber baron could have access to the trees , ” Thornton said .
Indonesia is home to more endangered species than any other place in the world , and logging was conducted in a state of near total anarchy .
By the late nineteen - nineties , the government estimated that as much as seventy per cent of the country ’s total timber harvest was illegal , and the World Bank calculated that Indonesia was losing three and a half billion dollars annually because of it .
In a series of undercover investigations , E.I.A. and an Indonesian group called Telapak discovered that many loggers were targeting a tree called ramin , which had great strength , was easy to stain , and could be sliced into thin pieces .
Ramin turned up in the West in countless cheap items : paintbrushes , two - dollar pool cues , dowels .
Even after Indonesia banned the export of ramin , in 2001 , the wood was still smuggled out of the country in large volumes .
Von Bismarck ’s first undercover job , he told me , was “ following the ramin trail . ”
By temperament and upbringing , he seemed well suited for clandestine operations .
He once told me that his favorite book , which he had read in the fourth grade , was “ All the King ’s Men . ”
When I asked him why , he said , “ In terms of how the world works , you have people interacting in a very sensible way , and in some cases it added up to corruption , and in some cases it added up to good things .
The book presents a very complicated system , a muddled world , but also a very human world . ”
Von Bismarck ’s family life was also complicated and muddled and very human , of course , and Gottfried , his father , told me that “ as a result , I think , he has developed a great ability to integrate conflicting parties . ”
Occasionally , I heard von Bismarck speak empathetically about the very people he was trying to catch — “ poor guys doing really hard work , destroying the natural resources of their own area , and getting arrested . ”
In 2003 , von Bismarck picked up the trail in Singapore , where he went undercover and met with a trafficker who boasted that profits from black - market ramin were “ better than drug smuggling . ”
In Malaysia , he met with associates of an underworld figure known as the Ramin King , who described how the wood was given false Malaysian paperwork to obscure its origins .
In Taiwan , he secretly filmed a baby - crib manufacturer named Jim Lee , who made products that were sold at J. C. Penney , and who said that he was shipping thousands of cribs made with ramin to Wal - Mart , “ even though it is smuggled . ”
Von Bismarck presented this information to Taiwanese officials , who raided Lee ’s facilities and barred half of his stock from export .
( Lee now maintains that his wood was legal . )
Von Bismarck also contacted J. C. Penney and Wal - Mart — both took steps to remove items made of ramin from their stores — and notified American authorities , who put imports from Lee ’s factory on a watch list .
A former customs officer told me , “ He gave us the same kind of information that we would have expected from another agent .
It was amazing to us that there was somebody out there who could keep track of that sort of thing . ”
This year , some of von Bismarck ’s undercover footage — of a manufacturer in Shanghai who allegedly sold illicit ramin to American companies — helped bring about a U.S. federal indictment .
“ I suppose they ’ll expect a bailout . ”

Lee had told von Bismarck that furniture manufacturers were leaving Taiwan in large numbers for mainland China , and after his workplace was raided he opened a factory there , too .
While more and more manufacturers were moving to China , the forestproducts industry there was dramatically changing .
In 1998 , the Yangtze River watershed flooded , killing more than three thousand people and causing more than thirty billion dollars in damage .
At the time , some Communist Party officials believed that the flood was exacerbated by soil erosion — the result of “ over quota ” cutting of trees — and the government banned logging throughout much of the country .
In order to meet its immense demand for raw materials , China began to buy unprecedented quantities of wood from abroad ; it is now the largest importer of logs and also the largest exporter of finished wood products .
China began to act the way many developed countries in North America and Europe do : it had destroyed much of its primary forests , gained from doing so , and was now protecting the trees it had left by buying wood indiscriminately , often from “ high risk ” countries , like Indonesia .
The year of the flood , China started importing large volumes of wood from Russia , which has more forest than any country in the world and was in a state of political and economic anarchy .
The greatest traffic in illicit wood is now thought to be from Russia to China .
All investigations must begin with a plan , and von Bismarck had begun devising his operation in Manchuria months earlier , from an office in a small brick house near Dupont Circle , in Washington , D.C.
The workspace is crammed into three small rooms .
There are maps on the walls , reports piled on shelves , and a computer workstation to edit undercover video footage .
Eight E.I.A. campaigners , and sometimes a dog , spend most of their daytime hours there , and some late nights , too .
Their annual budget is nine hundred thousand dollars , an improvement from the organization ’s earliest form of financing : credit cards .
The most popular word in the office is probably “ leverage , ” because E.I.A. tends to use its undercover information to pressure governments and companies to change their behavior .
Von Bismarck had not been to northern China before , nor was he very familiar with Russian timber , but he knew that he wanted to frame his investigation around an American retailer that was enmeshed in the trade , and that he could leverage .
He chose Wal - Mart .
A tenth of China ’s exports to the United States are sold by Wal - Mart ; if the company were a sovereign nation , it would be China ’s eighth - largest trading partner .
“ We knew that American demand for wood was causing forest destruction , ” he told me .
“ If we could get the biggest company in the country to take note , then we thought we could make a difference . ”
He intended to chart the wood ’s journey from the Russian forest to suburban store shelves through the complicated network of Wal - Mart ’s Chinese suppliers — whose identities the company takes care to obscure .
When he was done , he planned to show the company what he had discovered or release his findings to the media .
The first step was a physical audit of every wood product that Wal - Mart sold , to try to determine its precise origin .
This was done in two stores by a twenty - eight - year - old E.I.A. campaigner named David Groves .
“ I probably put in four eight - hour days in each store , ” Groves told me .
“ I would get there around ten in the morning and not leave until six .
I ate what was in a Wal - Mart .
I sustained myself on a laughable amount of cheeseburgers . ”
Evidently , one can walk into a Wal - Mart , systematically turn boxes on end , and take notes without interference from employees .
“ I actually got a lot more customers asking me stuff than Wal - Mart staff , ” Groves told me .
The size of the task became apparent early on .
Groves began by including paper in his inventory , but soon became overwhelmed .
“ I was like , ‘ That is completely undoable , ’ ” he said .
He confined his audit to wood , and ultimately collected data on more than nine hundred products , which von Bismarck used as a blueprint for his trip .
Groves also studied two cities in China ’s far north that serve as the main gateways for the trade in wood : Manzhouli , near Siberia ; and Suifenhe .
In the nineteen - eighties , Suifenhe became a test city for what Party officials called “ socialism with Chinese characteristics ” — the gradual and controlled opening of Chinese markets .
Russians would come to the city with furs or old military - issue goods and exchange them for Chinese - made products .
The practice became known as dao bao , or “ changing bags . ”
Largely because of its proximity to Russia and its distance from the central government , Suifenhe developed an energetic and violent shadow economy .
Some Chinese “ entrepreneurs ” smuggled opium and ephedrine , which was widely available in China but forbidden in Russia .
Local mobsters flourished , and reached out to their Russian counterparts .
At times , they clashed .
Marc Mooney , an American timber trader who recently tried to conduct business in Suifenhe , told me , “ I ’ve heard stories of Chinese men going on the other side of the border and just disappearing . ”
Occasionally , they were discovered : an entrepreneur who had travelled to Russia to buy trucks ended up floating off the coast of Vladivostok with bullet wounds in his head ; two others were found fatally shot in a car that had been parked in a Russian forest .
The timber industry in Suifenhe is largely centered on “ primary processing , ” the most rudimentary type of production — cutting logs into sawn wood , for instance , which is then shipped to other cities in China for more refined manufacturing .
Von Bismarck wanted to start at the base of the Wal - Mart chain — the suppliers to the suppliers — and the most logical target was the Shanglian Group .
It belongs to Sun Laijun , who grew up in Harbin , the provincial capital , but began going to Suifenhe in 1991 , in search of opportunity .
“ The first thing I did when I arrived in Suifenhe was to look for a Russian translator , ” he recalled in an interview with CCTV .
One of his first big barter deals involved swapping twenty railway cars of urea , a chemical used in fertilizers , for apples .
In 1998 , when China ’s logging ban was enacted , he formed Suifenhe Longjiang Shanglian Import and Export Company , and became heavily involved in the timber trade .
Longjiang Shanglian now imports one out of every ten logs that enter China from Russia .
The company has been the focus of a number of environmental investigations , and has grown suspicious of strangers .
When von Bismarck and Wu , in their guise as representatives of Axion Trading , tried to arrange a meeting with Sun , a receptionist told them that he was in Russia and directed their inquiries to another executive , who asked right away if they belonged to an environmental group .
“ What groups ? ”
Wu asked , and the executive said , “ If you do n’t know what that is , then you ’re O.K . ”
A meeting was set up with Longjiang Shanglian ’s manager , Sun Laijun ’s brother Laiyong , the following afternoon .
“ To a certain extent , you have to consider security , ” Wu later told me .
“ They own half of Suifenhe , probably , and , from what we know about the timber traders all around the world — some of them can be real nasty . ”
“ Let ’s go , ” von Bismarck told Wu , and they headed into Longjiang Shanglian ’s headquarters , a gray building that towers over the city ’s factories .
Both men were wired with hidden video and audio equipment .
After presenting themselves to a security guard , they went to the third - floor office of Sun Laiyong , who was surrounded by a coterie of senior managers .
“ The whole rail yard , stretching all the way to the mountainside , belongs to our family , ” Sun Laiyong said .
The men talked about the company ’s operations in Russia , where it bought nearly all its wood .
About forty minutes into the meeting , Wu attempted to steer the discussion toward illegality .
He asked about problems that the company faced , and Sun Laiyong said , “ There are transportation costs , customs fees , mafia protection money — ”
“ Mafia protection money ? ” Wu asked .
“ Mafia protection money , and other miscellaneous costs .
Russia is very — ”
One of the managers interrupted .
“ Even the police is like the mafia , ” he said .
Sun Laiyong continued , “ Doing business in timber , you ’ll have to pay protection money to them . ”
“ So when you go to Russia — ”
“ We do n’t want to go there ! ” Sun Laiyong said .
“ We send others there instead . ”
He claimed that Chinese businesses were able to muscle out Japanese companies , which for decades have had a presence in the Russian Far East , because the business climate was “ dark , ” and often required payments made by the suitcase .
“ Small Japanese companies ca n’t buy any timber in Russia , ” Sun Laiyong said .
“ They buy it here . ”
He gestured to von Bismarck , and said , “ He will not be able to buy any timber in Russia .
We bring cash there and pay up front .
Cash trade .
Anything happens . ”
“ Millions of dollars in cash ? ” Wu asked .
“ Yes . ”
Wu asked what kinds of mafia groups Longjiang Shanglian dealt with .
“ All kinds , ” Sun Laiyong said .
He described a contract murder he had heard about that took place in 2001 , during a struggle to control Nakhodka , one of Russia ’s largest ports , on the Pacific .
“ The manager did n’t want to sell it , and a few days later he was killed , ” he said .
Sun Laiyong mentioned the mayor of Vladivostok , a crime boss known as Winnie the Pooh , who was convicted on corruption charges .
“ Vladivostok ’s mayor was caught , ” Sun Laiyong said .
“ But he was the head of the mafia . ”
After the meeting , von Bismarck and Wu got into a car and reviewed the encounter .
They had obtained evidence that Longjiang Shanglian ’s operations were enmeshed with corruption in Russia , and that Sun Laiyong regarded bribery as a mundane expense , but they had failed to learn how it affected the company ’s supply .
“ When it came to the actual logging , he said , ‘ Oh , yes , we have all the proper documents .
Otherwise , how can you log ? ’ ” Wu said .
“ So , as soon as he said that , he kind of shut the door on me . ”
Wu leaned back .
“ Ach , I ’m disappointed , ” he said .
“ Yeah ? ” von Bismarck said .
“ I should think that I did really poorly . ”
“ Do n’t say that , ” von Bismarck told him , and the two men sat in silence as the car rumbled across the uneven pavement , toward their hotel .
Sun Laiyong ’s references to organized crime pointed to one of the most disturbing aspects of the illegal timber trade : the violence that supports it .
Last December , the body of a Russian banker with close ties to the timber industry was found at the bottom of his swimming pool , near Moscow .
A bag had been pulled over his head , and his arms had been tied to his ankles .
In a sloppy attempt at a coverup , a suicide note had been left at the scene , prompting a law - enforcement official to say , “ He ’s not Harry Houdini . ”
I heard of a similar “ suicide ” not far from Vladivostok earlier this year : an activist working with the World Wildlife Fund was found at a remote hunting cabin , fatally shot , an unconvincing note by his side .
This type of violence can be found elsewhere .
Earlier this year , in Peru , a community leader who tried to report a shipment of stolen timber was shot to death in a government office .
Three years ago , in Brazil , a missionary and community organizer from Ohio , Sister Dorothy Stang , was murdered in the state of Pará , where a third of the Brazilian Amazon ’s deforestation is occurring and where she had made enemies of loggers .
In 2001 , experts with the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo coined a phrase , “ conflict timber , ” to describe how logging had become interwoven with the fighting there .
The term is apt for a number of other places .
In Burma , stolen timber helps support the junta and the rebels .
In Cambodia , it helped fund the Khmer Rouge , one of the most brutal rebel factions in history .
Charles Taylor , the former President of Liberia , distributed logging concessions to warlords and a member of the Ukrainian mafia , and the Oriental Timber Company — known in Liberia as Only Taylor Chops — conducted arms deals on his behalf .
The violence tied to Taylor ’s logging operations reached unprecedented levels , and in 2003 the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on all Liberian timber .
( China , the largest importer of Liberian timber , tried to block the sanctions . )
Shortly afterward , Taylor ’s regime collapsed .
An American official told me that the U.S. intelligence community “ absolutely put the fall of Taylor on the timber sanctions . ”
When von Bismarck discusses this type of violence , there is emotion in his voice .
He once told me that he looked up to his grandfather Klaus , who had written in his memoirs of defying an order to execute captured Soviets during the war : it “ contravened everything I had been taught and was incompatible with my conscience . ”
When Hitler ’s regime collapsed , Klaus joined Allied programs designed to erase the Nazi legacy .
Martín Escobari , von Bismarck ’s Harvard roommate , told me , “ This is something that clearly had an impact on Sascha .
He is very proud of his grandfather , who had been part of the reconstruction of Germany , making up for very evil stuff .
Sascha ’s family comes from a long history of military service .
I think he has also tried to make up for previous wrongs . ”
Not long ago , von Bismarck testified in Congress about timber smuggling and about activists who had been attacked in countries where he had gone undercover .
“ We ’re not talking about fuzzy technicalities , ” he told me .
“ We ’re talking about people getting killed , and poor people ’s livelihood stolen . ”
Some of the people had worked with E.I.A. , such as a reporter in Indonesia who had been attacked by thugs carrying machetes .
At the hearing , he said , “ We are the unwitting financiers of this crime . ”
Von Bismarck often argues that illegal logging is as much a problem of global demand as it is of supply — which is n’t necessarily obvious .
Today , the worldwide sales of forest products are worth about a trillion dollars annually , but more wood is used locally , for fuel , than is traded for industrial purposes ; in Africa , nearly ninety per cent of all wood harvested is for energy .
Moreover , many developed countries import raw timber from places that do not have substantial illegal - logging problems .
But wood can be chopped , sliced , and pulverized in countless ways , by any number of middlemen , and large quantities of stolen timber end up in the West as finished products .
The United States is the world ’s largest consumer of finished wood items .
In a year , every American uses the equivalent of seventy - two cubic feet of wood .
Despite advances in recycling and technology , the per-capita consumption of wood in the United States has risen since the mid-nineteen - sixties .
It is rising elsewhere , too .
Wood consumption in China is about fifteen times lower than it is in the United States .
For centuries , the Chinese have made paper from bamboo , rice straw , and other non-wood fibres , but the central government recently decided to push the country ’s papermaking industry away from those raw materials , because the quality was poor , and the process polluted too much water .
The authorities closed down thousands of factories , and , between 1980 and 2002 , the proportion of non-wood fibre used in Chinese papermaking fell by half .
Meanwhile , the over - all amount of paper consumed increased .
If it ever grows to the level of American consumption , then China alone would end up using double the planet ’s current paper production — if that level of demand could ever be met .
In India , too , the use of paper is expected to double by 2015 .
Improving standards of living , combined with population growth , have created a twofold pressure on forests : more people are demanding wood , and people are demanding more of it .
No one has attempted to calculate what it would cost to restrict all wood products to sustainable forests and plantations .
Murray Gell - Mann , the Nobel Prize - winning physicist , once defined sustainability as “ living on nature ’s income rather than its capital . ”
As a planet , then , if we are consuming the world ’s forest capital — and deforestation suggests that we are — everything we use that is derived from wood is undervalued .
Von Bismarck told me that an economy that structurally undervalues wood is bound to accept illegal timber without much resistance , because the excess black - market supply only reinforces the misconception that wood is cheap and the supply nearly inexhaustible .
( According to one estimate , there is enough illicit timber traded worldwide to depress global prices for wood by as much as sixteen per cent . )
The notion is reinforced by the murkiness of the timber economy .
Very few companies take the trouble to discover where the wood in their products originates .
To do so would be expensive , and consumers do n’t demand it of them .
Indifference has become the norm .
From the docks and tall buildings of Dandong , one can see , across the Yalu River , a North Korean metropolis called Sinuiju , enveloped by smog .
On the Chinese side of the border , Dandong is surrounded by hills covered in chestnut trees .
The city is home to a firm called Dandong Maisafu , China ’s largest exporter of toilet seats .
The company sends its entire stock to Wal - Mart .
Many of its toilet seats are made from oak , and von Bismarck was trying to find out where the wood came from .
An unexpected discovery by David Groves brought von Bismarck and Wu to Dandong .
Groves had been combing through an enormous customs database called PIERS , which , every day , gathers more than twenty - five thousand bills of lading from around the world .
Looking into PIERS is a bit like looking into the Matrix : there are thousands upon thousands of rows of numbers — tracking codes , shipping codes , container I.D.s.
Wal - Mart generally chooses to remove its shipments from the publicly available version of PIERS , but , by chance , the company left on the record forty thousand entries on wood imports from China — including Russian oak toilet seats from a company called Dandong Anmin .
When von Bismarck and Wu visited Anmin , they were told that it was no longer dealing with Wal - Mart .
( Later , they learned that Anmin was selling some of its products , through a middleman , on Amazon.com . )
A senior manager at Anmin referred them to Dandong Maisafu , which was run by one of the owner ’s relatives .
As the investigation progressed , von Bismarck found that this type of reshuffle was common .
“ We had been given the gift of this data , ” he told me , referring to the PIERS information .
“ But then we found there was an added challenge : the turnover in Wal - Mart suppliers .
It was the ‘ Wal - Mart phenomenon ’ that we were bumping into , the phenomenon of leveraging suppliers by dumping them at a high frequency . ”
He and Wu would encounter factory owners who had just shipped Wal - Mart goods made with Russian wood but could or would no longer settle for Wal - Mart ’s price .
“ That made our investigation difficult , but it also made it difficult for Wal - Mart to get reliable wood , ” he said .
“ It created incentives for suppliers to get bad wood . ”
Von Bismarck and Wu called the offices of Dandong Maisafu , again posing as commodities traders , and met with Chunshou Zhuo , a garrulous , potbellied man in his late fifties , who wore a plaid shirt , jeans , and a trucker ’s cap .
Zhuo said that he owned Maisafu with his daughter , and that they entered the toilet - seat business about eight years ago .
His company made two million dollars a month , and exported furniture made from oak and other species to Wal - Mart .
When
Wu asked where the oak came from , Zhuo said that it was Chinese — “ from here , in the mountains ” — but Wu learned from a Maisafu floor manager that some of the toilet seats were made from Russian timber .
Zhuo ’s daughter later confirmed that the company used Russian hardwood for about a fifth of its products .
Roger Clemens ’ denials of performance - enhancing drug use to Congress will be examined by a federal grand jury , according to reports , leaving the seven - time Cy Young Award - winning pitcher under the cloud of a possible indictment and prison time if it is proved he lied .
Clemens , 46 , has denied statements made in baseball ’s 2007 Mitchell Report by his former trainer Brian McNamee , who claimed he injected the pitcher with steroids and human growth hormone during Clemens ’ playing days .
Clemens called a news conference to label McNamee ’s claims as lies , then appeared before a House subcommittee with McNamee in February to again say , under oath , that he was clean .
“ Let me be clear , ” Clemens told committee members .
“ I have never taken steroids or HGH . ”
Lying to Congress is a federal crime that could lead to prison time if Clemens is indicted and convicted .

McNamee ’s attorney , Earl Ward , said his client has not received a subpoena , but that grand jury involvement would represent “ an opportunity for vindication . ”
Clemens sued McNamee for defamation after the trainer made a deal with federal law enforcement authorities to avoid steroid distribution charges by disclosing truthful information to federal agents .
He also agreed to cooperate with Mitchell investigators .
ESPN.com was first to report that a federal grand jury in Washington had been convened , with witnesses being subpoenaed to provide testimony as soon as this week and evidence presented by U.S. Atty .
Daniel P. Butler .
The Associated Press later reported that two people briefed on the matter confirmed the investigation .
The sources declined to be identified , the AP reported , because proceedings are supposed to be secret .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney ’s office in Washington said that Butler was declining to comment and that the office would have “ no comment on pending matters . ”
“ We do n’t know anything about this , but it is no surprise , ” Clemens ’ lead lawyer , Rusty Hardin , told the AP through spokesman Patrick Dorton .
“ It ’s part of what a prosecutor does . ”
Advertisement
It ’s been nearly a year since Congress responded to Clemens ’ denials of performance - enhancing drug use by holding a hearing , with both the pitcher and McNamee taking the stand under oath .
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) said at the start of the hearing that Clemens had made statements in a deposition “ we know are untrue , ” and Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Virginia ) commented , “ Someone is lying in spectacular fashion . ”
Two weeks after Clemens ’ testimony , Waxman released a memo outlining seven assertions made by the pitcher that were contrary to other evidence .
Congress asked the Justice Department to explore if Clemens had lied under oath .
“ Convening a grand jury is the next logical step to what I ’ve perceived as clear misstatements , ” said Katherine Darmer , a Chapman University law professor and former federal prosecutor .
“ I would not be surprised at all to see an indictment come out of this . ”
Clemens had come across as eager to testify , dispute McNamee ’s claims and save a tarnished image .
Darmer said that strategy clearly backfired .
Advertisement
“ It ’s one thing to be called , another to get up there and so clearly lie , ” she said .
“ He should be held accountable for wasting the time of several members of Congress , who had better things to do . ”
The fallout might keep Clemens from the Hall of Fame .
On Monday , retired slugger Mark McGwire , stained by steroid allegations , received 21 % of Hall of Fame votes , when 75 % are required for entry .
Others who could be summoned for testimony are drug supplier and former New York Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski , investigators who worked for former Sen.
George Mitchell ’s 2007 report and Clemens ’ former teammate Andy Pettitte , who claimed in a sworn deposition that Clemens had admitted to HGH use .
Contacted by The Times , Radomski had no comment , though the New York Times reported Monday that he had been subpoenaed .
Radomski has reportedly given investigators an overnight - shipping receipt for a package of HGH he sent to Clemens ’ Houston home , and McNamee turned over needles and bloody gauze pads he claims were used in Clemens ’ injections .
Advertisement
The investigation could pose an interesting ethics puzzle for President - elect Barack Obama ’s incoming team at the Justice Department .
Lanny Breuer , a lawyer hired by Clemens last year , is expected to be announced as Obama ’s choice to lead the department ’s criminal division .

A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
This week , we ’re happy to have Jonathan Conway from UK .
Satish Talim >>
Welcome , Jonathan and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Jonathan >>
It all started when I was bitten by a radioactive Commodore Vic 20 at the age of six .
Apart from suddenly having the ability to keep still for long periods of time while staring at a screen .
I found that I had a sudden love of power for the ability to control this Ê»micro
computerÊ¼ with programming .
I first started programming commercially as a freelancer in the mid 90 Ê ¼s doing BBS intros in Assembler and some applications in C before going on to University .
At some point while I was there I learned Java which is what I did for the most part for several years .
IÊ¼d done everything from large dot com e-commerce sites on the web to real - time financial trading applications on J2ME enabled devices , but deep down I was nÊ¼t happy .
It all seemed like so much work for so little return .
Being young it didnÊ¼t seem to matter so much as time was something I had plenty of until I got married and had my first child .
Around this time I was working as a technical architect for a company in the City , we had a small team and I was adamant that there was a better way to deliver software in shorter time scales beyond just Agile methods .
During late 2004 IÊ¼d already been using Ruby for server administration .
DHH presentation at some university was making the rounds and I realized that I could use Ruby for more than server administration .
Anyway to cut a long story short I re-signed from my job and setup the UKÊ¼s first Ruby on Rails consultancy called Agile Evolved ( yeh , I know cheesy name ) , grew the company with some very talented employees before merging with New Bamboo in early 2007 .
I stayed as the technical director for a bit before getting snapped up by a start up where I currently work called vzaar Yep that Ê¼s a small Ê » vÊ¼ , weÊ¼re that 2.0 ; ) .
Keith Brady , Australia >>
What are the pros and cons of Ruby that are being discussed in the development community and what is your opinion on that ?
Jonathan >>
For proÊ¼s for the Ruby language I think the first thing people notice is the amount of flexibility and power it gives you .
This can be quite scary / dangerous for some people as they Ê¼re so used to languages like Java / C# constraining them and Ê » keeping them safeÊ¼ .
But for a talented developer this can be incredibly liberating .
Another pro of Ruby would have to be Ruby gems .
After spending too long in languages where I had to physically go off , hunt down and install a library in my path , having the use of Ruby gems was a instant win for productivity for me .
For conÊ¼s of the language ?
Well to be honest unless you Ê¼re trying to use Ruby like a golden hammer I can Ê¼t think of any that come to mind .
I always encourage all developers to be skilled at more than one language and embrace other paradigms found in them .
It Ê¼s always about using the right tool for the job .
Jerry Anning , USA >>
What best practices are most important for a new Ruby programmer to learn and understand ?
Jonathan >>
With regards to best practices in Ruby the first thing would be to embrace the languages flexibility and dynamicness and forget what they thought was OO .
When I first came to Ruby I brought with me all kinds of stupid Java baggage such as trying to create Abstract classes etc .
Unless you Ê¼re coming from another language such as Smalltalk then chances are that your previous staple language was nÊ¼t as pure from an OO stand point as Ruby is .
And I know IÊ¼m gonna start a flame war and sound elitist with some people but seeing PHP developers call their PHP 5 code Object Orientated just makes me chuckle .
It Ê¼s not their fault most of the time as they Ê¼re just doing the best they can with the object model they Ê¼ve been given .
But seeing quite a few ex PHP devÊ¼s creating Frankensteins of pseudo OO Ruby code makes me realize how important that new beginners have a clear foundation of the fundamentals of good Object Orientated design .
Jerry Anning , USA >>
Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby , including different frameworks , gems and external libraries ?
Jonathan >>
My personal favorite libraries to look at for clever yet clean and understandable code would be the following :
Thinking Sphinx by Pat Allan .
It Ê¼s very well written and easy to jump into if you need to change it for your own purposes .
Datamapper by Sam Smoot .
A very nicely abstracted ORM that gives you great flexibility .
Ramaze by lots of very smart people .
Although I use Merb for my everyday tasks I have to tip my hat to Ramaze .
Very thorough test suite , advanced use of Ruby yet very easy to understand .
Victor Goff , USA >>
How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place , and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work ?
Do you see trends in administration or other work ?
Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby ?
Jonathan >>
The market for Ruby programmers I feel will only get stronger .
However one of the common traits of a Ruby developer is that they prefer to work freelance .
This has made it considerably harder for companies to hire full time people .
Not only that but IÊ¼ve come across quite a few freelancers who have difficulty with the concepts of basic OO let alone good Ruby practices and yet have no qualms with charging the market rates for top end developers .
I feel something will inevitably has to change in the future so as not to tarnish the reputation of Ruby developers and keep a healthy ecosystem of Ruby jobs alive .
Another thing is that hiring companies need to be smarter and go beyond the usual academic / paper skills when seeking out new talent .
IÊ¼ve been lucky to snap up incredibly talented people in the past who have been turned down by other larger companies .
This is because unfortunately a lot of companies interviewing processes are either amateurish or outdated at best .
My personal interviewing technique is based upon psychology and technical ability designed to make the interviewee as relaxed as possible so that I can see their true abilities / potential and more importantly how they Ê¼ll interact with others at work in a social environment .
Remember a good team dynamic is crucial to successful delivery of projects .
Seeing what Jamie Van Dyke is doing at Parfa .
it with regards to recruiting for clients I think is definitely going in the right direction to solve some of the problems IÊ¼ve outlined above .
Woah , I kind of side tracked there but to keep on target I definitely see inroads into server / cloud administration with Ruby .
The languages readability coupled with libraries like Puppet , Capistrano / Vlad , Thor , Vertebra and others make Ruby an Ops guys dream come true .
Satish Talim >>
What can / should job candidates ( for Ruby ) do to distinguish themselves from their competition ?
Note :
The candidate has done his / her homework on the company that they are interviewing with .
The candidate understands what they ’re looking for , and the candidate is prepared to show them that he / she fits the bill , based on the candidate ’s skills and experience .
What else can the candidate do , to set themselves apart from other equally well - qualified and well - prepared candidates ?
Jonathan >>
I think the number one thing that everyone will tell you makes potential candidates stand out is contributions to Open Source .
Preferably one with a good test suite , but that Ê¼s my personal bias .
The other thing is to spend time on personal projects .
Even if they Ê¼re not Open Source , the ability to demonstrate your skills across a wide range of areas from the front to the back end in a web development context is priceless .
If you Ê¼re going for an OpÊ¼s job then writing a library for administering a cloud should increase your chances by a magnitude .
Hopefully if the person interviewing you is smart and not doing the outdated cookie cutter style interviewing technique then you Ê¼ll definitely be in their top ten .

The Path to Ruby Mastery Series ( So Far ) :
Java 's new math , Part 2
Floating - point numbers
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series : Java 's new math , Part 2 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
This content is part of the series : Java 's new math , Part 2 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
Version 5 of the Java™ Language Specification added 10 new methods to java.lang .
Math and java.lang .
StrictMath , and Java 6 added another 10 .
Part 1 of this two - article series looked at the new methods that make sense mathematically .
That is , they provide functions that a pre-computer - era mathematician would find familiar .
Here in Part 2 , I focus on the functions that make sense only when you realize that they 're designed for operating on floating - point numbers instead of abstract real numbers .
As I noted in Part 1 , the distinction between a real number such as e or 0.2 and its computer representation such as a Java double is an important one .
The Platonic ideal of the number is infinitely precise , whereas the Java representation has only a fixed number of bits ( 32 for a float , 64 for a double ) to work with .
The maximum value of a float is about 3.4*1038 , which is n't large enough for some things you might wish to represent , such as the number of electrons in the universe .
A double can represent numbers up to about 1.8*10308 , which covers almost any physical quantity I can think of .
However , when you do calculations on abstract mathematical quantities , it is possible to exceed these values .
For instance , a mere 171 !
( 171 * 170 * 169 * 168 * ... * 1 ) is sufficient to exceed the bounds of a double .
A float goes out of bounds at a mere 35 !.
Small numbers ( that is , numbers close to zero ) can also be problematic , and calculations that involve both large and small numbers can be positively dangerous .
To work around this , the IEEE 754 standard for floating - point math ( see Related topics ) adds the special values Inf to represent Infinity and NaN to represent " Not a Number . "
IEEE 754 also defines both positive and negative zeros .
( In regular math , zero is neither positive nor negative .
In computer math , it can be either . )
These values play havoc with classical proofs .
For instance , when NaN is in play , the law of the excluded middle no longer holds .
It is not necessarily true that either x == y or x != y.
Both can be false if x ( or y ) is NaN .
Beyond issues of magnitude , precision is an even more practical problem .
We 've all seen a loop like this one where you add 0.1 one hundred times and end up with 9.99999999999998 instead of 10 :
for ( double x = 0.0 ; x <= 10.0 ; x += 0.1 ) { System.err.println(x ) ; }
For simple applications , you usually just ask java .
text .
DecimalFormat to format the final output as the nearest integer , and call it a day .
However , in scientific and engineering applications where you 're not sure if the calculation will land on an integer , you need to be a lot more careful .
If you 're subtracting large numbers from each other to get a small number , you need to be very careful .
If you 're dividing by that small number , you need to be more careful still .
Such operations can dramatically amplify even tiny errors into large mistakes that have noticeable consequences when the answers are applied in the physical world .
Mathematically precise calculations can be thrown severely askew by small round - off errors caused by finite - precision floating - point numbers .
Binary representations of floats and doubles
An IEEE 754 float , as implemented by the Java language , has 32 bits .
The first bit is the sign bit , 0 for positive and 1 for negative .
The next eight bits are the exponent and can hold a value from - 125 to +127 .
The final 23 bits hold the mantissa ( sometimes called the significand ) , which ranges from 0 to 33,554,431 .
Putting these together , a float is interpreted as sign * mantissa * 2 exponent .
Observant readers may notice that these numbers do n't quite add up .
First , eight bits for the exponent should represent - 128 to 127 , just like a signed byte .
However the exponents are biased by 126 .
That is , you start with the unsigned value ( 0 to 255 ) and then subtract 126 to get the true exponent , which is now - 126 to 128 .
Well , except that 128 and - 126 are special values .
When the exponent is all 1 - bits ( 128 ) , that 's a signal that the number is either Inf , - Inf , or NaN .
To figure out which , you have to look at the mantissa .
When the exponent is all zero bits ( - 126 ) , that 's a signal that the number is denormalized ( more on what that means shortly ) but the exponent is still - 125 .
The mantissa is basically a 23 - bit unsigned integer — simple enough .
Twenty - three bits can hold a number from 0 to 224 - 1 , which is 16,777,215 .
Wait a minute , did n't I say that the mantissa ranged from 0 to 33,554,431 ?
That 's 225 - 1 .
Where 'd the extra bit come from ?
It turns out that you can use the exponent to tell what the first bit is .
If the exponent is all zero bits , then the first bit is zero .
Otherwise , the first bit is one .
Because you always know what the first bit is , it does n't have to be included in the number .
You get an extra bit for free .
Pretty sneaky , huh ?
Floating - point numbers for which the first bit of the mantissa is one are normalized .
That is , the mantissa always has a value between 1 and 2 .
Floating - point numbers for which the first bit of the mantissa is zero are denormalized and enable much smaller numbers to be represented , even though the exponent is always - 125 .
Doubles are encoded in much the same way except that they use a 52 - bit mantissa and an 11 - bit exponent for higher precision .
The bias for a double 's exponent is 1023 .
Mantissas and exponents
The two getExponent ( ) methods added in Java 6 return the unbiased exponent used in the representation of the float or double .
This is a number between - 125 to +127 for floats and - 1022 and +1023 for doubles ( +128/+1024 for Inf and NaN ) .
For example , Listing 1 compares the results of the getExponent ( ) method to a more classic base 2 logarithm :
Listing 1 . Math.log(x ) /Math.log ( 2 ) vs. Math.getExponent ( )
public class ExponentTest { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { System.out.println ( " x\tlg(x ) \tMath.getExponent(x ) " ) ; for ( int i = - 255 ; i < 256 ; i++) { double x = Math.pow ( 2 , i ) ; System.out.println ( x + " \t " + lg( x ) + " \t " + Math.getExponent(x ) ) ; } } public static double lg( double x ) { return Math.log(x ) / Math.log ( 2 ) ; } }
For a few values where round - off comes into play , Math.getExponent ( ) can be a bit or two more accurate than the usual calculation :
x lg( x ) Math.getExponent(x ) ...
2.68435456E8 28.0 28 5.36870912E8 29.000000000000004 29 1.073741824E9 30.0 30 2.147483648E9 31.000000000000004 31 4.294967296E9 32.0 32
Math.getExponent( ) may also be faster if you 're doing a lot of these calculations .
However , the caveat is that this only works for powers of two .
For example , here 's the output if I change to powers of three :
x lg( x ) Math.getExponent(x ) ... 1.0 0.0 0 3.0 1.584962500721156 1 9.0 3.1699250014423126 3 27.0 4.754887502163469 4 81.0 6.339850002884625 6
The mantissa is not considered by getExponent ( ) but is considered by Math.log ( ) .
With some effort , you could separately find the mantissa , take its log , and add that value to the exponent , but that 's hardly worth the effort .
Math.getExponent( ) is primarily useful when you want a quick estimate of an order of magnitude , not an exact value .
Unlike Math.log ( ) , Math.getExponent ( ) never returns NaN or Inf .
If the argument is NaN or Inf , then the result will be 128 for a float and 1024 for a double .
If the argument is zero , then the result will be - 127 for a float and - 1023 for a double .
If the argument is a negative number , then the exponent is the same as the exponent of the absolute value of that number .
For instance , the exponent of - 8 is 3 , just like the exponent of 8 .
There 's no corresponding getMantissa ( ) method , but it 's easy enough to derive one with a little algebra :
public static double getMantissa ( double x ) { int exponent = Math.getExponent(x ) ; return x / Math.pow ( 2 , exponent ) ; }
The mantissa can also be found through bit masking , though the algorithm is far less obvious .
To extract the bits , you only need to calculate Double.doubleToLongBits ( x ) & 0x000 FFFFFFFFFFFFFL .
However , you then need to account for the extra 1 - bit in a normalized number , and then convert back to a floating - point number between 1 and 2 .
Units of last precision
Real numbers are infinitely dense .
There 's no such thing as a next real number .
For any two distinct real numbers you name , I can name another one in between them .
The same is not true for floating - point numbers .
Given one float or double , there is a next float ; and there is a minimum finite distance between successive floats and doubles .
The nextUp ( ) method returns the nearest floating - point number greater than the first argument .
For example , Listing 2 prints all the floats between 1.0 and 2.0 inclusive :
Listing 2 . Counting the floats
public class FloatCounter { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { float x = 1.0 F ; int numFloats = 0 ; while ( x <= 2.0 ) { numFloats ++; System.out.println(x ) ; x = Math.nextUp(x ) ; } System.out.println(numFloats ) ; } }
It turns out there are exactly 8,388,609 floats between 1.0 and 2.0 inclusive ; large but hardly the uncountable infinity of real numbers that exist in this range .
Successive numbers are about 0.0000001 apart .
This distance is called an ULP for unit of least precision or unit in the last place .
If you need to go backwards — that is , find the nearest floating - point number less than a specified number — you can use the nextAfter ( ) method instead .
The second argument specifies whether to find the nearest number above or below the first argument :
public static double nextAfter ( float start , float direction ) public static double nextAfter ( double start , double direction )
If direction is greater than start , then nextAfter ( ) returns the next number above start .
If direction is less than start , nextAfter ( ) returns the next number below start .
If direction equals start , nextAfter ( ) returns start itself .
These methods can be useful in certain modeling and graphing applications .
Numerically , you might want to sample a value at 10,000 positions between a and b , but if you 're getting only enough precision to identify 1,000 unique points between a and b , then you 're doing redundant work nine times out of ten .
You can do a tenth of the work , and get results that are just as good .
Of course , if you really do need the extra precision , then you 'll need to pick a data type with more precision , such as a double or a BigDecimal .
For instance , I 've seen this come up in Mandelbrot set explorers where you can zoom in so far that the entire graph falls between the nearest two doubles .
The Mandelbrot set is infinitely deep and complex at all scales , but a float or a double can go only so deep before losing the ability to distinguish adjacent points .
The Math.ulp ( ) method returns the distance from a number to its nearest neighbors .
Listing 3 lists the ULPs for various powers of two :
Listing 3 . ULPs of powers of two for a float
public class UlpPrinter { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { for ( float x = 1.0 f ; x <= Float .
MAX_VALUE ; x *= 2.0f ) { System.out.println(Math.getExponent(x ) + " \t " + x + " \t " + Math.ulp( x ) ) ; } } }
Here 's some of the output :
0 1.0 1.1920929E-7 1 2.0 2.3841858E-7 2 4.0 4.7683716E-7 3 8.0 9.536743E-7 4 16.0 1.9073486E -6 ... 20 1048576.0 0.125 21 2097152.0 0.25 22 4194304.0 0.5 23 8388608.0 1.0 24 1.6777216E7 2.0 25 3.3554432E7 4.0 ... 125 4.2535296E37 5.0706024E30 126 8.507059E37 1.0141205E31 127 1.7014118E38 2.028241E31
The finite precision of floating - point numbers has one unexpected consequence : past a certain point x+1 == x is true .
For instance , this apparently simple loop is in fact infinite :
for ( float x = 16777213 f ; x < 16777218 f ; x += 1.0f ) { System.out.println(x ) ; }
In fact , this loop gets stuck at a fixed point at precisely 16,777,216 .
That 's 224 , and the point at which the ULP is now larger than the increment .
As you can see , floats are pretty accurate for small powers of two .
However , the accuracy becomes problematic for many applications by around 220 .
Near the limit of magnitude for a float , successive values are separated by sextillions ( in fact , quite a bit more , but I could n't find a word that means anything that high ) .
As Listing 3 demonstrates , the size of an ULP is not constant .
As numbers get larger , there are fewer floats between them .
For instance , there are only 1,025 floats between 10,000 and 10,001 ; and they 're 0.001 apart .
Between 1,000,000 and 1,000,001 there are only 17 floats , and they 're about 0.05 apart .
Accuracy is anticorrelated with magnitude .
For a float at 10,000,000 , the ULP has actually grown to 1.0 , and past that there are multiple integral values that map to the same float .
For a double this does n't happen until about 45 quadrillion ( 4.5E15 ) , but it 's still a concern .
The Math.ulp ( ) method has a practical use in testing .
As you undoubtedly know , you should usually not compare floating - point numbers for exact equality .
Instead , you check that they are equal within a certain tolerance .
For example , in JUnit you compare expected to actual floating - point values like so :
assertEquals ( expectedValue , actualValue , 0.02 ) ;
This asserts that the actual value is within 0.02 of the expected value .
However is 0.02 a reasonable tolerance ?
If the expected value is 10.5 or - 107.82 , then 0.02 is probably fine .
However , if the expected value is several billion , then the 0.02 may be completely indistinguishable from zero .
Often what you should test is the relative error in terms of ULPs .
Depending on how much accuracy the calculation requires , you usually select a tolerance somewhere between 1 and 10 ULPs .
For example , here I specify that the actual result needs to be within 5 ULPs of the true value :
assertEquals( expectedValue , actualValue , 5 * Math.ulp ( expectedValue ) ) ;
Depending on what the expected value is , that could be trillionths or it could be millions .
scalb
Math.scalb(x , y ) multiplies x by 2y ( scalb is an abbreviation for " scale binary " ) .
public static double scalb ( float f , int scaleFactor ) public static double scalb ( double d , int scaleFactor )
For example , Math.scalb ( 3 , 4 ) returns 3 * 24 , which is 3*16 , which is 48.0 .
You could use Math.scalb ( ) in an alternate implementation of getMantissa ( ) :
public static double getMantissa ( double x ) { int exponent = Math.getExponent(x ) ; return x / Math.scalb( 1.0 , exponent ) ; }
How does Math.scalb ( ) differ from x*Math.pow ( 2 , scaleFactor ) ?
In fact , the ultimate result does n't differ .
I was unable to contrive any inputs where the return value was even a single bit different .
However , the performance is worth a second look .
Math.pow ( ) is a notorious performance killer .
It needs to be able to handle really weird cases like raising 3.14 to the - 0.078 power .
It usually chooses completely the wrong algorithm for small integral powers like two and three , or for special cases like a base of two .
As with any other general performance claim , I have to be very tentative about this .
Some compilers and VMs are smarter than others .
Some optimizers may recognize x*Math.pow ( 2 , y ) as a special case and convert it into Math.scalb( x , y ) or into something very close to that .
Thus there may be no performance difference at all .
However , I have verified that at least some VMs are not that clever .
When testing with Apple 's Java 6 VM , for example , Math.scalb ( ) was reproducibly two orders of magnitude faster than x*Math.pow ( 2 , y ) .
Of course , usually this is not going to matter in the slightest .
However , in those rare cases where you are doing many millions of exponentiations , you may want to think about whether you can convert them to use Math.scalb ( ) instead .
Copysign
The Math.copySign ( ) method sets the sign of the first argument to the sign of the second argument .
A naive implementation might look like Listing 4 :
Listing 4 . A possible copysign algorithm
public static double copySign ( double magnitude , double sign ) { if ( magnitude == 0.0 ) return 0.0 ; else if ( sign < 0 ) { if ( magnitude < 0 ) return magnitude ; else return - magnitude ; } else if ( sign > 0 ) { if ( magnitude < 0 ) return - magnitude ; else return magnitude ; } return magnitude ; }
However , the real implementation looks like Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . The real algorithm from sun.misc .
FpUtils
public static double rawCopySign ( double magnitude , double sign ) { return Double.longBitsToDouble (( Double.doubleToRawLongBits( sign ) & ( DoubleConsts .SIGN_BIT_MASK ) ) | ( Double.doubleToRawLongBits( magnitude ) & ( DoubleConsts.EXP_BIT_MASK | DoubleConsts.SIGNIF_BIT_MASK ) ) ) ; }
If you think about this carefully and draw out the bits , you 'll see that NaN signs are treated as positive .
Technically , Math.copySign ( ) does n't promise that — only StrictMath.copySign ( ) does — but in practice , they both invoke the same bit - twiddling code .
Listing 5 may perhaps be marginally faster than Listing 4 , but its main raison d'être is to handle negative zero properly .
Math.copySign ( 10 , - 0.0 ) returns - 10 , whereas Math.copySign ( 10 , 0.0 ) returns 10.0 .
The naive algorithm in Listing 4 returns 10.0 in both cases .
Negative zero can arise when you perform sensitive operations such as dividing an extremely small negative double by an extremely large positive double .
For instance , - 1.0E - 147/2.1E189 returns negative zero , whereas 1.0E - 147/2.1E189 returns positive zero .
However , these two values compare equal with == so if you want to distinguish between them , you need to use Math.copySign ( 10 , - 0.0 ) or Math.signum ( ) ( which calls Math.copySign ( 10 , - 0.0 ) ) to compare them .
Logarithms and exponentials
The exponential function serves as a good example of how careful you have to be when dealing with limited - precision floating - point numbers instead of infinitely precise real numbers .
ex ( Math.exp ( ) ) shows up in a lot of equations .
For example , it 's used to define the cosh function as discussed in Part 1 :
cosh (x ) = ( ex + e - x ) /2 .
However , for negative values of x , roughly - 4 and lower , the algorithm used to calculate Math.exp ( ) is relatively ill - behaved and subject to round - off error .
It 's more accurate to calculate ex - 1 with a different algorithm and then add 1 to the final result .
The Math.expm1 ( ) method implements this different algorithm .
( The m1 stands for " minus 1 . " )
For example , Listing 6 demonstrates a cosh function that switches between the two algorithms depending on the size of x :
Listing 6 . A cosh function
public static double cosh ( double x ) { if ( x < 0 ) x = - x ; double term1 = Math.exp ( x ) ; double term2 = Math.expm1(-x ) + 1 ; return ( term1 + term2 ) /2 ; }
This example is somewhat academic because the ex term will completely dominate the e-x term in any case where the difference between Math.exp ( ) and Math.expm1 ( ) + 1 is significant .
However . Math.expm1 ( ) is quite practical in financial calculations with small amounts of interest , such as the daily rate on a Treasury bill .
Math.log1p ( ) is the inverse of Math.expm1 ( ) , just as Math.log ( ) is the inverse of Math.exp ( ) .
It calculates the logarithm of 1 plus its argument .
( The 1 p stands for " plus 1 . " )
Use this for values close to 1 .
For instance , instead of calculating Math.log ( 1.0002 ) , you should calculate Math.log1 p ( 0.0002 ) .
As an example , suppose you want to know the number of days required for $ 1,000 invested to grow to $ 1,100 at a daily interest rate of 0.03 .
Listing 7 would do this :
Listing 7 .
Find the number of periods needed to achieve a specified future value from a current investment
public static double calculateNumberOfPeriods ( double presentValue , double futureValue , double rate ) { return ( Math.log( futureValue ) - Math.log( presentValue ) ) /Math.log1 p( rate ) ; }
In this case , the 1p has a very natural interpretation , since 1+r shows up in the usual formulas for calculating these things .
In other words , lenders usually quote interest rates as the additional percent ( the +r part ) even though investors certainly hope to get back ( 1+r ) n of their initial investment .
Indeed , any investor who loans money at 3 percent and ends up with only 3 percent of the investment back would be doing poorly indeed .
Doubles are n't real numbers
Floating - point numbers are not real numbers .
There are a finite number of them .
There are maximum and minimum values they can represent .
Most important , they have limited , though large , precision and are subject to round - off error .
Indeed , when working with integers , floats and doubles can have decidedly worse accuracy than ints and longs .
You should carefully consider these limitations to produce robust , reliable code , particularly in scientific and engineering applications .
Financial applications ( and especially accounting applications that require accuracy to the last cent ) also need to be exceedingly careful when manipulating floats and doubles .
The java.lang .
Math and java.lang .
StrictMath classes have been carefully designed to address these issues .
Proper use of these classes and their methods will improve your programs .
If nothing else , this article should have shown you just how tricky good floating - point arithmetic really is .
It 's better to delegate to the experts where you can rather than roll your own algorithms .
If you can use the methods of java.lang .
Math and java.lang .
StrictMath , do so .
They 're almost always the better choice .

The world sure has a lot of problems and these are just a few .
None of them , however , measure up to what the U.N. General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto termed the " single greatest failure " of the U.N. - the failure to create a Palestinian state .
D'Escoto went on to accuse Israel of apartheid and called for sanctions and a boycott of Israel as was done to apartheid South Africa .
D'Escoto's speech came during the first day of a two day session in which the day the U.N. celebrated its International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People .
The Palestinian solidarity day is officially November 29 in commemoration and mourning of the day the U.N. voted for the establishment of the State of Israel .
The organization Eye on the UN reported that the U.N. was to hold an exhibit in its lobby with an entrance sign stating , " The Palestinians : 60 years of Struggle and Enduring Hope . "
( The 2005 Solidarity day included a map of Israel with a Palestinian Flag . )
The General Assembly President 's speech and the Solidarity Day commemoration exemplify perhaps all that is wrong with the world today :
It simply does not matter to the community of nations -
That there are so many greater humanitarian crises that need immediate international attention ;
That until the Jews returned to Palestine , the Land was relatively desolate , comprised of desert and swamp ;
That neighboring Arab states have refused to absorb Palestinian - Arab refugees and have waged continuous war on Israel since its inception ;
That Israel has repeatedly made peaceful gestures to Palestinian - Arabs and in doing so knowingly jeopardized its own security in the form of prisoner releases , withdrawals , expulsion of its own citizens , providing the Palestinian - Arabs with weapons , money and infrastructure and yet Palestinian - Arabs have responded only with terror ;
That Palestinian - Arab society is producing a Jew - hatred that threatens to overshadow the Jew - hatred of the Nazis ;
That the Palestinian - Arab claim to a separate Palestinian state goes back only fifty years , may actually be in decline , and is too young to constitute a valid national claim to territory or political independence ; and
That the Kingdom of Jordan is a second state in Palestine , [ 1 ] sits on land that was part of the ancestral Jewish state and is at least twice the size of the modern Jewish state .
The facts , the justness of the parties ' claims , the history , none of these things matter .
The only thing that does matter for the U.N. and the skewed world it represents is that the Israel must make more concessions to appease Arab demands .
The concession here is the creation of a Palestinian state , which will be used to terrorize Israel , ethnically cleanse the region of any significant Jewish presence and thus put an end to " the 60 years of struggle " that began with Israel 's creation .
But the blame for the rise of Palestinian - statism cannot be solely laid at the feet of the United Nations .
This is because the state with the primary interest in combating this movement , Israel , has itself placed the idea of a Palestinian state on a pedestal .
Though the Oslo Agreements and Ehud Barak 's generous offer in 2000 to give Yassir Arafat almost all of the disputed territories of Judea , Samaria ( the " West Bank " ) and all of Gaza resulted only in Palestinian terror , even Israel 's most hawkish figures persisted in worshipping the golden calf of appeasement .
In May 2003 , Prime Minister Ariel Sharon endorsed the 2002 Road Map , which called for the creation of a Palestinian state by 2005 , and carried out the Disengagement from Gaza in 2005 in accordance with the Road Map .
Following Sharon 's incapacitation , the next Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , worked from the beginning of his tenure to promote the " Convergence , " which would effectively create a Palestinian state by unilaterally withdrawing from Judea and Samaria and expelling the Jewish residents therein .
When his popularity dropped , Olmert abandoned the plan , quickly replacing it with traditional bilateral negotiations for the creation of a Palestinian state .
Olmert 's calls for Israeli concessions have only become more routine since he handed in his resignation .
Over the years , Israel has simply decided to give up fighting against the current .
As a senior Israeli diplomat told the Jerusalem Post , Israel 's attitude toward the Solidarity Day - and by implication the question of a Palestinian state - is that it is a battle which Israel " simply can't win . "
Of course , the United States , Israel 's closest ally , shoulders much of the burden as well .
As early as 2001 , U.S. President George W. Bush became the first Republican president to endorse a Palestinian state when he said that " the idea of a Palestinian state has always been part of a vision . "
In 2002 , despite his campaign declarations that he would n't set timetables for peace , Bush signed the Road Map , which as mentioned called for establishment of a Palestinian state by 2005 .
Later , Bush characterized Sharon 's 2005 Gaza Disengagement plan " as an opportunity for a Palestinian state which is peaceful to begin to grow . . . . "
In January of this year , Bush persisted in pushing his " vision " of a Palestinian state .
In a trip to Israel , the President predicted that Israel and the Palestinian Authority would conclude final peace agreements by January 2009 .
In complete ignorance of Israel 's mission to facilitate the return of the Jewish people to Judea and to serve as a haven for a people persecuted for 2000 years , Bush added that the final " agreement must establish Palestine as a homeland for the Palestinian people , just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people . "
It is particularly telling that as the U.N. celebrated its Palestine day and called for the creation of a Palestinian state , Olmert and Bush met for the final time the two leaders would be in office and touted their commitment to a Palestinian state .
And this trend will only continue with the upcoming inauguration of Barak Obama , who in June told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that " the Palestinians need a state that is contiguous and cohesive and that allows them to prosper . "
Until Israel and the United States recognize that a Palestinian state is more of a prescription for continued violence than a solution for peace and begin to battle Arab claims in the world arena , it is unlikely that a Palestinian state and the Israel - bashing it entails will ever be replaced as the top priority for the United Nations in favor of problems which truly deserve the world body 's attention .
For anyone who thinks this “ bailout ” is any more than a haphazard guess about what the market needs to remain mobile , here ’s your answer …
They ’ve changed their minds — again :
An already disheartened Wall Street turned sharply lower Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the government wo n’t buy banks ’ soured mortgage assets after all , disappointing investors who hoped to see the bad debt wiped off companies ’ books .
The Dow Jones industrials fell more than 270 points , and all the major indexes dropped more than 2 percent as the market retreated for a third straight session .
Paulson said the government ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue package will not purchase troubled assets from banks as originally planned .
He said that plan would have taken too much time , and that the Treasury instead will rely on buying stakes in banks and encouraging them to resume more normal lending .
While the market had been pleased by the government ’s decision weeks ago to buy banks ’ stock , investors still hoped to see the financial industry relieved of the burden of the mortgage assets whose decline in value helped set off the nation ’s financial crisis .
Paulson also announced a new goal for the program to support financial markets which supply consumer credit in such areas as credit card debt , auto loans and student loans .
He said “ with a stronger capital base , our banks will be more confident ” to support economic activity .
Now I understand why his initial proposal desired a lack of oversight on his powers …
He had no clue what was going on and wanted free reign to change his plans in mid-stream .
Now he ’s decided to throw money at the credit card and auto loan companies , because he ’s worried that lagging consumer spending will be the next domino .
Perhaps to say that he has no clue what ’s going on is n’t fair .
He probably knows exactly what ’s going on — he just ca n’t tell us , or we ’ll realize that the whole system is in danger .
As an unnamed banker reportedly said in Aug’07 , “ the deleveraging will not be denied . ”
I think our government is scared shitless .
Right now Paulson , Bernanke , the ECB , and financial movers the world over are trying to keep a burst bubble inflated , and the only way they know how is to pump air in , because they ca n’t fix the hole .
Just when will the world realize that the emporer has no clothes ?
Ronald Zehrfeld , the actor playing Störtebeker in the film , called the role “ a childhood dream . ”
Asked to describe his character , he said , “ He butchers people , but also has a very , very big heart . ”
The pirate ’s status has waxed and waned since the Romantic period , enjoying particularly good runs during the Nazi era and in socialist East Germany .
He has been the subject of rock songs , adventure novels and even a baroque opera .
The slogan of Störtebeker beer , brewed in Stralsund , is “ the beer of the righteous . ”
“ This strikes a nerve of social justice at the moment , ” said Philip Kalisch , one of the movie pirates outside the Gothic house here , who had been made picture - perfect medieval grimy  right down to the black cuticles  by the makeup team .
Mr. Kalisch , 29 , responded to an open call for actors and received time off from his job in Hamburg working for a Social Democratic member of Parliament to appear in the production .
“ People really want to see the fat pepper sacks relieved of a bit of their riches , ” he said , using a seasoned German term for the wealthy .
Much has been made of the fact that the capitalists responsible for the current global financial crisis are , in many cases , being propped up with multibillion - dollar state bailouts .
In the name of stability , no one is in a hurry to see the bankers , or more to the point their banks , fail .
It may be completely appropriate to applaud today as the early capitalists of the Hanseatic League , the organization of German merchant towns whose ships Mr. Störtebeker reputedly preyed upon , are run through , keelhauled and made to walk the plank .
In these difficult times , it may even be a little therapeutic .
Recently I have been using Common Lisp ’s eval function a bit .
Since it ’s eval that put ’s the E in REPL it fair to say that it is a fairly fundamental part of Lisp .
However , no code that I have seen appears to use it directly .
I think I know why .
To make ( eval … ) always work in the way you ’d expect does n’t appear to be that intuitive .
Paul Graham in On Lisp , has this to say about using eval in your own code :
Generally it is not a good idea to call eval at runtime , for two reasons :
It ’s inefficient : eval is handed a raw list , and either has to compile it on the spot , or evaluate it in an intepreter .
Either way is slower than compiling the code beforehand , and just calling it .
It ’s less powerful , because the expression is evaluated with no lexical context .
Among other things , this means that you ca n’t refer to ordinary variables outside the expression being evaluated
And so when I discovered a need in my project to persist and reload closures I decided that my needs would not violate either of Paul ’s points .
Firstly , because I do n’t know what the code I ’m going to persist is going to be , and secondly because no lexical context is needed to create my closures .
Therefore , I would store them as strings and then I would use read , and eval to restore them .
This worked fine so I put the code into the package and declared my work done .
It turned out that once the code was in a package it did n’t really work as I ’d intended .
When I tried to run it I got unknown symbol conditions raised when I tried to restore the closures .
Qualifying all the symbols with the correct package name worked but it made my shiny new DSL all messy by requiring me to always prefix all my symbols .
It turns out then that eval does n’t work this way by design .
The reason is because of this statement in the HyperSpec page of eval .
…
Description : Evaluates form in the current dynamic environment and the null lexical environment .
…
I was expecting that since my eval was inside a package it would be able to see function symbols in that package .
Not so , eval works in the dynamic environment , which implies then that the current package is a special variable and hence part of the dynamic environment .
This means my code could only ever work when the current package is the library package .
Any other package and the code fails because eval is checking the dynamic environment to determine which symbols are visible without package qualifiers .
Indeed it seems that , in SBCL to make my code work in the way that I should expect I need to wrap it in the following :
( let ( ( * package * ( find - package " MY - PACKAGE " ) ) ) ( eval ... ) )
And this works just fine .
The most pleasing thing about this outcome is that it illuminated a point that I ’d heard before but never been able to substantiate : Lisp , It Does n’t Get In Your Way .
eval has to work how it does otherwise Common Lisp would probably not work properly .
However , because the package system is an accessible part of the language to the programmer it seems as if I can adapt any part of that system to suit my purpose .
You ’d be right in thinking too much of this sort of thinking is bad for maintainability , but this single line hack allows me to safely persist executable - code at run time .
Since there ’s few languages that have closures to begin with , making a minor hack to make them easily persisted too ( with the help of macro ) seems a small price to pay .
“ Lisp .
It Does n’t Get In Your Way .
Much . ” – I like the phrase so much I think I ’m going to trade - mark it .

Print This Email This Update : International job cuts swell to 65,000 via NY
Times : " And Texas Instruments said after the market closed on Monday that it would cut 3,400 jobs or 12 percent of its work force through 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 buyouts or retirements .
" In Europe , the banking and insurance group ING said it would cut 7,000 jobs ; the electronics company Philips , 6,000 ; and the steel maker Corus , 3,500 worldwide .
Also : GM slashes 2,000 more jobs , Obama addresses ' deepening crisis '
Somebody was working this weekend to make sure thousands of other people did n't .
US companies announced they 're cutting 45,000 jobs by 9 am Eastern Time on Monday morning , even before the US stock market opened , according to a quick count by Raw Story .
Caterpillar , Inc. announced they 'd eliminate 20,500 jobs Monday morning .
" Caterpillar Inc said on Monday that quarterly earnings fell more than 32 percent and warned of a tough year ahead as the downturn that began in the United States metastasized into a full - blown global recession that hit sales of its earth - moving equipment , " Reuters wrote , saying the industrial equipment - maker would lay off 17,000 and buy out another 2,500 .
Pfizer said they'd ax 8,000 as part of a $ 65 billion deal to buy rival healthcare firm Wyeth .
" At the same time , Pfizer announced cost cuts that include slashing more than 8,000 jobs as it prepares for an expected revenue crash when its cholesterol drug Lipitor -- the world 's top - selling medicine and source of one - quarter of Pfizer 's revenue -- loses patent protection in November 2011 , " AP wrote .
Sprint - Nextel announced they 'd shed 14 percent of their 56,000 employees .
" Sprint Nextel Corp. is eliminating about 8,000 positions in the first quarter as it seeks to cut annual costs by $ 1.2 billion , " remarked AP .
And in the homebuilding industry ?
An AP reporter writes , " Home Depot Inc. plans to eliminate 7,000 jobs while closing four dozen stores under its smaller home improvement brands as the recession continues to batter the nation 's housing market . "
GM slashes 2,000 more jobs , Obama addresses ' deepening crisis '
Before noon , the news broke out that another US firm slashed 2,000 more jobs , and President Obama also addressed the ' deepening economic crisis ' and read a list of some of the companies that made recent job cuts .
" Before I begin today 's announcement , I want to say a few words about the deepening economic crisis that we 've inherited and the need for urgent action , " Obama said .
" Over the last few days , we 've learned that Microsoft , Intel , United Airlines , Home Depot , Sprint Nextel and Caterpillar are each cutting thousands of jobs . "
Obama continued , " These are not just numbers on a page .
As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008 , these are working men and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold .
We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency and common purpose . "
" We can't afford distractions and we cannot afford delays , " Obama said before signing new measures to spur development of fuel efficient cars and to wean America off foreign energy , in a first swipe at Bush administration climate policies ( story , video at this link ) .
Meanwhile , Dow Jones reports , " General Motors Corp . ( GM ) on Monday said it will lay off 2,000 more workers this spring and schedule down time at most of its assembly plants in the face of declining sales . "
The job cuts could be related to securing its share of the federal bailout .
" GM , surviving on a $ 13.4 billion federal loan , must convince the government by March 31 it can become viable or risk losing the money , " Dow Jones reports .
" Production cuts will be a significant part of GM 's recovery plan . "
An Australian writer whose novel sold just seven copies has been jailed for three years for defaming the King of Thailand .
Harry Nicolaides , who appeared in court in leg irons and brown prison overalls , broke down and wept after the court delivered its sentence .
He would have faced double the time in jail had be not pleaded guilty .
" This ca n't be real .
It feels like a bad dream , " Mr Nicolaides , from Melbourne , told reporters as he left the court yesterday .
" This is an Alice in Wonderland experience .
I really believe that I am going to wake up and all of you will be gone . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The case of Mr Nicolaides , of mixed Greek and Australian descent is a tale that mixes tragedy and farce .
The 41 - year - old was charged over his 2005 novel Verisimilitude whose sales failed to make it into double figures .
According to the presiding judge at Bangkok 's Central Criminal Court , a passage in the book that discussed the personal life of a fictional prince " suggested that there was abuse of royal power " .
Precisely what was deemed offensive is unclear ; after the case , the prosecutor warned reporters that the law prohibited the repetition of the material .
Mr Nicolaides , who taught at a university in the north of Thailand and was detained when trying to leave the country , unaware of the allegation against him , has fallen foul of Thailand 's " lese - majeste " laws which prohibit the publication of anything considered defamatory of the royal family and in particular 81 - year - old King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Anyone saying anything considered offensive of the king , considered semi-divine , faces jail of up to 15 years .
Increasingly , however , the law has been used as a tool to silence critics of the royal family against the backdrop of Thailand 's recent political turmoil .
The Royal family , in particular , Queen Sirikit has been criticised for its closeness to campaigners who laid siege to parts of Bangkok city and saw two previous prime ministers forced from office .
Last October , the queen attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed during clashes with police .
Critics of the law say it is open to abuse since a complaint can be filed by anybody against anybody , no matter how minor the alleged disrespect .
And even though the king himself has said he should not be above the law , police feel obliged to investigate all accusations .
Earlier this month , Justice Minister Pirapan Salirathavibhaga vowed to toughen laws protecting the monarchy and crack down on criticism of the palace and a Thai man accused of insulting the monarchy in comments posted on the internet was arrested last week .
Up to 2,300 websites considered critical of the royal family have been shut even though the recently elected and British - educated prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva said last week he was trying to " strike the balance between upholding the law and allowing freedom of expression " .
Yet opinion about the Thai royal family appears mixed .
Yesterday evening as the sun fell behind Bangkok 's Chao Phraya River , The Independent interviewed workers heading home on the cross -river ferry .
Those who gave their names universally spoke warmly of the king .
" I like the King of Thailand .
He is the King of Kings , " beamed Kukiat Ngamwitrot , a human resources executive .
Privately people may feel a little different .
One 22 - year - old man who asked not to be named said he believed the royal family should keep out of politics .
" Now the king and queen have joined with the politics and that is not good .
The politics should be separate .
The queen has been a big supporter of the protesters , " he said .
Thailand 's Eton-educated Prime Minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , was elected last month following months of turmoil that had seen two prime minister of the People 's Power Party ( PPP ) - once headed by another former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra - forced from office by the courts .
In November , protesters opposed to the rule of the PPP closed down Bangkok 's airports , stranding thousands of international tourists .
PRAGUE , Czech Republic —
A hospital does not have to compensate a young Gypsy woman it sterilized without her consent , an appeals court ruled Wednesday .
In overturning the Czech Republic ’s first monetary award for forced sterilization , the court said the statute of limitations had expired .
Human - rights groups believe hundreds of women from the Czech Republic ’s Gypsy minority of about 250,000 people were sterilized against their will .
Under communism , which ended in the Czech Republic in 1989 , sterilization was a semi-official tool to limit the population of Gypsies , or Roma as they prefer to be called , whose large families were seen as a burden on the state .
The practice ended only recently , according to a 2005 investigative report by the national ombudsman .
Iveta Cervenakova , now 32 , was sterilized without her consent in 1997 after she gave birth to her second daughter by cesarean section .
She filed a lawsuit in 2005 .
A lower court ruled two years later that the hospital in the northeastern city of Ostrava had to pay compensation and apologize for violating her rights .
Court spokesman Petr Angyalossy said the 500,000 koruna ( $ 26,330 ) judgment was overturned because the award came after the three - year statute of limitations in the case had expired .
He said the hospital needs only to apologize .
The Czech League for Human Rights sharply criticized the ruling and said it would appeal it to the Supreme Court .
Lawyer David Zahumensky of the League for Human Rights , who consulted with Cervenakova ’s lawyer , said she will argue that there should be no statute of limitation applied in sterilization cases .
Several other Czech Gypsy women are seeking damages from hospitals for illegal sterilizations .

Do you and I willingly give up our freedom and property for the benefits of living in these United States ?
Do we tacitly consent to oppression by not moving to another country ?
Do we tacitly consent to the authority of our governments by not rebelling , by not throwing the tea into Boston harbor ?
John Locke and many today say " yes " ; we tacitly accept the State by paying our taxes , by receiving its benefits ( such as property protection ! ) , and by not emigrating .
They say we acquiesce in an implicit contract in which we give up freedom or accept compulsion in exchange for other things that we value .
This view is dead wrong .
Why is it wrong ?
We are born into a system , we are chained from the start .
The deck is stacked against us .
The State has powers that it accumulated many decades ago , before you and I were born , and has accumulated since .
We can change our position only at great cost .
If we calculate whether to consent or not , we seemingly consent because we expect that to fight will cost us dearly without our securing a gain .
We are not making a social contract freely entered into .
There are guns to all our heads , one of which is PAY YOUR TAXES .
Protest that and you go to jail .
Call this consent ?
People love their country — their area , their people , their culture , their place .
To move is a wrenching experience .
Why should we have to move anyway ?
So we stay on despite the State ’s impositions .
Call this consent ?
The State controls education .
The State passes out favors to garner support from intellectuals and the press .
The State manufactures propaganda .
The State ties as many people up in the knots of social programs and subsidies as it can .
The State deifies itself .
Basically , the slaves are indoctrinated to love their masters and fear any other situation .
How can anyone enter a contract with open eyes and freely when the other side has educated you from day one to pledge allegiance to it , to accept that the State is the source of your prosperity , and to threaten you with loss of what you have if you resist ?
If your education is so poor that you do not know where prosperity and happiness come from — and they are not from the State — then you are a sitting duck for all sorts of misinformation and propaganda .
Call this consent ?
Tacit consent is myth .
What we really have is tacit submission .
After reaching that conclusion , I read Étienne de la Boétie who practically originated the idea that governments were upheld by consent .
I discovered that he uses the word " submit " five times and the word " consent " twice :
" It is therefore the inhabitants themselves who permit , or , rather , bring about , their own subjection , since by ceasing to submit they would put an end to their servitude .
A people enslaves itself … gives consent to its own misery … "
Moreover , he speaks of consent to misery , not consent to legitimacy of authority , which is Locke ’s idea .
The only reason that tacit consent has survived in our political thought is as a convenient , albeit incorrect , explanation of how unpopular and illegitimate States remain in power .
Libertarians disagree on tacit consent .
This is not a terribly serious matter .
The libertarian political philosophy in no way hinges on the concept of tacit consent .
Still , we should clear up our thinking about it .
We do not want to be led into related errors of thought .
On the one hand , the Voluntaryist ’s Statement of Purpose prominently mentions tacit consent , stating : " Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education , and we advocate withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which State power ultimately depends . "
In the same vein , Lew Rockwell has written : " Along with David Hume and Étienne de la Boétie , Mises saw that the state always rules with the tacit consent of the governed .
That does n’t mean that at every step , everyone in society must approve of what the state does .
Instead , it means that a sizeable majority have invested the state with a sufficient degree of institutional legitimacy to keep the political system running .
Otherwise , the state and its programs would fall . "
The U.S. Constitution was supposedly justified by the ( explicit not tacit ) consent of the governed , a liberating idea with long historical roots .
However , the idea that governments exist only at the behest and sufferance of those governed is so radical a political idea that it implies anarchy .
After all , if each individual can withdraw consent and secede , anarchy results .
Other libertarians think that to accept tacit consent as a reality is to accept the legitimacy of the State .
John Locke and the Founding Fathers , horrified at the notion of anarchy being implied by consent of the governed , grasped the lifeline of tacit consent .
George H. Smith writes that : " To trace the history of the tacit consent doctrine is to trace a tortuous route whereby political theorists have attempted to avoid the anarchistic implications of the natural rights / social contract position . "
Both Smith and Carl Watner mention that Robert Filmer and Josiah Tucker understood this , and Watner notes that Lincoln ’s First Inaugural referred to secession as " the essence of anarchy . "
Smith notes that Adam Smith , David Hume and John Madison all realized this clearly .
He quotes Madison as finding " no relief from such embarrassments [ of anarchy ] but in the received doctrine that a tacit assent may be given to established Government and laws , and that this assent is to be inferred from the omission of an express revocation . "
If we eliminate the ill - conceived doctrine of tacit consent from our thought , then we ’ll want alternative explanations of how illegitimate States retain power .
That ’s important .
Understanding how rulers control their subjects helps guide us in actions designed to undermine their power .
To sum up so far , the idea that a government is legitimate only if it has the consent of the governed is a valid libertarian idea , because government under this doctrine is a compact freely arrived at by all participating individuals who are also free to exit the agreement at will if their consent changes to non-consent .
The idea is very important historically because of its liberating motivation .
In this respect , Lysander Spooner , in No Treason , finds that " nations and governments , if they can rightfully exist at all , can exist only by consent . "
This portrait of consent of the governed actually is one of anarchism or self - government .
In contrast , the idea of tacit consent is an ad hoc doctrine with no basis in libertarian thought that says that people being coerced by a State assent to that State by living in that State , paying taxes , receiving benefits , and not moving elsewhere .
Does the consent of the governed actually exist in any State ?
Obviously not , because every State on earth coerces its people .
Jim Davies writes that consent of the governed is " nonsense on its face ; if I consent to your removing my property or damaging my person , then you are n’t governing me at all — and vice versa . "
Spooner launches a devastating attack on the notion that the United States rests on consent .
Here is a sample of some of Spooner ’s arguments that the government of the U.S. does not in fact rest on consent of the governed :
The war waged by the North showed definitively that the U.S. government does not rest on the consent of the governed , as theory might have it , but on compulsion and force .
The Constitution at its inception was consented to by only a small number of people living in the country .
The consent of that small number could not extend to future persons .
When persons voted subsequently , that cannot be construed as consent .
Voters , being forced to pay taxes and being ruled in other ways , being " under peril of weighty punishments " if they rebel , will vote in order to try to relieve their condition .
This in no way indicates that they consent to it .
In the century after the U.S.A. began , only a small fraction of the people were allowed to vote and still fewer actually voted , thereby limiting greatly any consent to the Constitution , the government , or the laws promulgated by that government and limiting the legitimacy of all of these with respect to the nonvoters .
The payment of taxes ca n’t be construed as consent because taxes are compulsory .
There is nothing for a voter to consent to anyway , since the Constitution is not and never was a valid agreement or contract .
The voters cannot possibly be providing consent when the Constitution ’s powers are so vast that the lives , properties , and liberties of the people are delivered up to the State by this document .
Government power ca n’t be legitimated or justified by consent of the strongest party or by consent of the majority .
Voting amounts to a situation in which a fraction of the population appoints agents who will administer the government under the Constitution ’s name .
This however cannot legally bind those others who do not so vote .
And even that authority is undermined by the fact that the principals ( the voters ) are unknown and unnamed , their ballots are cast in secret , and they can have no responsibility for the acts of their agents .
The agents ( elected officials ) do not know who their principals are either .
David Hume , with whom Spooner was probably familiar , notes that consent of the governed is " surely the best and most sacred " of any foundation of government .
But he scornfully and skillfully skewers the notion that consent of the governed founds or has founded governments .
These , he says , arise from force , fraud , fear of punishment , violence , political craft , conquest and usurpation .
Voting he views as either controlled directly by a select few or , if the multitudes are involved , led by an elite few .
Does tacit consent actually exist in a State ?
Spooner ’s view is that " It is not improbable that many or most of the worst governments — although established by force , and by a few , in the first place — come , in time , to be supported by a majority .
But if they do , this majority is composed , in large part , of the most ignorant , superstitious , timid , dependent , servile , and corrupt portions of the people ; of those who have been over - awed by the power , intelligence , wealth , and arrogance ; of those who have been deceived by the frauds ; and of those who have been corrupted by the inducements , of the few who really constitute the government .
Such majorities , very likely , could be found in half , perhaps nine - tenths , of all the countries on the globe .
What do they prove ?
Nothing but the tyranny and corruption of the very governments that have reduced so large portions of the people to their present ignorance , servility , degradation , and corruption ; an ignorance , servility , degradation , and corruption that are best illustrated in the simple fact that they do sustain governments that have so oppressed , degraded , and corrupted them . "
For Spooner , support or tacit consent exists , but it is meaningless because the consent arises from a coalition of people that includes those who are deceived by the State , those who benefit from the State , those who are blinded by the State , those who depend on it , those who fear it , and those who do not know any better .
Tacit consent is heavily influenced consent and means little .
Rockwell ’s theory of tacit consent modernizes Spooner and adds several new and important elements :
" What makes it possible for the largest government in human history — I ’m speaking of the U.S. government — to continue to rule in our own country ?
The answer is complex .
But it involves an enormous apparatus of propaganda and legitimization by the media , the academic elite , bureaucrats on the payroll , and special interests anxious to provide a cover for their graft .
" It also involves buying off potential critics and radical dissenters from the regime .
And it involves the misuse of religion , whereby we are taught to treat national symbols as sacred , worship the presidency , and regard the political and bureaucratic class as some sort of exalted ecclesiocracy . "
Under this theory , the State ’s frauds and deceptions are put across with the help of dedicated servants in the media and academia , as well as government and special interest spokesmen who provide an overwhelming flow of rhetoric based on false and self - serving ideas that include State - worship .
Enough of the people are fooled enough of the time to provide support for the State .
David Hume suggests that established governments meet with the acquiescence of the subjects , not their choice .
They view support as a matter of obligation or duty .
As for tacit consent :
" Should it be said , that , by living under the dominion of a prince which one might leave , every individual has given a tacit consent to his authority , and promised him obedience ; it may be answered , that such an implied consent can only have place where a man imagines that the matter depends on his choice .
But where he thinks ( as all mankind do who are born under established governments ) that , by his birth , he owes allegiance to a certain prince or certain form of government ; it would be absurd to infer a consent or choice , which he expressly , in this case , renounces and disclaims . "
Tacit consent exists if men think they are choosing their rulers .
However , when men support a State out of duty or allegiance , tacit consent does n’t exist .
Hume believes that allegiance underlies the State , not consent , tacit or otherwise , to an imaginary contract .
Allegiance exists , he says , because the subjects view it as necessary for the continuity and existence of the State .
And they believe this , in his view , because they are Hobbesians .
They ( and Hume ) believe laws , magistrates , judges and authority are necessary to maintain a social order so that the strong do not devour the weak and the violent do not invade the just .
Cooperation and civil society are out of the question without a ruling authority whom everyone obeys .
Anarchist libertarians understand and agree that laws and judgments are essential for social order .
They do not agree that a monopoly provider of these services is needed .
Such a single provider , a State , makes no sense according to Hume ’s own goal , because it , being strong and attracting the violent men to its powers , devours freedom , property , justice , the family , and weakens civil society .
If Hume ’s theory of allegiance is correct , then weaning people away from the State should focus on breaking down the notion that we must have a single authority in order to maintain social order and breaking down the idea that the State actually maintains social order when it does the very opposite !
It should focus on the alternative ideas that freedom of choice and movement among several providers are better and encourage cooperation , social order , reduced conflict , and a healthier and more robust civil society .
Hume goes on to point out that many men have no " free choice , " I would say no opportunity , to leave a country because they lack the means and face the barriers of language and custom .
Inferring tacit consent from the payment of taxes is a faulty way of judging a State ’s legitimacy .
We do not accept taxes out of a tacit consent of the State .
We view taxes as better to pay than not to pay or to leave the country .
The costs of moving are very high , and many other countries impose taxes that are just as high .
We have a choice among many bad alternatives .
Because we do not move does not imply that we would not be far better off without the taxes .
We would be better off without taxes .
If we do not move , does that imply we accept these taxes , that we consent to them ?
Yes .
Does that mean we believe ourselves better off with the taxes than without ?
No .
We ’d like to see the taxes lifted .
For us to avoid taxes , we must incur a host of other costs .
The State tries to set the taxes so that it does not pay us to avoid them .
They may be low enough to accomplish that end ; yet I ’d still be better off without them .
As Jean Baptiste Colbert wrote : " The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing . "
The State says to us :
You ca n’t go to the prom unless you wash all the floors and do all the ironing for the next two weeks .
We do these chores because the dance is worth more to us .
However , the chores ( taxes ) reduce our happiness .
Whenever we buy anything , our personal valuation exceeds the price we pay .
Taxes remove some of that excess of personal valuation over the price .
This is what a monopolist tries to do .
Tacit consent only means that we still find it worthwhile to live in a country .
It says nothing about the legitimacy or acceptance of the ruling authorities .
Nevertheless , the State reduces our happiness .
We make a choice to remain , but it ’s a choice that is based on a reduced set of opportunities .
To stay in the country does not signify consent to the government ’s authority as much as it signifies that our happiness at living here is great enough that we can bear the State ’s robberies and impositions ; and that the costs of moving elsewhere do not justify the prospective gains .
Hence , with respect to authorizing the State we live under , tacit submission better describes our remaining in the country than tacit consent .
Here is an elegant and more general argument .
Even if the State were not here , we would stay where we are , so that tacit consent ca n’t legitimize a State .
If a State moves in and we remain , it ’s not because we consent .
It ’s because we submit .
Barnett makes the further argument that tacit consent only is a possible justification of a State ’s authority if we assume that the government initially has the authority to command obedience , but that is what tacit consent is supposed to indicate .
Two final economic arguments .
( 1 ) The tacit consent doctrine seeks to infer legitimacy of the State from the fact that we remain in the country .
This assumes that all the benefits and costs of living in the country are mostly linked to the existence of the State , which is of course false .
The enjoyment of Niagara Falls , a steak dinner , or a baseball game have something to do with the State , but not much .
( 2 ) If the previous sentence is disputable , which it is , that is because we do not know the benefits and costs of the State in these instances .
We ca n’t know them because there is no market for the State ’s services .
It follows again that there is no way to infer that anyone would be willing to buy into the State merely because they remain in a country in which that State rules .
Next time you are tempted to say that States rest upon tacit consent , say instead that they rest upon tacit submission .
That conveys the notion that threat is involved , that we go along despite the costs imposed upon us by the State .
Let us move away from the issue of tacit consent by observing that both Spooner and Rockwell in their discussions of tacit consent actually strike off in a far more important direction : a " theory of rule . "
They mention a variety of means by which rulers control their subjects .
Understanding the multiple methods , devices , ruses , and stratagems by which rulers build and maintain power is critical in combating them .
Equally important is a realistic and nuanced view of how States fail .
Although we can say that withdrawal of consent occurs when a State fails , it is an empty statement .
The critical issues are how and why this happens , and what roles are played by errors made by rulers , by accumulated problems of the State , and by parties anxious to seize control over a new State .
Both the Voluntaryist and Rockwell believe that if the governed withdraw consent , then the government will fall .
While this may be so , what happens thereafter is exceedingly important .
In case after case , another State replaces the previous one .
In other words , a small coterie of people seizes power and imposes it on the vast majority , leaving the basic situation the same albeit with a State of a different stripe .
There are two policies that can avoid this outcome .
The first is gradualism , whereby the existing State does not collapse but is instead reduced and restructured piecemeal .
The second is a widespread understanding of the direction and ultimate goal being pursued , namely , reduction of State power and size to zero .

Just a quick holiday update on the Minnesota Senate Recount .
Each of Minnesota 's 4130 precincts completed reporting on December 12th , the result follows :
Recount Original Coleman : 1,208,935 - 1,210,995 = - 2,060 Franken : 1,208,747 - 1,210,285 = - 1,538 Current Margin : Coleman + 188 Precincts Recounted : 100 % ( 4130 of 4130 )
There was an additional 6,688 challenged ballots still left to be decided .
On Monday , December 22nd , the Minnesota Secretary of State 's Office posted a draft quality spreadsheet containing a proposed resolution for all 6,688 challenges .
Drawing from my previous tabulation :
Candidate Challenges -> Coleman -> Franken ->
Other Coleman ( R ) 3,404 32 3,125 247 Franken ( D ) 3,296 2,926 71 299 Both 12 3 5 4 Total 6,688 2,955 3,191 478 Challenge Margin : Franken + 236
Now if the precinct 's reported recount results are combined with the draft result of the challenge resolutions , the horserace stands as follows :
Precinct Recount Margin : Coleman + 188 Challenge Draft Margin : Franken +236 Current Recount Margin : Franken +48
Franken is not yet the winner however , there are still ballots left to be counted ; about 1,600 according to MN SOS Mark Ritchie .
According to the StarTribune there are at least 727 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots from 54 of Minnesota 's 87 counties .
The remaining counties have yet to finalize their count , but each county has until January 2nd to report their totals .
The canvassing board meets next Tuesday , December 30th , to finalize the challenge resolutions .
I will hopefully have a live stream of the proceedings and the subsequent press conferences .

Are we heading for bankruptcy ?
Britain 's debt is at record levels , sterling is falling like a stone , and investors are pushing up bond yields – a sure sign they want proper compensation for lending to the Government .
But the bailiffs are only a distant prospect .
If we actually go bust , what would this mean ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A visit to the International Monetary Fund , national bailout , ignomy , Brown exiting Downing Street , and some severe public spending cuts ...
How big is the national debt ?
Officially , around £ 650bn .
This does n't include liabilities taken on by the nationalisation of Bradford & Bingley and Royal Bank of Scotland , nor more than £ 30bn of Private Finance Initiative projects that government accounting trickery has kept off the books .
National debt could be as high as £ 850bn .
How deep is the recession ?
The UK economy contracted by 1.5 per cent in the final three months of 2008 .
Output has not fallen so badly for more than 28 years .
Do we know the full extent of banks ' toxic debt liabilities ?
Absolutely not .
Lending between banks seized up in 2007 because none of them trusted each other .
This fear remains .
Absurdly complex product and accounting structures mean bank bosses are most likely in the dark even about their own operations .
Is public spending really out of control ?
Not yet .
Gordon Brown has said : " We have low public debt , we have low inflation , wages are under control . "
Few economists agree .
Research firm Capital Economics says : " Borrowing is going to rocket .
Things are already pretty bad and there 's worse to come . "
How big a brake on recovery are high levels of personal debt ?
Britons are the most indebted in the world .
Between us , we owe around £ 1.4 trillion .
Having to service all this debt has dragged down consumer spending .
However , Bank of England rate cuts should aid recovery in the long term .
Will property prices stabilise this year ?
Capital Economics says prices will not stabilise until early 2010 .
The pound – is it all over ?
Unlikely .
Goldman
Sachs last week told its clients to stick with sterling , which it expects to bounce back quite soon .
Can we afford present levels of public spending ?
The real question is can we afford not to spend on big infrastructure projects ?
Where in Britain is worst hit ?
July - September 2008 jobless figures show unemployment in London at 7.4 per cent , second only to the North - east , at 8 per cent .
Yorkshire & Humber , the North - west , Wales and West Midlands all come in around the 6.5 - 6.8 per cent range .
Northern Ireland is lowest , with 4.1 per cent .

It 's a lot better than lost jobs because it means there are more people still in work – not taking benefits – and still paying taxes .
Where are the first genuine green shoots of recovery liable to appear ?
Earlier this month , media giant Reed Elsevier raised $ 1.5 bn in bonds to repay some debts .
In pre-credit crunch times such a success was common , but it is unheard of now .
This deal , and rumours of corporate takeovers , suggest the beginnings of resuscitation may appear in the City quite soon .
Do Brown and Darling know what they 're doing ?
Possibly .
They err on the side of avoiding the worst .
If throwing money at the problem averts a slump , it 'll have been worth it .
If it does n't , we 'll just have to get used to Swedish levels of tax for a decade or so .
Is the VAT cut likely to be repealed in the Budget ?
Not a chance .
The trickier question for Darling is whether to prolong it beyond 31 December , when critics say putting VAT back up will trample any green shoots .
Is the Government so associated with the problem that it cannot solve it ?
If recession becomes slump , then Brown 's departure will be a precondition of the return of confidence .
What should a young , non-property - owning person do ?
Cut down on credit card debts , overdrafts or personal loans .
What should a property - owning , middle - aged person do ?
Weigh the financial implications of unemployment .
Look at building up at least six months ' income in a savings account .
Do n't cut back on pension payments .
What should a retired person do ?
Shop around for the best savings rate , but do n't deposit more than £ 50,000 with any one bank .
Finally , should I emigrate , and , if so , to which country ?
The Independent 's Simon Calder recommends New Zealand or Dubai .

Two days ago , the Pew Internet and American Life Project released a report that details the ( apparently shocking ) phenomenon that about half of American adults play videogames ( 53 % , to be exact ) .
Sounds about right to me , though I just skimmed through a good dozen articles from all over the net that are making it sound like this is some big news .
I agree with this Forbes blogger in that it is n’t the numbers that are surprising but how surprised everyone seems to be about them ( must be that other 47 % ) .
It just goes to show how little understood gaming really is outside of itself .
After all , gaming permeates our culture .
Look at Nintendo ’s latest ad campaign .
Gaming is n’t just for geeks anymore –Carrie Underwood plays Nintendogs !
However , the problem , I think , is that this survey does n’t differentiate between “ gamers ” and “ people who play videogames . ”
At least , most of the reports on it are n’t .
I mean , my mom plays Solitaire constantly on her iPhone , and so she fits into that 53 % , but I would never in a million years refer to her as a “ gamer . ”
I think the other 47 % are seeing the headline “ MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS ARE GAMERS ” and picturing the other half of the country locked in their basements playing Halo and World of Warcraft .
There were a couple of detailed findings from the survey that I found interesting .
For example , older adults ( 65 + ) who play games are about 10 % more likely to play every day than younger people .
Also , college graduates are about 20 % more likely to play videogames than those without a high school diploma ( the research specialist at Pew says that there ’s no obvious reason for this one , but it seems to me that income level might be a skewing factor ) .
And a score for recognition of girl gamers – 50 % of women play versus 55 % of men .
Right now , age is the biggest demographic factor .
Nearly every teenager plays videogames ( 97 % ) versus 81 % of those 18 - 29 ( that ’s my box ! ) and 23 % of the senior crowd ( 65 + ) .
My prediction is that this difference will just continue to flatten over time , as it ’s more an issue of culture than circumstance .
By the time digital natives ( those born after 1980 ) are seniors , I suspect that most of us will be spending our retirements playing whatever the future equivalent of World of Warcraft is ( I ’m hoping for a metaverse myself ) .

The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs commissioned a study by research company TNO about how much Dutch Internet users download music , movies , and games , and what the social and economic effects of this downloading are .
This resulted in a nearly 150 - page report ( Dutch ) with many tables of percentages in it .
The report differentiates between paid and unpaid downloads and talks about file sharing , eschewing the word " illegal . "
In the Netherlands , only uploading copyrighted music and movies is against the law .
" Unpaid downloads " include officially licensed promotional content .
" Of the Dutch Internet population , 2.3 percent paid for music , movie , or game downloads in the past 12 months , " according to the report .
But then a table on the next page shows that 6.5 percent of the users have made purchases from iTunes and 2.9 percent have bought digital music from Amazon.com .
So apparently many of them tried going legal , but did n't make a habit of it .
( Amazon only sells MP3 downloads in the United States . )
According to the report , an estimated 1.5 billion to 2 billion songs are downloaded unpaid each year , which would be 7.5 songs for every song sold ( as a download or on CD ) .
This is much more than what people actually listen to .
Thirty - five percent of the Dutch population has downloaded music without paying for it , according to the study .
Curiously , freeloaders consume paid content in the same amounts as nondownloaders — for games , freeloaders even buy more than non-downloaders .
The report recognizes that for music , there is an important " sampling " effect where unpaid downloads are used to sample music , some of which is subsequently bought .
However , this does n't work as well for movies , because those tend to be viewed just once , so even if the unpaid downloader liked the movie , he 'll be unlikely to buy it because he wo n't want to see it again .
On the other hand , the rates for buying content that was previously downloaded without authorization are rather low : the majority only do this a few times a year , in equal amounts for music , movies , and games .
Things get really interesting on page 116 as the report starts to dissect the societal effects of file sharing .
The study concludes that the effects are strongly positive because consumers get to enjoy desirable content and also get to keep their cash to buy other things .
Because the consumers save much more money than the producers lose , the net economic effects are positive .
The report also reinforces the truth that unpaid downloads do not translate into lost sales in anything close to a one - to - one ratio .
The report makes a number of recommendations that file sharers will be able to live with , such as supporting the development of new economic models for rights holders , not criminalizing file sharing for personal use , and so on .
Big Content is likely to quibble with some of the report 's conclusions , especially the ones about the economic effects .
The music industry especially has laid the blame for the years - long decline in revenues at the feet of piracy , even though its own slowness to adapt to changing customer expectations and adopt new business in response is a major factor .

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
Traditional media outlets like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have begun to use some of the tools of social media — blogs , Facebook pages , even Twitter accounts .
But they seem a lot less eager to adopt some of social media ’s core principles , including a commitment to the two - way nature of the medium and all that it represents .
This means a lot more than just talking about “ the conversation ” and how great it is to get links or comments .
It ’s about taking those comments seriously , responding to them regardless of whether they are positive or negative , and incorporating that approach into the way you do your job .
It ’s about looking at “ journalism , ” broadly - speaking , as a process rather than an artifact .
This is something that most of the blogosphere , or at least the part of it that cares about accuracy and integrity , does pretty well .
Sites like GigaOM and others update their posts when information is added or corrected , and in many cases link to critical or differing opinions ( and if they do n’t , they should ) .
In that sense , truth — to use a loaded word — is not absolute , nor is it something that a single entity has a monopoly on , particularly around a developing or complicated issue .
The most we can hope for is that an outlet of any kind , whether it ’s a blog or a traditional newspaper ’s web site , does its best to represent an issue fairly and completely , and that requires additions , updates , links and discussion .
The WSJ arguably failed that test on Monday , with its story on Google ( s goog ) and how its position on “ net neutrality ” had allegedly softened .
There has been , and will no doubt continue to be , debate about whether the Journal ’s perception of Google ’s behavior is correct .
Some believe that Google is actually giving itself a benefit that others can’t match ( except , of course , other large web companies such as Microsoft ( s msft ) , Yahoo ( s yhoo ) , Amazon ( s amzn ) , etc. ) .
Others see it as a natural move by a large Internet company , and no threat to net neutrality at all .
Whether you agree depends on what you think net neutrality is supposed to mean , and what Google ’s role in it is .
If you want to understand more about the issue and the way the Journal described it , read some of the links in David Weinberger ’s post .
What is n’t in dispute , however , is that Google completely disagreed with the implications in the article , as company representatives made clear in a blog post written not long after the story went up on the Journal site .
It ’s understandable that Google might take issue with the story , of course , since it paints the company ’s behavior in a negative light .
But that ’s not really the point .
What is important is how the Journal responded to these criticisms , both from Google and Lawrence Lessig ( who was also quoted in the Journal story and noted , in his own blog post , that the description of his views was simply not accurate ) , and from other sources .
Was the story itself updated ?
No .
Were any links to the blog posts in question included , even as supplementary material ?
No .
There was a blog post on the Journal site that mentioned how the story had “ gotten a rise ” out of the blogosphere , which included a couple of links , and then on Tuesday there was as second one , also with links to additional posts at Wired and elsewhere , as well as a description of what “ edge caching ” is .
No response to Lessig ’s factual assertions about his views and the way they were described was provided .
There is no acknowledgment of it apart from the Journal ’s second blog post ( which someone reading the original story might or might not even find ) .
To any self - respecting blogger , this seems like a failure .
Why not put all of that information , whether they be links to critical blog posts , updates on factual errors , or something else that is relevant , inside the original story ?
Why not allow those responses to help expand the way people look at the story ?
They ’re going to do so anyway , once they come across them on their own .
Is the Journal simply hoping that they wo n’t , and the story will remain pure and unsullied by criticism ?
That ’s an old - media approach .
It ’s a way of saying , either directly or by implication , “ The truth is whatever we say it is . ”
Any critical responses , even from two of the major players in the story , are relegated to a blog post that gloats about the reaction the story got , but does little to treat it as valid or worthy of inclusion .
As Scott Rosenberg of Salon points out , online media provides the tools for a real conversation , one that changes the way people look at an issue , and for a real “ journalism as a process ” approach to the news .
It ’s a pity the Journal could n’t spot — or take advantage of — such an opportunity when it presented itself .
RNC mulls accusing Bush of ' socialism ' Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 30 , 2008

The divisions taking hold among Republicans are becoming more severe as the party prepares to accuse its outgoing president of embracing " socialism . "
The slur that conservatives were so fond of lobbing at Barack Obama during the presidential campaign is now being directed toward President Bush and GOP lawmakers who supported federal bailouts of the banking and auto industries .
At its meeting next month , the Republican National Committee is set to vote on a resolution formally opposing the bailouts , accusing Bush of helping nationalize the banks and taking " another dangerous step closer toward socialism , " the Washington Times reports Tuesday .
" We can't be a party of small government , free markets and low taxes while supporting bailouts and nationalizing industries , which lead to big government , socialism and high taxes at the expense of individual liberty and freedoms , " Solomon Yue , an Oregon member and co-sponsor of the resolution told the Times .
The resolution reads , in part : " WHEREAS , the Bank Bailout Bill effectively nationalized the Nation 's banking system , giving the United States non-voting warrants from participating financial institutions , and moving our free market based economy another dangerous step closer toward socialism ; and WHEREAS , what was needed , and is still needed , to fix the banking industry is not a bailout , but rather a commitment to fiscal responsibility . "
Republican leaders in both the House and Senate supported the Wall Street bailout , and GOP presidential candidate John McCain infamously " suspended " his campaign to return to Washington and whip up support for the bill .
A Republican - led filibuster blocked the auto industry bailout in the Senate , but Bush decided to use some of the previously approved $ 700 billion to grant loans to the car companies .
During the campaign , accusations that Obama was a closet socialist proliferated on talk radio , conservative blogs and in McCain / Palin campaign speeches .
For the record , " The resolution also opposes President - elect Obama 's proposed public works program and supports conservative alternatives , " another co-sponsor told the Times .
In January , Leslie Richard got a call from a man from Vision Media Television .
The Boca Raton , Florida , TV production company wanted to know if Richard would agree to be interviewed for a documentary on eco-fashion .
According to Richard , the caller implied that the film might air on PBS or possibly on CNN .
" I was nervous , but I was totally , like , Yeah -- I 'll do it , " says Richard .
A TV appearance promised to be a huge PR boost for her two - year - old Asheville , North Carolina , company , The Oko Box , which sells clothing made of organic cotton , hemp , and bamboo .
As talks progressed , however , Richard , 31 , grew increasingly skeptical about the documentary .
She says another Vision Media employee told her that Oko Box would be charged $ 22,900 to cover some production expenses , plus $ 3,000 for travel costs .
Feeling " creeped out , " Richard called the Better Business Bureau and posted a message about her experience on her company 's blog .
" Look alive small eco business owners , " she wrote , " ' cause there is a new scam targeting us .
[ U ] sing television lingo , an entire team of people , a website , video footage , and [ a ] whole bag of lies to cover their scheme . "
As cathartic as this blog post may have been , it put Richard 's business at risk .
Anything posted on a CEO 's blog -- including reader comments -- can be construed as carrying the weight of a company 's endorsement , says Marc Zwillinger , an attorney in the Washington , D.C. , office of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal .
" Blogging is a cheap and scalable way to talk to interested people , " adds Seth Godin , an avid blogger and the author of 10 books on marketing .
" But understand that while you advocate for your company , you are also walking a tightrope from a legal and business point of view . "
Initially , Richard says , her blog elicited responses from more than 50 business owners who said they had dealt with Vision Media and shared her concerns .
One person sent Richard a statement found on PBS 's website from 2004 that said the network was " not associated with and does not endorse " a list of companies that included Vision Media .
When the production company threatened to sue Richard if she did n't take down her blog , she wrote : " Um , yeah VMT your scam is being posted & has already been reported , and your imaginary lawyers can't do anything about it . "
In July , Vision Media made good on its threat and filed a lawsuit in Florida against Richard and her company , asserting that the comments on Oko Box 's blog ( which Richard reposted in a members - only chat room maintained by a group for social entrepreneurs ) had directly resulted in $ 5 million in lost business .
The suit also asked the court to award Vision Media $ 15 million in punitive damages .
Mark Miller , an executive producer at Vision Media , denies that his company claimed to work with PBS .
He also says Vision Media has a good rating with the Better Business Bureau , contrary to a post published in the comments section of Richard 's website .
" We 've lost a lot of business as a result of her blog , " Miller says .
After the initial shock wore off , Richard found a lawyer in Florida who was willing to work with her pro bono .
At presstime in late September , Richard was close to a settlement with Vision Media , and she said she was prepared to take down the blog posts .
Richard says the nine - month standoff could have been avoided if Vision Media had just said , " We 're a video company that does advertorials ; you can use it however you want , and this is how much it costs . "
Miller asserts that his company does , as a policy , mention fees in the first phone call and that Richard misunderstood the pitch .
" Our presentation is crystal clear , " he says .
( PBS declined to elaborate on its statement concerning Vision Media . )
Stating that “ the past always bears upon the future , ” Whitehouse asserted in a speech on the Senate floor last night that in order to look to the future , America must also review the abuses of the past .

PRINCETON , NJ -- A majority of Americans ( 62 % ) say Congress should block President - elect Obama 's request to release the remaining $ 350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds until more details are provided about how the funds will be spent .
The rest of Americans are split between saying the funds should be released immediately and saying they should not be released at all .
President Bush , accommodating a request from Obama , formally asked for the release of the remaining half of the TARP funds earlier this week .
The funds will automatically be released after 15 days unless Congress passes a law blocking their release .
A number of congressional leaders , including some Democrats and Republicans , have threatened to do just that -- citing concerns that the Obama administration must be much more explicit about what is going to be done with the second half of the appropriated TARP money .
These concerns in part reflect criticism that spending of the first half of the TARP funds was badly mismanaged .
Obama made a personal trip to Capitol Hill on Tuesday , lobbying for release of the funds and providing more details about how the money will be spent .
The Senate could vote on the issue as early as Thursday .
In general , the threat of blocking the release of the TARP funds appears to be one with which the average American is sympathetic .
Given three choices of what to do with the remaining funds , 62 % say Congress should block the release " unless more details are provided about how the funds will be used , " and another 12 % say Congress should block the funds entirely .
Only 20 % favor Congress ' simply allowing the funds to be released .
The differences by political orientation in response to this question are not as large as one might expect or as large as is typical in such situations , particularly given that the survey question explicitly referred to Obama in connection with allowing the release of the funds .
A majority of all three political groups favor blocking the funds until details are provided about how they are to be used .
Democrats are somewhat more likely to say they favor just allowing the funds to be released , and Republicans are more likely to say they favor blocking the funds entirely , but both of these percentages are below 30 % .
Implications
A clear majority of more than 6 out of 10 Americans are willing to have Congress block the release of the second half of the TARP funds unless more detailed explanations of how the money is to be spent are put forward .
President - elect Obama has perhaps already begun to meet these requirements by going to Capitol Hill Tuesday and explaining in more detail how the money will be spent .
The Obama team also put forth a letter to Congress from Dr. Larry Summers , the new head of National Economic Council in the Obama White House , that detailed how the TARP money will be spent .
All of these efforts , at least as far as the American public is concerned , would appear to be justified if the $ 350 billion is to be released .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,011 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 13 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
W es Jones is adamant .
" The architect 's role , " he insists , " is to place us in our world , to say something about how we live . "
A building is n't just a building , declares the Los Angeles architect , author and academic , but an argument for the better world that has yet to be created , a proposal , suggestion , or model .
But architecture is also an economic and bureaucratic exercise , subject to the pressures of time , money and rules as much as gravity and climate .
" Architecture constitutes most of the environment we live in , " Jones points out .
" Architecture gains its right to impose on us by accepting this responsibility . "
But , he adds , " North American culture is n't attuned to the possibilities of what architecture can do . "
Alas , neither are many North American architects .
Known for his tech - heavy projects – everything from houses to theatres to cooling plants – Jones has been spending time at the University of Toronto architecture school , where he holds this year 's Frank Gehry International Visiting Chair in Architectural Design .
" I like Toronto , " says the Santa Monica - based practitioner .
" It 's like New York without all the depressing parts .
Like most Americans , I see Canada as a nicer , better version of the U.S. I feel inherently safer here . "
Regardless of where we live , Jones continues , we share one essential characteristic : " We 're no longer able to have a direct experience of nature . "
It 's not that nature is dead ; it has been replaced by technology , which reveals natural processes as it replaces them .
" Technology teases nature into unhiddenness , " says Jones , quoting German philosopher Martin Heidegger .
" The world is not available to us except through technology ; technology makes things visible . "
Which brings us to Jones ' other point , namely that every building is a machine for doing something .
The idea comes , of course , from Le Corbusier 's ( in ) famous remark that a " a house is a machine for living in . "
Though the comment appears to reduce that most sacred of spaces – the human habitation – to something cold and mechanical , Jones argues that in the most literal sense it is true .
Which may be why Jones ' buildings tend to look extraordinarily complex ; like the hot - rodders he so admires , he derives enormous pleasure from the physical facts of architectural structures – beams , stairwells , windows , louvers and the like .
One of the projects documented in an exhibition of Jones ' work at the school 's Eric Arthur Gallery ( 230 College St. ) , is F2 , a " souped up " response to Mies van der Rohe 's celebrated glass residence , Farnsworth House .
" It elaborates or extends the logic of the iconic features of the original , " Jones explains .
The best part of Mies ' structure , he says , was less the thing itself than the idea behind it .
His task was to marshal technology to its service – but not to hide it in the process .
Indeed , Jones ' creations have an exaggerated industrial aesthetic that verges on fantasy .
" ... the work , " Jones writes in his most recent book , El Segundo , " is a product of that same uniquely American spirit of technological bricolage that produces the hot - rod and the lunar rover . "
Though Jones insists his architecture represents a strictly rational , technologically informed response to a given need , his buildings speak a similar architectural language .
Jones 's fascination with corrugated steel walls , shipping containers and exposed structures bring a post - apocalyptic edge to his projects .
The beach houses are elegantly minimalist , the UCLA Chiller Plant makes a monument of machinery , but some of his " packaged homes " of stacked ISO containers anticipate a happily improvised future of recycled equipment and backyard innovation .
" I 'm building a vernacular for a world that does n't yet exist , " says Jones .

Anti-piracy organizations are known for their excellent lobbying skills .
However , knowledge of the Internet and technology does n't seem to be a prerequisite .
Recently the Lithuanian anti-piracy outfit changed its name , but forgot to register the new domain .
It now belongs to the owner of one of the largest BitTorrent sites in the country .
There are a lot of BitTorrent users in Lithuania , and the two largest BitTorrent sites in the country , Torrent.lt and Linkomanija.net are in the top 20 of Lithuania ’s most visited websites .
Of course , a country with plenty of ‘ pirates ’ has to have its own anti-piracy organization , and Lithuania is no different .
The local anti-piracy outfit goes by the name ANVA , an acronym for ‘ Antipiracines Veiklos Asociacija ’ .
Their main targets are the local BitTorrent sites , which they have announced they will sue for millions in damages .
To use the word ‘ Lithuania ’ in a Lithuanian organization ’s name requires government approval .
Recently , ANVA changed its name to LANVA , after they succeeded in getting this authorization .
This seal of approval may give the organization more credibility , but there is a small problem .
They forgot to register the domain lanva.lt when they changed their name .
Before , they were using anva.lt , but while they did make a new logo with the L included , registering a new domain did n’t come to mind .
Usually , mistakes like this can be easily overcome by paying a certain amount of money to the person who was smart enough to register the domain , but not this time .
Kestas Ermanas , the owner of one of the largest BitTorrent sites in Lithuania , registered the domain as soon as he found out about the name change , and he is not planning to hand it over to his arch rival .
The domain Kestas bought currently displays the following message : “ This is how it works .
Whatever you sink , we build back up .
Whomever you sue , ten new pirates are recruited .
Wherever you go , we are already ahead of you .
You are the past and the forgotten , we are the Internet and the future . ”
LANVA has scheduled an emergency meeting next Thursday to discuss what they can do to get the lanva.lt domain in their possession .
The chances that they will get the domain through a dispute are very slim though .
There have been several cases in Lithuania where large companies sued owners of domain names , and they lost every single time .
This is not the first time that an anti-piracy organization has had a domain dispute with a BitTorrent site .
October last year The Pirate Bay got hold of the domain name of IFPI , under which they wanted to launch the “ International Federation of Pirate Interests . ”
The case was later lost by The Pirate Bay , but the fact that they acquired it in the first place is yet another example of the tech illiteracy of these organizations .
Psychic Warfare from 1981 -2008
PSYCHIC WARFARE from 1981 - 2008
" I never liked to get into debates with the skeptics , because if you did n't believe that remote viewing was real , you had n't done your homework . "
-- Major General Edmund R Thompson
The year I was born , in 1981 , the US Government decided magick was real .
Well , the " US Government " is of course an abstraction -- specifically , Congressional Research Service was commissioned to do a report on psychic phenomena and offered the following conclusion :
" Recent experiments in remote viewing and other studies in parapsychology suggest that there exists an interconnectiveness of the human mind with other minds and with matter .
This interconnectiveness would appear to be functional in nature and amplified by intent and emotion . "
That sounds like a pretty accurate description of magick to me .
Score one for the weirdos , right ?
Of course , I do n't expect you to believe that .
Ignore any claims that would n't get made outside a college - level physics textbook .
There is no need to believe in non-human or " extra- dimensional " intelligence , no need to believe in telekinesis , no need to believe in any of the claims made by the magick community .
They are merely designing rituals to alter their perception and experiencing self - generated hallucinations .
The illusion of moving images is a puzzle that humans have cracked to great success , and by flashing sequential photographs at 24 frames per second or more , we get to watch movies -- windows back in time .
Humans have even learned to " fake " three - dimensional objects with holographic technology .
If it can be engineered , it can be reverse engineered .
If these people are " merely " altering their own consciousness and then taking their own imagination at face value , these rituals can be modeled , measured and ultimately replicated .
It is obvious , both to skeptics and to practicing magicians , that most of the words , props and staging involved with ritual is a matter of personal preference and probably not integral to the actual effects .
The basic effects we 're discussing here need to be stated precisely .
Human beings , through mental effort and concentration , can work physical effects in the outside world without any visible or measurable force being exerted .
These effects are indeed small and slight , but that 's all humans have ever needed .
Psi is worth studying because with enough data and discussion , we can figure out the mechanism at work behind this .
The second that 's done , humans will be working on replicating , enhancing and amplifying these effects with technology .
We 've figured out how to pull off some amazing magic tricks with elemental forces of nature .
Electricity was once an obscure and controversial phenomenon , too .
Rational materialism objects that the human body does n't produce enough energy to account for these effects , but this is thinking on the wrong level of scale .
As humans on the surface of a spinning planet being exposed to solar and interstellar radiation , we are constantly swimming in energy fields .
It would be a subtle but powerful biological trick to harness this energy .
Biology does that more or less constantly , on every level of scale .
I 'm not talking " spiritual " or " ethereal " anything , this is simple as photosynthesis , and amazing as the oceans dancing through space with the moon .
Another explanation for psi phenomena that gets invoked a great deal is quantum physics .
I suspect that the experimental basis of quantum theory is very relevant , but not the proposed explantions .
Even the founding fathers were not satisfied with their own explanations .
What did Erwin Shroedinger think of quantum physics ?
" I do not like it , and I am sorry I ever had anything to do with it , " he said .
The reason quantum theory is weird , stated nakedly , is that it contradicts almost everything we experience in our daily lives .
Sober and eminently rational men of science took a peek into the smallest level of scale that humans can percieve -- so far -- and what they found baffled them and defied the existing , Euclidian concepts of physics .
The traditional narrative explanation holds that science gradually accepted the fact that at the quantum level , all the rules suddenly change .
Personally , I think that 's not a necessary step : science had it wrong to begin with , and at the quantum level , their measuring equipment is precise enough to prove it .
The results of the classic quantum experiments -- results that you yourself can reproduce -- are strong evidence for human psi phenomena .
In other words , I am claiming that the results of these experiments are determined and directly affected by the scientists who observe them .
This is not the same as claiming " we create the universe , " just pointing out that our interaction with the universe interferes with our measurements .
Everyone who shaped Quantum Physics disagreed with one another , vehemently and often totally , about the meaning of their own work .
Einstien rejected the " spooky " aspects of the entire system , Heisenberg thought that Schrodinger 's work was " disgusting , " and Schrodinger in turn was " repelled " by Heisenberg 's theories .
Not surprisingly , Schrodinger and Heisenberg both proved themselves right .
This , in and of itself , is a very valuable lesson that 's very difficult to learn .
For instance , if you disagree with my version of quantum theory , you 're not wrong ... but then again , neither am I .
POINTS FOR RESEARCH .
" Often one hears , ' I believe in telepathy ' or ' I do n't believe . '
But what does this really have to do with belief ?
That is not a scientific formulation of the question .
We need to research those problems scientifically . "
-- Lazar Soukarebsky
In 2008 , do we have the technology nescessary to radically alter the perception and thoughts of other human beings , without their knowledge ?
We live in a world where many technological advances are supressed , either by military classification , corporate secrecy , or vested interests who would be threatened by change .
However , based on limited knowledge through de-classified and publicly available resources , it looks like the answer is a definite yes .
The two most common methods of forced consciousness change are electromagnetic signals and pharmaceutical drugs , and both methods have long , colorful research histories involving military , religious , and corporate forces .
However , it 's worth considering that the media environment itself provides the most important technology of control , hidden in plain sight .
This is even more signifigant when you consider that the science of memetics is still very much in a pre-paradigm state .
There 's no working explanation of how memes actually transfer and replicate themselves , and no functional description of what a " meme " even is .
Most proposed theories are biological metaphors : language as a virus , for instance .
Most of these metaphors hold up beautifully , especially viewing human culture as a stigmergic communication network , such as an ant or bacteria colony .
Stigmergy is the invisible system behind swarm behavior , where critters alter their environment to leave cues for other critters .
There 's no central planning , but the behavior that emerges will appear to be intelligently guided .
There 's a simpler and more disturbing possibility , based on the 1950s research of Herbert Krugman .
He discovered early on that television watching induces a shift towards right brain dominance in human primates .
This phenomenon also triggers the release of endorphins , and seems to indicate that television is literally and physically addictive .
If this is the case , then nearly anything that goes on a TV screen would have powerful mental and physical effects .
A number of eminent scientists have proposed theories of new fields in order to explain psi phenomena .
Rupert Sheldrake has outlined remarkable research into morphogenetic fields , which enable instantaneous communication over vast distances .
Another quality heretic is Ervin Laszlo , a very respected man who 's probably lived far longer than some would like .
He left the Club of Rome , disgusted with their elitism and technofascist beliefs , and then added injury to insult by publishing " Science and the Akashic Field : An Integral Theory of Everything , " which suggests that our Universe shares background information fields of zero point quantum fuzz with every other possible Universe , simultaneously .
Perhaps it 's nothing so grandiose .
I 've recently been re-reading Marvin Minsky 's book " Society of Mind , " which is a collection of single - page essays about the component parts of consciousness .
Minsky was an early AI researcher , who has been guided by the assumption that consciousness is the sum of thousands of small , unremarkable parts : simple biological calculations , energy transfers , and information coding .
Although I do n't buy his argument , I 've found the book is more compelling when read in reverse : as a working description of how a whole society 's mind would actually work .
The physical principle of entrainment also has implications for a possible psi mechanism .
Recent brain research has generated a lot of publicity for " mirror neurons " as the physical explanation for human empathy , as well as the physical entrainment that happens during human interaction .
Questions of entrainment lead to questions of scale .
If other humans can exert powerful unconscious effects on us , what about the larger environment ?
Earth is constantly radiated with energy from the sun , other stars , and ambient galactic space weather .
In the history of parapsychology research , though , experiments indicate that all this energy flow is not enabling psi phenomena .
In fact , most sources agree that exposure to ambient energy fields inhibits psi strength and performance .
" Of particular interest here is the growing literature in parapsychology suggesting that perceptual psi , both in the lab and spontaneously in life , improves as GMF fluctuations decrease . "
-- Dean Radin , The Conscious Universe , pg. 177
" When you 're inside [ a Faraday cage ] , a psychic , for example , has their performance increased by a thousand fold .
A Faraday cage shields you from the electromagnetic radio waves , allowing only extremely low frequency ( E.L.F . ) magnetic waves to get through .
I do n't think there 's a psychic warfare research lab that does n't make use of them today . "
-- Andrija Puharich , random online interview ... bear in mind his credibility is roughly on par with an average politician .
It should come as no surprise that some people have exceptional psychic skills -- the same is true for baseball , music and all other forms of human endeavor .
However , if psychic ability is a basic human potential , then this material should be useful for anyone interested in this phenomena , regardless of " natural talent . "
Mystical traditions are full of conflicting dietary restrictions , and many trance mediums were vegetarians who avoided refined sugars .
In the absence of any biological mechanism for psi , it 's impossible to judge any of this tradition except for personal experimentation .
If psi is related to DNA biophontonic effects , then perhaps the sugar ban is not superstition , as refined sugar has been shown to reduce the biophotonic emission of human DNA considerably .
The health implications and even the cause of DNA emitting biophotons remain unknown .
All of this , of course , is ultimately conjecture in the face of the unknown .
That 's a good thing , too .
Despite billions of dollars , global resources , and classified technology , the monkeys who think they 're in charge are n't any closer to The Truth than the rest of us weirdos .
This much we do know : do n't bet against human potential .
Perhaps this is all self - delusion .
Of course I want to believe human beings have psychic powers , but that 's just hippie optimism from an overgrown kid who read too much X - Men .
With both neurology and physics in a transition state , I 'm selectively cherry - picking anomalous facts to make my fantasy sound more " scientific . "
Still :
Most of you reading this have psychic mutant superpowers you 're currently unaware of .
Unlocking them is a means of mentally and emotionally enabling yourself , as well as doing the research to understand your abilities and better manipulate them .
There is nobody else to do this research for us .
There are no trustworthy experts -- in fact , most of the best writers in the field are con artists and anonymous pseudonyms .
A revival of " scientific illuminism " has never been more important than it is in 2008 .
Although there 's a great deal more money in gathering followers , our best tool for meaningful progress is communication among equals .
If you can hook people and make learning sexy , that 's magic at the highest level .
When lies become true , most humans call that prophecy , some folks call that public relations , and a few carnival hoodlums recognize a great pitch .
Every idea already exists , but few of them have ever been pitched persuasively .
I know what you 're thinking .

Hellgate : London has been on death 's door for some time now , but there seems to be some hope for the beleaguered MMO .
HanbitSoft , the company responsible for maintaining the game in Korea , has announced that they will continue to support the title worldwide , and will be dropping subscription fees in favor of a free - to - play model .
The servers are officially scheduled to be closed on the 31st of January , after Flagship Studios ' closure and Namco Bandai pulling the plug .
Hanbitsoft is the current owner of the Hellgate IP , and has promised to continue to support the title with future patches and updates , worldwide .
This will likely be good news for the fans that are still around , as the game always did show quite a bit of promise .
I never got around to giving Hellgate : London a try , but free sounds like just the right price point .
Here 's hoping HanbitSoft gets things sorted out in time .

Police are investigating whether the incident was an accident or an attack
An actor narrowly escaped death after slashing his throat on stage with a real knife , instead of a blunt stage - prop blade .
Daniel Hoevels slumped to the floor with blood pouring from his neck during a performance at Vienna 's Burgtheater .
He was rushed to hospital with a deep slice to his throat which fortunately missed his main artery .
Austrian police are investigating whether the incident was a mistake or a deliberate attack on the actor .
" If the actor had put a little more pressure on the knife or even struck an artery , he would probably have bled to death on the stage , " a doctor who treated Mr Hoevels , 30 , told the newspaper Oesterreich .
The real - life drama happened last weekend during a performance of Friedrich Schiller 's play Mary Stuart , about Mary Queen of Scots .
Mr Hoevels 's character was supposed to commit suicide and the actor used what he thought was a blunt prop weapon .
Applause for ' stunt '
The audience is said to have applauded what they thought was a stunning special effect , and only realised something was wrong when the actor staggered off stage to receive treatment .
Austrian police launched an investigation and have not ruled out the possibility of foul play , Austrian media reported .
They were told that the knife had been bought at a local shop .
" The knife even still had the price tag on it , " one officer said .
Mr Hoevels recovered after hospital treatment and , in true theatrical tradition , appeared on stage the following night although with a bandage around his neck .
Alec Baldwin on Jennifer Aniston Kissing Scene : " It Was Painful "
was minding his own business last night at a Time Warner Center gala when a Huffington Post reporter tapped him on the shoulder and tried to get the ' skinny ' on his recent kissing scene withon 30 Rock .
When prompted to dish about his guest co-star , Baldwin offered , " It was painful .
I mean , every man who had to make out with her on TV and movies , I do n't know how they do it . "
We 're not sure if he meant ' painful ' in a physical sense or a mental sense .
We 'll let our readers decide for themselves .
Aniston played a ' crazy putty ' character in an episode that implied that unstable women are better in bed .
HP baited Baldwin by asking if he thought that this premise is true in real life .
Baldwin , who was married to and then repeatedly trashed his ex Kim Bassinger , would n't bite on that one .
He did say that he did n't think the premise held true for crazy men and then decided he needed to clarify : " I will say this on the record , I never slept with a crazy man . "
We do n't make the news ..... we just report it .
Check out our photo gallery below and a clip from 30 Rock .
The cost of virtual functions is often invoked as a reason to C++’s poor performance compared to other languages , especially C .
This is an enduring myth that , like most myths , have always bugged me .
C++ myths are propagated by individuals that did not know C++ very well , tried it one weekend in 1996 , used a bad compiler , knew nothing about optimization switches , and peremptorily declared C++ as fundamentally broken .
Well , I must agree that C++ compilers in the mid-90s were n’t all that hot , but in the last fifteen years , a lot have been done .
Compilers are now rather good at generating efficient C++ code .
However , the cost of calls , whether or not they are virtual , is not dominated by the the call itself ( getting the address to jump to and jumping ) but by everything else surrounding the call , like the stack setup and argument passing .
Let us debunk that myth by looking at what types of calls are available in C and C++ , how they translate to machine code , and see how faster or slower they are relative to each other .
Function call methods .
C and C++ offer the following call methods :
Direct .
This is the normal function call , where the address of the function is known at compile - time — or patched at link time , in either cases , the address is fixed in the code at run-time .
The call itself will consist of stack set up ( we ’ll be back later on this ) and of the call on a constant .

The call itself will consist of stack set up ( we ’ll be back later on this ) and of the call on a constant .
Indirect .
This is usually known as call by function pointer , where the address of the function is unknown at compile - time but held in a variable that may be modifiable by the program at run-time .
Example of these are callbacks , and object oriented programming , which is entirely possible ( if painful ) to do in C.
Function pointers will have their natural use in a number of design patterns such as visitor , observer , or just event handling .

Function pointers will have their natural use in a number of design patterns such as visitor , observer , or just event handling .
Inline .
inline is a compiler directive to instruct the compiler to eliminate the function call by placing the function ’s body at the point of call .
By doing so , the compiler eliminates the overhead of setting up the stack and doing the call , but at the possible cost of code expansion .
The compiler takes inline as a hint , as it will apply heuristic to determine whether or not inlining the function will result in performance gain .
If the compiler estimates a positive gain , the function is inlined , if the compiler estimates a negative gain , the function is called normally .
This is indeed what the standard says the compiler should do ( C++ ISO 14882:1998 § 7.1.2 ) .
In C and C++ , inline also modifies the function ’s storage semantics , preventing the function modified by inline from having external storage ( C99 , ISO 9899:1999 § 6.7.4 ) .
However , the compilers are free to instantiate a hidden copy of the inline function to make normal calls .
Basically , the compiler does what it wants with the keyword inline , treating it like register , a hint for optimization , and nothing more .
However , compilers are rather smart when you use proper optimization switches , they may well inline the function you asked for , and even other functions .
Generally , a function with one or two arguments with just two or three lines of code will be inlined automagically .

Virtual .
In Object Oriented Programming , inheritance and polymorphism warrant the use of indirect function calls so that the correct function is called even though a given object is manipulated as a base type ( with a is - a relation ) .
Virtual functions ensures that the right function is called for the actual object type , regardless of as what type it is manipulated , greatly simplifying code and helping to ensure correctness .
Implementation may vary from language to language , but in C++ , for each object having virtual functions , there ’s a hidden pointer to a table that is created for the class , the VMT , the virtual method table that holds the function pointers .
Each time a virtual method ( method is object oriented lingo for “ member function ” ) is called on an object , the address of the function is retrieved from the table .
This is clearly only a special case of indirect calls , only that the function pointers are hidden and that the compiler generates all the necessary code and storage to manipulate them transparently .
In particular , the compiler generates the code to fill the table when the object ’s constructor is called .
The mechanics of function calls .
Although the particular may somewhat vary from processor to processor , and from compiler to compiler , calls are performed more or less the same way because C and C++ enforce a particular type of stack management .
In C , and C++ , the stack management is split between caller ( the one that performs the call ) and the callee ( the function that is called ) .
The caller pushes the arguments on the stack in reverse order , then performs the call .
The call instruction pushes the current instruction address on the stack , and this address will become the return address , where the code is to resume execution when the function call returns .
Upon return , it is the caller ’s task to clean up the stack by popping ( unstacking ) the arguments .
The callee will set its own stack environment , ensuring that the stack is restored when it exits , so that the at the top of the stack the return address is found , allowing the code to resume normally , returning to the caller .
The callee will only modify the stack in its own frame , using it to store its local variables .
Stack manipulation is supported by a set of specialized instructions which vary depending on the processor , but they basically offer push , pop , and clean up ( a massive pop that simply discards pushed data ) .
The call instruction is basically a push - jump instruction , where the current address ( or the address of the next instruction ) is pushed on the stack before jumping to the specified address .
The return instruction is therefore a pop-jump instruction , where the target address is retrieved from the top of the stack ( popped ) before jumping at the retrieved address .
So , to perform a call , the caller evaluates the arguments and push the resulting values in reverse order on the stack before calling the function .
The function creates its own local storage , accesses the arguments , cleans up its local storage , returns .
The caller then cleans up the arguments from the stack , and program execution resumes .
You may ask yourself why the the caller must push the arguments in reverse order .
Well , the reason is that C ( and C++ ) allows the use of the ellipsis , the feared and troublesome ... that one finds in function such as printf , and that is used to pass an indefinite number of arguments to a function .
The prototype of printf is :
int printf ( const char * format , ... ) ;
And only the position of the first argument must be known .
Pushing it last , it means that it is a known position , that is , the top of the stack ( just under the return address ) .
The cost of calls .
So , clearly , the cost of a call , by itself , is not much :
Direct .
If the address is known at compile time , the call is merely a push with a direct jump at a known address embedded in the instruction .
The penalty incurred is processor - specific : whether it breaks the address prediction , flushes the pipeline , jumps to an address for which the code is not in cache , etc , but those penalties apply to all types of calls .

Indirect . ,
If the call is indirect , we add the extra cost of fetching the address from a memory location .
Clearly , using a simple function pointer is not going to cost much more than adding a single read from memory .
Typically , a function call such as fonction_ptr ( arg1 , arg2 ) ; will translate into this x86 code : push arg2 push arg1 call function_ptr // loads the value from // memory location where function_ptr may expand to a complex address generation instruction , like eds : [ ebx+some_offset ] , but that is not very costly as processors are optimized to handle those efficiently .
Of course , if you have the idea of doing something like : function_ptr [ thingie -> method[ arg3 ] ] ( arg1 , arg2 ) ; the cost increases dramatically , as a lot of operations are needed to get the destination address .
This may be useful , but you ca n’t complain about the performance loss .

Clearly , using a simple function pointer is not going to cost much more than adding a single read from memory .
Typically , a function call such as Inline .
Inlined function have no call cost .
They may perturb the optimization of your code and have an adverse effect , but the call code is removed .
However , that does not dispense one from evaluating the arguments , which is always costly .
Also , the compiler may decide not to inline the function at all , in which case it will behave exactly as a normal direct call .

Virtual Functions .
Virtual functions are only indirect calls , but the pointer is stored in a table for the class rather than some other location in memory .
The following : an_object ->virtual_function ( arg1,arg2 ) ; will compile to something similar to : push arg2 push arg1 // esi almost always contains THIS already mov edx , [ esi+vmt_offset ] // loads the vmt pointer ( *) call [ edx+method_offset*sizeof_ptr ] // calls from memory location where the vmt_offset is a constant , determined at compile time .
The instructions may even be optimized further using the fact that the this pointer is already in a register , or using more complex instructions such as lea ( for load effective address , a “ do it all ” address calculation instruction provided by x86 CPUs ) .
Moreover , the line marked by ( * ) may be simplified if the VMT is stored as the beginning of the object , as it is with G ++.
But the cost of a call , whatever the flavor , is dominated by the evaluation of its arguments .
We saw that indirect calls , whether C - style or C++ virtual methods , are inherently inexpensive .
A call to a virtual method is not any more expensive than an indirect call using a struct member ( something -> function ( arg1 , arg2 ) ) so deeming virtual function as incredibly slow is just misinformed .
However , care must be exercised when comparing performances between languages .
One must understand exactly what the programs in different language do exactly , and how the semantics — the subtle , tenuous differences — impact program performance .
Of course , if a minimal translation of a program in language A to language B does n’t do the same thing , any conclusions drawn on performance are moot .

This is the eleventh post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lecture sixteen , which introduces the concept of Greedy Algorithms , reviews Graphs and applies the greedy Prim's Algorithm to the Minimum Spanning Tree ( MST ) Problem .
The previous lecture introduced dynamic programming .
Dynamic programming was used for finding solutions to optimization problems .
In such problems there can be many possible solutions .
Each solution has a value , and we want to find a solution with the optimal ( minimum or maximum ) value .
Greedy algorithms are another set of methods for finding optimal solution .
A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment .
That is , it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution .
Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions , but for many problems they do .
In this lecture it is shown that a greedy algorithm gives an optimal solution to the MST problem .
Lecture sixteen starts with a review of graphs .
It reminds that a graph G is a pair ( V , E ) , where V is a set of vertices ( nodes ) and E ?
VxV is a set of edges .
If E contains ordered pairs , the graph is directed ( also called a digraph ) , otherwise it 's undirected .
It also gives facts , such as , for all graphs , | E| = O ( |V|2 ) , and if a graph is connected then |E| >= | V| - 1 .
It also mentions handshaking lemma - sum over all vertices of degree of the vertex = 2|E| (? v?V degree( v ) = 2|E| ) .
The lecture continues with graph representations .
Graphs are commonly stored as adjacency matrices or as adjacency lists .
Adjacency matrix of a graph G = ( V , E ) is an nxn matrix A with elements a ij = 1 , if edge ( i , j ) ?
E and a ij = 0 , if edge ( i , j ) ?
E .
Here is an example of adjacency matrix for a digraph G = ( {1 , 2 , 3 , 4} , { {1 , 2} , { 1 , 3} , { 2 , 3} , { 4 , 3}} ) :
You can see that the element a ij of matrix A is 1 if there is an edge from i to j , and the element is 0 if there is no edge from i to j ( i is row , j is column ) .
The storage space required by this representation is O ( |V|2 ) .
For dense graphs this is ok , but for sparse it 's not ok .
Adjacency list of a given vertex v ?
V is the list Adj[v ] of vertices adjacent to v .
Here is an example of adjacency list for the same graph :
Storage required by this representation is O ( V+E ) .
The lecture progresses with the problem of minimum spanning trees ( MSTs ) .
It 's stated as following : given a connected , undirected graph G = ( V , E ) with edge weight function w : E -> R , find a spanning tree that connects all the vertices of minimum weight .
Here is an example of a MST .
The MST of the graph is colored in green .
The MST connects all the vertices of the graph so that the weight of edges is minimum .
Analyzing the MST problem in more detail , it is appears that MST contains optimal substructure property - if we take a subgraph and look at its MST , that MST will be a part of the MST of the whole graph .
This is dynamic programming hallmark # 1 ( see previous lecture ) .
It also appears that the problem of finding an MST contains overlapping subproblems , which is dynamic programming hallmark # 2 .
Hallmarks # 1 and # 2 suggest that we could use a dynamic programming algorithm to find a MST of a graph .
Surprisingly , there is something more powerful than dynamic programming algorithm for this problem - a greedy algorithm .
There is a hallmark for greedy algorithms :
Greedy choice property - a locally optimal choice is globally optimal .
Lecture continues with a theorem and a proof that a greedy local choice for a MST is globally optimal choice .
This is the key idea behind Prim 's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree of a graph .
The idea in the algorithm is to maintain a priority queue Q ( keyed on minimum weight of edge connected to a vertex ) of vertices that are not yet connected in the MST .
At each step the algorithm takes a vertex from Q and goes over all edges , connects the edge with minimum weight to MST and updates keys of neighbor vertices ( please see the lecture or lecture notes for the exact algorithm and an example ) .
The lecture ends with running time analysis of Prim 's algorithm .
As it uses a priority queue , the running time depends on implementation of the priority queue used .
For example , if we use a dumb array as a priority queue , the running time is O ( V2 ) , if we use a binary heap , the running time os O ( E·lg ( V ) ) , if we use a Fibonacci heap , the running time is O ( E + V·lg ( V ) ) .
Another well known algorithm for MSTs is Kruskal 's algorithm ( runs in O ( E·lg ( V ) ) , which uses a disjoint - set data structure , that is not covered in this course ( but is covered in Chapter 21 of the book this course is taught from ) .
The best known algorithm to date for finding MSTs is by David R. Karger ( MIT ) , Philip N. Klein ( Brown University ) and Robert E. Tarjan ( Princeton University ) .
This algorithm was found in 1993 , it 's randomized in nature and runs in O ( E + V ) expected time .
Here is the publication that presents this algorithm : " A Randomized Linear - Time Algorithm for Finding Minimum Spanning Trees " .

Former UN head Kofi Annan and the former US president Jimmy Carter have cancelled a planned trip to Zimbabwe .
They said the government had not granted them visas , making their two - day visit , with Nelson Mandela 's wife Graca Machel , impossible .
The three international figures are part of a group called the Elders , set up to tackle world conflicts .
Earlier , Zimbabwe 's government denied a report that it was seeking to block the visit .
" We had to cancel our visit because the government made it very clear that it will not cooperate , " Mr Annan told a press conference in Johannesburg .
Power - sharing deadlock
The three said they were very disappointed and that the sole aim of the trip had been to help people in Zimbabwe , and that they had no intention of becoming involved in any political negotiations .
Mr Carter said they had applied for visas " several weeks ago " but that the government was " determined to prevent our entering Zimbabwe " .
Mr Annan said that there had been no clear explanation from the Zimbabwean authorities as to why they were not welcome .
Zimbabwe 's government has made no immediate comment .
The state - owned Herald newspaper had previously reported a government official as saying the planned mission was biased .
President Robert Mugabe 's ruling Zanu -PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) are in a power - sharing stand - off following disputed presidential elections earlier this year .
Aid groups say Zimbabwe is facing a major humanitarian crisis , with nearly half the population needing food aid by early next year .
The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe , which has killed nearly 300 people , has created a new sense of urgency .
Human rights activist Graca Machel said the Elders had planned to meet people and hear first - hand about the scale of the humanitarian crisis .
The Elders will now stay in South Africa to brief themselves about the situation in Zimbabwe and the neighbouring countries .

More than one in five women has a secret Santa Claus fantasy , according to dating website BeNaughty.com .
As you can guess by their URL , their subscribers probably were more inclined to fantasy about numerous holiday icons , so guard your turkeys at Thanksgiving .
Research by the site reveals that women find the chubby , bearded gift - giver very sexy indeed .
More than 1,000 women were asked whether they fancied Santa Claus in the poll .
1 in 10 even wear a Santa costume themselves in the bedroom , though a beard and breasts probably says more about the men they are with than it does the women themselves .
" We can't decide whether it 's the beard , the red suit or his obvious kind and friendly nature that makes him appealing , " said Max Polyakov , head of BeNaughty.com .
It could of course be that he brings a lot of presents and smiles a lot .
Or just that he brings presents .
Northern women were most attracted to jolly Santa , with almost one in three ( 32 % ) from Sheffield and one in three ( 31 % ) from Glasgow saying they found him sexy .
The survey also revealed that one in 16 ( 6 % ) men had , at one time or another , dressed up as Santa Claus in the bedroom .
Men from Cardiff were the most prolific - more than one in 10 ( 11 % ) said they had dressed as Saint Nick for their partner .
So , women , if you have a thing for Santa , get thee to Welsh .
Note that on the other 364 days of the year , he will be bald and yell at the TV during football games .
9 % of women had worn a sexy Mrs Claus outfit , with an even higher one in six ( 17 % ) Liverpudlian women saying they had slipped into the red and white outfit .
The survey
12,102 female members were surveyed through the website from 1 - 5 December 2008 and were asked ' Do you find Santa Claus fanciable or sexy ? '
11,009 male and female members were also surveyed through the website from 1 - 5 December and were asked ' Have you ever dressed in a Santa Claus or Mrs Santa Claus outfit in the bedroom ? '
( Total survey base : 23,111 )

Yesterday we noticed that our new baby has some goop in his one eye when he cried .
As the day went on , it got worse – but only when he cried , which led me to believe that it had something to do with his tear ducts .
A quick check online took me to ehow.com where one of their contributors had posted this remedy .
Apply a warm compress on the newborn baby ’s eye .
Using your knuckle or pinkie finger apply a small amount of pressure at the inner edge of your baby ’s eye and make short sweeping strokes in a downward motion .
this encourages the tear duct to open .
Express a few drops of breast milk and drop into the infected eye .
Antibodies in the breast milk will help fight the infection .
Repeat four to five times a day .
Yes you read right …
They wanted me to drop breast milk into my little guys eyes – so I did and it worked !
We used a warm cloth to clean the goopy stuff , pressed on his swelled duct to move the infected stuff out ( lots of stuff came out , which reduced the size of it ) and then put a couple of drops of breast milk into it to make it better .
Everything looks good this morning , but I may have to repeat this today if it comes back when the little monkey starts to cry .

Napoleon of North Beach to give up his gavel PROFILE : Aaron Peskin Term limits force out S.F. supervisors ' powerful , polarizing president - for now
Outgoing San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin Walks on Green Street in San Francisco's North Beach on Wednesday , Dec. 31 , 2008 .

It takes Aaron Peskin a long time to walk a block in North Beach .
Everybody knows him , and the San Francisco supervisor eats up the attention .
He talks with a priest , asks a homeless man how he 's doing , greets Chinese women carrying pink shopping bags with a booming " Hello ! " in Cantonese .
" We 're going to miss you , man ! " Steve Mahoney , a street cleaner , tells him .
" I 'm not going anywhere ! " Peskin responds .
That 's just what his enemies fear .
After eight years representing District
Three on the Board of Supervisors and four years as the panel 's president , the polarizing Peskin is termed out of office and will preside over his last meeting Tuesday .
Love him or hate him , nobody thinks the Napoleon of North Beach is gone for good .
Although he says he has no plans to run for another office , city insiders say he loves politics too much to get out and expect him to set his sights high .
" Oh yeah , he 'll run again , " said former Mayor Willie Brown , a former adversary of Peskin 's who now enjoys dinners out on the town with him .
" Mayor is a distinct possibility . "
In the meantime , Peskin , 44 , will continue to wield power as chairman of the city 's Democratic Party and is likely to keep close tabs on his former City Hall colleagues .
" I am willing to bet I will be getting text messages from him during board meetings next year with suggestions and ideas , " said Supervisor Sean Elsbernd .
San Francisco is a different city from when Peskin came to prominence in the late 1990s as the president of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers , successfully working against the destruction of the Colombo Building and the addition of a Rite Aid drugstore to the neighborhood .
Back then , the city 's economy was thriving amid the dot - com and real estate boom , but neighborhood activists thought supervisors were giving Mayor Brown and his developer allies a free hand to run San Francisco .
In 2000 , with district elections replacing a citywide vote for supervisors , Peskin and five other City Hall newcomers were elected to the board in an anti-Brown tidal wave .
Peskin still has a collage of dozens of his campaign buttons , one of which reads , " Annoy Willie : Elect Peskin . "
Under Peskin 's leadership , the board has become a full - time body with far more power than it used to have , and has developed a penchant for annoying first Brown and then Mayor Gavin Newsom .
Voters agreed to a big pay raise for supervisors - they now make $ 93,000 , up from $ 38,000 - and to give the board president the right to appoint people to a variety of commissions , rather than leaving the mayor alone in charge .
" Despite all the chatter about the board being out of touch or too left , the voters have been with us , " Peskin said .
Authority on planning
Peskin's bailiwick has been land use and planning , and he understands the city 's 1,200 - page planning code better than just about anybody .
He killed a Brown - blessed plan to build a huge mall at Piers 27 through 31 and a runway expansion project at San Francisco International Airport , and got voters to approve banning chain stores in some neighborhoods and to create a commission for historic preservation .
Although it is largely disliked by developers , Peskin 's board has also approved major projects along Market Street , on Rincon Hill and at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard .
In November , the supervisors approved a sweeping plan to rezone and build housing on 2,200 acres on the eastern side of the city .
In the process , the board has often squeezed more affordable housing or social services money out of developers .
" Contrary to what even some of my friends believe , he has n't been a one - trick pony , " said financier Warren Hellman , who said Peskin 's support was invaluable in building the parking garage in Golden Gate Park that serves the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum and the California Academy of Sciences .
" He has n't just been the doctrinaire anti-business , anti-institutional kind of guy . "
Supervisor Chris Daly said Peskin 's planning decisions have been guided by his assessment of what is appropriate for each of the city 's varied neighborhoods .
" It 's about having those who will be impacted by planning decisions having a voice in what gets decided , " Daly said .
Universally described as whip - smart and fearless - he once posed in a Speedo swimsuit for a local magazine - Peskin has written and won approval for 205 ordinances in his eight years on the board , making him the most prolific supervisor in at least a decade .
Rarely loses
Constantly working the phones and making the rounds of City Hall , he 's rarely on the losing side of a vote .
By some accounts he carries more clout than Newsom , who unlike Peskin has a tough time scraping together board majorities .
" People beat a path to his door when they 're trying to make something happen in city government , " said Supervisor Bevan Dufty , a Newsom ally .
" Aaron could get six votes to make Wheaties the official cereal of San Francisco . "
Peskin 's relations with Newsom have been frosty at best .
Mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard was dismissive of the board president , saying Peskin does n't have as much influence as he'd like to think .
" Peskin knows that he is n't likable enough to be elected mayor , and so he has relentlessly promoted himself as a surrogate mayor , " Ballard said .
Still , even Newsom 's department heads realize they must win over Peskin to get anything done .
Mitch Katz , the city 's public health chief , said that when he wanted to ban tobacco from drugstores or pass a bond to rebuild San Francisco General Hospital , he called Peskin .
" Perhaps that 's why he 's liked by many and not liked by many , " Katz said .
" Someone who just presides over the meetings will not cause such strong feelings as someone who really determines the course . "
Getting in trouble
At times , however , Peskin has wielded his clout with a heavy hand .
In 2007 , port Director Monique Moyer went to the Department of Human Resources about a series of late - night phone calls from Peskin to port officials threatening their jobs because of a disagreement over building - height limits on the waterfront .
Peskin also tried and failed to eviscerate the city 's Department of the Environment after its director differed with him on the city 's energy policy .
Supervisor Michela Alioto - Pier said that when she spoke out against Peskin 's successful Muni overhaul measure , the board president switched his vote on a piece of her legislation , essentially killing it .
She said he also stripped her of her committee assignments and told her , " Payback is a bitch . "
The vitriol has n't been limited to city officials .
In 2007 , Bok Pon , a retired Richmond District resident , got involved in an unsuccessful recall effort of Peskin .
Pon filed a police report after Peskin allegedly called him at 10:30 p.m. and told him , " You are wrong , and you will take that to your grave . "
Pon said it sounded like a threat .
Authorities declined to file charges against Peskin , who called Pon " certifiably crazy . "
Alioto - Pier said she knows of dozens of people , inside and outside city government , who have had their jobs or projects threatened by Peskin .
Few come forward , she said , because of fear of retribution .
" People are really scared they 're going to have to pay dearly for it , " she said .
Peskin said he knows he has a reputation for being a " 5 - ( foot ) - 4 , dictatorial son of a bitch , " but he does n't think he 's ever acted inappropriately .
" I do this job 20 hours a day , " he said .
" I call people at 7 o'clock in the morning and 9 o'clock at night .
I 've played rough , and I 've gotten rough in return .
" It 's not that I want people to fear me , " Peskin said , " but they 've got to take you seriously and know you mean business . "
Late - night calls
Pon , Moyer and others who have received late - night calls from Peskin say he often sounds drunk .
Peskin said alcohol has never gotten in the way of his work , though it " might exacerbate " his tendency to voice his opinions forcefully .
" It might add to a feeling I already have , but I can let people have it without having a drink , " Peskin said .
As for what comes next , Peskin said he wants to " mellow out " for a while , and will spend a month hiking in Patagonia .
Then he 'll return to co-running with his wife , Nancy Shanahan , a nonprofit called Great Basin Land and Water that preserves land in Nevada and is headquartered in North Beach .
He 'll also continue to serve as chairman of the Democratic County Central Committee .
In the November elections , more than 80 percent of candidates and ballot measures endorsed by the group won - and all four candidates for open Board of Supervisors seats backed by Peskin and his allies were elected .
Democratic committee focus
Peskin said he hopes to make the Democratic committee more visible on large issues , as opposed to day - to - day City Hall matters .
Former Mayor Art Agnos said Peskin could turn the group into a power center for San Francisco .
" If he exercises that as astutely as he did the presidency of the Board of Supervisors , I think the Democratic Party will be greatly strengthened and far more productive than it has been in the past , " Agnos said .
But will Peskin ever return to City Hall ?
Robert Haaland , a political organizer for the Service Employees International Union and a friend of Peskin's , said he thinks the outgoing supervisor wo n't stay out forever .
" It 's hard for me to imagine a world of politics without Aaron Peskin in it , " Haaland said .
" And it 's hard for me to imagine he wo n't want to be in . "
When news broke of Bernard Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion worldwide Ponzi scheme , news accounts first protrayed him as a shadowy hedge fund manager outside the scope of regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
But as the sheer magnitude of the fraud became clearer , so did the picture of Madoff 's place in the Wall Street - Washington world .
Madoff 's businesses were actually subject to a variety of financial regulations , something Madoff would actually use as a selling point to investors .
Last year in a speech , Madoff said , " In today 's regulatory environment , it 's virtually impossible to violate rules . "
He registered as an investment adviser in 2006 , and had been under the SEC 's extensive regulatory framework for securities broker - dealers since he founded his firm almost 50 years ago .
And far from being a shadowy figure , Madoff was a pillar of the financial establishment .
He showered campaign contributions on politicians , mostly Democrats .
He was also quite chummy with many of the financial regulators charged with overseeing him .
For instance , Clinton administration SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt , who has championed onerous mandates like the burdensome Sarbanes - Oxley accounting mandates to preserve " market intergrity , " appointed Madoff during his SEC tenure to what the New York Times describes as " a large advisory commission ... that explored the rapidly changing structure of the financial markets . "
An even closer connection was SEC assistant inspections director Eric Swanson who , according to CNBC reporter Charles Gasparino , " was part of the team that examined Madoff 's brokerage firm " in 1999 and again in 2004 .
" During those exams , the SEC team said it found almost nothing wrong , " Gasparino writes in The Daily Beast .
In 2007 , after leaving the SEC , Swanson married Madoff 's niece Shana , who is the regulatory compliance attorney at her uncle 's firm
While there is no evidence of wrongdoing with regard to Madoff by either Levitt or Swanson , SEC officials , for whatever reason , looked the other way , despite numerous allegations and " red flags , " some received as early as 1992 .
And since 1999 , rival investment manager Harry Markopolos had sent the agency detailed analysis of why he though Madoff consistent postive returns were mathematically impossible without running a Ponzi scheme or insider trading .
In a 2005 submission he made to the SEC that was recently made public by the Wall Street Journal , Markopolos charged that it was " highly likely " that " Madoff Securities is the world 's largest Ponzi scheme . "
But despite the SEC 's incompetence in heeding these warnings , many are still arguing that to prevent future Madoff - type frauds , we need more regulations that give more power to the SEC .
But it 's hard to see how any additional powers could have made a difference in this case , given that the SEC almost seemed determined to look the other way for violations of the most basic rules against securities fraud that had long been in place .
Since hedge funds were among Madoff 's clients ( and biggest victims , as this WSJ editorial points out ) , calls are again being intensified for further hedge fund regulation to bring them under the cumbersome registration process for investment advisers .
( The SEC already has full authority to investigate hedge funds and other unregistered investment entitities if there are suspicions of fraud . )
This is what the agency tried to do a few years ago , only to have a three - judge federal appeals court panel throw out the rule in 2006 in a unanimous finding that the agency had stretched the law .
But the SEC can't argue that this would have helped them prevent Madoff 's fraud , because , as noted above , Madoff had registered as an investment adviser in 2006 , and was registered as a broker - dealer for decades .
This broker - dealer registration gave the SEC full power to investigate all affiliated businesses .
As MarketWatch commentator David Weidner pointed out ( in a column with a curious headline about " lack of regulation " that is the exact opposite of the author 's point -- often columnists , unlike bloggers , do n't wite their own headlines ) , " Broker - dealers are supposed to be the most scrutinized of the investment community .
If Madoff was running separate businesses , the SEC and FINRA should have been looking at all of them as a whole . "
In fact , the fact that Madoff was under such heavy regulation probably helped him in constructing the alleged facade .
As business reporters Binyamin Appelbaum and David S. Hilzenrath wrote in their perceptive Washington Post article , " the fraud Madoff allegedly constructed was successful in part because it avoided the appearance of risk . "
The article quoted an expert as saying that SEC regulators " had to make judgments , and they decided to look at derivatives , short sales , insider trading , all the things that Madoff never had . "
So The SEC was too busy hounding unregistered hedge funds , short - sellers , and entrepreneurial companies for trivial minutiae from Sarbanes - Oxley and other mandates to notice the fraud right in front of them .
The regulators did n't just " drop the ball , " as President - Elect Barack Obama recently asserted .
They lost focus on where the most important " ball " was .
Getting that " ball " back by paying attention to warning signs about where the real fraud is , and rolling back the mounds of red tape on honest investors and entrepreneurs that also wastes the time the agency has to go after the real problems , must be the number one priority of newly designated SEC chairman Mary Schapiro
Ashlee Simpson Defends Jessica Simpson 's Weight ( Photos )
The internet went crazy yesterday after photos surfaced oflooking like she had put on some pounds .
The singer performed at a concert put on by Radio 99.9 Kiss in conjunction with an annual chili cook - off in Pembroke Pines , Florida on Sunday .
Jessica 's little sister Ashlee Simpson is disgusted with all the attention that the news is giving to her sister 's weight .
Ashlee took the time to address this situation on her blog .
" Since when did a woman 's weight become newsworthy .
A week after the inauguration and with such a feeling of hope in the air for our country , I find it completely embarrassing and belittling to all the women to read about a woman 's weight or figure .
All women come in different shapes , sizes and forms and because you 're a celebrity , there should n't be a different standard . "
Ok , we do n't think she 's overweight , what we do think is that her stylist is to blame and that person should get fired ASAP .
Those awful high - waisted pants would make anyone look like they have put on a few pounds and the belt right under her chest is n't doing anything positive for her figure either .
More photos below , including a few from her ' daisy duke ' days .

With Body Language Like This , Who Needs a Caption ?
I was struck by the photo above , which accompanied a Times article about President - elect Obama ‘s first news conference .
Not only does it give us a good look at many of Obama ’s economic advisers , but it ’s a great study of photo - taking body language .
Many photographers
I know have nicknames for the way people stand when they ’re having their pictures taken , and in this picture you can see just about every option :
The “ fig leaf ” pose ( hands coupled and held in front ) as exhibited here by Joe Biden , Larry Summers , and others ; the “ toy soldier ” pose ( hands stiffly at sides ) as exhibited by William Donaldson ( far left ) ; what looks to be the “ hands - in - pocket ” pose , by Paul Volcker , to the immediate right of the podium ; and , although you ca n’t see it in this photo ( I saw it in another photo of the event that I can no longer locate ) , the “ firing squad ” pose ( hands behind back ) exhibited by Bob Rubin , who in this photo is mostly hidden behind Biden .
But the real outlier here is Rahm Emanuel , hands on hips , eyes scanning the room , looking ready to intervene in any way necessary .
What shall we call this pose ?
“ Football coach ” ?
“ Bad cop ” ?
Or , as some have said of Emanuel , “ absolute enforcer ” ?
Bolivians yesterday approved a new constitution granting more power to the country 's indigenous majority and rolling back half a millennium of colonialism , discrimination and humiliation .
After a bruising struggle between supporters and opponents of the president , Evo Morales , the country voted to adopt the new constitution in a referendum .
The charter confirms Bolivia – the second poorest country in South America after Guyana – as a leader in the regional " pink tide " of leftwing governments that have ousted traditional elites and challenged US influence .
Yesterday , Morales , who wept for joy when the draft of the new constitution was agreed last October , told a crowd in front of the presidential palace that the vote signalled the start of a new era .
" Here begins the new Bolivia , " he said .
" Here we begin to reach true equality . "
The president said the charter would " decolonise " Bolivia by championing indigenous values lost since the Spanish conquest .
It also includes clauses on land redistribution and sets aside seats in Congress for minority indigenous groups .
However , in Boliva 's conservative eastern lowlands , a semi-tropical stronghold of European descendants , there was widespread opposition to the constitution , with critics saying it was a recipe for ruin , division and authoritarianism .
They argued that the focus on indigenous communitarism ignored the freewheeling capitalism that drives the eastern plains ' huge cattle ranches and powerful soy industry .
There were bloody clashes between pro and anti-government supporters , including miners armed with dynamite and peasants with machetes , during the drafting of the charter .
Several people died , hundreds were injured and Bolivia was left dangerously polarised .
Yesterday , Moises Shiriqui , the cowboy - hatted mayor of the eastern provincial capital , Trinidad , said there was still fierce opposition to the new constitution .
" In five states , we 're rejecting the constitution , " he said .
" In five states , we have another vision of the country . "
An unofficial tally by the Bolivian television network ATB showed the constitution winning with 59 % of the vote .
The quick count had a 3 % margin of error , and was mirrored by two private exit polls .
An official vote count will be announced on 4 February .
The constitution also gives Morales the opportunity to run for re-election and remain in power until 2014 .
He is expected to go to the polls again in December in an election that will also elect a newly reorganised Congress with seats set aside for minority indigenous groups .
A provision granting autonomy for 36 indigenous " nations " and four opposition - controlled eastern states is at the heart of the constitution .
But both groups are given a vaguely defined " equal rank " , which critics say will create rival claims to open land in Bolivia 's fertile east , home to the large agribusiness interests and valuable gas reserves that drive much of the country 's economy .
With an eye to redistributing land in the region , the constitution limits future holdings to either 5,000 or 10,000 hectares ( 12,000 or 24,000 acres ) .
Current landholders are exempt from the cap in a nod to the cattle and soy industries .
Morales , an Aymara Indian , has allied himself closely with the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chávez .
He expelled the US ambassador and drug enforcement administration agents after claiming they had conspired against his government last year .
Washington denied the allegations .
Elected in 2005 on a promise to nationalise Bolivia 's natural gas industry , Morales has increased the state 's presence throughout the economy and expanded benefits for the poor .
In 2006 , his reform project nearly failed when an assembly convened to rewrite the constitution broke apart along largely racial lines .
The following year , three college students were killed in anti-government riots , and 13 mostly indigenous Morales supporters died when protesters seized government buildings to block a vote on the proposed constitution in September .
But even Oedipus eventually saw the light ( or so Sophocles tells us — you decide ) .
Somewhere in my freshman year of college , my mind , thankfully , began to close a little and the world started to open up .
I was on the slow boat to recovery . . . and then calamity struck .
A “ friend ” lent me his copy of Bellow ’s “ Herzog . ”
If ever there was a candidate for strict Congressional oversight , it is this cunning little book .
Moses Herzog is a professor in the full throes of midlife crisis who writes countless letters to the famous literary and intellectual dead .
These scintillating one - sided exchanges , in which Herzog quotes and spars with the great minds of Western civilization , made me feel that I was mastering life as I read them , just as a budding music historian might have the delusion that he was mastering the piano simply by listening to a sonata by Beethoven .
In fact , as I discovered many years later , Bellow was joking .
What he wanted to demonstrate , in the figure of poor Herzog , was the utter ineffectuality of the most potent ideas .
Thanks for letting me know , pal .
Since nobody at the time bothered to let me in on all the fun , I finished “ Herzog ” as , well , Herzog .
At job interviews , I assured prospective employers of my immunity to distraction by affectionately invoking Artistotle ’s observation that copulation makes all animals sad .
To puzzled women on dates , I expatiated on Hegel and Sombart .
“ What ’s wrong ? ” one girl asked me as we stared into each other ’s eyes and I smiled ruefully .
“ Oh nothing , ” I said .
“ Spinoza associated desire with disconnected thinking — that ’s all . ”
And so it went , just like that , reaching the high point of absurdity when I applied for a job at a publication called The Social Register , thinking that it was a socialist magazine .
I had been reading Gramsci by way of Silone by way of Engels on the Manchester working class .
So enthusiastic had I become about the sweeping inexorabilities of dialectical materialism that I neglected to pick up an actual , material copy of The Social Register .
Grando mistako .
If I had , I would have seen that it was not a socialist magazine at all , but a comprehensive directory of America ’s high society .
My interviewer , a pleasant , 40 - ish man in a rumpled white shirt and tie , sat in his Fifth Avenue office and listened politely , his lip curling ever so slightly , to my reflections on hegemony , slave consciousness and “ boring from within . ”
He even walked me to the door .
I hope you are at least partly convinced by the power of my examples .
Somehow , we ’ve been sold a bill of goods about how literature empowers us .
But the idea that great literature can improve our lives in any way is a con as old as culture itself .
The University of Chicago ’s Great Books course ?
Think Tammany Hall .
“ Willing suspension of disbelief ” ?
Code for : distract him while I lift his wallet .
The government regulates drugs , alcohol and ( finally ) bad lending practices .
How long can we continue to allow the totally laissez - faire dissemination of literature ?
Not even a warning from the surgeon general or the attorney general , or some sort of general , on the back of every book ?
It was years before I realized that if life is a voyage of sorts then the best thing to do is to keep busy in the depths of your little boat — your life — polishing , tuning , cleaning , repairing the engine that is your own inborn strength , without regard to extraneous aids in the form of culture .
Facing it , always facing it , that ’s the only way to get through .
O.K. , I got all that from Conrad .
The fact is that “ facing it ” has gotten me into trouble , too .
I tell you , these people are hard to shake .
Troubled Times for Tacheles Landmark Berlin Squat Battles Eviction
It is a classic Berlin faceoff : the squatters against the investors .
Usually the latter win , but property at the landmark Berlin art squat Tacheles is under receivership and the fate of the site is uncertain .

Asian markets were massacred Friday , led by a 9.6 percent plunge in the Nikkei , as the global economic slowdown slashed earnings prospects for an array of companies , forcing investors to look to safer government bonds .
The stronger yen has been particularly damaging to the competitiveness of Japanese exporters as it curbs their overseas profits when they are brought home and erodes the competitiveness of their products .
A handful of companies that have expressed positive outlooks have not been able to turn investor sentiment around to focusing on value rather than on the uncertainty of economic factors .
The yen climbed against the euro and other high - yielding currencies on rising risk aversion , hitting a 13 - year high against the U.S. dollar .
Oil prices gained on expectations OPEC would agree to cut output in an emergency meeting in Vienna , with Iran suggesting that it lower production by 2 million barrels a day .
Crude futures are currently trading above $ 68 a barrel .
Japan's Nikkei 225
Average plunged 9.6 percent to hit a 5 - ½ year closing low , having lost 50 percent this year , with exporters hit by the double punch of a Sony profit warning and a sharply higher yen .
Sony plunged more than 14 percent after the company halved its full - year profit forecast by 57 percent , to far below market estimates in its second downward revision this year , blaming a firmer yen and slowing demand for cameras and flat TVs .
It is a new day in America , and a new day on " The View . "
Can you guess which co-host of the ABC gab fest said this today ?
" Today is a victory for this country : to have Barack Obama be our president , the first black president , the first black first lady .
To have the amount of voters -- 14 million more voters in this election than the last -- present themselves and vote in this election .
Today is victory . "
What about this ?
" In seeing the amount of people that were able to gather with enthusiasm , ignited and ready to move this country in a fresh direction under Barack Obama , I think he has a gift .
And I think with everyone ’s support and prayers , he has the ability to really move us in a new place . "
Was it Joy Behar ?
Whoopi Goldberg ?
Nooo .
It was Elisabeth Hasselbeck , the lone Republican voice on the panel and passionate supporter of Sen. John McCain who recently accused Behar of drinking the Obama Kool - Aid .
Hasselbeck and Behar have been arguing a lot lately .
Behar has staunchly supported president - elect Barack Obama and the two women have reportedly been fighting behind the scenes , though they adamantly deny that .
Today , after Hasselbeck " made nice " with the president - elect , Behar took the opportunity to gloat .
" What are you saying ?
I was right all along ? "
Behar said and laughed .
The two women shook hands .
Then Behar explained how she viewed the election :
" For me , this was a triumph over negative campaigning .
And I appreciate that about Americans today .
That they did n’t fall for the Jeremiah Wright ads and this association baloney .
They went for themselves .
For the country .
And it ’s such a wonderful feeling . "
The real winner , all women seemed to agree , was America .
Goldberg opened the discussion by saying that she was bowled over when her mother admitted to her on Tuesday night that she did n't think America would elect a black president in her lifetime .
" And the realization that hit me and really messed me up for a lot of the night was that as an American , I always thought of myself as an American with all of the promise that America holds , " Goldberg said .
" But suddenly last night I felt like I could put my suitcase down finally .
" When people say , everybody can be president ... this is a moment where you realize that you have become the fabric of America , that people really do want greatness for the country and they ’re willing to do as much as they can to bring it about .
And I was so knocked out by it . "
Co-host Sherri Shepherd was so emotional about Obama 's win that she could n't contain her tears while trying to explain why she finally decided to cast her vote for him .
Shepherd was undecided until the very end .
" I took my son with me and he kept saying , ' Barack Obama , we did it !
We did it !'
We ’ve always had these limitations on us .
And I remember somebody in my family , when I said I wanted to be a comic and an actor , ' Go get a job at the post office , they do n’t let people like us do that . '
So to look at my son and say , ' No limitations on you . '
It is an extraordinary day for me to be able to tell my son .
[ Sarah Palin ] spoke to me as a mother who has a child who has special needs .
But this spoke to me more .
And I know there are people who died to be able to see this day . "
Walters played a clip of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 " I Have A Dream " speech after explaining her feelings .
" None of us who are white can know what you feel , " she said , looking at Shepherd .
" And I did n’t cry last night .
But this morning I was brushing my teeth and they had an excerpt of Martin Luther King .
I remember that .
It was 1963 and I found myself crying .
It struck me so that I ’ve asked to just play a little bit of that for you who are too young to remember and for those of you who remember and finally his dream came true . "

RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Friday denied the Israeli - Palestinian peace process sponsored by U.S. President George W. Bush was a failure , saying it should lay the ground for an eventual deal .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Launched nearly a year ago at a conference in Annapolis , Maryland , the negotiations were hampered from the start by violence and bitter disputes over Jewish settlement building and the future of Jerusalem .
“ We knew ... that if that agreement was not reached by the end of the year , there would be those that would say that the Annapolis process , the negotiations , had failed .
In fact , it is quite the opposite , ” Rice told a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
“ While we may not yet be at the finish line , I am quite certain that if Palestinians and Israelis stay on the Annapolis course , they are going to cross that finish line and can do so relatively soon , ” she added .
The White House acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that Bush ’s goal of a deal on Palestinian statehood before he leaves office in January was “ unlikely ” to be achieved .
Abbas and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni made public commitments to Rice to continue the negotiations , which the secretary of state insisted had narrowed the gaps between the two sides .
Barack Obama , who won the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday , takes office on January 20 but it is unclear how soon he will engage in Middle East peacemaking .
SETTLEMENT DISPUTES
“ We hope that the new administration will begin immediately tackling the Middle East issue so we would not waste time , ” Abbas told reporters .
He also said he complained to Rice about continued Israeli settlement building , “ incursions ” into Palestinian areas and what he called a “ dangerous escalation ” in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest .
U.S. officials attributed the failure to reach an agreement this year to Israel ’s decision to hold an early parliamentary election , scheduled for February 10 .
With Abbas at her side , Rice cautioned Israel about continued building activity in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank , calling it damaging to peace prospects .
Bush had hoped an end - of - term deal would bolster a legacy burdened by the unpopular war in Iraq .
U.S. officials said Rice , whose trip includes a brief visit to Jordan on Friday and stops in the West Bank city of Jenin and the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh , has no plan to float her own proposals to strive for a last - minute deal .
They also played down the possibility of the two sides agreeing on a document summarizing where the negotiations stood , saying there was a need to preserve the talks ’ secrecy .
Rice on Thursday said it was an “ open question ” how the Bush administration would hand over the matter to Obama ’s team .
President Bush : \ " All life is a gift from our Creator that is sacred , unique , and worthy of protection . \ "
Bush : ' Sanctity of Human Life Day '
In one of his final actions in the White House , President Bush on Thursday declared Jan. 18 to be “ National Sanctity of Human Life Day . ”
“ All human life is a gift from our creator that is sacred , unique and worthy of protection .
On National Sanctity of Human Life Day , our country recognizes that each person , including every person waiting to be born , has a special place and purpose in this world , ” reads the presidential proclamation .

“ The most basic duty of government is to protect the life of the innocent .
My administration has been committed to building a culture of life by vigorously promoting adoption and parental notification laws , opposing federal funding for abortions overseas , encouraging teen abstinence and funding crisis pregnancy programs , ” the proclamation continues .
“ The sanctity of life is written in the hearts of all men and women .
On this day and throughout the year , we aspire to build a society in which every child is welcome in life and protected in law .
We also encourage more of our fellow Americans to join our just and noble cause .
History tells us that with a cause rooted in our deepest principles and appealing to the best instincts of our citizens , we will prevail . ”
Bush is scheduled to deliver a farewell address Thursday night which White House counselor Ed Gillespie described during the morning briefing as “ optimistic and future - oriented . ”
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Bank of America said late Thursday that it plans to cut up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as the financial giant adjusts to a recession and completes the pending acquisition of brokerage firm Merrill Lynch & Co .
This comes as the latest wave of mass layoffs in the troubled financial sector , which has been crippled by the credit crunch and the failure of large institutions such as Lehman Brothers LEHMQ .
More than 220,000 jobs already have been lost across the sector this year , according to labor - tracking firm Challenger Gray & Christmas .

Advertisement China has censored parts of the new US president 's inauguration speech that have appeared on a number of websites .
Live footage of the event on state television also cut away from Barack Obama when communism was mentioned .
China 's leaders appear to have been upset by references to facing down communism and silencing dissent .
English - language versions of the speech have been allowed on the internet , but many of the Chinese translations have omitted sensitive sections .
Selective editing China keeps a firm grip on the country 's media outlets and censors their news reports as a matter of routine .
Like the rest of the world , it has been keenly following developments in the United States ; President Obama 's inauguration was front page news .
But the authorities seem not to want ordinary Chinese people to read the full , unexpurgated version of the president 's speech .
In his inauguration address , President Obama said : " Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks , but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions . "
That entire passage was retained for an English - language version of the speech that appeared on the website of state - run Xinhua news agency .
Xinhua did not mention the word " communism " in its Chinese version But in the Chinese - language version , the word " communism " was taken out .
President Obama 's comments addressed to world leaders who " blame their society 's ills on the West " also fell foul of the censor 's red pen .
" To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent , know that you are on the wrong side of history , " the president said .
Once again , Xinhua included the passage in full in its English version , but the sentence was taken out of the Chinese translation .
Similar changes were made to versions of the speech that appeared on other websites based in China .
And websites were not the only media organisations that struggled to report some of the comments made by President Obama .
China Central Television , the country 's main broadcaster , aired the speech live with a simultaneous Chinese translation .
But when the translator got to the part where President Obama talked about facing down communism , her voice suddenly faded away .
The programme suddenly cut back to the studio , where an off - guard presenter had to quickly ask a guest a question .
Censoring sensitive news reports is nothing new in China , where officials go to great lengths to cut critical material .
These officials appear a little nervous about the arrival of a new US President , who might not be as friendly to China as President George W. Bush .
As an editorial in the state - run China Daily put it : " Given the popular American eagerness for a break from the Bush years , many wonder , or worry to be precise , whether the new president would ignore the hard - earned progress in bilateral ties . "

The UN Climate Change Conference in Poznan , Poland is ground zero for world leaders looking to take the next steps in tackling global warming .
The international conference is aimed at negotiating a new agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , and to be finalized in Copenhagen in December of 2009 .
Since the U.S. pulled out of Kyoto , and Bush ’s environmental impotence has done nothing but obstruct progress , Greenpeace is urging the U.S. — and President - Elect Barack Obama — to commit to science based reductions in global warming .
In fact , during the last week Greenpeace activists have protested the conference in Poland , with a handful even occupying a coal plant .
Greenpeace hopes the following principles will be included in any agreement :
• Strong global caps on emissions in developed countries
• Substantial funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency
• Funding to end deforestation in developing countries
• Funding for adaptation to global warming impacts in vulnerable countries .
On Saturday , Greenpeace will be holding rallies in 30 cities across America .
Here in San Francisco , they will be showing off a 30 x 50 ft. banner ( pictured above ) in front the Golden Gate Bridge .

Why Dropping a Stone Makes a Jet
The thin stream kicked up by dropping an object in water results from a kind of squirting action by the fluid , according to experiments and simulations .

A disk pulled rapidly into water generates a jet that is explained by a sort of toothpaste - squeezing scenario , according to researchers who used simulations and high - speed video cameras .

A disk pulled rapidly into water generates a jet that is explained by a sort of toothpaste - squeezing scenario , according to researchers who used simulations and high - speed video cameras .

The splash of a solid object into water–be it a coin or an Olympic high diver–is capped off by a thin jet of fluid shooting straight up from the surface .
The detailed explanation of this seemingly simple event has proved elusive .
Now researchers publishing in the 23 January Physical Review Letters think they have a more complete explanation than their predecessors .
Using a combination of theory , simulation , and experiment , they studied the collapse of the air cavity trailing the submerged object , concluding that it ejects water like toothpaste squeezed rapidly from its tube .

A disk is pulled into water at 1 meter per second , creating a water jet that is explained by a new theory .
A solid object plows a roughly symmetrical tube of air into a fluid .
The sideways pressure exerted by the surrounding water quickly begins to collapse the cavity , first by pinching off the cylinder at its midpoint .
Twin jets shoot straight up and down from the pinch - off point , called a pinch singularity .
Researchers had assumed that the concentrated forces built up at the pinch point were sufficient to drive jet formation , says Stephan Gekle , a graduate student at the University of Twente in the Netherlands .
In some models , the build - up comes from a mix of so - called inertial focusing –the concentration of energy as the cavity collapses–and surface tension violently drawing the cavity shut .

Simulation of the “ pinch - off ” and closing up of the air cavity behind the disk .
But nobody had proved that the jet was a direct outgrowth of the pinch alone , says Gekle .
“ You still have the wall of the cavity , ” he says .
“ You have to consider the entire cavity collapse . ”
So Gekle , his graduate supervisor Detlef Lohse , and their colleagues –including a collaborator from the University of Seville in Spain –expanded the inertial focusing analysis to cover the whole cylinder , which closes from the pinch - off point as if zippers were being pulled up and down .
Inertial focusing occurs because water accelerates as it rushes in to fill the cylindrical cavity .
As the water begins to fill in , the circumference of the cylinder shrinks , but the total volume of water coming in per unit time remains constant .
With less space to move through , the water must speed up .
( This same principle explains why pinching a garden hose increases the stream ’s speed . )
Finally , hemmed in all around , the water has nowhere to go but up or down .
The team pulled a 4 - centimeter - diameter circular disk down through a water surface at 1 meter per second and used high - speed imaging to track the base of the jet as it moved up from the pinch - off point .
Then they simulated the jet base on a computer .
The simulated and real motion agreed closely , although the simulated jet base ascended faster than the real one , a discrepancy Gekle blames on the slight asymmetry of the real thing .
The formation of the jet was the same whether or not they included surface tension in the simulation , indicating that whatever role it may play prior to pinch - off , surface tension was not driving the jet by flinging water up like a trampoline tossing an acrobat , as some had speculated .
The simulation in turn agreed with a mathematical treatment , which together gave the team new insight into the jet - generation mechanism .
“ Our new mechanism says that the exact driving of the pinch - off … is not the most important factor in the game , ” Gekle says .
Instead , the group found that as the jet base moves upward , the continued inertial focusing draws in more water and accelerates it upward , much like squeezing a toothpaste tube quickly from bottom to top .
Gekle says a single push from the pinch - off point–like a single squeeze of the toothpaste tube–would not provide enough force to maintain the jet .
The study lends “ very convincing ” support to the inertial origin of jetting , says Sigurdur Thoroddsen of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , who has studied high - speed water jets experimentally .
“ The fact that it combines theory , experiments , and numerical simulation gives it extra oomph , ” he says .
He adds that researchers will learn more when high - speed video cameras become powerful enough to resolve the instant when the momentum of the rushing water switches from inward to up and down .
“ I believe there are still some surprises awaiting in this jetting geometry . ”

Reporting from Monterrey , Mexico --
In the seconds before the gunmen burst into the tiny Lozano Garza jewelry store in this city ’s downtown , three shoppers browsed the display cases .
An unarmed security guard sat by the door .
Then three men with assault rifles ran in , one after the other , the muzzles of their weapons ablaze .
By the time anyone reacted to the gunfire , it was too late .
The four people collapsed in the barrage of bullets .
One of the gunmen helped another , apparently wounded by a comrade , out of the store .
Before the last killer fled , he fired final shots into a customer and the guard .
Twenty - three seconds after they came , the gunmen disappeared into the traffic of busy Francisco Madero Avenue , lined with hardware and lighting shops , taco vendors and newsstands .
The page of a catalog on one case fluttered in the breeze .
The killers left the jewelry .
Nor did they touch the cash register .
They paid no heed to the three video cameras that recorded the entire scene .
Lying dead that afternoon of March 14 , 2007 , were an off - duty police commander and his wife , Benjamin Espinosa and Griselda Melendez , who apparently were shopping for a religious medallion in gratitude for a successful intestinal operation on their hospitalized infant daughter .
Beyond them lay Ignacia Perez , a homemaker who lived on a former garbage dump and sold jewelry to neighbors , who paid her in weekly installments .
Sprawled near the entrance was Fernando Rodriguez , an unarmed security guard who took the $ 90 - a - month job to save for his oldest daughter ’s 15th birthday celebration .
He lived in terror that someone with a gun would come through that door .
A shattered peace
The victims ’ stories intersected in that jewelry store , but the slaughter recorded on the videotape that day looks to have been rooted in a nearby town that believed itself immune from Mexico ’s drug war .
San Pedro Garza Garcia , southwest of Monterrey , backs up against the Sierra Madre Oriental , 15 miles and a world away from that jewelry store .
It is Latin America ’s wealthiest town and had long been considered one of its safest .
For years , it has been the suburban escape for the industrial dynasties -- the Sada , Garza , Zambrano , Elizondo , Rivero and other families -- that manufactured steel , glass , beer and cement , and turned Monterrey into a global economic player .
Hundreds of sampetrinos , as residents are known , hold Dallas Cowboys season tickets .
They shop at Maserati dealerships , and send their children to top - flight private schools .
Many can navigate Houston and Aspen better than the barrios where Ignacia Perez , Fernando Rodriguez and police commander Benjamin Espinosa and his wife lived .
When Espinosa was hired as a San Pedro Garza Garcia patrol officer in 1995 , it was one of the few good police jobs in Mexico .
Officers there were paid about $ 1,000 a month .
Being a San Pedro police officer “ was an honor , ” said Mauricio Fernandez Garza , San Pedro ’s mayor from 1989 to 1991 .
“ There was a lot of recognition .
They had better uniforms , of higher - quality fabric .
There was a lot of training . ”
Fresh from two years of military service , Espinosa was aggressive and disciplined .
Both his jaw and his crew cut were sharp .
“ He was a police officer 24 hours a day .
He was very active , ” said Camilo Cantu , a former San Pedro chief of police .
Espinosa went to McAllen , Texas , every few months for training and target practice sponsored by U.S. law enforcement .
San Pedro police had a maximum response time of two minutes .
That was possible because San Pedro never had much crime .
Fernandez Garza remembers no homicides during his tenure , and in a town full of banks , only one bank robbery .
No one could remember a San Pedro police officer being killed in the line of duty in those days .
The town elites kept a firm hand .
“ When a daughter was marrying someone from outside , ” said Gilberto Marcos , a businessman and San Pedro community activist , “ they ’d check his bank accounts . . . to see if his money was made right .
We used to look into who these people were , what family they came from .
If they did n’t check out , you would n’t speak to them . ”
But by the late 1990s , San Pedro was being infiltrated by the world its residents had moved there to escape .
Families from Monterrey ’s middle and upper - middle classes had swelled San Pedro to 120,000 people , triple its size in the 1960s .
The elite ’s social control ebbed .
Among the new residents were out - of - state drug - cartel families who had moved to the one town where their BMWs and bodyguards would n’t stand out .
In 2001 , San Pedro was shocked when resident Felipe de Jesus Mendivil and his wife were arrested after a shootout with police .
The federal attorney general ’s office said police found $ 7 million and jewelry in 15 suitcases , all believed to have come from drug sales the couple were allegedly laundering for the Juarez drug cartel .
That year , newspapers reported that Benjamin Arellano Felix , head of the Arellano - Felix cartel that controls the flow of drugs from Tijuana , had kept his wife and children in San Pedro for several years .
“ We started seeing signs of violence that are n’t the usual minor robberies , but rather were kidnappings or executions , ” said Jose Roberto Mendirichaga , a history professor , civic activist and San Pedro resident .
Members of San Pedro ’s elite were busy diversifying their once- regional businesses into global companies and navigating Mexico ’s bumpy democratic transition , said Oscar Flores , a historian .
“ They did n’t think [ drug violence ] could come here , ” Flores said .
“ By the time they thought all this [ drug violence ] was important , it had grown a lot . ”
By 2005 , Monterrey , one of Mexico ’s safest big cities , had become a disputed pathway for drugs headed to the United States .
The Gulf drug cartel controlled the areas of Nuevo Leon state around San Pedro ; the city became an island controlled by the Sinaloa cartel , some of whose members had moved there , said a former city official who requested anonymity out of concern for safety .
‘ These two cartels ’
“ Many of the problems we ’re seeing are really between these two cartels , ” the official said .
Family members of prominent San Pedro businessmen and politicians were kidnapped , among them the brother - in - law of the state director of public safety .
Since 2006 , five police officers have been killed .
In February 2006 , San Pedro Police Chief Hector Ayala was gunned down .
That September , Marcelo Garza y Garza , a well - known San Pedro resident and chief of state police investigations , was shot to death outside the town ’s largest Roman Catholic church .
San Pedro may have paid cops better than the rest of Mexico , but it still paid too little .
Several San Pedro SWAT officers left the department and are believed to be working for the cartels .
But Benjamin Espinosa hung in .
He rose from street cop to operations commander targeting the city ’s local drug dealers .
His new rank , with a salary of $ 1,500 a month , afforded his family a telephone but not a car .
He often used a city vehicle .
He joined a unit aimed at rooting out corrupt cops .
This year he was involved in capturing two supposed cartel gunmen .
He was scheduled to take them to a prison near Mexico City on Friday , March 16 of last year .
But on the Wednesday before , the 30 - year - old went shopping with his wife , also 30 , on Francisco Madero Avenue , in the Lozano Garza jewelry store , owned by the family of San Pedro ’s director of public safety .
Ignacia Perez spent the morning of the day she died sweeping her concrete - block house 15 miles from San Pedro Garza Garcia .
“ Nati , ” as everyone knew her , was a dark , handsome woman , the mother of four boys , and recently a grandmother , at 37 .
She lived atop what had been known as Garbage Dump No. 4 , at the foot of Cerro del Topo Chico ( Small Mole Hill ) , a mountain that cleaves the northern sections of Monterrey .
The city closed the dump and began covering it in the early 1980s , and waves of rural migrants rushed in to grab the land .
At 15 , Perez married Jose Luis Rodriguez , a Monterrey garbage man , and the couple squatted on a thoroughfare then taking shape , Avenida Esperanza -- Hope Avenue .
They built a shack of pallets , cardboard and plastic tarp , and strung copper cable to a nearby transformer for electricity .
In that shack , Perez grew into a woman and bore their sons .
Over several years , her husband built two rooms , eventually adding three others and painting it all light blue .
Years later , the city paved the streets , installed electrical lines and meters , and issued land titles .
The spider web of copper cables came down .
The once - squatted shantytown entered the new century a working - class neighborhood with most of the essentials .
City services , it ’s true , remained a rare sight .
Yet crime was relatively low .
Killings , shootings , kidnappings were things that happened elsewhere .
Through these years , Perez raised her sons .
Her husband drank heavily , and she made do with the little money he gave her each week .
Perez ’s two older sons became garbage men , got married and moved .
“ She was a nice mother , though she would scold us at times , ” said her third son , Victor Rodriguez , 19 .
“ She ’d listen to music while she swept and mopped the floors . ”
Five years ago , Perez began selling jewelry door to door for the Lozano Garza store .
She offered rings , earrings , necklaces and bracelets -- all gold - plated , and nothing for more than $ 40 .
She would go down to the store and pick up a few pieces at a time .
It was the farthest she traveled from her neighborhood .
After cleaning the house that day , that ’s where Perez headed .
She left money for the telephone , water and electricity bills on the kitchen table .
Her sons found it when they returned that afternoon ; she ’d never done that before .
About noon , she boarded a bus that took her past lines of concrete - block houses like her own and into downtown Monterrey , where she got off at a stop across the street from the jewelry store .
By that time , Fernando Rodriguez had been at his post inside the store for more than four hours .
It was a dull job .
Rodriguez would go outside occasionally to talk with Fernando Lizcano , who owned the cellphone shop next door .
“ We ’d talk about work , the family , sports , ” Lizcano said .
“ He ’d come from time to time and ask to use the phone . ”
Rodriguez , from a large rural family , had little education and few skills .
At 44 , his options were considerably reduced .
Most companies did n’t hire men his age , except as security guards .
Thus he had struggled to provide his family with a rented house on an unpaved street a mile north of where Perez lived , just west of Esperanza Avenue .
But he remained a cheerful person , untempted by drink or violence .
He was a teddy bear of a man who drew joy from his wife , Oralia , and daughters , Esmeralda , Areli and Fernanda , then ages 14 , 10 and 3 .
Sunday , his only day off , he would take them to parks around Monterrey .
The family frequently took photographs .
“ Their whole life is in their photos , ” said Oralia ’s mother , Angelica Aleman .
He sang often and loved dancing with Oralia .
His mother - in - law thought of him as her son .
As a younger man , Rodriguez sold kitchenware door to door .
He was a messenger for several years , until he broke his leg in an accident .
Then he was hired to clean and guard a beauty school downtown for $ 80 a week .
He learned to clean the school ’s clippers and machinery .
His only fear was that he would have to eject some rowdy customer .
Rodriguez spoke constantly of his wife and daughters and worried how they would manage without him .
“ They were his world , ” said Myrna de Luna , owner of the beauty school .
“ He ’d register them for school .
He ’d shop for his daughters and wife -- buy their dresses , even their underwear . ”
His main worry was saving for his oldest daughter ’s quinceañera that July .
He wanted a dance hall with a big sound system and many guests .
A few months before the deadly attack , he ’d quit the beauty school to work at the jewelry store because it paid $ 10 a week more , but he never liked the new job .
Unarmed and alone , he worried about having to protect the store .
On Saturdays he cleaned the machines at the beauty school for extra cash .
“ He was looking for money anywhere he could find it , ” De Luna said .
Most other days , he dropped by there to ask for his job back .
To work at the jewelry store , Rodriguez had to leave home early and come back late .
The morning before he left for the last time , Oralia asked her husband whether she could look for work .
Rodriguez had always said no .
But that morning , he said maybe she should , after all , interview for a job .
She went to a factory that day .
She was being interviewed in the afternoon when her family sent word that she was needed at home .
The war moves on
On the evening of March 14 , Nati Perez ’s family gathered on Esperanza Avenue , hoping .
The shootings had been reported on television and radio .
A cousin who worked at the hospital where the city morgue is located called , saying that one of the bodies looked like Nati .
Perez ’s son Victor and his aunt went to the hospital to see for themselves .
“ Her face was destroyed , but she had a mole above her lip and that ’s how my aunt recognized her , ” Victor recalled .
Monterrey officials pledged to help with the funeral .
“ It was just promises , ” Victor said .
The family buried her in the city cemetery near the state prison .
Abraham , her youngest son , seldom ate ; her husband spent his nights crying in the upstairs bedroom he had built for the couple .
He has stopped drinking .
Perez ’s sister drops by to cook and clean the house on Esperanza Avenue .
“ It does n’t feel the same , ” said nephew Joel Lopez .
“ Here my aunt was everything .
She was the one who gave the house spirit . ”
Merchants along Francisco Madero Avenue say they miss Fernando Rodriguez .
“ It took a long time to get used to the idea that he was dead , ” said Lizcano , who ran from his cellphone shop after the shooting and was the first to find the bodies .
For his daughter ’s 15th birthday last year , the Rodriguez family held a modest dinner at their house .
The jewelry store moved two days after the attack .
The storefront that housed it is the only unrented space for blocks .
The four killings remain unexplained .
The families have heard nothing from officials .
The video shows no clerks or manager in the store at the time of the shooting -- a source said the staff was upstairs eating lunch .
One theory is that the killers ambushed Espinosa to send a message to San Pedro ’s director of public safety , Rogelio Lozano , whose family owns a chain of jewelry stores that included the shop attacked .
“ The citizens have to guess , ” said Marcos , the businessman and San Pedro community activist .
“ One guess is that [ Espinosa ] was involved with one gang and the other killed him .
Or there ’s the one that you ’d like to believe , which is that , for having done his job , they killed him . ”
Kidnappings of important sampetrinos continue .
In August , 17 months after the slayings , thousands of residents marched through the streets of downtown Monterrey as part of a national mobilization against drug violence .
The cartels ’ warring , meanwhile , has drifted elsewhere ; it has left more than 6,000 fatalities nationwide in less than two years .
But in San Pedro , the killing of Espinosa created little sustained outrage .
There were no fundraisers , no trusts set up for his daughters .
The girls live with their mother ’s family .
Their grandfather , Lucio Melendez , 57 , supports them .
He earns $ 100 a week as a security guard , and wonders why anyone in Mexico would want to be a cop .

Britain 's biggest union , Unite , is calling for a crackdown on tax havens , which it claims rob the Treasury of £ 33 bn a year .
As Britain faces a bleak new year with public finances under increasing strain , Unite is urging prime minister Gordon Brown to make the " culprits " of the credit crunch pay their fair share of tax .
The union cites figures published by analysts Tax Research UK , which suggest that Britain 's top companies avoid paying £ 25 bn in tax a year through the use of tax havens .
In addition , a conservative estimate suggests that wealthy individuals - those earning over £ 200,000 a year - avoid a further £ 8bn in tax .
" A commitment to make 2009 the year Labour gets tough on the tax havens would be met with delight by hard - working families , " said Unite joint general secretary Derek Simpson .
" For years , super - rich individuals and corporations have undermined the UK's tax revenues and without decisive intervention from the government those same people would have destroyed our economy .
Thanks to them , our jobs and homes are at risk . "
There has been growing disquiet over the use of tax havens - financial " boltholes " that allow companies to pay little or no tax .
Britain joined France and Germany in pledging to get tough on tax havens and draw up punitive measures for uncooperative countries at an OECD summit in Paris , although Brown has been accused of standing in the way of a crackdown .
According to Tax Research UK , the top 100 companies have reduced their tax payments by 5 % over the past five years .
The union is calling on the government to force financial institutions to close down their structured finance operations , repatriate offshore profits and make them subject to UK tax , and close down private banking advice departments that help to exploit tax loopholes .
Clawing back just one year 's tax would have been enough to pay for the government 's £ 20 bn fiscal stimulus package , the union noted .
" The taxes these corporations and super - rich individuals avoid could go a long way to boosting the UK economy during these tough times , " Simpson said .
" The government must close the loopholes that allow the super - rich to avoid paying their fair share of tax .
It is also time for the banks to close down their private banking advice sections . "
Barack Obama , the incoming US president , has added to the pressure for further scrutiny on tax havens , commenting : " We need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our tax laws so that those who work hard and play by the rules are n't disadvantaged . "
DFLer Al Franken won an impressive share Saturday of what may be the last ballots tallied in the U.S. Senate recount , boosting his unofficial lead over Sen.
Norm Coleman to 225 votes heading into a Monday meeting where the state Canvassing Board will certify the final result of the race .
At least two things , however , still stand in the way of Franken becoming Minnesota 's newest U.S. senator : the possibility of a ruling by the Minnesota Supreme Court that more wrongly rejected absentee ballots should be counted , and a legal contest that Coleman attorneys all but promised should Franken prevail .
It took only an hour Saturday afternoon for election officials to count 933 absentee ballots that all sides had agreed were wrongly rejected .
Franken won 52 percent of them and Coleman captured 33 percent ( the rest went to other candidates or cast no vote in the Senate race ) .
It was a surprisingly muscular margin that was reflected in the glum looks of Coleman staffers and the satisfied appearance of Franken 's staff .
Franken started the day with an unofficial lead of 49 votes .
He achieved a net gain of 176 votes on Saturday .
Coleman 's attorneys said that depending on what the court decides , they would be ready to file a legal action contesting the recount results as early as Tuesday .
Recount attorney Fritz Knaak said that he believed 300 to 400 ballots would go Coleman 's way in a contest , including through the addition of absentee ballots so far excluded and the elimination of so - called " double votes " in Minneapolis .
" We are prepared to go forward and take whatever legal action is necessary to ... remedy this artificial lead that we believe is being shown now for the Franken campaign , " Knaak said .
Franken recount attorney Marc Elias was somewhat restrained in his comments following the counting , expressing satisfaction that the disputed absentee votes were counted and confidence that Franken will be declared the winner Monday .
" We are confident that since there are no ballots left to count , the final margin will stand with Al Franken having won the election by 225 votes , " he said .
The margin , he said , was " comfortable . "
Compared with previous Franken leads of four votes or 50 , he said , " 225 votes is a real victory ... [ it 's ] a close election , but it 's a fairly clear victory . "
Absentee ballot heartbreak
After the counting , Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said he was satisfied that the recount results were as accurate as they could be , given human limitations , the scope of state law and Supreme Court directives .
But he said that the entire pool of 12,000 rejected absentee ballots " break my heart " because a complicated system disenfranchised those voters .
And he said he was n't happy at all with the court order that allowed the counting of only wrongly rejected absentee ballots that both campaigns agreed to accept .
" The two campaigns got to veto the right to vote of over 400 Minnesotans , " he said .
The outcome Saturday was not a complete surprise , as the ballots counted came disproportionately from precincts where Franken did well on Election Day , according to a Star Tribune analysis .
But Franken 's margin was larger than expected , as Elias acknowledged .
" I told you when we were up 49 votes that I doubted we were going to lose more than 49 votes .
I thought we 'd gain some .
...
We obviously gained more than we thought we would , and that 's gratifying , " he said .
Focus on the court
With the recount complete , focus immediately shifted to the Supreme Court , which continued to consider a request from the Coleman campaign to alter the process and add more absentee ballots to be reconsidered .
But there was no word Saturday from the state 's highest court as to when it would rule or hear arguments .
The state Canvassing Board is scheduled to meet Monday ( and Tuesday , if necessary ) to review the tally of the previously rejected ballots , then certify the final result .
Under state law , an election certificate formally naming a winner cannot be issued until all legal disputes are resolved .
The new Congress convenes Tuesday in Washington .
The Franken campaign , Ritchie and various county officials filed responses with the Supreme Court on Saturday morning .
Franken , Ritchie and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman all argued forcefully against the Coleman petition .
They said the process for identifying wrongly rejected absentee ballots had worked as intended and should be completed .
The Franken brief argued that the Coleman campaign had missed deadlines to request reconsideration of additional ballots , and added that all rejected absentee ballots have now been reviewed at least twice by local officials .
But it appeared that the rules for handling added ballots were understood and applied differently from one county to another .
While officials in Hennepin , Ramsey and Rice counties said they had refused to consider additional ballots , officials in Anoka , Stearns and Pipestone counties said they had done so , even without agreement from the campaigns .
Much of the day Saturday was spent conducting a preliminary sorting of the ballots .
At one point , state officials painstakingly separated the secrecy envelopes from the ballots .
Gelbmann , in announcing the move to reporters and lawyers , said it was another step to preserve the secrecy of individual votes and to " preserve evidence for possible future litigation . "
Drama at day 's start
The day began with a moment of drama when Tony Trimble , a lead recount attorney for Coleman , formally asked that the counting not begin until the Supreme Court made its ruling .
" This procedure should not continue until the Supreme Court has acted , " Trimble said , reflecting Coleman 's dimming hopes of winning the recount without the addition of more ballots .
For much of the past week , the Coleman campaign had tried to force the secretary of state 's office and local election officials to add 654 absentee ballots to the total , saying they , too , needed to be reviewed .
The ballots came disproportionately from precincts where Coleman fared well in the election .
As meetings were held last week across the state to review the absentee ballots , Coleman 's lawyers were largely unsuccessful in trying to get local election officials themselves to add the 654 ballots to the official count .
CHICAGO  President - elect Barack Obama has chosen retired Gen. Eric K. Shinseki to be secretary of the Veterans Affairs Department , elevating the former Army chief of staff , who was vilified by the Bush administration on the eve of the Iraq war for his warning that far more troops would be needed than the Pentagon had committed .
In his choice of General Shinseki , which Mr. Obama will announce here on Sunday , the president - elect would bring to his cabinet someone who symbolizes the break Mr. Obama seeks with the Bush era on national security .
The selection was confirmed by two Democratic officials .
General Shinseki , testifying before Congress in February 2003 , a month before the United States invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein ’s regime , said “ several hundred thousand soldiers ” would be needed to stabilize Iraq after an invasion .
In words that came to be vindicated by events , the general anticipated “ ethnic tensions that could lead to other problems , ” adding , “ and so it takes a significant ground force presence to maintain a safe and secure environment . ”
The testimony angered Donald H. Rumsfeld , the defense secretary at the time , whose war plans called for far fewer troops .
Mr. Rumsfeld ’s deputy , Paul D. Wolfowitz , publicly rebuked General Shinseki ’s comments as “ wildly off the mark , ” in part because Iraqis would welcome the Americans as liberators .
A defense of pornography Share This :
By Martin Green
The debate over pornography is too often dominated by conservatives and liberals ; the former castigate pornography as disgusting and corrupting , the latter defend its publication with ' free speech ' arguments , but are rarely prepared to defend pornography as worthwhile and socially positive .
Far too often voices â€ “ and there are a growing number â€ “ that argue pornography / erotica is a good thing that should be defended and celebrated are not heard .
There is a major paradox here .
Never has the public acceptance of and engagement with erotica been so widespread .
The consumption of pornography in all its forms is massive ; it is a huge industry that could not exist in its present form without millions of people worldwide being avid consumers .
But among official opinion formers , especially politicians , its stock has never been so low .
Many mainstream media commentators treat producers of erotica as they would drug dealers or gangsters .
Pornography is an anathema in polite society , while hundreds of millions use it in private .
This is ' cognitive dissonance ' on a huge scale â€ “ saying one thing and doing another .
Part of the reason the anti-porn charge is so powerful is the de-facto alliance between anti-porn feminism and the religious fundamentalist right .
Any rational discussion of sex is very difficult in the USA and Britain , but especially difficult when taking a pro-porn position is likely to find its advocate decried as a priori perverted or â€ “ even worse â€ “ misogynistic .
Pornography and its advocates face among the most violent and pervasive of taboos .
Millions of pornography fans have their use of it as among their most personal secrets .
Fortunately the most articulate defence of pornography today often comes from women â€ “ in the first place Wendy McElroy , but also Nina Hartley , Susie Bright and Violet Blue .
The liberal position on the ' right of free speech ' is something that the pornography industry will shield behind , but in the end a weak line of defence .
If something is fundamentally anti-social and damaging , then free of speech arguments are n't very strong and will often falter .
Only by sex-positive , pro-pornography views being openly expressed and fought for will the argument , eventually , be won .
The core of the argument â€ “ what is sex for ?
In any case the predominant Christian view today , especially in the growing Evangelical and Pentecostal churches , but also in the Roman Catholic Church , is that sex is to be enjoyed by married couples and is primarily about having children .
In these dominant Christian traditions , sex outside or before marriage is adultery and a sin , and masturbation is also a sin .
And of course pornography is also a sin because it often involves non-married sex and promotes masturbation .
This is the ' hard core ' religious view .
Variants of the same kind of thinking are found among many non-religious people who argue sex is for expressing love between couples ( not necessarily married ) and also for having children .
This is a sort of ' soft core ' Christian - derived view .
But the actual practice of countless millions in the world reveals a contrary view â€ “ that sex is a gigantic universe of pleasure to be enjoyed and consumed in multiple ways .
For millions sex is for fun , as well as about having children and expressing loving relationships .
Yes , countless millions of young people go out at weekends to try to pick someone up and have sex ; they will probably only have one sexual encounter with that person .
Millions of others enjoy sexuality and eroticism in different ways , including pornography , without marriage or children ever coming into it .
That sex is often ' just ' about fun would not have come as a big surprise to our ancient ancestors .
According to path - breaking research by Timothy Taylor , â€ œThe widespread lay belief that sex in the past was predominantly heterosexual and reproductive can be challengedâ€ .
Taylor 's book The Prehistory of Sex ( 1 ) reveals the vigorous sexual culture of Stone Age humans , where the dominant forces were â€œhunger and sexâ€ and the forms of sexual enjoyment were multiple .
Once it is conceded the religious or semi-religious mystification of sexuality is false , then objections to erotica and pornography per se collapse .
There may be objections to aspects of pornography or the way it is done , but if it is conceded that enjoying sexuality can legitimately be ' just ' about fun and excitement â€ “ if so fundamental a human desire and need can ever have the adjective ' just ' - then there can be no logical objection to using erotic images to have sexual fun .
Nor any logical objection to producing such images .
Of course many non-religious opponents of pornography do indeed make other objections , utilising subsidiary arguments , and we deal with some of these objections one - by - one below .
Objection 1 : Erotica is fine because it is artistic in intent , whereas porn is just about getting a sexual response and is therefore worthless
This is the most frequently deployed and intellectually reprehensible argument in the porn debate .
The British art historian Kenneth Clarke used it in his famous book The Nude , although he accepted there might be ' residues ' of erotic stimulation in looking at art on erotic themes .
As Wendy McElroy points out in her path breaking book ( 2 ) , â€ œPart of the anti-porn attempt to control the debate has been the forced distinction they 've drawn between pornography and erotica .
Basically , pornography is nasty ; erotica is healthy .
What exactly constitutes erotica is never clearly expressed .
It is merely described as life affirming , while pornography is decried as degradingâ€ .
Wikipedia is plain confused on the issue : â€ œPornography or ' porn ' is the explicit depiction of sexual subject matter with the sole intention of sexually exciting the viewer .
It is to a certain extent similar to erotica (! ) , which is the use of sexually arousing imageryâ€ (! ) .
But the editor of this article does n't tell us to what extent porn and erotica are similar or what erotica uses sexually arousing imagery for .
MSN - Encarta says : â€ œErotica is a modern word used to describe the portrayal of the human anatomy and sexuality with high - art aspirations , differentiating such work from commercial pornography .â€ 
That 's a pretty typical exposition of the alleged distinction .
The organisers of the highly acclaimed London 2007 - 8 Seduced exhibition of erotica said in the exhibition programme : " The pornographic image has one job to do : to arouse for the purpose of eventual climax .
It may do its job with artistry , but it does not aspire to the reach and interpretative openness of art .
Pornography aims to eliminate distracting variables , such as complexity of character . "
But as the British feminist writer Joan Smith points out ( 3 ) , this attempt at distinction is a minefield .
Who is to say whether any image has ' interpretive openness ' and what is artistic ?
The false attempt to distinguish between pornography that is merely arousing and erotica that is artistic falls flat on its face confronted with one of the most popular forms of modern pornography , photographic ' art nudes ' .
Where does photography of the naked female form stop being erotica and become pornography ?
There are very high minded photography magazines that can be found in many libraries that publish sets of naked women that employ very high production values , imaginative lighting and presentation that would seem to incorporate many artistic values ; yet such sets would by no means be out of place in commercial pornography sites likes Met - Art , Hegre - Art and Digital Desire â€ “ much of whose content incorporates the same high production values and arguably artistic presentation .
There are thousands of individual photographers making a living out of ' art nudes ' , whose work certainly appears to involve artistic skills and values and is yet utterly sexually arousing .
But the attempted distinction between porn and erotica fails throughout the history of art .
This has been exposed by the British art critic and illustrator Tom Lubbock in the London Independent .
Talking of the late British theatre critic Kenneth Tynan he says :
â€ œIf Tynan had stayed in London , and gone to a venue on the fringes of Soho , he might have found there several equally enchanting spectacles .
He might have feasted his eyes on any number of well - built and clean young people .
And he might have enjoyed , for example , a group scene , with at its centre a young man and a woman , both naked , sweetly making love , mouth to mouth , fingers to nipples ; or another , in which a naked child whips a naked man with a topless woman looking on ; or a naked woman displayed , bound in chains to a rock ; or a naked woman having full sex with a large bird ; or an orgy involving adults , children and animals both living and dead ...
â€ œThe venue I have in mind is , of course , the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square .
And the spectacles I 've described are paintings by ( respectively ) Bronzino , Veronese , Ingres , Michelangelo ( attrib . ) and Poussin .
And every day , with no admission fee and no age restrictions , the public are admitted between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm , and children are allowed , indeed encouraged , to look at these things .
And somehow we do n't notice .
We 're experts at not noticing .
Even with our post - Freud minds , or perhaps especially with our post - Freud minds , we 're inoculated against seeing what 's in front of our noses .

( The Dirty Old Masters , Independent 20 September 2008 )
The comparison of such famous nude art with pornography might seem far fetched .
An amusing take on it is the campaign to keep the two famous â€ “ highly erotic â€ “ Titian paintings in the public domain in the UK , which means raising Â£ 50 m .
To promote the campaign the National Gallery staged a stunt involving the modern ' recreation ' of Titian 's Diana and Acteon â€ “ the photograph involved raunchy Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall and a posse of glamour models getting naked for the shoot , which duly appeared in national newspapers .
A modern recreation involves a photograph and glamour models .
That says it all .
But does the work of the grand masters of painting really involve direct sexual stimulation ?
Did it have the same function as pornography in producing sexual arousal ?
We should remember that what appears erotic and arousing depends on contemporary cultural norms .
The work of people like Raphael in the 16th century was created and displayed at a time when other public images of explicit nudity did not exist and where most people had never seen more than one other person ( if that ) naked .
The erotic arousal charge of such images at the time must have been enormous , especially as the themes are often seduction and rape .
Few paintings of course went as far FranÃ§ois Boucher 's Leda and the Swan that shows the swan staring intently at a very explicitly drawn vagina , but with that one prohibition usually observedâ€ “ no detailed representation of the vagina - the old masters were pretty explicit .
Beyond the old masters though the attempt to distinguish between erotica and pornography falls down repeatedly when confronted with particular artists .
People in North America may be surprised to know that some people in Europe have the work of Austrian Peter Fendi on their walls , and there are several internet art sites which will sell you framed versions forr your study or hall .
Fendi worked in the early 19th century as a portrait painter , but did a sideline producing erotica / pornography paintings , mainly showing sex with very explicit vaginas and penises on view .
The work is highly skilled , amusing and , well , artistic .
Pornography it certainly is , in droves .
We get into even more contentious terrain with fashion / nude photographer Helmut Newton .
When Newton died in 2004 David Bailey said : â€ œHis impact has been enormous .
He was a giant of photography and he redefined the nude .
Helmut came along and did something totally original .
His lasting legacy will be that he was seen as a great photographer , but I suppose he will be remembered for his nudes in the same way that I am still lumbered with the ' 60s . "
Newton 's agent Tiggy Maconochie , said : " His fashion photographs were an inimitable mix of eroticism , elegance and luxurious decadence .
He will continue to influence photography well into the 21st century .â€ 
Yes , but was his work pornographic â€ “ of course it was !
Wikipedia says : â€ œHis works appeared in magazines including , most significantly , French Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar .
He established a particular style marked by erotic , stylised scenes , often with sado - masochistic and fetishistic subtexts.â€ 
In other words , pornography .
When Violet Blue called porn film maker Andrew Blake ' the Helmut Newton of porn ' she made a slight mistake .
Helmut Newton was the Helmut Newton of porn .
Andrew Blake is the Helmut Newton of modern internet video porn .
Yes Newton 's work was elegant , stylish , beautifully produced if , like Tamara de Lempicka , hopelessly obsessed with the rich and famous ; but it was utterly sexually arousing .
Erotic and pornographic , same thing .
The distinction between erotica and pornography cannot be sustained because there is no authoritative way of establishing the definition of what is art and what is not .
Objection 2 : Pornography degrades women by picturing them as ' sex objects '
This objection is , on the face of it , bizarre .
How could erotica / pornography function if the models / performers in it were not portrayed fundamentally for their sexual attractiveness ?
This incidentally is also true for gay porn , where the models are all hunks or sweet boys : it has to be true , whether the models are male or female or transgender .
It does n't mean that because people are pictured as the focus of sexual attraction they are somehow degraded or objectified .
Most of us strive , for at least some of our lives , precisely to be viewed as sexually attractive and the subject of desire .
Millions upon millions would just love to be viewed as objects of sexual desire , although far fewer can achieve it than would like to (! ) , for reasons of age , shape or whatever .
Lust is normal , wanting to be the subject of it is normal too .
The very term ' sex object ' is a sleight - of - hand ideological construct which uses the ambiguity of the word ' object ' to imply ' dehumanised thing ' .
Once the term is replaced with ' subject of sexual desire ' or ' focus of lust ' then this mystification collapses .
Since pornography is about creating or stimulating sexual desire , then there is no attempt to give an overall portrayal of the life or personality of the person or people depicted .
In fact when this has been attempted , in Playboy 's little biographical essays that explain that this extremely sexually desirable young woman likes Beethoven and modern jazz and wants to be a professor of Psychology , it seems both patronising and a hypocritical attempt to conceal the obvious ; the male reader ( or lesbian reader of which more below ) is reading this magazine to provoke or satisfy their desire and really does n't care much about potted biographies and even , sad to say , interviews with James Baldwin and Norman Mailer .
At this point we should perhaps deal with the argument that modern pornography does n't just present people as sexually desirable , but is unhealthily obsessed with body parts â€ “ breasts , bottoms and genitals .
We deal further on with the issue of the type of body that pornography promotes as attractive , but here we 'll just note that there is no human society for which we have any anthropological evidence in which women 's breasts and bottoms have not been regarded as objects of sexual desire .
Even if we go back 25,000 years to the famous ' Venus ' figurines ( the most famous being the Venus of Willendorf ) , they are precisely big breasted and big bottomed .
There is nothing disgusting or abnormal about that .
You can reinvent the world so that pornography never happened , and women 's breasts would still be objects of desire and â€ “ in a society were things sexual are becoming more open â€ “ of display .
The ' sex object ' argument fails to convince because itâ€™s based on conceptual hoodwinking that turns out to be nonsense .
Objection 3 : Pornography is perverted and only used by dirty old men and other sad cases who can't have ' proper ' sexual relations
The old stereotypes about porn users persist .
Porn consumption is so huge today it is impossible to attempt any profile of the ' typical ' porn user .
Porn users can be sexually active or not , use it alone or with a partner , be heterosexual , gay or lesbian and any age from puberty upwards .
Some of the figures are extraordinary .
Seventy five per cent of all German adults in a Der Spiegal survey said they used pornography sometimes .
A third of men between 14 and 70 said they looked at porn on a daily basis .
Some eight percent of women watch porn daily .
" Pornography , in the sense of the description and depiction of sexual activities , is something of interest to every man and woman whether he or she visits [ porn sites ] , " said Rolf Gindorf , a sexologist and former president of the sexuality research society , based in DÃ¼sseldorf .
" Our study showed that 98 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women admit to an interest in pornography . "
In a Kinsey Institute Survey completed by 10,000 people , 81 per cent had accessed pornographic images in the last month , although 80 % of respondents were men and porn users were more likely to reply .
Other figures gave the total number of people in the US using porn websites in 2004 at about 40 million , although the figure would be higher today .
Germany and the US are of course among the leading porn consumers .
Figures elsewhere would be lower .
But at any rate porn consumption is absolutely massive and the old stereotypes about who uses it are false .
Retailers say 40 % of all porn video hirings in the US are by women .
It 's clear that a high percentage of downloads at some sites are by women .
Some of them , particularly accessing women - run sites like Abby Winters and Suze Randall , will be lesbians .
Some heterosexual women use porn for their own private use or with husbands and boyfriends .
While some lesbians probably consume porn from the heterosexual scene where they can find mountains of sexy women , gay men have their own gigantic porn scene .
The consumption of porn by lesbians is of course facilitated now by the internet .
In the past buying Playboy in a newsagents or bookshop said â€œ I 'm a lesbianâ€ .
Now it can be done in private .
In addition there is the extensive CyberDyke network , that seems to have lesbian - looking women , although of course some users will be men .
It 's true that more men use visual pornography than women .
But there is an extensive world of pornography not generally treated as such , namely the erotic literature scene â€ “ so called ' clit lit ' â€ “ that sells millions of sexually explicit titles each year .
The books are designed to be held on one hand , so the other hand can be used for making tea , writing letters , eating chocolate or masturbating with or without a dildo .
Clit lit is excluded from the ' pornography ' title only if we insist that pornography must include images .
For whatever reason it seems obvious less women are turned on by images than men , and so erotica / pornography aimed at women focuses more on the written word .
But what makes novels which include multiple intercourse scenes , rapes , anal intercourse and spanking just ' erotica ' and internet ' art nudes ' pornography ?
Convention , ideology , hypocrisy .
Porn use is now way beyond older men in dirty macs or young teenage males .
It 's everywhere and part of a much more diverse series of methods for accessing sexual pleasure .
Objection 4 : Pornography leads to masturbation
It sure does .
Of course the masturbation revolution of our times is in the acceptance or very widespread diffusion of the vibrator .
Dildos are among humanity 's oldest known artefacts , but a hundred years ago very few women had them .
Nowadays dildo use figures are mind - boggling .
At least 2 million vibrators are sold each year in the UK ; estimates say at least 25 % of women in the US have one and that 10 % of US couples use them in their sex play .
7000 vibrations a minute are a really good way to get an orgasm , especially if you have some clit lit to hand .
Objection 4 is no objection at all , accept to the most idiotically dull of religious fundamentalists .
Objection 5 : Pornography exploits its performers and models
In the world of work exploitation is everywhere .
But is there something special about porn that makes its performers especially exploited ?
It is certainly not true that the overwhelming majority of models and performers are directly coerced into pornography .
This may happen in some third world countries , but being a porn model or actress in advanced countries is usually a career choice and one that gets often far better rewards than working in an office or factory .
If there are women in Western countries who work in porn because they can't do any other type of work , they must be very few in number .
This argument often really means porn ' degrades ' its actresses by making them do degrading things .
That assumes that you think the depiction of nudity and / or intercourse is degrading .
Another circular argument .
Objection 6 : Porn promotes sexist stereotypes of women
Yes , a lot of porn does , but if you think that all modern porn reiterates the Playboy large breasted Barbie doll of yesteryear , forget it .
Diversity is the word out there , especially in the ' alt porn ' scene where lots of the young women look , well , ordinary â€ “ although most of them have tattoos and piercings .
Still there are a lot of very big - breasted women in porn .
Given the emphasis that most human cultures have put on female breasts as objects of sexual desire , that is not really surprising .
In fact the anthropological evidence is that the bio-cultural function of breasts is as a sexual signal , and like hairlessness in humans , large breasts have emerged from sexual selection .
There is no biological function in female breasts accumulating large amounts of fat .
Other higher apes lactate without having prominent breasts .
The present steady trend towards women having larger breasts in advanced countries may be partially to do with obesity , but I doubt that is the whole answer .
But large breasts of course are just part of it .
The ' look ' of most porn models very much conforms to , or is an exaggeration of , popular and fashionable looks in society at large .
That is certainly true at many photo sites where the models could be a selection from any shopping street in Europe of the US .
A decreasing proportion of models seem to have huge breast implants , but that of course cannot be measured accurately .
The real issue is this : are sexist stereotypes of what women should look like and how they should behave created by pornography ?
Or does pornography reflect stereotypes created elsewhere ?
I would say pornography today is much , much more open to alternative looks , and to aggressive and assertive women 's roles , than for example the fashion industry or the Hollywood film industry .
Few ' alt porn ' models would make it into mainstream movies .
The very scope of porn increasingly demands novelty , including novelty of looks and styles .
Take a look at the Abby Winters site to see what I mean or a site like God 's Girls .
You wo n't find anything like the diversity of looks and styles among television news readers , fashion models or actresses in the mainstream movies .
Objection 7 : Porn exploits its customers
Never have such huge numbers of people been so willingly exploited !
Of course addiction to anything can seriously damage your bank balance .
But the striking thing is today the relative cheapness of porn , with for example the leading video site Video Box being available for a ludicrous $ 10 a month .
In any case , compared with the fast food , alcohol , tobacco and auto industries â€ “ industries that kill people - porn is harmless .
When the subway stops in the morning the guy with the heart attack has n't had it because of too much masturbation .
Given that we live in a market economy , porn is going to be provided through the market and charged for .
But the porn entrepreneurs make fortunes mainly because they sell so much of their product , not because it is hugely expensive .
Objection 8 : Porn leads to violence against women
This is an unproven idea and mixes up several things .
The first notion is that porn portrays women as submissive and / or worthless and just objects of men's lust and use , and therefore creates an attitude towards women that legitimises violence .
This is a wildly speculative idea with little evidence to back it up .
Wendy McElroy says : â€ œA cause - and - effect relationship is drawn between men viewing pornography and men attacking women , especially in the form of rape .
But studies and experts disagree as to whether any relationship exists between pornography and violence , between images and behavior .
Even the pro-censorship Meese Commission Report admitted that the data connecting pornography to violence was unreliable .
â€ œOther studies , such as the one prepared by feminist Thelma McCormick ( 1983 ) for the Metropolitan Toronto Task Force on Violence Against Women , find no pattern to connect porn and sex crimes.â€ 
Violence and other abuse of women is widespread in contemporary cultures and was before modern pornography , photography and the internet existed .
Most of it is ' domestic violence ' that has deep roots in the modern family system and the oppression of women more generally .
It will take a long time to uproot it .
To argue that erotic imagery ' leads to ' violence against women is an assertion , nothing more .
The other part of the argument is that what is depicted in pornography â€ “ for example spanking or BDSM â€ “ promotes sexual violence .
You could equally well argue that BDSM promotes sexual violence towards men .
But the truth is that pornography users know the difference between the world of fantasy and reality .
They are not really going to go out and tie up their secretary in the office and spank her ; or go out and tie up their boss and whip him .
That 's not the way sexual fantasy works .
The world of fantasy is a private domain which cannot â€ “ yet â€ “ be censored .
And where people play out scenarios that will never be put into action in real life .
It 's an open secret that many women have fantasies about being dominated and even raped , without in the least wanting it to happen in reality .
Millions of women engage voluntarily is sexual play - acting that may involve them being dominated in symbolic ways .
Hundreds of thousands of male BDSM fans engage in play - acting in which they are dominated and abused by women .
None of this is primarily to do with porn , although experience of porn may liberate and develop the fantasy world of the user .
Which is a good thing .
Finally when Joan Smith says about modern pornography , â€ œWhat is really offensive is that most of the material it creates is violent , degrading and illegal , especially the huge numbers of images involving childrenâ€  ( New Statesman 11 October 2007 ) she is saying something massively untrue .
The modern porn industry has nothing to do with paedophilia , most pornography is not illegal and little of it , the stylised fake representations of BDSM excepted , is violent .
Joan Smith is creating a straw person to easily smash down .
Her argument does n't stand up to a moment 's examination .
She puts allegations about violence and images of children together with the word ' degrading ' , so that word does n't have to be substantiated from the real world of pornography .
Conclusion : the clash between mass acceptance and social anathema
So everything 's OK in the porn world then ?
No problems ?
Not at all .
Much of it is tedious and repetitive .
Much of it is badly done .
Some of it does contain idiotic stereotypes of women ( and men ) .
The production values of some of it are very poor .
As Wendy McElroy has pointed out , when an industry has such a low social standing , the brightest and the most talented do n't naturally gravitate towards it .
Porn needs to be criticised , especially by its consumers .
The trend towards more diversity in representations â€ “ of people in general and women in particular â€ “ needs to be encouraged .
To do that , and to end the widespread hypocrisy , the social standing of pornography needs to be sharply revised â€ “ upwards .

Much mainstream thought about pornography in Western society is either explicitly or implicitly informed by the Judeo - Christian tradition .
That tradition treats human beings as essentially sinful , and the original sin of course took place in the Garden of Eden and involved sex .
Despite the attempt by some contemporary Christians to finesse the point , eating the forbidden fruit and treating with the devil who appeared in the form of a serpent (! ) is a metaphor for having sex .
In any case the predominant Christian view today , especially in the growing Evangelical and Pentecostal churches , but also in the Roman Catholic Church , is that sex is to be enjoyed by married couples and is primarily about having children .
In these dominant Christian traditions , sex outside or before marriage is adultery and a sin , and masturbation is also a sin .
And of course pornography is also a sin because it often involves non-married sex and promotes masturbation .
This is the ' hard core ' religious view .
Variants of the same kind of thinking are found among many non-religious people who argue sex is for expressing love between couples ( not necessarily married ) and also for having children .
This is a sort of ' soft core ' Christian - derived view .
But the actual practice of countless millions in the world reveals a contrary view â€ “ that sex is a gigantic universe of pleasure to be enjoyed and consumed in multiple ways .
For millions sex is for fun , as well as about having children and expressing loving relationships .
Yes , countless millions of young people go out at weekends to try to pick someone up and have sex ; they will probably only have one sexual encounter with that person .
Millions of others enjoy sexuality and eroticism in different ways , including pornography , without marriage or children ever coming into it .
That sex is often ' just ' about fun would not have come as a big surprise to our ancient ancestors .
According to path - breaking research by Timothy Taylor , â€ œThe widespread lay belief that sex in the past was predominantly heterosexual and reproductive can be challengedâ€ .

Yes Newton 's work was elegant , stylish , beautifully produced if , like Tamara de Lempicka , hopelessly obsessed with the rich and famous ; but it was utterly sexually arousing .
Erotic and pornographic , same thing .
The distinction between erotica and pornography cannot be sustained because there is no authoritative way of establishing the definition of what is art and what is not .
Objection 2 : Pornography degrades women by picturing them as ' sex objects ' This objection is , on the face of it , bizarre .
How could erotica / pornography function if the models / performers in it were not portrayed fundamentally for their sexual attractiveness ?
This incidentally is also true for gay porn , where the models are all hunks or sweet boys : it has to be true , whether the models are male or female or transgender .
It does n't mean that because people are pictured as the focus of sexual attraction they are somehow degraded or objectified .
Most of us strive , for at least some of our lives , precisely to be viewed as sexually attractive and the subject of desire .
Millions upon millions would just love to be viewed as objects of sexual desire , although far fewer can achieve it than would like to (! ) , for reasons of age , shape or whatever .
Lust is normal , wanting to be the subject of it is normal too .
The very term ' sex object ' is a sleight - of - hand ideological construct which uses the ambiguity of the word ' object ' to imply ' dehumanised thing ' .
Once the term is replaced with ' subject of sexual desire ' or ' focus of lust ' then this mystification collapses .
Since pornography is about creating or stimulating sexual desire , then there is no attempt to give an overall portrayal of the life or personality of the person or people depicted .
In fact when this has been attempted , in Playboy 's little biographical essays that explain that this extremely sexually desirable young woman likes Beethoven and modern jazz and wants to be a professor of Psychology , it seems both patronising and a hypocritical attempt to conceal the obvious ; the male reader ( or lesbian reader of which more below ) is reading this magazine to provoke or satisfy their desire and really does n't care much about potted biographies and even , sad to say , interviews with James Baldwin and Norman Mailer .
At this point we should perhaps deal with the argument that modern pornography does n't just present people as sexually desirable , but is unhealthily obsessed with body parts â€ “ breasts , bottoms and genitals .
We deal further on with the issue of the type of body that pornography promotes as attractive , but here we 'll just note that there is no human society for which we have any anthropological evidence in which women 's breasts and bottoms have not been regarded as objects of sexual desire .
Even if we go back 25,000 years to the famous ' Venus ' figurines ( the most famous being the Venus of Willendorf ) , they are precisely big breasted and big bottomed .
There is nothing disgusting or abnormal about that .
You can reinvent the world so that pornography never happened , and women 's breasts would still be objects of desire and â€ “ in a society were things sexual are becoming more open â€ “ of display .
The ' sex object ' argument fails to convince because itâ€™s based on conceptual hoodwinking that turns out to be nonsense .
Objection 3 : Pornography is perverted and only used by dirty old men and other sad cases who can't have ' proper ' sexual relations
The old stereotypes about porn users persist .
Porn consumption is so huge today it is impossible to attempt any profile of the ' typical ' porn user .
Porn users can be sexually active or not , use it alone or with a partner , be heterosexual , gay or lesbian and any age from puberty upwards .
Some of the figures are extraordinary .
Seventy five per cent of all German adults in a Der Spiegal survey said they used pornography sometimes .
A third of men between 14 and 70 said they looked at porn on a daily basis .
Some eight percent of women watch porn daily .
" Pornography , in the sense of the description and depiction of sexual activities , is something of interest to every man and woman whether he or she visits [ porn sites ] , " said Rolf Gindorf , a sexologist and former president of the sexuality research society , based in DÃ¼sseldorf .
" Our study showed that 98 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women admit to an interest in pornography .
"
In a Kinsey Institute Survey completed by 10,000 people , 81 per cent had accessed pornographic images in the last month , although 80 % of respondents were men and porn users were more likely to reply .
Other figures gave the total number of people in the US using porn websites in 2004 at about 40 million , although the figure would be higher today .
Germany and the US are of course among the leading porn consumers .
Figures elsewhere would be lower .
But at any rate porn consumption is absolutely massive and the old stereotypes about who uses it are false .
Retailers say 40 % of all porn video hirings in the US are by women .
It 's clear that a high percentage of downloads at some sites are by women .
Some of them , particularly accessing women - run sites like Abby Winters and Suze Randall , will be lesbians .
Some heterosexual women use porn for their own private use or with husbands and boyfriends .
While some lesbians probably consume porn from the heterosexual scene where they can find mountains of sexy women , gay men have their own gigantic porn scene .
The consumption of porn by lesbians is of course facilitated now by the internet .
In the past buying Playboy in a newsagents or bookshop said â€œ I 'm a lesbianâ€ .
Now it can be done in private .
In addition there is the extensive CyberDyke network , that seems to have lesbian - looking women , although of course some users will be men .
It 's true that more men use visual pornography than women .
But there is an extensive world of pornography not generally treated as such , namely the erotic literature scene â€ “ so called ' clit lit ' â€ “ that sells millions of sexually explicit titles each year .
The books are designed to be held on one hand , so the other hand can be used for making tea , writing letters , eating chocolate or masturbating with or without a dildo .
Clit lit is excluded from the ' pornography ' title only if we insist that pornography must include images .
For whatever reason it seems obvious less women are turned on by images than men , and so erotica / pornography aimed at women focuses more on the written word .
But what makes novels which include multiple intercourse scenes , rapes , anal intercourse and spanking just ' erotica ' and internet ' art nudes ' pornography ?
Convention , ideology , hypocrisy .
Porn use is now way beyond older men in dirty macs or young teenage males .
It 's everywhere and part of a much more diverse series of methods for accessing sexual pleasure .
Objection 4 : Pornography leads to masturbation
It sure does .
Of course the masturbation revolution of our times is in the acceptance or very widespread diffusion of the vibrator .
Dildos are among humanity 's oldest known artefacts , but a hundred years ago very few women had them .
Nowadays dildo use figures are mind - boggling .
At least 2 million vibrators are sold each year in the UK ; estimates say at least 25 % of women in the US have one and that 10 % of US couples use them in their sex play .
7000 vibrations a minute are a really good way to get an orgasm , especially if you have some clit lit to hand .
Objection 4 is no objection at all , accept to the most idiotically dull of religious fundamentalists .
Objection 5 : Pornography exploits its performers and models
In the world of work exploitation is everywhere .
But is there something special about porn that makes its performers especially exploited ?
It is certainly not true that the overwhelming majority of models and performers are directly coerced into pornography .
This may happen in some third world countries , but being a porn model or actress in advanced countries is usually a career choice and one that gets often far better rewards than working in an office or factory .
If there are women in Western countries who work in porn because they can't do any other type of work , they must be very few in number .
This argument often really means porn ' degrades ' its actresses by making them do degrading things .
That assumes that you think the depiction of nudity and / or intercourse is degrading .
Another circular argument .
Objection 6 : Porn promotes sexist stereotypes of womenYes , a lot of porn does , but if you think that all modern porn reiterates the Playboy large breasted Barbie doll of yesteryear , forget it .
Diversity is the word out there , especially in the ' alt porn ' scene where lots of the young women look , well , ordinary â€ “ although most of them have tattoos and piercings .
Still there are a lot of very big - breasted women in porn .
Given the emphasis that most human cultures have put on female breasts as objects of sexual desire , that is not really surprising .
In fact the anthropological evidence is that the bio-cultural function of breasts is as a sexual signal , and like hairlessness in humans , large breasts have emerged from sexual selection .
There is no biological function in female breasts accumulating large amounts of fat .
Other higher apes lactate without having prominent breasts .
The present steady trend towards women having larger breasts in advanced countries may be partially to do with obesity , but I doubt that is the whole answer .
But large breasts of course are just part of it .
The ' look ' of most porn models very much conforms to , or is an exaggeration of , popular and fashionable looks in society at large .
That is certainly true at many photo sites where the models could be a selection from any shopping street in Europe of the US .
A decreasing proportion of models seem to have huge breast implants , but that of course cannot be measured accurately .
The real issue is this : are sexist stereotypes of what women should look like and how they should behave created by pornography ?
Or does pornography reflect stereotypes created elsewhere ?
I would say pornography today is much , much more open to alternative looks , and to aggressive and assertive women 's roles , than for example the fashion industry or the Hollywood film industry .
Few ' alt porn ' models would make it into mainstream movies .
The very scope of porn increasingly demands novelty , including novelty of looks and styles .
Take a look at the Abby Winters site to see what I mean or a site like God 's Girls .
You wo n't find anything like the diversity of looks and styles among television news readers , fashion models or actresses in the mainstream movies .
Objection 7 : Porn exploits its customersNever have such huge numbers of people been so willingly exploited !
Of course addiction to anything can seriously damage your bank balance .
But the striking thing is today the relative cheapness of porn , with for example the leading video site Video Box being available for a ludicrous $ 10 a month .
In any case , compared with the fast food , alcohol , tobacco and auto industries â€ “ industries that kill people - porn is harmless .
When the subway stops in the morning the guy with the heart attack has n't had it because of too much masturbation .
Given that we live in a market economy , porn is going to be provided through the market and charged for .
But the porn entrepreneurs make fortunes mainly because they sell so much of their product , not because it is hugely expensive .
Objection 8 : Porn leads to violence against women
This is an unproven idea and mixes up several things .
The first notion is that porn portrays women as submissive and / or worthless and just objects of men's lust and use , and therefore creates an attitude towards women that legitimises violence .
This is a wildly speculative idea with little evidence to back it up .
Wendy McElroy says : â€ œA cause - and - effect relationship is drawn between men viewing pornography and men attacking women , especially in the form of rape .
But studies and experts disagree as to whether any relationship exists between pornography and violence , between images and behavior .
Even the pro-censorship Meese Commission Report admitted that the data connecting pornography to violence was unreliable .
â€ œOther studies , such as the one prepared by feminist Thelma McCormick ( 1983 ) for the Metropolitan Toronto Task Force on Violence Against Women , find no pattern to connect porn and sex crimes .
â€ Violence and other abuse of women is widespread in contemporary cultures and was before modern pornography , photography and the internet existed .
Most of it is ' domestic violence ' that has deep roots in the modern family system and the oppression of women more generally .
It will take a long time to uproot it .
To argue that erotic imagery ' leads to ' violence against women is an assertion , nothing more .
The other part of the argument is that what is depicted in pornography â€ “ for example spanking or BDSM â€ “ promotes sexual violence .
You could equally well argue that BDSM promotes sexual violence towards men .
But the truth is that pornography users know the difference between the world of fantasy and reality .
They are not really going to go out and tie up their secretary in the office and spank her ; or go out and tie up their boss and whip him .
That 's not the way sexual fantasy works .
The world of fantasy is a private domain which cannot â€ “ yet â€ “ be censored .
And where people play out scenarios that will never be put into action in real life .
It 's an open secret that many women have fantasies about being dominated and even raped , without in the least wanting it to happen in reality .
Millions of women engage voluntarily is sexual play - acting that may involve them being dominated in symbolic ways .
Hundreds of thousands of male BDSM fans engage in play - acting in which they are dominated and abused by women .
None of this is primarily to do with porn , although experience of porn may liberate and develop the fantasy world of the user .
Which is a good thing .
Finally when Joan Smith says about modern pornography , â€ œWhat is really offensive is that most of the material it creates is violent , degrading and illegal , especially the huge numbers of images involving childrenâ€  ( New Statesman 11 October 2007 ) she is saying something massively untrue .
The modern porn industry has nothing to do with paedophilia , most pornography is not illegal and little of it , the stylised fake representations of BDSM excepted , is violent .
Joan Smith is creating a straw person to easily smash down .
Her argument does n't stand up to a moment 's examination .
She puts allegations about violence and images of children together with the word ' degrading ' , so that word does n't have to be substantiated from the real world of pornography .
Conclusion : the clash between mass acceptance and social anathemaSo everything 's OK in the porn world then ?
No problems ?
Not at all .
Much of it is tedious and repetitive .
Much of it is badly done .
Some of it does contain idiotic stereotypes of women ( and men ) .
The production values of some of it are very poor .
As Wendy McElroy has pointed out , when an industry has such a low social standing , the brightest and the most talented do n't naturally gravitate towards it .
Porn needs to be criticised , especially by its consumers .
The trend towards more diversity in representations â€ “ of people in general and women in particular â€ “ needs to be encouraged .
To do that , and to end the widespread hypocrisy , the social standing of pornography needs to be sharply revised â€ “ upwards .

Printer Friendly Wendy McElroy - Sunday 04 January 2009 - 23:10:21 - Permalink Defending pornographyBy Martin Green
The debate over pornography is too often dominated by conservatives and liberals ; the former castigate pornography as disgusting and corrupting , the latter defend its publication with ' free speech ' arguments , but are rarely prepared to defend pornography as worthwhile and socially positive .
Far too often voices â€ “ and there are a growing number â€ “ that argue pornography / erotica is a good thing that should be defended and celebrated are not heard .
There is a major paradox here .
Never has the public acceptance of and engagement with erotica been so widespread .
The consumption of pornography in all its forms is massive ; it is a huge industry that could not exist in its present form without millions of people worldwide being avid consumers .
But among official opinion formers , especially politicians , its stock has never been so low .
Many mainstream media commentators treat producers of erotica as they would drug dealers or gangsters .
Pornography is an anathema in polite society , while hundreds of millions use it in private .
This is ' cognitive dissonance ' on a huge scale â€ “ saying one thing and doing another .
Part of the reason the anti-porn charge is so powerful is the de-facto alliance between anti-porn feminism and the religious fundamentalist right .
Any rational discussion of sex is very difficult in the USA and Britain , but especially difficult when taking a pro-porn position is likely to find its advocate decried as a priori perverted or â€ “ even worse â€ “ misogynistic .
Pornography and its advocates face among the most violent and pervasive of taboos .
Millions of pornography fans have their use of it as among their most personal secrets .
Fortunately the most articulate defence of pornography today often comes from women â€ “ in the first place Wendy McElroy , but also Nina Hartley , Susie Bright and Violet Blue .
The liberal position on the ' right of free speech ' is something that the pornography industry will shield behind , but in the end a weak line of defence .
If something is fundamentally anti-social and damaging , then free of speech arguments are n't very strong and will often falter .
Only by sex-positive , pro-pornography views being openly expressed and fought for will the argument , eventually , be won .
The core of the argument â€ “ what is sex for ?
This just in from KPD ’s Sgt. Eli Rivera :
He is dropping the unlawful assembly charges against Toby and I !
Here ’s some speculation as to why .
Perhaps they realized they had no case .
The regulations clearly state that permits are only for those that intend to exclusively use certain “ public facilities ” like electricity for a specified period of time in a specific location .
Therefore , even under their own rules ( and ignoring the pesky Constitution , of course ) it ’s quite clear that simply assembling in a public place does not require a permit .
Perhaps another reason they decided against it was because they felt as though too many activists might come out and refuse to stand for “ justice ” Burke in protest of his recent crackdown on courtroom sitters .
Perhaps what he says in his letter is true and that he has discovered who the “ actual organizer ” of Freedom Fest was and is planning on going after him .
I do n’t know for sure , but I do have coffee scheduled with Mr. Rivera , so perhaps I can find out more at that time and dissuade him from going after anyone .
Hopefully these government guys will start to realize that the more they crack down , the larger the response from the activists .
Eventually , they should come to the conclusion that leaving us alone is the best way to protect their precious cloak of legitimacy .
If they ignore liberty activists , there wo n’t be as much news generated , meaning other activists wo n’t be as enthusiastic about moving sooner rather than later , which will help them extend their rule over the ignorant masses as long as possible .
Basically , if they do n’t want their little party to end sooner , they should stop inviting us to it .
Anyway , thanks to Eli Rivera for making the right choice .
Hopefully , he and his associates will continue to do so .
Here ’s the discussion thread about this on the Free Keene Forum .
Teenagers who watch a lot of television programs that contain sexual content are more than twice as likely to be involved in a pregnancy , according to a study published today in the journal Pediatrics .
Researchers from RAND Corporation surveyed about 2,000 adolescents , ages 12 to 17 , nationwide in 2001 about their television habits and sexual behavior .
Researchers focused on 23 programs popular among teenagers that were widely available on broadcast and cable TV .
The shows included dramas , comedies , reality programs and animated shows .
Sexual content was defined as depictions of sex as well as dialogue or discussion about sex .
The participants were surveyed again three years later .
About 700 said they had engaged in sexual intercourse by the third survey .
The teens who watched the most sexual content on TV ( the 90th percentile ) were twice as likely to have become pregnant or caused a pregnancy compared to the teens who watched the least amount of sexual content on TV ( the 10th percentile ) .
Adolescents who lived in a two - parent household had a lower probability of pregnancy while African Americans and adolescents with behavior problems were more likely to be involved in a pregnancy .
Parents should consider limiting their teen 's exposure to sexual content on TV , said the study 's lead author , Anita Chandra , a behavioral scientist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
Television producers should consider more realistic depictions of the consequences of sex in their scripts , she says , noting that there is little content on the consequences of unprotected sex .
About 1 million adolescents become pregnant each year in the United States .
" Adolescents receive a considerable amount of information about sex through television and that programming typically does not highlight the risks and responsibilities of sex , " said Chandra , in a news release .
" Our findings suggest that television may play a significant role in the high rates of teenage pregnancy in the United States . "

As you know , President Bush took the close to unprecedented step of revoking one of his own pardons yesterday .
In fact , from what I can tell , it may actually be unprecedented , since the earlier cases appear to have been instances of revoking a predecessor ’s pardon .
( In other words , this looks like the first revocation on the basis of a goof rather than a difference of policy or opinion . )
That ’s what happened in 1869 when , three days into his presidency , President Grant cancelled two pardons his predecessor President Johnson had given .
In any case , it turns out there ’s a blog exclusively focused on the pardon power — pardonpower.com .
One of the contributors to the blog , P.S. Ruckman , Jr. , did a post earlier today on whether or not the president can revoke a pardon .
And he says he ’s sure the president can do so .
But I ’m not sure that ’s the last word on the matter .
Like others who say that the president can rescind a pardon , Ruckman appears to base his argument on in re Du Puy from 1869 .
In that case , the Court held that President Grant was within his rights to rescind President Johnson ’s pardons because they had not yet been delivered to the grantees .
But last night a reader sent in some testimony from the hearings on the Clinton pardons that took place just after President Bush was sworn in in 2001 .
As you ’ll remember , they focused heavily on the infamous Marc Rich pardon .
And the question came up whether there was n’t something President Bush could do to undo Clinton ’s pardon .
Key testimony was provided by Margaret Colgate Love , herself a contributor to pardonpower.com and also former DOJ Pardon Attorney from 1990 - 1997 .
When asked by Rep. Hostettler ( R ) whether President Bush could n’t undo Clinton ’s pardons under the Du Puy case , she seemed to say that Du Puy had been superseded in this regard by Biddle v. Perovich from 1927 …
No , once the pardon warrant is signed , that is the public act that accomplishes the clemency action .
I believe that Supreme Court case law has made it pretty clear that a pardon is a public act , and so all that business about the deeds and delivery , I think , has pretty much has been overtaken by the Biddle case ; that it is a public act and once a warrant is signed –I mean , know from my own experience that we did not deliver pardon warrants , individual pardon warrants , to the recipients sometimes for weeks .
I am embarrassed to say , because we just did not –I am sure , frankly , if you look , I suspect that a number of the 176 have not gotten theirs yet , either , and that is a warrant that is signed by Roger Adams , who is the current Pardon Attorney .
Roger Adams does not have any authority to do anything other than simply deliver what the President did , and this is a document that somebody can frame and hang on their kitchen wall or something .
But it is nothing more than a symbol , a sign of what the President did in signing a document with 140 names on it .
This is not my area of specialty .
So I wo n’t try to get too far into the technicalities .
But from a quick layman ’s reading , the issue in Biddle seems to be the reasoning that the presidential pardon power , which grew from royal prerogative , was no longer a private act of grace from a sovereign but a part of the constitutional system .
And as such , whether or not it had been delivered was irrelevant .
There are a few things that are n’t completely on point in Biddle .
It was about a commutation , not a pardon .
And that still leaves the issue of whether the pardon did n’t really become valid until the Pardon Attorney ‘ executed ’ it .
But Love seems to have expressed a pretty clear opinion on that too .
Certainly , Love ’s personal opinion is n’t definitive .
But as a former Pardon Attorney herself and someone who ’s now in private practice specializing in pardons , I would think she ’s as firmly rooted in the relevant precedents and law as anyone .
So until I see more , I ’m back to thinking that President Bush ’s revocation of this pardon just may not fly .
As I wrote last night , I ’m eager to hear from experts in the field who can shed more light on this .
They are different in kind not just size .
The rule of thumb that a Depression is a Recession of 10 % or greater drop in GDP is more misleading than helpful .
A Recession is typically caused when the central bank RAISES rates to cool off an economy .
A Depression is caused by a banking crisis that comes from the central banking LOWERING rates , spurring a credit bubble which leads to the banking crisis .
A Recession is when your friend loses his job A Depression is when you lose your job A Great Depression is when an economist loses his job
Given the very different causes , the solutions are also different .
This lack of understanding is causing us ( as we did in 1931 ) to prolong and deepen the downturn by excessive intervention that is poorly designed .
For example , Bernanke has recently criticized Andrew Mellon , the much maligned Treasury Secretary in 1929 who urged the government to sit back and " purge the rottenness from our system . "
Yet Hoover ignored his advice and actively intervened with public works , tariffs , taxes , bank bailouts and more .
Recessions tend to be short ( less than a year ) and modest ( less than 5 % drop in GDP ) .
A recent study The After Math of Financial Crises looks at all the post - war ( WWII ) banking crises and concludes that Depressions are much deeper and longer than Recessions :
five years for unemployment to bottom ( worse by 7 % )
six years for housing to begin to recover ( down 35 % )
three and a half years for stocks to bottom ( down 60 % )
two years of severe GDP decline ( down 9 % )
Typically government debt increases by 86 % , largely from a dropoff in tax revenues .
Bailouts of banks tend to relatively small compared to other causes of a massive increase in government debt , including big increases in spending to attempt to fight the downturn .
The authors , both professors ( Harvard and UMd ) and members of the NBER which officially calls recessions , note that so far this crisis has seen asset prices decline as expected from prior bankng crises .
They urge caution : " one would be wise not to push too far the conceit that we are smarter than our predecessors . "
Unlike the other post - war banking crises , " with the notable exception of the Great Depression " , this one is not isolated to a country or region like Sweden or Japan , but is global .
" The global nature of the crisis will make it far more difficult for many countries to grow their way out through exports , or to smooth the consumption effects through foreign borrowing . "

The story is this .
Not long after we moved to our house in the Box - Ironbark forests of Central Victoria , a friend visited and went for a walk one day to explore the surrounds .
Our block of land backs onto State forest which is basically empty government land , not managed particularly well .
At different points paddocks make an incursion into the forest , a history of gold - mining and sheep farming in the region .
The sheep farmers are still here , the gold miners ghosts merely tourist attractions .
She returned to announce that everyone should walk north and that we could not guess what we would find .
Well , we did go for that walk , and she was right .
After about a mile walking through standard dry Australian bush , we came to a paddock that was deserted .
There were no roads , no obvious access to this piece of land , except down the hill a good distance to what we assume is a farmer ’s residence .
And , in the middle of this dry old sheep paddock stood a very large gun tree .
And , in that gum tree a rusty old car from the 1970s .
( Click on the image for full sized picture )
Find the full story of how this came to be , over the fold ...
It was the stuff of internet spam .
The type of image you would see floating from your friend into your inbox that would provide a 5 second chuckle before you started back at work .
Yet , it was real .
We wondered how it might have come to live at LAT 37° 6'24.63 " S LONG
144° 6'36.88 " E ( the tree foliage covers the car on Google Earth ) in the middle of a sheep paddock surrounded by State
Forest .
My family decided there were 3 options :
1 . There had a some point been an amazing flood and the car had floated into the tree branches , once the water subsided , what was left was a car in a tree .
2 . The car had parked over a mutant gum tree seedling which had grown naturally lifting the car into the air , hence a car in a tree .
3 . A once in a lifetime twister had picked up the car and deposited it in the tree , and so we have a car in a tree .
Strange as it may seem to you , none of these were right .
In discussions with locals for months later we found out that there was a perfectly plausible explanation .
A local of the small town nearby had edited a hot rod magazine in the
1970s .
He decided that a good shot for a front cover would be a car 10 meters up in a tree .
He organized with a mate , a local sheep farmer , to bring a crane into an isolated paddock , place it in the tree , take a photo - and leave it there .
And so , I bring you - directly from our little patch of earth in rural Australia : the car in the tree .
Bernie Madoff showed us how it was done : you induce many investors to invest their money , promising steady above - market returns ; and you deliver – at least on paper .
When your clients check their accounts , they see that their investments have indeed increased by the promised amount .
Anyone who opts to pull out of the game is paid promptly and in full .
You can afford to pay because most players stay in , and new players are constantly coming in to replace those who drop out .
The players who drop out are simply paid with the money coming in from new recruits .
The scheme works until the market turns and many players want their money back at once .
Then it ’s game over : you have to admit that you do n’t have the funds , and you are probably looking at jail time .
A Ponzi scheme is a form of pyramid scheme in which earlier investors are paid with the money of later investors rather than from real profits .
The perpetuation of the scheme requires an ever - increasing flow of money from investors in order to keep it going .
Charles Ponzi was an engaging Boston ex-convict who defrauded investors out of $ 6 million in the 1920s by promising them a 400 percent return on redeemed postal reply coupons .
When he finally could not pay , the scam earned him ten years in jail ; and Bernie Madoff is likely to wind up there as well .
Most people are not involved in illegal Ponzi schemes , but we do keep our money in accounts that are tallied on computer screens rather than in stacks of coins or paper bills .
How do we know that when we demand our money from our bank or broker that the funds will be there ?
The fact that banks are subject to “ runs ” ( recall Northern Rock , Indymac and Washington Mutual ) suggests that all may not be as it seems on our online screens .
Banks themselves are involved in a sort of Ponzi scheme , one that has been perpetuated for hundreds of years .
What distinguishes the legal scheme known as “ fractional reserve ” lending from the illegal schemes of Bernie Madoff and his ilk is that the bankers ’ scheme is protected by government charter and backstopped with government funds .
At last count , the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury had committed $ 8.5 trillion to bailing out the banks from their follies .
1
By comparison , M2 , the largest measure of the money supply now reported by the Federal Reserve , was just under $ 8 trillion in December 2008.2
The sheer size of the bailout efforts indicates that the banking scheme has reached its mathematical limits and needs to be superseded by something more sustainable .
Penetrating the Bankers ' Ponzi Scheme
What fractional reserve lending is and how it works is summed up in Wikipedia as follows :
“ Fractional - reserve banking is the banking practice in which banks keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserve ( as cash and other liquid assets ) with the choice of lending out the remainder , while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all deposits immediately upon demand .
This practice is universal in modern banking .
. . . The nature of fractional - reserve banking is that there is only a fraction of cash reserves available at the bank needed to repay all of the demand deposits and banknotes issued .
. . .
When Fractional - reserve banking works , it works because :
“ 1 . Over any typical period of time , redemption demands are largely or wholly offset by new deposits or issues of notes .
The bank thus needs only to satisfy the excess amount of redemptions .
“ 2 . Only a minority of people will actually choose to withdraw their demand deposits or present their notes for payment at any given time .
“ 3 . People usually keep their funds in the bank for a prolonged period of time .
“ 4 . There are usually enough cash reserves in the bank to handle net redemptions .
“ If the net redemption demands are unusually large , the bank will run low on reserves and will be forced to raise new funds from additional borrowings ( e.g. by borrowing from the money market or using lines of credit held with other banks ) , and / or sell assets , to avoid running out of reserves and defaulting on its obligations .
If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of cash , they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible , triggering a bank run . ”
Like in other Ponzi schemes , bank runs result because the bank does not actually have the funds necessary to meet all its obligations .
Peter ’s money has been lent to Paul , with the interest income going to the bank .
As Elgin Groseclose , Director of the Institute for International Monetary Research , wryly observed in 1934 :
“ A warehouseman , taking goods deposited with him and devoting them to his own profit , either by use or by loan to another , is guilty of a tort , a conversion of goods for which he is liable in civil , if not in criminal , law .
By a casuistry which is now elevated into an economic principle , but which has no defenders outside the realm of banking , a warehouseman who deals in money is subject to a diviner law : the banker is free to use for his private interest and profit the money left in trust .
. . .
He may even go further .
He may create fictitious deposits on his books , which shall rank equally and ratably with actual deposits in any division of assets in case of liquidation . ”

How did the perpetrators of this scheme come to acquire government protection for what might otherwise have landed them in jail ?
A short history of the evolution of modern - day banking may be instructive .
What came to be known as fractional reserve lending dates back to the seventeenth century , when trade was conducted primarily in gold and silver coins .
How it evolved was described by the Chicago Federal Reserve in a revealing booklet called “ Modern Money Mechanics ” like this :
“ It started with goldsmiths .
As early bankers , they initially provided safekeeping services , making a profit from vault storage fees for gold and coins deposited with them .
People would redeem their " deposit receipts " whenever they needed gold or coins to purchase something , and physically take the gold or coins to the seller who , in turn , would deposit them for safekeeping , often with the same banker .
Everyone soon found that it was a lot easier simply to use the deposit receipts directly as a means of payment .
These receipts , which became known as notes , were acceptable as money since whoever held them could go to the banker and exchange them for metallic money .

IN 1965 , a year before the first pocket calculator was invented , a young physicist from Silicon Valley , Gordon Moore , made a daring prediction .
He claimed that the number of components squeezed onto a single silicon chip would double about every two years .
And double , and double and continue to double .
If he had been right , the best silicon chips today would contain an unbelievable 100 million single components .
The true figure is more like 2 billion : Moore had underestimated how fast the shrinking trend would take off .
Since the mid-1970s , though , his “ law ” has been a bankable certainty , influencing economic , social and scientific developments in ways that are hard to overstate .
Google , genome sequencing , multiplayer video games , the search for the “ God particle ” : all rely on silicon ’s seemingly limitless ability to deliver more computing speed and capacity – for an ever - diminishing price .
Moore ’s law means that the cellphone or iPod in your pocket today has more byte - crunching power than the mainframes on the Apollo spacecraft , at the planning stage when the prediction was made .
Had aviation followed a similar trajectory , a flight from New York to Paris in 2005 would have cost a cent and lasted less than a second , Intel – the chip giant Moore co-founded in 1968 – calculated .
Can the trend go on ?
Reports of the imminent death of Moore ’s law have been around almost as long as the law itself , and have always proved exaggerated .
But now there is concrete cause for concern .
The smallest features on today ’s state - of - the - art chips are just …
In the search of Holy Web Grid

How can we build perfect web Grid ?
can’t
What about 760 ( 800 x 600 px ) monitors ?
golden proportions
Responses to “ In the search of Holy Web Grid ”
Probably we .
There is no such thing as perfect web grid .
But we can try .
What do we need ?
First we need some info and parameters .
The web grid is limited in horizontal and unlimited in vertical .
Vertical limitation depends on monitor size .
We have various kinds of monitors with 800 , 1024 , 1280 px vertical spacing .
We should choose one standard that will work for most of the monitors I think that 955 px is the optimum width for a web site viewed on 1024 px and bigger monitors .
Why not put all important info in the first 760 px , for users with 800 x 600 px monitors to see all important info instantly .
Another more important motif for this is that we usually read from left to right starting from the left upper corner .
Ok , if you read Arabic you will start from right to left or Japanese , Chinese up -> down .
Some researches say that we read in Ok , we have the grid 0 -> 760 -> 955 px .
The first 760 px are very important .
We need to divide the first 760 px , but how ?
What about using
The golden proportions are 1 : 1.61803 or 38.2 % : 61:8 .
In our case will be something about 470 px : 290 px = 760 px .
Ok , now we have 0 -> 470 -> 760 -> 955(470 + 290 + 195 = 955 ) and this is our basic grid .
What if we want to break our columns into smaller units ?
We can use " The Rule of Thirds " dividing the first column ( 470 px ) into 3 units .
The second column ( 270 px ) in two units .
And the last live it like it is .
What do you think ?
Rob Maltar did n't believe it when the province 's Special Investigations
Unit ruled his brother had killed himself with a police officer 's gun .
But he did n't know where to turn .
Early last year , Maltar took the case to the Ontario Ombudsman , complaining the SIU was biased in favour of the police .
After receiving 20 similar complaints , Ombudsman André Marin announced a full - scale probe into the civilian agency on June 7 , 2007 .
The Maltars were hopeful , if skeptical , that something would come of their complaint .
Yesterday , something did .
In a scathing 121 - page report , Marin hammered the SIU for allowing the police to control its investigations and adopting an " impotent stance " when challenged by police .
" There 's no doubt in my mind that an SIU investigation is one which is currently done through blue - coloured glasses .
There is no doubt that there is a police bias in their approach to investigations , " Marin said at Queen 's Park yesterday .
" The SIU has not only become complacent about ensuring that police officials follow the rules , it has bought into the fallacious argument that SIU investigations are n't like other criminal cases and it is acceptable to treat police witnesses differently from civilians , " the report said .
Marin issued 46 recommendations aimed at the SIU , the Ministry of the Attorney General and the province on how to move forward .
" There 's a point when you can't unring a bell , " he said , referring to cases that were cleared years ago .
However , he added , " the SIU may well decide to take another look at a case " in light of his findings .
That 's what the Maltars were counting on .
" Our lives have been on hold while we waited for this .
To see what it would say , " said Rob Maltar .
" What this report means for us is the door has not been completely closed .
We are going to be requesting on or about Oct. 16 ( the date the new director assumes the post ) that SIU re-evaluate this case . "
On Sept. 18 , 2005 , James Maltar was shot in a Port Credit police detachment after being arrested .
Six months into an 11 - month probe , the SIU redesignated one of the subject officers as a witness officer and ruled James had shot himself .
It was one of eight cases highlighted in Marin 's report , " Oversight Unseen . "
The investigation , one of the largest in the history of the Ombudsman 's office , was released yesterday afternoon at Queen 's Park – nearly a year behind schedule .
Among the most serious problems identified , Marin noted police are rarely interviewed within the regulated time frame – no later than 24 hours – following an incident .
" ( Interviews ) are all too often postponed – for weeks , sometimes even months , " Marin said in the report .
" Rather than vigorously inquiring into and documenting delays and other evidence of police resistance , the SIU deals with issues of police non-co-operation as isolated incidents .
It ignores systemic implications . "
But , as the report later details , it may be difficult for SIU officials to monitor problems since the majority of its recordkeeping is on paper .
" Unlike most of the police forces it oversees , the SIU does not have a computerized case - management system , making systemic monitoring and analysis virtually impossible , " Marin said in the report .
" The SIU 's antique technology also hampers its investigative ability .
There is no easy way to cross-reference cases to determine if particular police officers or services display a pattern of conduct . "

Marin also found that notification is a problem .
Police forces are legislatively required to contact the SIU immediately whenever officers are involved in the serious injury , sexual assault or death of a civilian .
Being on the scene quickly is imperative to any investigation .
" Unfortunately , in many cases involving the SIU , the `golden hour ' has often come and gone well before the SIU is even aware that an incident within its mandate has occurred , " Marin noted .
" Often police union lawyers are at the scene before the SIU , " Marin added at yesterday 's news conference .
That 's an issue that Judge George Adams also highlighted in his review of the SIU back in 1998 .
Despite a decade of supposed progress , it seems little has changed .
In Maltar 's case , four of the eight SIU officers did n't arrive on scene until up to five hours after Maltar had been shot , the report says .
Marin went on to hammer the Attorney General 's office for sitting on the " sidelines . "
Following an investigation , the director of the SIU – currently James Cornish , who will be replaced by Crown attorney Ian D. Scott in two weeks – submitted a report to the Attorney General .
In 1998 , Adams recommended these reports be made public when a charge is dismissed .
In 2003 , Adams again reviewed the agency and noted the reports were still not released .
Yesterday , Marin again reiterated the need for the release of director 's reports when an officer has been cleared of wrongdoing to promote transparency and public trust .
Following his announcement , Marin was congratulated by Toronto lawyer Julian Falconer .
" That 's a courageous report , " said Falconer , one of the first to bring concerns to Marin in late 2006 .
At the time , Falconer was representing Hafeez Mohamed .
Mohamed was arrested for impaired driving on May 23 , 2006 .
Falconer said the arresting officers used " such force as it ended up leaving him in the intensive care unit at St. Michael 's Hospital for some 57 days . "
The SIU determined no charges should be laid .

A mosque asking that Canadian workplaces respect a strict Muslim dress code is at the same time disseminating slurs against Jews and Western societies , and warning members against social integration .
The Khalid Bin Al - Walid Mosque near Kipling Ave. and Rexdale Blvd. serves as the religious authority for eight Somali women complaining to the Canadian Human Rights Commission that UPS Canada Ltd. violated their religious rights at a sorting plant .
The mosque , founded in 1990 and serving upwards of 10,000 people , preaches strict adherence to sharia , or Islamic law , and no compromise with the West .
Teachings on the mosque 's website , khalidmosque.com , refer to non-Muslim Westerners as " wicked , " " corrupt " and " our clear enemies . "
Sometimes Jews are singled out .
" Is it permissible for women to wear high - heeled shoes ? " begins one posting in question - and - answer format .
" That is not permissible , " comes the reply .
" It involves resembling the Disbelieving Women or the wicked women .
It has its origin among the Jewish women . "
Modern pastimes are condemned .
" What is the ruling on subscribing to sports channels ? " another question begins .
" Watching some of the female spectators , when the camera focuses on them time after time " stirs " evil inclinations , " the lesson reads .
" Some ( players ) may not even believe in Allaah . "
Mosque leaders refused repeated requests for an interview .
A disclaimer on the website says questions and answers do not necessarily reflect the mosque 's views .
But the About Us page says : " All questions and answers on this site ( are ) prepared , approved and supervised by ( the mosque 's imam ) Bashir Yusuf Shiil . "
The mosque 's stand on the UPS case also appears contradictory .
In September , a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal heard two weeks of testimony from eight mosque members alleging " Islamophobia " at the company 's west Toronto plant .
Three final days of testimony are scheduled for next week .
The eight women , who lost their jobs at UPS , say Islam dictates that they wear a full - length skirt for modesty .
The courier company insists that any skirt be knee - length for safety , as workers climb ladders up to 6 metres high .
Under their skirt , the women wear full - length trousers but say they do not want the lower part showing in case the shape of the calf can be discerned .
The complaint originally centred on the company 's use of temporary workers and uneven enforcement of its safety rules .
But the key question remains :
Is UPS insisting on shorter hems for safety or is it violating religious rights by denying the women permanent jobs unless they conform ?
So far , no Khalid Bin Al - Walid Mosque representative has attended the sessions , but the women cited the mosque as their place of worship and religious authority , and tabled a letter from its administration .
" This is to certify that the religion of Islam requires all Muslim women to cover her entire body inclusive of the legs , arms , head , ears and neck , " the letter reads .
" As such , ( the women ) would not be able to wear pants as an outfit . "
On the other hand , the mosque 's website teachings forbid women to work outside the home in the first place .
" It is known that when women go to work in the workplaces of men , this leads to mixing with men , " one such posting says .
" This is a very dangerous matter , " it reads .
" It is in clear opposition to the texts of the Shariah that order the women to remain in their houses and to fulfill the type of work that is particular for her ...
" We ask Allah to protect our land and the lands of all Muslims from the plots and machinations of their enemies . "
Two of the women making the complaint – Dales Yusuf , 46 , and Nadifo Yusuf ( no relation ) , 36 – said in an interview that they live in Canada now , and are free to pick and choose from Islamic law .

" We must work , " said Dales Yusuf .
" I'm a single parent raising my kids . "
Jacquie Chic , a lawyer with the Workers ' Action Centre representing the women at the hearings , said neither she nor her clients were aware of the mosque 's posted teachings .
" I , the Workers ' Centre and these women are concerned enormously about any expression of anti-Semitism or any other form of racism , " she said .
Questions to the mosque about its teachings were met with evasiveness over three weeks .
Mosque chairman Osman Mohamed three times agreed to an interview and three times cancelled at last minute .
Imam Shiil was said to be in Saudi Arabia and unreachable .
Mosque administrator Abukar Mohamed confused matters further by appearing to agree with UPS , saying : " The Quran says women must be covered – it does n't give you the specific clothes .
But I am not a religious authority . "

It 's a wrap , a doddle , an Israeli ceasefire just in time for Barack Obama to have a squeaky - clean inauguration with all the world looking at the streets of Washington rather than the rubble of Gaza .
Condi and Ms Livni thought their new arms - monitoring agreement – reached without a single Arab being involved – would work .
Ban Ki-moon welcomed the unilateral truce .
The great and the good gathered for a Sharm el - Sheikh summit .
Only Hamas itself was not consulted .
Which led , of course , to a few wrinkles in the plan .
First , before declaring its own ceasefire , Hamas fired off more rockets at Israel , proving that Israel 's primary war aim – to stop the missiles – had failed .
Then Cairo shrugged off the deal because no one was going to set up electronic surveillance equipment on Egyptian soil .
And not one European leader travelling to the region suggested the survivors might be helped if Israel , the EU and the US ended the food and fuel siege of Gaza .
After killing hundreds of women and children , Israel was the good guy again , by declaring a unilateral ceasefire that Hamas was certain to break .
But Obama will be smiling on Tuesday .
Was not this the reason , after all , why Israel suddenly wanted a truce ?
Egypt 's objections may be theatre – the US spent £ 18 m last year training Egyptian security men to stop arms smuggling into Gaza and since the US bails out Egypt 's economy , ignores the corruption of its regime and goes on backing Hosni Mubarak , there 's sure to be a " compromise " very soon .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And Hamas has had its claws cut .
Israel 's informers in Gaza handed over the locations of its homes and hideouts and the government of Gaza must be wondering if they can ever close down the spy rings .
Hamas thought its militia was the Hizbollah – a serious error – and that the world would eventually come to its aid .
The world ( although not its pompous leaders ) felt enormous pity for the Palestinians , but not for the cynical men of Hamas who staged a coup in Gaza in 2007 which killed 151 Palestinians .
As usual , the European statesmen appeared hopelessly out of touch with what their own electorates thought .
And history was quite forgotten .
The Hamas rockets were the result of the food and fuel siege ; Israel broke Hamas 's own truce on 4 and 17 November .
Forgotten is the fact Hamas won the 2006 elections , although Israel has killed a clutch of the victors .
And there 'll be little time for the peacemakers of Sharm el - Sheikh to reflect on the three UN schools targeted by the Israelis and the slaughter of the civilians inside .
Poor old Ban Ki-moon .
He tried to make his voice heard just before the ceasefire , saying Israel 's troops had acted " outrageously " and should be " punished " for the third school killing .
Some hope .
At a Beirut press conference , he admitted he had failed to get a call through to Israel 's Foreign Minister to complain .
It was pathetic .
When I asked Mr Ban if he would consider a UN war crimes tribunal in Gaza , he said this would not be for him to " determine " .
But only a few journalists bothered to listen to him and his officials were quickly folding up the UN flag on the table .
About time too .
Bring back the League of Nations .
All is forgiven .
What no one noticed yesterday – not the Arabs nor the Israelis nor the portentous men from Europe – was that the Sharm el - Sheikh meeting last night was opening on the 90th anniversary – to the day – of the opening of the 1919 Paris peace conference which created the modern Middle East .
One of its main topics was " the borders of Palestine " .
There followed the Versailles Treaty .
And we know what happened then .
The rest really is history .
Bring on the ghosts .
According to various sources , since August , hundreds of employees have been forced to leave their jobs from Google with a further 1000 + to be laid off this week .
By law , Google is required to report layoffs publicly as well as to the SEC however , Google has managed to get around the legal requirement by classifying a number of the employees as “ temporary operational expenses ” .
By doing so , Google is able to hire full time employees without full time benefits such as health coverage and insurance .
Also , the company is then able to boost it ’s standing on Wall Street by giving the impression that Google is producing far more per employee that it actually is .
All this naturally increases shareholder satisfaction and consequently ensures share prices remain high .
Supposedly , Google has a number of sneaky tactics used to get around the SEC requirements .
One of the methods according to WebGuild is by moving workers from job to job every few months so that their status remains temporary .
In their own words , “ that is why you probably have never spoken to the same person twice at Google and that is also why there is somebody new on the job and most times you know more about their job than they do . ”
Given the size of the company , the number of lawyers involved and the number of staff supposedly laid off , it is difficult to be certain as to the credibility of the claims .
However , undoubtedly Google has taken a hit and in some respects this is hardly surprising considering stock price is currently at 40 % of its year - ago high .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights campaigner Shirin Ebadi was briefly taken into custody Sunday as Iranian authorities raided and indefinitely shut down two of her offices in Tehran , she told CNN .
Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for her human rights work .
The Iranian authorities never gave her an explanation for the crackdown , and she was later released , she said , adding that there were no arrests in the raid , but the offices remain closed .
Speaking from her home , Ebadi said the closed offices belong to two non-governmental organizations funded by her Nobel Peace Prize earnings : the Center for Participation in Clearing Mine Areas , which helps victims of landmines in Iran ; and Defenders of Human Rights Center , founded five years ago to report human rights violations in Iran , defend political prisoners , and support families of those prisoners .
Ebadi said Iranian authorities had no written justification for Sunday 's raid , which she described as illegal .
" The collective activities of the human rights activists in Iran have angered the Iranian authorities so much that they have illegally ordered the closing down of two NGOs , " she said .
Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for her human rights work , making her the first Iranian to receive the honor .
She is one of the most prominent Muslim women in the world and serves as the president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center .
In August 2006 , Ebadi said the Iranian government informed her that the agency is " illegal " and vowed to arrest those who continued to work there .
" Of course , me and the other members of the center do not intend to shut down the center and we shall continue our activities , " she said at the time .
She said the center -- which has operated for over five years in Tehran -- " is a member of the International Federation for Human Rights " and " has also been awarded a human rights prize by the Human Rights National Commission in France . "
" This center is very well known and credible in Iran , " she said in 2006 .
The Nobel committee has described Ebadi as a champion of human rights who " sees no conflict between Islam and fundamental human rights .
" As a lawyer , judge , lecturer , writer and activist , she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country , Iran , and far beyond its borders .
She has stood up as a sound professional , a courageous person , and has never heeded the threats to her own safety . "
The Commission has insisted that " there is no immediate danger of disruption for European citizens " .
But officials are worried that the latest wave of freezing weather , in one of the coldest winters for years , will push the EU into a full blown energy crisis by fuelling demand for Russian gas as people seek to heat their homes across Europe .
Over the last 60 years , ever - smaller generations of transistors have driven exponential growth in computing power .
Could molecules , each turned into miniscule computer components , trigger even greater growth in computing over the next 60 ?
Atomic - scale computing , in which computer processes are carried out in a single molecule or using a surface atomic - scale circuit , holds vast promise for the microelectronics industry .
It allows computers to continue to increase in processing power through the development of components in the nano - and pico scale .
In theory , atomic - scale computing could put computers more powerful than today ’s supercomputers in everyone ’s pocket .
“ Atomic - scale computing researchers today are in much the same position as transistor inventors were before 1947 .
No one knows where this will lead , ” says Christian Joachim of the French National Scientific Research Centre ’s ( CNRS ) Centre for Material Elaboration & Structural Studies ( CEMES ) in Toulouse , France .
Joachim , the head of the CEMES Nanoscience and Picotechnology Group ( GNS ) , is currently coordinating a team of researchers from 15 academic and industrial research institutes in Europe whose groundbreaking work on developing a molecular replacement for transistors has brought the vision of atomic - scale computing a step closer to reality .
Their efforts , a continuation of work that began in the 1990s , are today being funded by the European Union in the Pico - Inside project .
In a conventional microprocessor – the “ motor ” of a modern computer – transistors are the essential building blocks of digital circuits , creating logic gates that process true or false signals .
A few transistors are needed to create a single logic gate and modern microprocessors contain billions of them , each measuring around 100 nanometres .
Transistors have continued to shrink in size since Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore famously predicted in 1965 that the number that can be placed on a processor would double roughly every two years .
But there will inevitably come a time when the laws of quantum physics prevent any further shrinkage using conventional methods .
That is where atomic - scale computing comes into play with a fundamentally different approach to the problem .

“ Nanotechnology is about taking something and shrinking it to its smallest possible scale .
It ’s a top - down approach , ” Joachim says .
He and the Pico - Inside team are turning that upside down , starting from the atom , the molecule , and exploring if such a tiny bit of matter can be a logic gate , memory source , or more .
“ It is a bottom - up or , as we call it , ' bottom - bottom ' approach because we do not want to reach the material scale , ” he explains .
Joachim ’s team has focused on taking one individual molecule and building up computer components , with the ultimate goal of hosting a logic gate in a single molecule .
How many atoms to build a computer ?
“ The question we have asked ourselves is how many atoms does it take to build a computer ? ” Joachim says .
“ That is something we cannot answer at present , but we are getting a better idea about it . ”
The team has managed to design a simple logic gate with 30 atoms that perform the same task as 14 transistors , while also exploring the architecture , technology and chemistry needed to achieve computing inside a single molecule and to interconnect molecules .
advertisement
They are focusing on two architectures : one that mimics the classical design of a logic gate but in atomic form , including nodes , loops , meshes etc. , and another , more complex , process that relies on changes to the molecule ’s conformation to carry out the logic gate inputs and quantum mechanics to perform the computation .
The logic gates are interconnected using scanning - tunnelling microscopes and atomic - force microscopes – devices that can measure and move individual atoms with resolutions down to 1/100 of a nanometre ( that is one hundred millionth of a millimetre ! ) .
As a side project , partly for fun but partly to stimulate new lines of research , Joachim and his team have used the technique to build tiny nano - machines , such as wheels , gears , motors and nano - vehicles each consisting of a single molecule .
“ Put logic gates on it and it could decide where to go , ” Joachim notes , pointing to what would be one of the world ’s first implementations of atomic - scale robotics .
The importance of the Pico - Inside team ’s work has been widely recognised in the scientific community , though Joachim cautions that it is still very much fundamental research .
It will be some time before commercial applications emerge from it .
However , emerge they all but certainly will .
“ Microelectronics needs us if logic gates – and as a consequence microprocessors – are to continue to get smaller , ” Joachim says .
The Pico - Inside researchers , who received funding under the ICT strand of the EU ’s Sixth Framework Programme , are currently drafting a roadmap to ensure computing power continues to increase in the future .
Todos sabemos que la mayoría de los juegos de PC que tienen magos , hechiceros , brujos o cualquier tipo de poder o magia , por lo general son de rol o mejor dicho RPG .
Es por eso que en este artículo he recopilado los mejores juegos de PC desde el 2007 que incluyen este género .
Saga World of Warcraft
Uno de los mejores juegos de RPG multiplayer , por no decir el mejor desde su origen en 2004 .
Este juegazo sigue lanzando expansiones y siendo uno de los mejores para lo que buscamos , ya que tiene mucha magia y poderes .
Las clases que más poderes y hechizos tienen son el brujo , el chamán , el druida , el mago y el priest ( sacerdote ) cuyos poderes y magia son de curación como así también de daño .
Si estás buscando un juego multiplayer que haya brujos y magos , el WoW es el mejor .
Saga The Witcher
The Witcher , “ El Brujo ” , claramente es un juego lleno de hechizos .
De los juegos de RPG de este momento , The Witcher 3 es el juego de moda .
El protagonista es un brujo que no sólo usa poderes sino pociones y también daño físico .
Uno de los mejores de la actualidad que puedes jugar offline .
The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim
En realidad toda la saga The Elder Scrolls incluye magia , pero voy a referirme a su último juego “ Skyrim ” .
Es similar al WoW en cuanto al tipo de juego con la diferencia que no elijes ser mago , brujo , guerrero , etc. , en el inicio sino en el transcurso del juego .
El personaje es sumamente personalizable y todos de por sí lanzan una gran cantidad de hechizos , de curación , daño , ilusión , conjuración , etc .
El jugador debe elegir entre perfeccionar su aspecto mágico o físico .
Es el mejor RPG que puedes jugar offline , sin lugar a dudas .
Saga Mass Effect
Uno de los mejores juegos de PC que se han lanzado debido a su inigualable historia .
Si bien Mass Effect no es un juego de hechizos , existen poderes dependiendo la clase que elijas .
Más que magia son poderes .
No es un juego como los anteriores , pero por ser uno de los mejores de PC en RPG , tal vez deberías echarle un vistazo .
Saga Diablo

Globular Cluster NGC 2419
Credit & Copyright : Richard Hammar
Explanation :
Of three objects prominent in this thoughtful telescopic image , a view toward the stealthy constellation Lynx , two ( the spiky ones ) are nearby stars .
The third is the remote globular star cluster NGC 2419 , at distance of nearly 300,000 light - years .
NGC 2419 is sometimes called " the Intergalactic Wanderer " , an appropriate title considering that the distance to the Milky Way 's satellite galaxy , the Large Magellanic Cloud , is only about 160,000 light - years .
Roughly similar to other large globular star clusters like Omega Centauri , NGC 2419 is itself intrinsically bright , but appears faint because it is so far away .
NGC 2419 may really have an extragalactic origin as , for example , the remains of a small galaxy captured and disrupted by the Milky Way .
But its extreme distance makes it difficult to study and compare its properties with other globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy .

While Franken is certainly not challenging more total ballots , it does appear as though 60 % of Franken 's challenges occur in precincts he is currently winning , only 50.8 % of Coleman 's challenges come from precincts Coleman is winning .
If the current data is extrapolated into the remaining precincts the margin for Franken increases :
Franken : +637 (+/- 76 ) Coleman : +57 (+/- 65 ) Net Franken : 580
We 'll find out later tonight after the official SOS result if these numbers mean anything .
Franken is releasing 633 of his challenges , and Coleman is doing about the same .
If The 580 vote margin holds up it may suggest two things :
(1) Franken is challenging more ballots for himself .
(2) Franken is challenging a ton of ballots in precincts where the race is relatively close , and the challenges by Franken , are actually inducing a Franken lead .
We 'll find out more later tonight .
Update [ 8:15 PM CT ] :
Well its later tonight and the new numbers have been posted by the MN SOS .
First a recap of today 's official result :
Recount Original Coleman : 1,193,307 - 1,195,885 = - 2,578 Franken : 1,197,965 - 1,200,533 = - 2,568 Franken Net Today : 91 ( - 13 Yesterday , 41 day before , - 29 ) Total Franken Net : - 10 Franken Deficit : 225
The challenge numbers have also been updated and are shown below using the postive / negative convention already established :
Franken : +765 Coleman : - 41 Net Franken : 806
Unfortunately the new challenge numbers do not factor in the withdrawn ballots by both campaigns ; there is a disclaimer on the results page explicitly stating that " these totals do not include results for 633 challenged ballots that were withdrawn by the Al Franken campaign . "
Each candidate increased their challenge count , Coleman by 70 and Franken 112 .
If we compare today 's challenges with yesterday's , it is safe to assume that Coleman 's frivolous challenges are also included in today 's count ; unless of course , Franken challenged 745 ballots today .
It now appears as though 62 % of Franken 's challenges occur in precincts he is currently winning .
Coleman 's percentage slipped from 50.8 % to 49.4 % with the inclusion of the newly posted data .

Higher salt intake in children is related to an increased consumption of sugary beverages , according to a study conducted by researchers from St. George 's , University of London , and published in the American Heart Association 's journal
High consumption of salt is well - known to be linked to high blood pressure , or hypertension .
Now a new study suggests that it may also be partially responsible for the health problems that come from drinking too many sugary beverages .
Researchers analyzed the salt and fluid intake for 1,600 children between the ages of four and 18 .
All food and beverages that the children consumed were weighed on digital scales .
" We found that children eating a lower - salt diet drank less fluid , " said lead author Feng He .
" We estimated that one gram of salt cut from their daily diet would reduce fluid intake by 100 grams per day .
" Based on analysis of the children 's average consumption patterns , the researchers concluded that a 100 - gram reduction in fluid intake would correspond to a 27 - gram reduction in sugary beverage consumption .
" Sugar - sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children , " He said .
" It has been shown that sugar - sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people .
" If children ... cut their salt intake by half ( i.e. , an average reduction of three grams a day ) , there would be a decrease of approximately two sugar - sweetened soft drinks per week .
" According to He , this would remove 250 calories from a child 's diet each week .
"
Not only would reducing salt intake lower blood pressure in children , " He said , " but it could also play a role in helping to reduce obesity .
"
The researchers noted that prior experimental studies have shown that reducing children 's salt intake leads to a reduction consumption of sugary and other beverages " Currently , salt intake in young people is unnecessarily high because of , in most countries , hidden salt added to food by the food industry , " they said .
A Better Mousetrap !
This mousetrap design was used by my uncle decades ago , when his graduate students were studying territorial behavior of rodents in Iowa and Wisconsin .
As I recall , they used hundreds of such traps , and caught tens of thousands of mice .
When I was a kid , we did something similar in grade school after our teacher took interest in his methods .
I had n't revisited this for at least 25 years , and then it happened .
An infestation in our home .
It was absurd , and my wife was going nuts .
I could have poisoned or otherwise killed the things , but I figured it'd be more fun ( especially for my youngest children ) to catch 'em live and release 'em in an appropriate wild area ( though based on what my uncle learned , this is all pointless ;-)
So I made several of these traps , and in a few days we 'd caught 8 juveniles and 1 adult ( forgot to check whether it was a female ) .
Over the next couple weeks , we caught nearly 30 mice .
Sheesh .
However , some of the juveniles ( I presume ) managed to lick all the bait off the trigger with impunity !
Therefore , I reasoned that something novel must be done to force them to apply more force -- sufficient force -- in order to trip the trap reliably .
The innovation that seems to have done the trick is the skewer scrap , and I 've included that in the assembly instructions .
I 'd be interested to hear from anyone who uses these instructions , innovates , or whatever .
Heck , email just to tell me how many mice you 've caught .
If you use a rat trap version with a five gallon bucket to catch the cats that 've been crappin ' in your kids ' sandbox , email me about that , too . ;-)
Please check your traps every day .
If you anticipate catching juvenile mice , check them even more frequently .
Mice will quickly dehydrate and suffer badly ; you'd be kinder to snap their backs with a normal trap than to neglect them once they 're caught .
( hat tip to Amy R. )
I have other gizmos you can check out , too -- such as the Hyperlite Finger Stove .
* Note :
Do not get a mousetrap that has yellow plastic bait trays .
Get conventional , old fashioned mousetraps .
You 'll need : coffee can
1/4 " screen
mousetrap *
old scissors or diagonal cutter
slip - joint pliers and / or needle nose pliers
bamboo / wood skewers ( from the grocer )
small screws
screwdriver
light wire
glue
light drill
cunning and dexterity
You 're going to be mounting a mousetrap to the open end of a coffee can as shown , so that the hinge is right at the top edge of the can .
You can use two or three small screws to do this , as shown .
By pressing the trap against the partially driven screws , you can easily mark the trap for drilling pilot holes .
You 'll need these to avoid splitting the wood when driving the screws .
Simple enough .
Before mounting the trap to the can , you 're going to bend the bait / trigger loop out of shape a bit .
Note :
Do n't bend anything outside the yellow ellipse , if you can help it .
Otherwise , you 'll have to perform some painstaking tweaking of the trigger when you 've finished the trap .
Your goal is to open up the curl , so that ... ... when the trap is set , a length of the skewer will stand straight up in the hole , with a tight fit .
You 'll put the skewer piece in later .
Once you 're content that you have n't screwed up the trap 's trigger with all this bending , press a drop of glue into each hole , and mount the trap to the can .
Note :
It 's also possible to do the following steps before mounting the trap to the can ; it 's a matter of whatever 's most convenient for you .
Place a piece of screen under the snapper as shown .
I 'm using a skewer to keep the spring of the trap from bending the screen until it 's attached .
Note :
On this particular trap I mounted the screen at a 45 degree angle ; usually I 've mounted it so the warp and woof run parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the trap .
Whatever catches your mouse will work fine .
Use light wire to attach things .
Twist it tightly with a pliers .
Secure each corner of the snapper , then lay your twists down flat against the screen so they do n't get in the way when you set the trap .
Do n't forget a couple twists of wire at the root of the snapper , to secure the screen there .
When you start trimming the wire around the edge of the can , notice that there 's a minor issue right next to the trap .
A portion of the screen has to be bent a bit so that it 's actually inside the can .
This is because it 's beneath the hinge and is actually rotating outward when the trap closes .
If you do n't do this , thing 's will bend weirdly when you try to open the screen to set the trap .
As you 're securing things with the wire , you 'll want to pay attention to where the retaining wire loops over the snapper .
You can't let the screen obstruct its action .
You can always trim out a piece of the mesh , if you need to .
Whack on one end of the skewer piece .
Shredding it a bit makes it hold your bait very well .
Note :
Our infestation made it obvious what would make the best bait .
The buggers had chewed on a Hershey 's dark chocolate bar , among other things .
I 'll give 'em credit for good taste .
So I used a lighter and melted a bit of the chocolate bar , applying it to the skewer along with some always - reliable peanut butter .
Insert the skewer piece in the trigger , and make final adjustments as needed .
Smear just the top of the skewer with goodies , and leave the can in a tempting spot .
Along a wall is always good .
Inside a cupboard , as needed .
On a pantry shelf , if your mice are climbers .
Wherever you find their poop !
Snap !
This juvenile was caught in a larger coffee can trap I heartily encourage suggestions !
E-mail me .
OK , so here 's the feedback section .
I 've had a lot of e-mail about the trap design , but not too many photos .
Where the sender gives permission for their use , I 'll post photos and comments below .
" Zen Seeker " sends this photo with remarks I 'll summarize : Zen built this for a friend who 's apparently after rats -- an acid test for this design .
" Ruggedizing " seems the objective of a few mods : using " T " nuts to secure the trap to the can , wiring the bait stick to the trigger , setting the stick at an angle to get the animal deeper into the trap , as well as increase leverage on the trigger , adding some hemp fiber to the tip of the bait stick , using masking tape on the wire mesh to prevent injury to user or rat , adding a wooden board to keep the trap from rolling ( nice handle ! ) .
He also " thought about adding graphics , neon beer signs , cheese lunch special signs , etc - better things came up this weekend . "
:-)
Update :
Not long after receiving the above picture from Zen , he sent a couple more .
One is a handy side view , showing that he had not cut the trap in half , as I thought .
The second picture is the fun one , though .
This critter 's a bit bigger than the " micro- mouse " shown further above , in one of my own traps . ;-)
Kudos to Zen for successfully scaling this trap to handle rats without needing to upsize to a large can .
The need for design changes to accommodate a rat prompted a thought .
Rats may be too big for the coffee cans , even with the stick pointed backwards quite a bit ( update : Zen has proven otherwise ) .
They may get part - way in and trip it while their body is out far enough to prevent capture .
Is there any way to get the rats further in ?
Here 's a thought :
Program vs. Programme By Ali Hale
One of our readers wrote to ask if we could clarify the difference between program and programme .
The Noun : Program or Programme ?
The basic difference is between different languages :
American English always uses program
British English uses programme unless referring to computers
unless referring to computers Australian English recommends program for official usage , but programme is still in common use .
The word “ program ” was predominant in the UK until the 19th century , when the spelling “ programme ” became more common — largely as a result of influence from French , which has the same word “ programme ” .
So , if you ’re writing in British English ( either as part of an examination , if you ’re studying English , or for a British publication ) , here ’s some examples of how to use programme and program correctly :
We ’re still drawing up the programme for the concert .
for the concert .
This computer program wo n’t run on my PC .
wo n’t run on my PC .
I missed my favourite television programme last night .
The Verb : To Program , Programmed , Programming
The word program is also a verb , as in “ I ’ll program the computer today . ”
In this case , both American and British English use “ to program ” .
These forms are also valid in American English :
progra m ed
ed progra m ing
But the Oxford English Dictionary recommends the double - m instead , which is in far more widespread usage :
progra mm ed
ed progra mm ing
If in doubt , and writing for a publication , check whether or not they have a style guide or a rule on which form of the verb to use .
When you ’re writing for yourself , just make sure you ’re consistent .

" My colleague tried to get him to re-engage .
At that moment I thought he was going to come back down but he said ' No ' , closed his eyes and threw himself off . "
Ever heard of HFO - 1234yf ?
No ?
Well , give it time .
You will .
That random alphanumeric string is the trade name of a new chemical refrigerant ( whose technical name is an even bigger mouthful , 2,3,3,3 - tetrafluoroprop - 1 - ene ) jointly developed by Honeywell and Dupont .
And after December 8 , when the Society of Automotive Engineers ’ International Research Program endorsed it as the best answer to Europe ’s new , stringent , and impending regulations governing mobile air conditioning ( MAC ) systems , HFO - 1234yf looks to be poised to become the latest industry standard .
In June of 2006 , the EU published its MAC Directive , announcing the phase - out , starting in 2011 , of the relatively new automotive air conditioning refrigerant R - 134a , in favor of systems or chemicals with global warming potentials ( GWPs ) below 150 .
( R - 134a ’s GWP is 1,430 ; HFO - 1234yf has a GWP of 4 .
By definition , CO 2 ’s GWP is 1 . )
With this announcement , auto manufacturers , chemical companies , and environmental groups began scrambling to come up with the miracle solution that would be cheaper , cleaner , and more profitable for everyone involved .
Two camps quickly evolved .
The first backed a new variation on an old theme : fluorocarbons , stating that with a little research a new molecule could simply replace the old one already in use .
Systems would n’t need to be redesigned , and companies could simply transition all of their manufacturing , worldwide , to save time and money .
The second advocated a completely redesigned system based on CO 2 , claiming that the chemical is easily harvested from any number of industrial sources and that , in the long run , the planet and its people would be much healthier if a little extra effort is expended now .
The debate raged on , each side making slight gains only to lose them again in the ongoing tug of war .
The latter group looked to be winning after several major German car manufacturers , including Volkswagon and BMW , announced they would be switching to a new MAC cooled with CO 2 .
A video released to YouTube earlier in November of a car crash and several tests staged by the German Environmental Aid Association , amusingly enough with the German initials DUH , purported that the chemical was too hazardous for everyday use and did n’t hurt their cause either .
But with the SAE ’s announcement , coupled with the results the manufacturers solicited from a number of independent laboratories , the fluorocarbon may have just jumped ahead again .
According to the information posted by Honeywell and Dupont , independent testing confirmed that while HFO - 1234yf ’s global warming potential may be slightly higher than that of CO 2 , it is significantly more efficient , particularly in hotter climates where air conditioning is more widely used .
Since car air conditioners are powered by their engines , current CO 2 cooled systems actually require more fuel than the new synthetic fluorocarbon , leading to greater indirect emissions and thus a larger environmental impact .
What is more , only minor modifications would be needed to use HFO - 1234yf in the current fleet of vehicles crowding the roadways .
CO 2 systems have to function at significantly higher pressures to cool effectively and thus require significant re-engineering — not to mention additional safety features to guard against failures .
CO 2 advocates point out that the new chemical is not only toxic , like R - 134a currently in use , but also flammable , unlike its counterpart .
HFO - 1234yf ’s supporters have responded with tests stating that HFO - 1234yf breaks down into safer constituents in a matter of days ; other tests claim the chemical posed no significant risk in real world scenarios .
Mirroring their opponents ’ tactics , they then returned fire questioning the safety of pressurized canisters of CO 2 in car accidents .
And so it goes .
With the exception of the German companies , no doubt heavily influenced by German popular opinion and the government tax breaks , which is heavily biased in favor of CO 2 , none of the major manufacturers have claimed sides .
But one thing is certain , given the current fiscal positions of car companies around the world , R&D costs are likely to play a major role in whatever choice they finally make .
And right now , HFO - 1234yf is the cheaper alternative .
I ’m adding a link to the YouTube video here , but unless you speak German , you probably wo n’t get much out of it .

Maybe you have to read between the lines , but here are the facts .
Baz Luhrmann 's Australia is a very big picture – not much short of three hours , epic landscapes , a lot of special effects , Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman , and a final budget at around $ 130 m ( £ 87.5 m ) .
Reports from the US suggest that it grossed less than $ 20 m ( £ 13.4 m ) in its first week .
On December 4 , the New York Times ran a full - page ad for the film .
It quoted chunks from the many friendly reviews .
But the image was not Kidman and Jackman in a torrid embrace , not Japanese planes attacking Darwin , not 1,500 cattle on the enormous plains .
No , it was a winsome close - up of Brandon Walters who plays the mixed - race boy in the story and who does so much to make the movie work .
The marketing of Australia has shifted in 10 days : now , it 's a picture about the kid .
All of which tends to sustain one of the more remarkable trends in recent movie history : the way in which Nicole Kidman has become hard to sell .
Australia looks set to join a list of Kidman films with a US gross considerably lower than what it cost :
The Golden Compass
cost $ 180 m ( £ 120.9 m ) , grossed $ 70 m ( £ 47 m )
Margot at the Wedding
cost $ 10 m ( £ 6.7 m ) , grossed $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m )
The Invasion
cost $ 80 m ( £ 53.7 m ) , grossed $ 15 m ( £ 10.1 m )
Fur
cost $ 16 m ( £ 10.7 m ) , grossed $ 220,000 ( £ 147,740 )
Bewitched
cost $ 85 m ( £ 57.1 m ) , grossed $ 62 m ( £ 41.6 m )
The Interpreter
cost $ 80 m ( £ 53.7 m ) , grossed $ 72 m ( £ 48.4 m )
Birth
cost $ 20 m ( £ 13.4 m ) , grossed $ 5 m ( £ 3.4 m )
The Stepford Wives
cost $ 90 m ( £ 60.4 m ) , grossed $ 59 m ( £ 39.6 m )
The last Kidman picture that approached " hit " status was Cold Mountain , which cost $ 83 m ( £ 55.7 m ) and grossed $ 95 m ( £ 63.7 m ) .
And Cold Mountain was generally regarded as a failure in the year it opened , particularly in the Academy awards .
I 'm not saying that every one of the films listed above ended up losing money , particularly if you factored in worldwide box office and video revenue .
Nor do deplore every title : Birth and Fur seem to me audacious adventures for anyone – and Birth , I think , is one of the most seriously neglected films of the last 10 years .
Kidman has always tended to be at her best in difficult rather than mainstream roles .
I would say that The Interpreter , Bewitched , The Invasion and The Stepford Wives were unworthy of her , while Margot at the Wedding is a small gem .
A lot of this indicates the peril of being a brave , independent actress beyond the age of 40 .
And the bigger the picture , the greater the peril .
This is the third time Kidman and Luhrmann have worked together .
Before Australia they did Moulin Rouge ( some hated it , some loved it – I 'm in the latter group ) and ... can you guess ... yes , the notorious Chanel No 5 commercial which at a per minute cost was probably the most expensive film Kidman has ever made .
Nicole Kidman , Hugh Jackman and Baz Luhrmann at the UK premiere of Australia guardian.co.uk
In the Chanel ad ( as in Moulin Rouge ) she is absurdly beautiful – and magically dressed .
In Australia , give or take a few cocktail dresses from London , she wears what Australian women in the Northern Territory would have worn in 1940 .
Not a high point in the history of fashion or glamour , and Kidman , I think , sometimes feels more at ease if she looks sensational .
This is an actress who needs to be put in chic clothes in romantic comedies where she can be funny , and wicked , and drop a few of the clothes .
Otherwise , it 's the kid 's picture .
I must be hungry , because this seemed like a great idea for a Quick 10 today .
Have you ever been eating or drinking something and wondered where the name came from ?
Some items are pretty well known " “ a Shirley Temple was named after the actress , obviously , and an Arnold Palmer was named after the golfer .
But how about that T.V. dinner staple , the Salisbury steak ?
We 'll fill you in .
10 Foods Named After People
1. The Oh Henry !
candy bar has at least three stories behind the name .
I 'll let you pick your favorite .
The first is that it was named after a boy who frequented the Williamson Candy Company quite often to flirt with the girls who worked there .
Therefore , " Oh Henry ! " would be kind of an exasperated , coy exclamation .
Story # 2 is that Henry was a young man who was often called to do odd jobs around the Williamson Company , which would make " Oh Henry ! " a call for help .
Finally , consider that the bar was invented by one Tom Henry .
Makes more sense to me that the bar was probably named after him , although I like the flirting story the best .
2. Salisbury steak was invented by Dr. James H. Salisbury .
He thought that fruits and veggies were bad for humans and caused heart disease , tumors , mental illness , tuberculosis and all kinds of horrible ailments .
He invented the Salisbury steak ( which is really just hamburger steak ) to convince people to change their diet to mostly meat .
3. Crepes Suzette has quite the tale behind it .
In 1896 , Edward VII , Prince of Wales , was eating at the CafÃ© de Paris in Monte Carlo .
He ordered a special dessert and was pleased when the waiter brought out a flaming dish .
When the dessert was dedicated to him , the Prince declined and asked if the dish could be named after his dining companion , Suzette .
Some sources dispute this story , though , so take it with an ounce of Grand Marnier .
4. Beef Wellington was named after Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington .
Wellington boots ( " Wellies " ) were also named after him .
The story is either that it was his favorite dish , or that chefs could dump whatever crap they wanted to in a bowl and cover it with pastry and he would eat it .
I 'm more inclined to believe the latter " “ other accounts of the Duke say that he had no interest in creature comforts whatsoever and would repeatedly eat " cold meat " and bread for breakfast .
5. Eggs Benedict is another one with multiple stories ( I guess maybe they all are ) .
Story # 1 -
In 1894 , a stockbroker by the last name of Benedict visited the Waldorf hotel in New York with a hangover one morning .
He asked for toast , bacon and poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce on the side , believing it to be the perfect remedy to his drink - induced illness .
The Waldorf decided to keep it on the menu , but changed a few ingredients a bit .
Story # 2 " “ The head chef at Delmonico 's created the dish for socialite Mrs. LeGrand Benedict in 1893 .
I like the hangover story best .
6. Clementines " “ those delicious , juicy little orange - like fruits " “ were named after a French monk who was living in North Africa .
PÃ¨re ClÃ©ment Rodier either found or created the hybrid of the Mandarin and Seville oranges to create Clementines .
7. Bananas Foster calls its ( their ? ) hometown New Orleans .
Famed restaurant Brennan 's created the delicious dish for Richard Foster , a friend of owner Owen Brennan and also the chairman of the New Orleans Crime Commission .
8. Kaiser rolls have been around for a long time " “ they were created sometime around 1487 , when a Viennese baker stamped the image of either Frederick III or Franz Josef on it .
9. Reuben sandwiches are soooo good .
Definitely one of my favorites , so I have to thank Reuben Kulakofsky for ( maybe ) making it happen .
Rumor has it he created it for his poker buddies at an Omaha hotel in the early 1920s .
The dispute on this origin comes from Arnold Reuben , a New York restauranteer who said he created the sandwich in 1914 for an actress .
The earliest known Reuben reference is from a 1937 men from the Cornhusker Hotel in Lincoln , Neb. , so I 'd say Kulakofsky has a stronger claim .
10 . The Cobb salad was invented by Hollywood Brown Derby owner Robert Cobb when he was asked to make a late - night snack for Sid Grauman of Grauman 's Chinese Theater .
He found some leftovers , chopped up the ingredients very finely and served it up .
It became a hit across the town and the Cobb salad legend grew .

( Photo : Wuzzles in the wild ... Wall art inside Cincinnati ’s Museum Center at Union Terminal . )
On a walk along Wabash one bone - chilling day
My suburban friend , Val , had something say :
“ You ca n’t tell the story , you ca n’t tell , you can ’t –
My nieces might read this , their parents will rant .
If you do , change the names of people and places ,
Using a pseudonym leaves fewer traces . ”
“ Most of all , please make it fit for young readers ,
My sister has standards , I beg that you meet hers .
Under no circumstance unveil the puzzle–
The item I sought to buy ?
Call it the wuzzle . ”
Five years and twenty have passed since it happened
Suburban Val found herself rubbed on the back end ,
Never expecting the unforeseen nuzzle
While harmlessly out on the hunt for a wuzzle .
Now wuzzles are funny , as older girls know
They do n’t like to sled with you out in the snow .
They do n’t like the sunlight , they do n’t like the rain
You would n’t take one out to play on the train .
They wo n’t be caught romping in summertime flowers
Instead they ’ll befriend you at undisturbed hours .
Their rubbery wubbery wobbly kisses
Are sought after widely by legions of misses .
But where ’s a girl coming of age in the sticks
Supposed to find wuzzly buzzly kicks ?
Where can you find one ?
Where do they roam ?
How do you go about coaxing one home ?
You go to the forest where wuzzles are born
Amid renty - blue flickies and wee - gamer sporn .
You do n’t tell a soul of your wuzzly bid
But you go there , and quickly –that ’s just what Val did .
As she entered the glade , she was swiftly perplected –
It was n’t exactly as she had expected .
For one , it was dirty , for two , it was dim
And all of the people there looked rather grim .
She averted her eyes , she avoided their gaze
And made for a tree hidden half in the haze ,
When what to her down - looking eyes should appear
But a sad little wuzzle , shedding a tear .
“ Oh , why are you crying , dear wuzzle ? ” asked Val .
“ If I can do something to help you , I shall . ”
“ Yes , please , ” moaned the wuzzle , “ please do so with haste ,
My batteries are dying , they must be replaced ! ”
Now there ’s nothing as woeful , as jolly decreased
As seeing a wuzzle becoming deceased .
Thusly moved by its plight , Val picked up the poor creature
Gave it a kiss and examined each feature .
“ I ’ll take you back home and I ’ll wash you up neat ,
Then you and I both will be in for a treat !
We ’ll play in my nuzzle patch , just you and me
We ’ll play there together , we ’ll play there , you ’ll see ! ”
“ Say , you ’ll need a name as would any new wuzzle … ”
Val thought for a minute , “ I christen you : Buzzle ! ”
Replied our faint hero , “ Now please help me work , ”
So Val cuddled him closer and made for the clerk .
But before she could get there , she suffered a bump
A thumpety - rub smack dab right on her rump .
And turning around to see what was the nuzzle
She came face to face with an odd fellow ’s kluzzle .
She cried out in fright–she was not to be blamed
Then after she gathered herself she exclaimed :
“ Dear sir , I ’ve no interest to rub on your kluzzle ,
My heart now belongs to my buzzery wuzzle . ”
Val ran away quick from that nasty old grinder
In hope Mister Nuzzle was nowhere behind her .
But fleeing one frying pan into one newer
She met with a floozie who thought that she knew her .
A floozie it was , a floozie indeed
But not of the typical amateur breed .
From the tip of her tat to the breadth of her poozie
As floozie - floos go , this one was a doozie .
“ I ’m Madam Gadunk - Gadunk , ” floozie professed ,
“ The last time you saw me I was n’t quite dressed .
Apologies due for that day ’s tardy session ,
Shared space has its snags in our chosen profession . ”
“ Now what are you talking ?
Now what did you say ? ”
Val asked as she felt herself inching away .
“ I ’m not your old roommate , no we ’ve never met .
You naked is something I would n’t forget . ”
“ Now please let me by , I really must hurry –
My wuzzle is wheezing , I ’m starting to worry . ”
As Val hastened past , she heard an alarm
And watched Gadunk carted off by the gendarmes .
She looked down at Buzzle , held tight in her hand
And told him , “ Today ’s going not as I planned !
I wanted a wuzzle , but not all this hassle–
This hassily , wassily , whissily - wassle ! ”
“ Now let ’s get you fixed and get out of this glade ,
My patience is weakening , my temper is frayed .
Who knew nabbing wuzzles was difficult work ? ”
Luckily that ’s just when Val spotted the clerk .
She slid up to the counter and laid Buzzle down
Got hold of the clerk , and said with a frown ,
“ My wuzzle is wheezing , he ’s almost a goner .
Can you fix him up ?
Will you do me the honor ? ”
And that ’s when the clerk got a mischievous grin .
“ I think he needs D - cells , here I ’ll put them in . ”
“ I ’ll do it , ” said Val , “ if you merely provide them .
I ’ve had a long day .
Now where do you hide them ? ”
But quick as a wink and before she could flee
The clerk snatched away Buzzle with obvious glee ,
And giving a flash of his lecherous smile
Inserted the batteries and turned up the dial .
Now what he did next you ’d never suppose –
He shook the poor wuzzle in front of her nose !
Then asked in a voice that was needlessly gruff :
“ Is this wuzzle ’s rub - buzzery buzzling enough ? ”
“ Why I never ! ” said Val .
“ Never did I suspect
A buzz - wuzzle salesman to be so direct ! ”
She tossed him a twenty and gave him a smack ,
Ran off with dear Buzzle and never looked back .
Now many years later and half - again older
Suburban Val has n’t grown markedly bolder .
“ The fright that he gave me can do without topping ,
Forevermore I ’ll stick to Internet shopping ! ”
“ The prices are cheaper there , no one ’s a tease ,
And two - for - one sales make me weak at the knees . ”
The moral ’s as plain as a pat on the tush :
A wuzzle in hand is worth two in the bush .

最近読んだ VM の本
少し前に " Virtual Machines : Versatile Platforms for Systems and Processes " という VM の教科書を読んだ .
今年は VM について知ったかぶりをする必要に迫られることが多く , 反省して付け焼刃をした次第 .
言語処理系の VM の話を期待していたら XEN や VMWare 方面の VM の話が主で , 意表は突かれたものの面白かった .
速度を保ちながら仮想化という抽象を守るために
コンパイラと OS の間の子が次々に曲芸を披露する健気さには心を打たれる .
VM を使ってあげようという気になる一冊 .
折良く Google から Native Client ( NaCl ) なんていう VM 技術の応用が公開されたことだし , これを肴に教科書の宣伝をするというのが今日の趣旨です .
NaCl 自体の詳しい話は whitepaper やそのほかのウェブサイトを参照ください .
VM の分類
で , 教科書の話 .
導入部の 1 章では VM の分類を行う .
まず仮想化を行う単位で分類をする .
OS のプロセス単位で仮想化をする Process VM と , OS を含めたシステム全体を仮想化する System VM がある. この二つは仮想化に使うレイヤが異る .
Process VM は , ABI ( Application Binary Interface ; 関数/システムコール呼び出しなど ) と ユーザ空間の ISA ( Instruction Set Architecture ; CPU の仕様 ) を仮想化する .
ユーザランドの ISA というのは普段の特権レベルで動く命令セットってことね .
対する System VM では , ユーザランド ISA はもちろん , Process VM では ABI の下に隠れていた システム ISA も仮想化する必要がある .
システム ISA は特権レベルで動く命令セットのこと .
System VM では ABI を仮想化する必要がない .
ABI は ( VM の上で動く ) OS が提供している .
もう一つの切り口は , ホストとゲストの ISA の違い. ホストとゲストの ISA が同じ場 合( Same ISA ) と 違う場 合( Differencne ISA ) で分類している .
Process VM + Same ISA には , たとえば Valgrind や Vx32 がある. WINE も ABI を仮想化するという意味では VM に近い .
( VM と呼ばれているのは見たことないけど . )
Process VM + Different ISA の例として , 教科書では FX!32 を紹介している .
DEC 製の VM で , Alpha 用 Windows NT の上で x86 用 Windows プログラムを動かせたらしい .
DEC すごい. 典型的な JVM や CLR も Process VM + Different ISA だと言える .
今時 VM というと真っ先に連想される VMWare や XEN , VirtualBox の類は System VM +
Same ISA である .
QEMU は System VM + Different ISA .
ゲーム機エミュレータの類も System VM + Different ISA ... かもしれないけれど , OS もユーザモードもない環境相手に上の枠組みを使っても仕方なさそう .
この分類でいくと , NaCl は ( VM かどうかはさておき ) Process VM + Same ISA にあてはまるだろう .
要素技術いろい ろ
こんな感じでだらだらと本の紹介をしていこうと思っていたけれど早くも挫けてきたので , NaCl の実装に出てくるトピックを VM 教科書の文脈で説明しておわりにします .
まず , NaCl の文脈で仮想化技術を使う動機を考えてみる .
だいたい以下の二つだと思う :
サンドボックス : 悪意のあるプログラムがユーザにわるさをできない
可搬な ABI の提供 : Windows でも Posix 的システムコールのサブセットが動く , 実装を選ばずブラウザ機能の API が動く .
サンドボックス : 割り込みと先回り
サンドボックス の実現は教科書全体を通じて論じられる .
なにしろサンドボックスを破るのは仮想化を破るとほぼ同義なので , ゲストプログラムを騙しきるのは仮想化の中心的課題だと言える.
サンドボックスの代表的なアプローチは , ゲストの操作を 先回り したり , 操作に 割り込んだり してゲストの幻想を保つことだ .
たとえば命令の実行方式がインタープリタなら , VM は全ての命令に割り込むことができる .
インタプリタのループの中でまずいメモリアクセスや命令をチェックし , 偽の結果を捏造すればいい .
OS と CPU が提供するメモリ保護や特権レベルの仕組みも , 割り込みの実現に利用できる .
OS の割り込みを VM が補足して , ゲスト向けに辻褄あわせをすればいい .
ただし , VM を高速化するにはなるべく割り込む回数を減らさなければいけない.
割り込み回数の削減に限らず , VM 技術の話で速度は無視できない .
高速化のためにギリギリを攻める話は教科書の随所に現れる.
( 速度を無視して安全にしたいならインタプリタを作ればおしまいだからね...)
怪しい箇所を毎回チェックするのは大変なので , 先回りして怪しい箇所を含むコードを安全なコードに変換しておくこともできる.
変換後のコードをインタプリタで動かすこともできるものの , どうせ生成するなら直接実行できるコードがいい.
オリジナルのコードからホスト CPU が直接動かせるコードを生成して実行することを , 教科書では binary translation と読んでいる .
要するに JIT .
binary translation はプログラムの実行中に basic block 単位で行われるのが普通らしい .
多くの命令セットには Java Bytecode のようなメタ情報がなく , 実際に分岐して実行されるまでメモリ上のどの部分がコード( プログラム)なのかはわからない.
だから変換は basic block 単位でしかできない .
分岐では一旦インタプリタや VMM ( 仮想マシンモニタ ) にジャンプし , VMM が分岐先を変換してから , その変換後のコードに進む .
分岐先が決まった分岐は , VMM を経由しないで直接分岐先にジャンプするよう後から書き換えられる.
高速化のために basic block を複数つなぎあわせることもある .
連結された basic block を superblock という .
このへんは Tamarin の Tracing
Tree とよく似ている .
あれは機械語用 VM 由来のテクニックだったのか...
binary translation は , Different ISA の VM だけでな く Same ISA の VM でもサンドボックス目的などで利用する . ただ , Different ISA の VM では別のメモリ領域を確保して命令列を作る必要があるのに対し , Same ISA の VM は元の命令列を部分的に書き換える patching を使えるかもしれない .
patching は完全なコード生成と比べメモリ消費が少ないが , 常に使えるとは限らない .
書き換え後の命令が元の命令より大きいとダメとかね.
続サンドボックス : コード検証
話が逸れてしまった .
サンドボックスを実現するもう一つのアプローチに
コード検証 がある. コード検証は実行前にコードをチェックして , まずいコードを拒否する .
Java の bytecode verification はコード検証の代表例 .
教科書では , Java や .NET のような高レベル VM を扱う章の中でコード検証を説明している .
JVM のような高級 VM と比べ , 多くの ISA はコード検証がやりにくい .
まず IA32 など実際の CPU の ISA や実行モデルには , Java のクラスファイルやオブジェクトのようなメタデータがない .
メモリイメージのどの部分が何という関数で , どこにラベルがあってどこがゴミなのか. どこが配列でどこかポインタなのか...
安全を保証するためのそんな手がかりに乏しい.
また , 実際の CPU は JVM よりずっと自由度が高い .
JVM の ISA では表現できないトリッキーなコードを実行することができる .
...というより , JVM は実際の CPU から安全性の邪魔になる機能を 注意深く取り除き , 静的な検証をやりやすいよう設計されている .
コード検証と VM の ISA には密接な関係がある .
仮想化の障害を乗り越える多くの面倒を教科書で散々読んだあとに
JVM の ISA とコード検証について説明されると , JVM はよくできてるなと感心する .
Sun エライ .
binary translation を使った実行で特に扱いが難しいのは コードの自己書き換えだ .
ロード時にチェックしたプログラム自体に不正がなくても , そのプログラムが動的にまずいコードを生成してはたまらない.
binary translation で生成したコードとも辻褄が合わなくなってしまう .
Java ほど高レベルでない 実 CPU の ISA を実行する VM では , コードの自己書き換えを防ぐために涙ぐましい努力をしている.
しかしあまりがんばると遅くなってしまうため , 難しいトレードオフがある .
それにしても JIT をする VM 自身が自己書き換えをするプログラムの代表格なのは切ない話だとおもう .
Valgrind の FAQ には Java VM を動かす際の制限が説明されている .
NaCl のサンドボック ス
NaCl の sandbox は , 上で紹介した手法のうちいくつかを使っている .
まず割り込み .
NaCl は不正なメモリアクセスを防ぐために CPU のメモリ保護を使う. ただし mprotect ( ) のような OS 提供の保護機構ではなく , IA32 固有の セグメントレジスタ で保護する .
どちらも似たようなものだけれど , セグメントレジスタは特権モードがなくても変更できるから都合が良い(...のかな. よくわからず ) .
保護の対象は 主に NaCl のランタイム .
プログラムからランタイムを書き換えて
サンドボックスを破ることができないよう保護しているらしい.
コード検証 も行う .
NaCl は専用のプログラムローダ sel_ldr を持っており , ( sel_main . c ) ロード中にコードを検証する .
間接ジャンプ , 特権命令などは検証を通らない .
( ncvalidate.c など. ncdecode_table.c をみると禁止されている命令が一覧できる. )
コード検証と ISA には密接な関係があると先に書いたけれど , これは NaCl にもあてはまる .
静的な検証だけでフルセットの IA32 コードの安全性を保証するのは大変だから , NaCl は IA32 のサブセットだけを許している .
自己書き換えのような怪しいコードは , IA32 として有効でも NaCl では動かない .
サブセット化だけではうまい検証ができないため , NaCl は IA32 に独自の命令を追加している .
たとえば関数の間接呼び出し ( 関数ポインタなど ) は不正の入口になりやすい部分だ .
けれど禁止されるとさすがに厳しい. そこで , NaCl の ISA は安全な( 実行時チェック付きの ) 間接呼び出し命令として naclcall を定義している .
このほかには nacljmp と naclret が定義されている .
JVM の ISA では自由な分岐を許すかわりに invokevirtual を定義しているけれど , それと似たようなものかもしれない .
普通のコンパイラは IA32 サブセット + 独自命令を出力できないため , NaCl はパッチのあたった gcc や gas を提供している ( gcc- 4.2.2.patch など. )
実装をみると独自命令が登場するのは gcc が出力するアセンブリだけ .
パッチ付きの gas はこれを特定の IA32 命令シーケンスに変換する .
ncv もそのシーケンスを知っているので , シーケンスが一致すれば禁止命令であっても例外的にパスする.
このへんのトリックは面白い .
このサブセット化+独自命令+ツールチェインの導入によって , NaCl はフルセットの IA32 命令を安全に実行するための苦労から逃れている .
怪しい命令の実行は VM 実装の中でも難しく , 教科書でもページを多く割いているところなので , それを省けるとシステムはとてもシンプルになる .
怪しい命令を実行する一番確実な方法である
IA32 のインタプリタもいらないし , インタプリタを高速化するための binary translation もいらない .
他の VM が怪しいコードをがんばって動かそうとするのは , 既存のバイナリ資産を実行したいと考えているからだ .
NaCl はバイナリ資産の活用をばっさり諦めることで問題を簡単にした .
このへんは企業のカラーがでるところだと思う.
たとえば Microsoft のようにバイナリ資産を多く持っている企業だと , それを捨てるという判断をするのは難しいだろう .
Google が持っているクライアントサイドのバイナリ資産は
Microsoft と比べれば小さなものだろうから , こういう判断もアリなんだと思う .
ブラウザ上のサンドボックスという制約がある以上 , いずれにしてもバイナリ資産の活用は難しそうだしね.
また話がそれた ...サンドボックス最後の砦はプロセスによる分離だ.
NaCl のプログラムはホストのウェブブラウザとは独立したプロセスが作られる.
ホストのウェブブラウザは OS のプロセスとして保護され , ゲストはプロセス間通信でホストの機能を利用する .
プロセスの分離は , 他のサンドボックス機構にバグがあった場合の予備的な保護機構だという.
NaCl では , セグメントレジスタやコード検証を用いた保護を inner sandbox , プロセスによる保護を outer sandbox と呼んでいる .
この outer sandbox は VM 技術と関係ない .
OS を活用しましょうという話 .
結局 NaCl の sandbox はこんなかんじになっていた :
セグメントレジスタを使ったメモリ保護
コード検証と拡張命令を使った怪しいコードの除去
怪しくないコードを吐くために toolchain をカスタマイズ
プロセスを分離して更に安全 .
可搬な ABI の提供
次の話. Process VM は , ゲストのバイナリが想定している OS の API / ABI を仮想的に提供する .
Linux なんかだとシステムコールだろうし , Windows なら user32.dll といった DLL 内の関数だろう .
これらを仮想化するためのアイデアは単純.
システムコールなら , 該当する命令 ( IA32 なら " int " ) を ランタイム関数の呼び出しに置き換えればよい .
DLL ならロードの段階でホストが実装した DLL をゲストに注入する .
ゲストのコードを実行している間 , ホスト用のランタイムメモリは保護されているのを思いだそう.
システムコールを代替するランタイム関数は , まずこの保護を外す必要がある. そしてしかるべきコードを実行したあとは , メモリ保護を復帰してからゲストのコードに戻る.
アイデアが単純でも実装が簡単とは限らない. ホスト OS とゲスト OS が一致しているなら , システムコールは 1:1 に対応する .
この場合 , ホストはゲストとの ABI の違い ( 引数の積み型やエンディアン ) を調整して , ホスト側の同じシステムコールを呼び出せばいい.
Alpha 版 Windows の上で IA32 版 Windows を動かした FX!32 はこのアプローチらしい .
ホスト OS とゲスト OS が一致しないと問題はずっと難しくなる .
ホスト VM はゲスト OS の機能を自分で実装しなおす必要があるからだ .
これは要するに WINE や FreeBSD の Linux Binary Compatibility がやっているようなことなんだろうけれど , いかにも大変そうだよね .
NaCl の ABI 仮想化
NaCl のバイナリは Linux でも Windows でも動作するわけから , そこには何らかの ABI 仮想化があるはずだ .
前に書いたとおり , NaCl はバイナリ資産の活用を完全に諦めている .
だから Linux や Windows の ABI をがんばってサポートする動機がない . 実際 , 既存の OS とは互換性のない , NaCl 独自の ABI を持っている .
どう独自なのか .
ABI を議論する時 , ソースコードレベルで提供する API の種類 と , そのコードをビルドしたバイナリ内での 呼び出し規約 はわけて考えた方が良い .
NaCl SDK が提供する API には , POSIX で定義された関 数( システムコール ) のサブセットと ブラウザ連携のための独自 API がある .
SDK にはこれらの API 呼び出しをラップした関数の静的ライブラリが含まれている .
アプリケーションはこれをリンクする .
それらのラップ関数は , 所定の呼び出し規約に従って API 本体を呼び出す .
IA32 の Linux では int 命令を使う部分だけれど , NaCl のコード検証は int を禁止している .
かわりに API 呼び出しは Trampolin コードにジャンプする .
Trampolin コードは , セグメントレジスタのメモリ保護を解除するなどサンドボックスを無効化し , それからホストのコード用にスレッドを切り替える .
そのスレッドで API の実装が動作する .
OS のシステムコール呼び出しがやっていることをユーザ空間でやると思えば , だいたい合っているとおもう .
静的ライブラリには Trampolin へのジャンプだけが含まれている .
API の本体はホストのバイナリに含まれている .
( OS 毎のホスト実装が OS の違いを吸収する . ) その API 本体を呼び出す Trampolin は , ロード中に sel_ldr が生成する .
例として close ( ) を見てみよう .
SDK が提供する静的ライブラリは , 標準 C ライブラリの実装である newlib をベースにしている .
newlib は組込み OS なんかでよく使われる実装らしい .
ライブラリ関数のうち , OS に依存する部分は newlib の利用者 側( =NaCl ) で提供する必要がある .
close ( ) のエントリポイントは close .c にある .
// tools/libnacl /close .c ... extern int errno ; extern int __nacl_close ( int desc ) ; int close ( int desc ) { int retval = __nacl_close ( desc ) ; if ( retval < 0 ) { errno = - retval ; return - 1 ; } return 0 ; }
__nacl_close ( ) を呼び , エラーコードの辻褄あわせをしている .
__nacl_close ( ) は nacl_close .S で定義されている .
#include " ../../service_runtime/include/bits/nacl_syscalls.h "
# include " ../../service_runtime/nacl_config.h " . text .globl __nacl_close .p2align NACLENTRYALIGN
__nacl_close : .CLOSE_SYSCALL_ADDRESS
= NACL_SYSCALL_ADDR( NACL_sys_close ) jmp .
CLOSE_SYSCALL_ADDRESS
ここで Trampolin のアドレスに jmp する .
jmp 先の Trampolin はローダが生成する .
// sel_ldr.c ... void NaClPatchOneTrampoline ( struct NaClApp * nap , uintptr_t target_addr ) { //
Trampolin 用の雛形と relocation 情報を指定して ... struct NaClPatchInfo patch_info ; ... patch32[0 ] . target = (( uintptr_t ) & NaCl_tramp_cseg_patch ) - 6 ; patch32[0 ] .value = ( uintptr_t ) NaClSyscallSeg ; ... patch_info.abs32 = patch32 ; patch_info.num_abs32 = sizeof patch32/ sizeof patch32 [ 0 ] ; ... patch_info.dst = target_addr ; patch_info.src = ( uintptr_t ) &NaCl_trampoline_seg_code ; patch_info.nbytes = ( ( uintptr_t ) &NaCl_trampoline_seg_end - ( uintptr_t ) & NaCl_trampoline_seg_code ) ; // ゲストのコードにパッチ NaClPatchMemory ( &patch_info ) ; } ... void NaClPatchMemory ( struct NaClPatchInfo * patch ) { ... /* 雛形をゲストのコード領域にコピー */ memcpy ( ( void *) patch ->dst , ( void *) patch -> src , patch -> nbytes ) ; ... /* relocation とか ... */ }
patch する雛形は tramp .
S にある :
#include " native_client/service_runtime/nacl_config.h " . text .globl IDENTIFIER(NaCl_trampoline_seg_code ) .globl IDENTIFIER(NaCl_tramp_dseg_patch ) .globl IDENTIFIER(NaCl_tramp_cseg_patch ) .globl IDENTIFIER(NaCl_trampoline_seg_end ) IDENTIFIER(NaCl_trampoline_seg_code ) : movl $ 0xdeadbeef , %eax IDENTIFIER( NaCl_tramp_dseg_patch ) : mov %eax , %ds /* remove data sandbox */ lcall $ 0xcafe , IDENTIFIER_IMMED(NaClSyscallSeg ) /*

C 言語にもラベルをグローバルな識別子にする機能が欲しいなあ...
それはさておき , このあと NaClSyscallSeg ( ) の先で 更に各種チェックやコンテクスト切り替えを済ませ , ようやく プラットホーム毎の nacl_syscall_impl .c で定義された API ( システムコール ) の 実装が呼びだされる .
/* service_runtime/win/nacl_syscall_impl.c */ int32_t NaClSysClose ( struct NaClAppThread * natp , int d ) { return NaClCommonSysClose ( natp , d ) ; } /* service_runtime/nacl_syscall_common.c */ int32_t NaClCommonSysClose ( struct NaClAppThread * natp , int d ) { int retval = - NACL_ABI_EBADF ; struct NaClDesc *ndp ; NaClLog ( 4 , " Entered NaClCommonSysClose ( 0x%08x , %d )
" , ( uintptr_t ) natp , d ) ; NaClSysCommonThreadSyscallEnter(natp ) ; NaClXMutexLock ( &natp->nap->desc_mu ) ; ndp = NaClGetDescMu(natp -> nap , d ) ; if ( NULL != ndp ) { NaClSetDescMu(natp->nap , d , NULL ) ; /*
Unref the desc_tbl */ } NaClXMutexUnlock ( &natp->nap->desc_mu ) ; NaClLog ( 5 , " Invoking Close virtual function of object 0x%08x
" , ( uintptr_t ) ndp ) ; if ( NULL != ndp ) { retval = ( * ndp->vtbl - > Close ) ( ndp , natp ->effp ) ; /* Unref */ } NaClSysCommonThreadSyscallLeave( natp ) ; return retval ; }
いやー大変だわ . 実装自体も単純に close ( ) を呼ぶんじゃなくて 自前で descriptor table を管理してるし ...
帰り道も同じような苦難の旅が続きそうだけれど割愛させていただきます.
また話がそれていた .
NaCl がどうやってユーザ空間だけで ABI の仮想化を実現しているか 眺めてみるという話だった :
int 命令を使わずに済ませるため , 独自の ABI を定義してい る
その ABI は Trampoline 経由でホストに移るというもの まずサンドボックスを解除する コンテクスト切り替えやら何やらをして実装にを呼び出す 帰り道は逆をや る

For these " decoupled " superscalar x86 processors , register renaming is absolutely critical due to the meager 8 registers of the x86 architecture .
This differs strongly from the RISC architectures , where providing more registers via renaming only has a minor effect .
Nonetheless , with clever register renaming , the full bag of RISC tricks become available to the x86 world , with the two exceptions of advanced static instruction scheduling ( because the micro- instructions are hidden behind the x86 layer and thus are less visible to compilers ) and the use of a large register set to avoid memory accesses ( because x86 only has 8 architecturally - visible registers ) .
The solution , invented independently ( at about the same time ) by engineers at both NexGen and Intel , was to dynamically decode the x86 instructions into simple , RISC - like micro-instructions , which can then be executed by a fast , RISC - style register - renaming OOO superscalar core .
While the Pentium , a superscalar x86 , was an amazing piece of engineering , it was clear that the big problem was the complex and messy x86 instruction set .
Complex addressing modes and a minimal number of registers meant that few instructions could be executed in parallel due to potential dependencies .
For the x86 camp to compete with the RISC platforms , they needed to find a way to " get around " the x86 instruction set .
So where does x86 fit into all this , and how have Intel and AMD been able to remain competitive through all of these developments in spite of an architecture that 's now more than 20 years old ?
No matter which route is taken , the key problem is still the same  normal programs just do n't have a lot of fine - grained parallelism in them .
A 4 - issue superscalar processor requires four independent instructions to be available , with all their dependencies and latencies met , at every cycle .
In reality this is virtually never possible , especially with load latencies of two or three cycles ( and increasing with every processor generation ) .
Currently , real - world instruction - level parallelism for mainstream applications is limited to about 2 instructions per cycle at best .
Certain types of applications do exhibit more parallelism , such as scientific code , but these are generally not representative of mainstream applications .
There are also some types of code , such as pointer chasing , where even sustaining 1 instruction per cycle is extremely difficult .
For those programs , the key problem is the memory system ( which we 'll get to later ) .
DEC , for example , went primarily speed - demon with the first two generations of Alpha , then changed to brainiac for the third generation .
MIPS did similarly .
Sun , on the other hand , went brainiac with their first superscalar then switched to speed - demon for more recent designs .
The PowerPC camp has also gradually moved away from brainiac designs over the years , although the reservation stations in all PowerPC designs do offer a degree of OOO execution between different functional units even if the instructions within each functional unit 's queue are executed strictly in order .
Intel is sort - of going both ways at once  x86 processors have no choice but to be at least somewhat brainiac due to limitations of the x86 architecture ( though the Pentium - 4 is about as speed - demon as possible for a decoupled x86 microarchitecture ) , but with IA64 , Intel is betting solidly on the smart - compiler approach , with a simple but very wide design relying totally on static scheduling ( at least in the first two generations ) .
When it comes to the brainiac debate , many vendors have gone down one path then changed their mind and switched to the other side ...
Exactly which is the more important factor is currently open to hot debate .
At present , it seems that both the benefits and the costs of OOO execution have been somewhat overstated .
In terms of cost , appropriate pipelining of the dispatch and register renaming logic has allowed OOO processors to achieve clock speeds competitive with simpler designs  the aggressively OOO Alpha 21264 , moderately OOO PowerPC G4e , and simpler in - order UltraSPARC -III are all available at comparable clock speeds , for example .
This is a testament to some outstanding engineering by processor architects .
Unfortunately , however , the effectiveness of OOO execution in dynamically extracting additional instruction - level parallelism has been disappointing , with only a relatively small improvement being seen 3 .
OOO execution has also been unable to deliver the degree of schedule - insensitivity originally hoped for , with recompilation still producing large speedups even on aggressive OOO processors such as the MIPS R10000 and Alpha 21264 .
Brainiac designs are at the smart - machine end of the spectrum , like IBM 's POWER2 and the MIPS R10000 , whereas speed - demon designs like the Alpha 21164 and UltraSPARC rely on a smart compiler .
Clearly , OOO hardware should make it possible for more instruction - level parallelism to be extracted , because things will be known at runtime that cannot be predicted in advance ( cache misses , for example ) .
On the other hand , an in - order design is potentially able to run at faster clock speeds at any given point in time , due to reduced design complexity .
Whether compilers can do the task of instruction scheduling well enough or not is a hot question at the moment in the hardware industry .
This is called the brainiac vs speed - demon debate .
This simple ( and fun ) classification of design styles first appeared in a 1993 Microprocessor Report editorial by Linley Gwennap , and was made widely known by Dileep Bhandarkar 's Alpha Implementations & Architecture book .
Most of the early superscalars were in - order designs ( SuperSPARC , hyperSPARC , UltraSPARC , Alpha 21064 & 21164 ) .
Examples of OOO designs include the MIPS R10000 , Alpha 21264 and to some extent the entire POWER / PowerPC line ( with their reservation stations ) .
UltraSPARC-III is the most notable recent design which has stayed in - order and not added any OOO execution hardware .
The compiler approach also has some other advantages over OOO hardware  it can see further down the program than the hardware , and it can speculate down multiple paths rather than just one ( a big issue if branches are unpredictable ) .
On the other hand , a compiler can't be expected to be psychic , so it can't necessarily get everything perfect all the time .
Without OOO hardware , the pipeline will stall when the compiler fails to predict something like a cache miss .
Another approach to the whole problem is to have the compiler optimize the code by rearranging the instructions ( called static , or compile - time , instruction scheduling ) .
The rearranged instruction stream can then be fed to a processor with simpler in - order multiple - issue logic , relying on the compiler to " spoon feed " the processor with the best instruction stream .
Avoiding the need for complex OOO logic should make the processor quite a lot easier to design , and should potentially make it easier to ramp up the clock speed over time .
All of this dependency analysis , register renaming and OOO execution adds a lot of complex logic to the processor , making it harder to design and potentially harder to ramp up the clock speed over time .
On the other hand , it offers the advantage that software need not be recompiled to get at least some of the benefits of the new processor 's design ( though typically not all ) .
If the processor is going to execute instructions out of order , it will need to keep in mind the dependencies between those instructions .
This can be made easier by not dealing with the raw architecturally - defined registers , but instead using a set of renamed registers .
For example , a store of a register into memory , followed by a load of some other piece of memory into the same register , represent different values and need not go into the same physical register .
Furthermore , if these different instructions are mapped to different physical registers they can be executed in parallel , which is the whole point of OOO execution .
So , the processor must keep a mapping of the instructions in flight at any moment and the physical registers they use .
This process is called register renaming .
As an added bonus , it becomes possible to work with a potentially larger set of real registers in an attempt to extract even more parallelism out of the code .
There are two ways to do this .
One approach is to do the reordering in hardware at runtime .
Doing dynamic instruction scheduling ( reordering ) in the processor means the dispatch logic must be enhanced to look at groups of instructions and dispatch them out of order as best it can to use the processor 's functional units .
Not surprisingly , this is called out - of - order execution , or just OOO for short ( sometimes written OoO or OOE ) .
If branches and long latency instructions are going to cause bubbles in the pipeline (s ) , then perhaps those empty cycles can be used to do other work .
To achieve this , the instructions in the program must be reordered so that while one instruction is waiting , other instructions can execute .
For example , it might be possible to find a couple of other instructions from further down in the program and put them between the two instructions in the earlier multiply example .
Interestingly , the ARM architecture used in many portable handheld devices was the first architecture with a fully predicated instruction set .
This is even more intriguing given that the ARM processors only have short pipelines and thus relatively small mispredict penalties .
The Alpha architecture has had a conditional move instruction since the very beginning .
MIPS , SPARC and x86 added it later .
With IA64 , however , Intel has gone all - out and made almost every instruction predicated in the hope of dramatically reducing branching problems in inner loops , especially ones where the branches are unpredictable ( such as compilers and OS kernels ) .
It will be interesting to see whether this works out well or not for IA64 .
Of course , if the blocks of code in the if and else cases were longer , then using predication would mean executing more instructions than using a branch , because the processor is effectively executing both paths through the code .
Whether it 's worth executing a few more instructions to avoid a branch is a tricky decision  for very small or very large blocks the decision is simple , but for medium - sized blocks there are complex trade - offs which the optimizer must consider .
Given this new predicated move instruction , two instructions have been eliminated from the code , and both were costly branches .
In addition , by being clever and always doing the first mov then overwriting it if necessary , the parallelism of the code has also been increased  lines 1 and 2 can now be executed in parallel , resulting in a 50 % speedup ( 2 cycles rather than 3 ) .
Most importantly , though , the possibility of getting the branch prediction wrong and suffering a large mispredict penalty has been eliminated .
Here , a new instruction has been introduced called cmovle , for " conditional move if less than or equal " .
This instruction works by executing as normal , but only commits itself if its condition is true .
This is called a predicated instruction because its execution is controlled by a predicate ( a true / false test ) .
Consider the above example once again .
Of the five instructions , two are branches , and one of those is an unconditional branch .
If it was possible to somehow tag the mov instructions to tell them to execute only under some conditions , the code could be simplified ...
Conditional branches are so problematic that it would be nice to eliminate them altogether .
Clearly , if statements cannot be eliminated from programming languages , so how can the resulting branches possibly be eliminated ?
The answer lies in the way some branches are used .
Unfortunately , even the best branch prediction techniques are sometimes wrong , and with a deep pipeline many instructions might need to be cancelled .
This is called the mispredict penalty .
The Pentium - Pro/II / III is a good example  it has a 12 + stage pipeline and thus a mispredict penalty of 10 - 15 cycles .
Even with a clever dynamic branch predictor that correctly predicts an impressive 90 % of the time , this high mispredict penalty means about 30 % of the Pentium - Pro / II / III 's performance is lost due to mispredicts .
Put another way , one third of the time the Pentium - Pro / II / III is not doing useful work but instead is saying " oops , wrong way " .
The other alternative is to have the processor make the guess at runtime .
Normally , this is done by using an on -chip branch prediction table containing the addresses of recent branches and a bit indicating whether each branch was taken or not last time .
In reality , most processors actually use two bits , so that a single not - taken occurrence does n't reverse a generally taken prediction ( important for loop back edges ) .
Of course , this dynamic branch prediction table takes up valuable space on the processor chip , but branch prediction is so important that it 's well worth it .
The key question is how the processor should make the guess .
Two alternatives spring to mind .
First , the compiler might be able to mark the branch to tell the processor which way to go .
This is called static branch prediction .
It would be ideal if there was a bit in the instruction format in which to encode the prediction , but for older architectures this is not an option , so a convention can be used instead ( such as backward branches are predicted to be taken while forward branches are predicted not - taken ) .
More importantly , however , this approach requires the compiler to be quite smart in order for it to make the correct guess , which is easy for loops but might be difficult for other branches .
So the processor must make a guess .
The processor will then fetch down the path it guessed and speculatively begin executing those instructions .
Of course , it wo n't be able to actually commit ( writeback ) those instructions until the outcome of the branch is known .
Worse , if the guess is wrong the instructions will have to be cancelled , and those cycles will have been wasted .
But if the guess is correct the processor will be able to continue on at full speed .
Now consider a pipelined processor executing this code sequence .
By the time the conditional branch at line 2 reaches the execute stage in the pipeline , the processor must have already fetched and decoded the next couple of instructions .
But which instructions ?
Should it fetch and decode the if branch ( lines 3 & 4 ) or the else branch ( line 5 ) ?
It wo n't really know until the conditional branch gets to the execute stage , but in a deeply pipelined processor that might be several cycles away .
And it can't afford to just wait  the processor encounters a branch every six instructions on average , and if it was to wait several cycles at every branch then most of the performance gained by using pipelining in the first place would be lost .
Latencies for memory loads are particularly troublesome , in part because they tend to occur early within code sequences , which makes it difficult to fill their delays with useful instructions , and equally importantly because they are somewhat unpredictable  the load latency varies a lot depending on whether the access is a cache hit or not ( we 'll get to caches later ) .
From a compiler 's point of view , typical latencies in modern processors range from a single cycle for integer operations , to around 3 - 6 cycles for floating - point addition and the same or perhaps slightly longer for multiplication , through to over a dozen cycles for integer division .
The number of cycles between when an instruction reaches the execute stage and when its result is available for use by other instructions is called the instruction 's latency 2 .
The deeper the pipeline , the more stages and thus the longer the latency .
So a very deep pipeline is not much more effective than a short one , because a deep one just gets filled up with bubbles thanks to all those nasty instructions depending on each other .
If the first instruction was a simple integer addition then this might still be okay in a pipelined single issue processor , because integer addition is quick and the result of the first instruction would be available just in time to feed it back into the next instruction ( using bypasses ) .
However in the case of a multiply , which will take several cycles to complete , there is no way the result of the first instruction will be available when the second instruction reaches the execute stage just one cycle later .
So , the processor will need to stall the execution of the second instruction until its data is available , inserting a bubble into the pipeline where no work gets done .
The second instruction depends on the first  the processor can't execute the second instruction until after the first has completed calculating its result .
This is a serious problem , because instructions that depend on each other cannot be executed in parallel .
Thus , multiple issue is impossible in this case .
How far can pipelining and multiple issue be taken ?
If a 5 stage pipeline is 5 times faster , why not build a 20 stage superpipeline ?
If 4 - issue superscalar is good , why not go for 8 - issue ?
For that matter , why not build a processor with a 50 stage pipeline which issues 20 instructions per cycle ?
No VLIW designs have yet been commercially successful , however Intel 's IA64 architecture , which is now in production in the form of the Itanium - I / II processors , was intended to be the replacement for x86 ( and may still end up that way , although this is looking increasingly unlikely ) .
Intel chose to call IA64 an " EPIC " design , for " explicitly parallel instruction computing " , but it 's basically just a VLIW with clever grouping ( to allow long - term compatibility ) and predication ( see below ) .
Many graphics processors ( often called GPU's ) can in some ways be considered VLIW - like ( although obviously they only provide single - purpose instruction sets ) , and there 's also Transmeta ( see the x86 section , coming up soon ) .
It is worth noting , however , that most VLIW designs are not interlocked .
This means they do not check for dependencies between instructions , and often have no way of stalling instructions other than to stall the whole processor on a cache miss .
As a result , the compiler needs to insert the appropriate number of cycles between dependent instructions , even if there are no instructions to fill the gap , by using nops ( no- operations ) if necessary .
This complicates the compiler somewhat , because it is doing something that a superscalar processor normally does at runtime , however the extra code in the compiler is minimal and it saves precious resources on the processor chip .
Other than the simplification of the dispatch logic , VLIW processors are much like superscalar processors .
This is especially so from a compiler 's point of view ( more on this later ) .
A VLIW processor 's instruction flow is much like a superscalar , except that the decode / dispatch stage is much simpler and only occurs for each group of sub-instructions ...
In this style of processor , the " instructions " are really groups of little sub-instructions , and thus the instructions themselves are very long ( often 128 bits or more ) , hence the name VLIW  very long instruction word .
Each instruction contains information for multiple parallel operations .
In cases where backward compatibility is not an issue , it is possible for the instruction set itself to be designed to explicitly group instructions to be executed in parallel .
This approach eliminates the need for complex dependency checking logic in the dispatch stage , which should make the processor easier to design ( and easier to ramp up the clock speed over time , at least in theory ) .
The issue - widths of current processors range from 2 - issue ( MIPS R5000 ) to 3 - issue ( PowerPC G3 / G4 , Pentium - Pro/ II / III /M , Athlon , Pentium - 4 ( well , sort - of ) ) or 4 - issue ( UltraSPARC , MIPS R10000 , Alpha 21164 & 21264 , PowerPC G4e ) or 5 - issue ( PowerPC G5 ) , or even 6 - issue ( Itanium - I / II , but it 's a VLIW  see below ) .
The exact number and type of functional units in each processor depends on its target market .
Some processors have more floating - point execution resources ( MIPS R8000 , IBM 's POWER line , Athlon 1 ) , others are more integer - biased ( Pentium - Pro / II / III /M , PowerPC G3 ) , some devote much of their resources towards SIMD vector instructions ( PowerPC G4 & G4e ) , and many take the middle ground ( UltraSPARC , MIPS R10000 , Alpha 21164 & 21264 , Pentium - 4 , Itanium - I/ II , PowerPC G5 ) .
Of course , there 's nothing stopping a processor from having both a deep pipeline and multiple instruction issue , so it can be both superpipelined and superscalar at the same time ...
The IBM POWER1 processor , the predecessor of PowerPC , was the first mainstream superscalar processor .
Most of the RISC 's went superscalar soon after ( SuperSPARC , Alpha 21064 ) .
Intel even managed to build a superscalar x86  the original Pentium  however the complex x86 instruction set was a real problem for them ( more on this later ) .
Note that the issue - width is less than the number of functional units  this is typical .
There must be more functional units because different code sequences have different mixes of instructions .
The idea is to execute 3 instructions per cycle , but those instructions are not always going to be 1 integer , 1 floating - point and 1 memory operation , so more than 3 functional units are required .
This is great !
There are now 3 instructions completing every cycle ( CPI = 0.33 , or IPC = 3 ) .
The number of instructions able to be issued or completed per cycle is called a processor 's width .
In the above example , the processor could potentially execute 3 different instructions per cycle  for example one integer , one floating - point and one memory operation .
Even more functional units could be added , so that the processor might be able to execute two integer instructions per cycle , or two floating - point instructions , or whatever the target applications could best use .
Of course , now that there are independent pipelines for each functional unit , they can even be different lengths .
This allows the simpler instructions to complete more quickly , reducing latency ( which we 'll get to soon ) .
There are also a bunch of bypasses within and between the various pipelines , but these have been left out for simplicity .
Since the execute stage of the pipeline is really a bunch of different functional units , each doing its own task , it seems tempting to try to execute multiple instructions in parallel , each in its own functional unit .
To do this , the fetch and decode / dispatch stages must be enhanced so that they can decode multiple instructions in parallel and send them out to the " execution resources " ...
Today , most processors strive to keep the number of levels of logic down to just a handful for each pipeline stage ( about 10 - 20 levels ) , and most have quite deep pipelines ( 4 - 7 in PowerPC G3 / G4 , 5 - 7 in MIPS R10000 , 7 - 9 in Alpha 21164 , 7- 12 in PowerPC G4e , 8 - 10 in Itanium - II , 9 in UltraSPARC , 10 - 15 in Athlon , 12 + in Pentium - Pro/II / III , 14 in UltraSPARC-III , 16 - 25 in PowerPC G5 , 20 + in Pentium - 4 ) .
The x86 processors generally have deeper pipelines than the RISC 's because they need to do extra work to decode the x86 instructions ( more on this later ) .
The Alpha architects in particular liked this idea , which is why the early Alpha 's had very deep pipelines and ran at such very high clock speeds for their era .
The MIPS R4000 series was also superpipelined ( in fact the R4000 was only superpipelined and not superscalar , see below ) .
Since the clock speed is limited by ( among other things ) the length of the longest stage in the pipeline , the logic gates that make up each stage can be subdivided , especially the longer ones , converting the pipeline into a deeper super - pipeline with a larger number of shorter stages .
Then the whole processor can be run at a higher clock speed !
Of course , each instruction will now take more cycles to complete ( latency ) , but the processor will still be completing 1 instruction per cycle ( throughput ) , and there will be more cycles per second , so the processor will complete more instructions per second ( actual performance ) ...
The early RISC processors , such as IBM 's 801 research prototype , the MIPS R2000 ( based on the Stanford MIPS machine ) and the original SPARC ( derived from the Berkeley RISC project ) , all implemented a simple 5 stage pipeline not unlike the one shown above ( the extra stage is for memory access , placed after execute ) .
At the same time , the mainstream 80386 , 68030 and VAX processors worked sequentially using microcode ( it 's easier to pipeline a RISC because the instructions are all simple register - to - register operations , unlike x86 , 68 k or VAX ) .
As a result , a SPARC running at 20 MHz was way faster than a 386 running at 33 MHz .
Every processor since then has been pipelined , at least to some extent .
A good summary of the original RISC research projects can be found in this 1985 CACM research paper by David Patterson .
Although the pipeline stages look simple , it is important to remember that the execute stage in particular is really made up of several different groups of logic ( several sets of gates ) , making up different functional units for each type of operation that the processor must be able to perform ...
Since the result from each instruction is available after the execute stage has completed , the next instruction ought to be able to use that value immediately , rather than waiting for that result to be committed to its destination register in the writeback stage .
To allow this , forwarding lines called bypasses are added , going backwards along the pipeline ...
At the beginning of each clock cycle , the data and control information for a partially processed instruction is held in a pipeline latch , and this information forms the inputs to the logic circuits of the next pipeline stage .
During the clock cycle , the signals propagate through the combinatorial logic of the stage , producing an output just in time to be captured by the next pipeline latch at the end of the clock cycle ...
From the hardware point of view , each pipeline stage consists of some combinatorial logic and possibly access to a register set and / or some form of high speed cache memory .
The pipeline stages are separated by latches .
A common clock signal synchronizes the latches between each stage , so that all the latches capture the results produced by the pipeline stages at the same time .
In effect , the clock " pumps " instructions down the pipeline .
Modern processors overlap these stages in a pipeline , like an assembly line .
While one instruction is executing , the next instruction is being decoded , and the one after that is being fetched ...
Consider how an instruction is executed  first it is fetched , then decoded , then executed by the appropriate functional unit , and finally the result is written into place .
With this scheme , a simple processor might take 4 cycles per instruction ( CPI = 4 ) ...
Instructions are executed one after the other inside the processor , right ?
Well , that makes it easy to understand , but that 's not really what happens .
In fact , that has n't happened since the middle of the 1980's .
Instead , several instructions are all partially executing at the same time .
How can this be ?
Obviously , there 's more to it than just clock speed  it's all about how much work gets done in each clock cycle .
Which leads to ...
A 200 MHz MIPS R10000 , a 300 MHz UltraSPARC and a 400 MHz Alpha 21164 are all about the same speed at running most programs , yet they differ by a factor of two in clock speed .
A 300 MHz Pentium - II is also about the same speed for many things , yet it 's about half that speed for floating - point code such as scientific number crunching .
A PowerPC G3 at that same 300 MHz is somewhat faster than the others for integer code , but still far slower than the top 3 for floating - point .
At the other extreme , an IBM POWER2 processor at just 135 MHz matches the 400 MHz Alpha 21164 in floating - point speed , yet it 's only half as fast for normal integer programs .
The first issue that must be cleared up is the difference between clock speed and a processor 's performance .
They are not the same thing .
Look at the results for processors of the recent past ...
But be prepared  this article is brief and to - the - point .
It pulls no punches and the pace is pretty fierce ( really ) .
Let 's get into it ...
Fear not !
This article will get you up to speed fast .
In no time you 'll be discussing the finer points of superscalar - vs - VLIW , the brainiac debate and its relationship to IA64 and Itanium .
Okay , so you 're a CS graduate and you did a hardware / assembly course as part of your degree , but perhaps that was a few years ago now and you have n't really kept up with the details of processor designs since then .
DFLer Al Franken 's 225 - vote lead in the marathon U.S. Senate recount was unanimously certified Monday by the state Canvassing Board , prompting attorneys for Republican Norm Coleman to immediately declare that they will challenge the results in court .
In a brief statement outside his Minneapolis townhouse , Franken said he was humbled and proud to be " the next senator from Minnesota , " even as he acknowledged that the legal wrangling probably is n't over .
" Whether you voted for me or not , I want every Minnesotan to hear this : I work for you now , and I will work hard to earn your confidence , " Franken said , declining to say when he would leave for the nation 's capital .
The lawsuit that Coleman 's attorneys said they would file today is called an election contest .
It will prevent Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , under state law , from officially certifying Franken 's election until the legal process has run its course .
No one knows how long that might take , but Coleman attorney Fritz Knaak said their case will pivot in part on constitutional issues , such as the equal protection clause , that typically are decided by the U.S. Supreme Court .
With Coleman 's
Senate term officially ended and no one yet positioned to take the seat , Minnesota is left with a single senator just as Congress is expected to grapple with the nation 's financial meltdown .
Congress convenes today .
The Coleman campaign 's last hope to postpone the board 's action had crumbled earlier Monday when the Minnesota Supreme Court rejected its petition to order the review of 654 rejected absentee ballots that the campaign said appeared to be validly cast .
Those ballots , which had been labeled as properly rejected by local election officials , were left out of the pool of ballots counted Saturday that boosted Franken 's margin from 49 to 225 .
They will be key to Coleman 's legal contest , along with up to 150 ballots in DFL - leaning precincts that the campaign said were counted twice , and 133 Minneapolis votes that were counted ( based on the Election Day tally ) though the actual ballots could n't be found during the hand recount .
Results , not winner , certified
Two months after the election and nearly seven weeks after the recount began , the board took less than 10 minutes to certify final results showing Franken with 1,212,431 votes and Coleman with 1,212,206 .
Ritchie made it clear that the board was n't declaring a winner , just certifying the results emerging from the process of recounting about 2.9 million undisputed ballots , thousands of challenged votes and hundreds of wrongly rejected absentee ballots .
The four judicial members who joined Ritchie on the board each praised the secretary of state and his staff for their work , and said they were satisfied that all valid votes had been counted " at least within the confines of the law , " said Ramsey County District Judge Edward Cleary .
Minnesota Chief Justice Eric Magnuson called the recount " an important and historic effort " of such a scale that it should n't be expected to happen " without a few squeaks and protests . "
Ramsey County Chief District Judge Kathleen Gearin called the recount fascinating , occasionally frustrating and always exciting .
" If we have made any [ mistakes ] -- and we probably have -- our mistakes have been the mistakes of the warm - hearted , and the mistakes of the honest - hearted , and the mistakes of the good - hearted , just like the people of Minnesota , " she said .
In rejecting Coleman 's request to reconsider the 654 ballots during the recount , the Supreme Court did not address the merits of his claim that the ballots may have been wrongly rejected .
Instead , it said he could later pursue a lawsuit to make his case .
Any court contest must be filed within seven days .
It would be held in Ramsey County District Court and presided over by a three - judge panel .
The Supreme Court had previously ruled that county elections officials and the two campaigns must agree on which rejected absentee ballots should be included .
They agreed to include 933 that the counties said were improperly rejected because of clerical errors or other reasons .
When those ballots -- which came disproportionately from DFL - leaning precincts -- were counted over the weekend , Franken 's lead rose to 225 .
Coleman last week asked the court to direct the counties to send all rejected absentee ballots to Ritchie , so he and the two campaigns could review them and jointly decide which to include in the recount .
The 654 absentee ballots that the campaign referred to in its request are mostly from rural and suburban areas of the state where Coleman ran well .
In an opinion written by Justice Alan Page , the court noted that it had required unanimity among the campaigns and counties on which absentee ballots would be included and which excluded .
" Local election officials have acted diligently ... and together with the candidates have agreed upon more than 900 rejected absentee ballots , which have now been opened and counted , " the opinion said .
Criticism , deflection Coleman attorney Tony Trimble accused unnamed members of Ritchie 's office of engaging in partisan acts during the recount , but Ritchie deflected the criticism .
" We are not spending any time in responding to personal attacks , " he said .
At al - Shifa hospital , Gaza ’s largest , an unidentified injured man is laying at the hospital ’s intensive care unit .
He was hit by shrapnel from an Israeli missile that struck a target at the Samer crossroad in the Omar al - Mukhtar street in Gaza City at noon yesterday .
“ This wounded patient has sustained critical injuries and his condition is unstable , but we do n’t yet know his identity , he is still unknown , ” Dr. Omar Manasra , the on - duty doctor of the intensive care unit ( ICU ) said .
Manasra added , “ Since the Israeli strikes began on Saturday , we have received at least 30 unidentified wounded at the ICU ; most of them were later identified , but this took some time .
We just labeled them with figures like , unknown number 1 , number 2 , etc . ”
Manasra explained the challenges faced by the ICU with the mounting number of wounded : “ We suffer a severe lack of medicines , equipment and beds at our unit .
In the first day of the air strikes alone , we received almost 50 cases , and that has overloaded our capacity .
“ We have only 12 beds , so we have been forced to open new emergency ICUs in other sections like the cardiac , the orthopedic and the maternity wards .
Also , I would like to add that we lack basic ICU medicines like antibiotics …
In addition we are in need for equipment like ventilators and monitors . ”
In the Gaza Strip , home to 1.5 million residents , there are seven main hospitals .
According to Hammam Nasman , spokesperson of the Hamas - run health ministry , such an emergency situation in Gaza can not be dealt with by the hospitals .
“ The health situation in Gaza is still miserable as Gaza ’s [ medical professionals ] try relentlessly to cope with this unprecedented emergency situation .
Our field crews are at risk and four medics have been killed and a few others injured during rescue operations , ” Nasman explained .
Nasman added that there are 1,534 physicians at all the main hospitals and they cannot serve the needs of all of those requiring treatment during this emergency situation .
As a result , many cases have been transferred to other private hospitals or clinics .
Nasman pointed out that so far , his ministry has been coordinating with concerned Egyptian and other Palestinian bodies in order to distribute some Arab - provided assistance .
He alluded to the need for more assistance as the hospitals lack 230 medical needs including alcohol , Bludine and stitching thread .
He also confirmed that most of the power generators at the hospitals have been depleted of their fuel stocks and that many of them have broken down and need spare parts , the import of which Israel denies .
Gaza has been experiencing electricity blackouts for more than 70 percent of the time , on a daily basis , since Israel severely restricted the import of fuel to Gaza ’s power plant in November of last year , when a six - month Egyptian - brokered truce collapsed following an Israeli attack on Gaza .
Dr. Moawiya Abu Hassanein , chief of the emergency and ambulance department at the health ministry , said that the ambulances run by the ministry are operating at less than 50 percent of their actual capacity , as Israeli air raids have so far damaged five ambulances and three fire trucks .
Two ambulance crew members are reported to have lost their lives while responding to the scenes of Israeli strikes .
The Israeli attacks from air , sea and ground that began last Saturday on the pretext of halting the firing of rockets from the coastal enclave have so far claimed the lives of more than 400 Palestinians and wounded at least 2,000 .
Most of the casualties are civilians and non-combatants , like the unidentified patient lying in al - Shifa hospital .
Unidentified Palestinians are being victimized for the sake of unidentified objectives .
Israel claims it is targeting Hamas , while in fact , it is targeting whoever and whatever in Gaza .
For the past seven days , Israeli air raids completely devastated scores of civilian ministerial buildings , municipal premises , charities , universities , schools , homes and mosques .
Israeli pilots in fighter jets do not see or care about the identities of those who receive their bombs as it is not just Hamas but the whole of the Palestinian people who are their targets .
Meanwhile , Gaza doctors struggle to find the identities of what is left of the victims after those bombs are delivered .
Rami Almeghari is contributor to The Electronic Intifada , IMEMC.org and Free Speech Radio News and is a part - time lecturer on media and political translation at the Islamic University of Gaza .
Rami is also a former senior English translator at and editor - in - chief of the international press center of the Gaza - based Palestinian Information Service .

This year , in 2009 , we ’ll get to see Megan Fox fighting alongside Autobots once again to protect our world from the invasion of Decepticons in the upcoming “ Transformers ” sequel , “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” .
The movie is said to be much more realistic than the original , so realistic that it had 22 - year - old actress “ genuinely terrified ” .
She recalled ,
“ It makes you run fast because you are genuinely terrified .
And you still feel blanks – with that many guns going off , you never really know .
During filming I ’ve got 75 military officers firing at me , shrapnel falling on my head that ’s bigger than my arms .
It ’s hard to be normal .
Even an eyelash flying at you at 700 miles an hour will cut you .
You ’re running past them , and your clearance is only about 10 feet .
These dudes are moving , and if one trips or falls and we run into the muzzle of a blank , that could blow your chest open or burn you . ”
If this is not sexy enough , she ’ll also play a possessed cheerleader turns into a killer in “ Jennifer ’s Body ” , who specializes in offing her male classmates .
I know it sounds like a generic cheesy horror movie that we ’ve seen too much in the past , but if this is a product of the creator of “ Juno ” , we should expect nothing less .
If you are a fan of Megan Fox , you ’ve probably seen the topless pictures below , which were shot in last summer when filming “ Jennifer ’s Body ” in Vancouver .
The sad thing is she had flesh - colored pasties on , but those could do little to nothing to cover up her perfect breasts .
Since she already burned up the Golden Globes , and her two anticipated movies will be out in a few months , we think it makes perfect sense to heat you guys up with our gallery of Megan Fox before they hit the theaters this summer .
And before you start wondering if the naked picture of Megan Fox on the top left is real , let me assure you that it is not , but you ’ve got to love how nicely it ’s done .
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy 's Nude Image on Shopping Bags ( Photos )
French first ladyis hot under the collar over a clothing manufacturer who has produced a white canvas shopping bag that uses her nude image as the design feature .
Her lawyer has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the former supermodel .
The trendy bags , produced by Pardon , are being sold on the French island of Reunion and will be available soon throughout France , according to company manager Peter Mertes .
The wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy will be represented by her legal team in court on Monday .
Their mission is to get a judge to ban sales of the bag .
A spokesman for her lawyer Thierry Herzog said , " This bag makes use of Mrs Bruni - Sarkoszy 's image without her consent and for commercial gain . "
The image was taken from a 1993 black and white photo of the supermodel standing upright in the nude .
The famous photo sold at a New York auction early this year for $ 91,000 .
It was offered up for sale along with nude pics of Kate Moss and Gisele Bundchen .
Check out the story here .
Mertes has reportedly manufactured 10,000 of the nude bags already and has given most of them as gifts to clients who have bought other products .
He contends that he is entitled to use the photo because Bruni-Sarkozy is a public figure .

This post is basically just an reply to Josh Berkus blog post .
Additionally , it refers to “ SQL Coding Standards To Each His Own " by Leo Hsu and Regina Obe .
Well , I 've read what Josh wrote , and I though to myself – oh my , I must be doing something wrong , as I would never use long aliases .
Then I read what Leo and Regina wrote , and I regained some confidence in my choice .
But , to say so , I could simply add a comment on Josh post .
So , I 'd like to add something from myself .
The topic of writing maintainable queries is very close to me , as I worked with a lot of strangely written queries , did the same as Josh – spending 30 minutes to rewrite the query just to understand what it really does .
I have seen queries written by people , ORMs ( Josh should like them I guess , but I hate the queries written by Hibernate and Django ) .
During the time , I decided that my priorities for writing maintainable queries :
Avoid useless typing .
Use aliases for tables / views .
Always .
And make them sensible aliases .
Indent code in some way .
Avoid quotations ( yes , this is why I hate Django ) Use join syntax
List is not long , but that 's because SQL queries are usually relatively simple as they do one thing at a time .
As for “ Avoid useless typing " – long , repeated names make it ( for me ) more difficult to read , repeated expressions make it easier to make mistake when maintaining ( changing “ + 1 " to “ + 2 " in 2 out of 3 places in query ) .
This goes for repetition of table names like :
SELECT search_query .
id , search_query .
criteria , search_query .
url FROM search_query WHERE ( search_query .
url = '...' )
As for aliases – imagine this situation – you rewrote above query to avoid repetition to :
SELECT id , criteria , url FROM search_query WHERE url = '...'
But then you have to join some other table ( which luckily does n't contain any columns named the same way ) , add a where , and add new column to be returned :
SELECT id , criteria , url , some_column FROM search_query JOIN some_table ON id = sqid WHERE url = '...'
AND some_option = '...'
ORDER BY ordering
Now , tell me – which table does “ some_column " come from ?
And “ criteria " ?
Of course – “ criteria " is simple – we know it came from “ search_query " , but we know it only because we just modified the query .
If some poor guy will come in my place in a month , and he will see the query he will have to manually check which table given column belongs to .
This is especially important if you 'd ever would like to ask for help on irc in case of “ slow query " – as the situation is much different depending on which of columns ( id , sqid , url , some_option and ordering ) are in the same table .
As for sensible aliases – make them short , but meaninful .
In this case – I would probably go with “ q " ( like query ) and “ st " for “ some_table " , but your preference might be different .
So , the query would look :
SELECT q . id , q .
criteria , q . url , st .
some_column FROM search_query AS q JOIN some_table AS st ON q .
id = st . sqid WHERE q . url = '...'
AND st .
some_option = '...'
ORDER BY st .
ordering
Remember that by “ Always use aliases " I mean also in column names – i.e. even if “ url " is unique in your database – add “ q . " .
It will not cost you much , but will give instant benefit to whoever will end up reading the query later .
“ Indenting the code " is very vague , but generally – any way will do as long as you will not generate queries like “ 4 kb in single line " – which is , sadly , what ORMs tend to do .
My preferred way of indenting is shown above – it has some drawbacks , but it works nicely for me ( side note : in my long - term todo I have plans for writing SQL beautifier , but maybe you know one that works ? )
Last point from my shortlist – avoid quotation .
This is a safeguard against cases when you 'll accidentally enter something like :
CREATE TABLE " Unintentionalcaps " ...
As a side benefit – whenever I see quoted names in queries , I tend to assume that they are quoted for a purpose ( i.e. they contain some strange characters ) , and I have to type them the same way .
Which adds keystrokes , and thus is not welcome .
And if I 'll not add them – the code will look ugly with mix of quoted and unquoted names of the same objects .
The “ join syntax " point is again inspired by Django .
It has nasty habit of using “ WHERE " part of the query to enter table join criteria .
Like this :
SELECT id , criteria , url , some_column FROM search_query , some_table WHERE url = '...'
AND some_option = '...'
AND id = sqid ORDER BY ordering
Which has at the very least 2 issues :
it makes it unclear which conditions are used for join and which are used for data filtering
if you 'll ever would like to change type of join ( to outer join for example ) you have to modify both FROM and WHERE parts of the query .
Which makes it possible that you 'll forget WHERE , and end up with outer join working like inner join .
And that would be all .
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) -
An exotic goat in Canada ’s Calgary Zoo accidentally hanged itself after it became entangled in a rope and then fell off a log , CTV television reported on Sunday .
Home video of the accident on Friday showed the Turkmenian markhor hanging lifeless from the rope in its enclosure .
Later , keepers could be seen trying to resuscitate the animal .
The zoo said in a statement that the goat had been playing with a ball on the end of a rope -- a toy designed to stimulate the animal .
The accident was the latest in a series of deaths at the zoo in the western province of Alberta .
Last November an elephant calf died of a virus and in May 2008 , 41 stingrays died for reasons that have yet to be explained .
On Jan. 21 , 2009 — his first full day in office — President Obama met privately with the military commanders in charge of Iraq .
The White House announced that morning that attendees were to expected to include the following : Vice President Joe Biden ; a representative from the State Department ; Defense Secretary Robert Gates ; White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ; national security adviser Gen. James Jones ; chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen ; Gen. David Petraeus , commander in chief , U.S. Central Command ; U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker ; and Gen. Ray Odierno , commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq .
Odierno was expected to join via video conference .
After the meeting , Obama issued a statement , included below in its entirety :
" This afternoon , I met with our ambassador to Iraq , the commander in Iraq , and the overall theater commander in the region in order to get a full update on the situation in Iraq .
Key members of my Cabinet and senior national security officials also participated in this meeting .
" The meeting was productive and I very much appreciated receiving assessments from these experienced and dedicated individuals .
During the discussion , I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq .
" In the coming days and weeks , I will also visit the Department of Defense to consult with the Joint Chiefs on these issues , and we will undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region . "
Promise Kept .
The Independent and Independent on Sunday are re-locating from their premises in Docklands to Northcliffe House , Kensington , headquarters of Associated Newspapers , according to a statement released today
Under an agreement signed today , Independent Newspaper titles will have their own dedicated office space and will share some back office services with Associated , publishers of the Daily Mail , The Mail on Sunday , Evening Standard , Metro and London Lite .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The two groups ’ editorial , management and commercial operations will remain entirely separate .
The Independent and Independent on Sunday will remain under the full ownership of INM .
The move , which will take place at the end of January 2009 , follows last week ’s announcement of a major editorial restructuring of The Independent which will deliver annual cost efficiencies of approximately £ 10 million .
The new shared service agreement with Associated will deliver additional savings .
Ivan Fallon , chief executive of Independent News and Media ( UK ) said :
“ This move will transform the prospects of the Independent titles .
We will have immediate cost savings when we move offices and take maximum advantage of the resources and services offered to us by our partners at Associated to create better and more commercially viable newspapers while staying true to the editorial values we cherish . ”
Ian Hanson , operations director of Associated Newspapers , said :
“ We look forward to welcoming Independent News and Media ( UK ) to our offices in Kensington .
The cost savings from a sharing of infrastructures will be beneficial to both organisations . ”

When there are so many Linux distros out there , you are probably wondering why one would want to create his / her own distro instead of getting a ready - made one .
While in most cases a ready - made distro is fine , if you want to have a distro that is one - hundred percent tailored to your needs ( or your mum or dad ’s needs ) , you might have to create it on your own .
With the right tools , creating your own Linux distro is n’t as hard as it seems , though it takes time for sure .
There are lots of tools for the purpose – some of them are universal , and some of them are distro -specific .
Here are eight of them .
Related : VIM Keyboard Shortcuts Cheatsheet
1. Linux Respin
Linux Respin is a fork of the now discontinued Remastersys .
Years ago , Remastersys used to be one of the most popular tools to create your own Linux distro and / or a backup of your OS .
Linux Respin does n’t offer as much as Remastersys used to , but still it does a great job if you are using a distro it ’s available for .
Linux Respin is available for Debian , Mint and Trisquel only , which kind of limits its popularity .
What I do n’t like about this tool is its almost nonexistent documentation .
2. Linux Live Kit
Linux Live
Kit is another tool you can use to create your own distro or back up your system .
It prefers Debian but fortunately can be run on other distros as well , provided it supports aufs and squashfs kernel modules .
Linux Live
Kit has a very short and sweet wizard on how to build a distro – just follow the steps and you are done .
3. Ubuntu Imager
Ubuntu Imager is a good tool to create your own Ubuntu - based distro .
It ’s not the only such app for Ubuntu , but since it ’s a good one , I chose to mention it on this list .
I am not going to review it in detail because we already have a very detailed howto with instructions about installation and operation , so if you want to run it , just check the article in the link .
4. Linux from Scratch
If you want to have absolute control on what is included in your distro and you have lots of free time , you can have a look at the Linux from Scratch project .
LFS has very extensive documentation and is a great learning resource about Linux in general , not just how to create your own distro .
Linux from Scratch allows you to build your own customized Linux system entirely from source code .
LFS is not exactly a tool , like the rest on this list , but you can still use it for the same purpose – to create your own Linux distro ( and to learn a lot about Linux as a whole ) .
5. Slax Modules Tool
If you are looking for an easy - to - use tool and you like Slax – a lightweight distro based on Slackware , you are lucky because they have an online tool you can use to pick the modules you would like included in your distro .
I ’ve used this tool in the past numerous times when I wanted to create a lightweight live system for friends of mine , and it works like a charm .
Browse through the categories of software and pick the apps you want .
Add them to the build .
Do n’t worry if you miss a thing or two , as you can always add more apps after you build and run it .
6. Live Magic
Live Magic is one more Debian tool for distro creation .
It can create CDs , USBs , and netboot images .
It ’s much simpler to use than some of the other apps on this list , such as Remastersys , but it does not use your running system to build the image .
Instead , follow a wizard and choose your configuration options as you go .
The program will pull the packages from your repositories and install them into your image .
These tools for creating your own Linux distro should help you out .
Their level of complexity ( and power ) varies , but we ’ve tried to include both easy - to - use apps and apps that give you more power .

We 're not exactly sure why burnouts are fun to watch , but boy are they ever .
In the hands of an expert , the smell of the burning tires and the roar of the engine are a thing of beauty .
For the amateur , burning prolonged rubber can lead to more than some ruined radials .
Hit the jump to view one of the saddest burnouts we 've ever seen .
For some reason , the man behind the wheel of this BMW thought it would be a good idea to lay rubber on a cement embankment .
The resulting video ought to be enough to make sure an insurance claim is n't approved .
We 're just happy nobody appeared to be hurt ; as this one could have ended even more badly .

We never bought into the idea that newspaper companies should own baseball teams , but we will say this :
The New York Times 's decision to buy 17.5 % of the entity that owns the Red Sox in 2002 was the best financial investment it has made in years .
The NYT has now officially put this stake on the block .
It might fetch $ 150 - $ 200 million or so ( less after tax ) .
This will not be enough cash to get NYTCo through 2009 , but it should buy it some additional breathing room .
Assuming the Red Sox sale goes through , NYTCo will have two additional assets it can sell : The Boston Globe and About.com .
At today 's prices , these might bring in $ 300 - $ 400 million .
This additional cash would allow the company to meet its cash needs until mid-2010 .
By then , however , if current business trends continue and the company has n't slashed costs , the news operations will be burning cash fast .
See our estimates of how much cash NYTCo needs over the next three years here .
Russell Adams , WSJ : Seeking to fortify its core assets , New York Times Co. is actively shopping its stake in the holding company of the Boston Red Sox baseball club , according to two people familiar with the discussions .
The Times Co. , which faces a cash shortage accelerated by steep industrywide revenue declines , has been rumored for months to be open to selling non-core assets .
Besides its flagship newspaper , the Times Co. owns the Boston Globe , About.com and a 17.5 % stake in New England Sports Ventures , which owns the Red Sox , their fabled ballpark Fenway Park and most of the cable network that airs their games .
The Times Co. pushed discussions beyond the exploration phase early last month at a quarterly meeting of NESV 's limited partners at which the Times Co. indicated to the partnership its intention to sell .
Since then Times Co. has been pursuing potential buyers , according to people familiar with the discussions .
A Times spokeswoman declined to comment .
It is unclear what the Times Co. thinks it can get for its stake .
Barclays Capital estimates the Times Co.'s investment is worth about $ 166 million ; analysts and sports bankers recently told Reuters the Times Co. could raise at least $ 200 million if it sold its stake ...
It 's possible that the Globe could be packaged with the sports assets in a sale ; Jack Connors , a former ad executive in Boston , and former General Electric CEO Jack Welch took a serious look at the Globe two years ago , when people close to them said they were valuing it at $ 550 -600 million at the time .
The Times rebuffed the inquiries .
The Globe was recently valued by Barclay 's at $ 20 million .

Margie Christoffersen did n’t make it very far into our conversation before she cracked .
Chest heaving , tears streaming , she reached for her husband Wayne ’s hand and then mine , squeezing as if she ’d never let go .
“ I ’ve almost had a nervous breakdown .
It ’s been the worst thing that ’s ever happened to me , ” she sobbed as curious patrons at a Farmers Market coffee shop looked on , wondering what calamity had visited this poor woman who ’s an honest 6 feet tall , with hair as blond as the sun .
Well , Christoffersen was a manager at El Coyote , the Beverly Boulevard landmark restaurant that ’s always had throngs of customers waiting to get inside .
Many of them were gay , and Christoffersen , a devout Mormon , donated $ 100 in support of Proposition 8 , the successful November ballot initiative that banned gay marriage .
She never advertised her politics or religion in the restaurant , but last month her donation showed up on lists of “ for ” and “ against ” donors .
And El Coyote became a target .
Advertisement
A boycott was organized on the Internet , with activists trashing El Coyote on restaurant review sites .
Then came throngs of protesters , some of them shouting “ shame on you ” at customers .
The police arrived in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob .
The mob left , but so did the customers .
Sections of the restaurant have been closed , a manager told me Friday during a very quiet lunch hour .
Some of the 89 employees , many of them gay , have had their hours cut , and layoffs are looming .
And Christoffersen , who has taken a voluntary leave of absence , is wondering whether she ’ll ever again be able to work at the restaurant , which opened in 1931 ( at 1st and La Brea ) and is owned by her 92 - year - old mother .
“ It ’s been so hard , ” she said , breaking down again .
Advertisement
A lot of customers saw Christoffersen as the face of the restaurant .
She was the hostess who roamed from table to table with a pitcher of water , refilling glasses and schmoozing with friends .
Christoffersen , raised Mormon by her late father , told me she has no problem with gay people .
“ I love them like everybody else . ”
But she supports her church ’s position that marriage is between a man and a woman .
Advertisement
I , on the other hand , opposed Prop .
8 . And as I wrote more than once , I think organized Christian religion reached new levels of hypocrisy in using the Bible to preach discrimination and promote the initiative .
As for the Mormons , I have trouble taking any cues on social mores from a group whose founder and early leaders believed they were acting on directives from on high when they took enough wives -- many in their teens -- to fill every booth in the cavernous El Coyote .
But I did n’t like what I was hearing about the vilification of Margie Christoffersen and others in California being targeted for the crime of voting their conscience .
“ I agree with you on this , ” said Fred Karger .
On his Californians Against Hate website , Karger has been outing Prop. 8 supporters , but he thinks Christoffersen ’s small personal donation did n’t warrant such a backlash against El Coyote .
Karger also spoke out against the resignation of a Sacramento theater director who gave $ 1,000 to Yes on 8 and happens to be Mormon .
Advertisement
The focus should be on the Mormon Church , Karger said , and on people and businesses that gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Yes on 8 .
Wayne Christoffersen , who is also a manager at El Coyote , is not a Mormon , and he said he does n’t care who marries whom .
But he does n’t think it ’s right that he and other employees at the restaurant are seeing their livelihoods threatened .
Should Apple be boycotted by Yes on 8 people , he asked , simply because the computer company donated $ 100,000 to the No on 8 campaign ?
El Coyote has never been known for gourmet cuisine .
But the warm , kitschy vibe and cool patio scene have always been a hit with customers willing to wait in long lines under the distinctive neon sign .
Now business is off about 30 % , Wayne said .
Margie wants to blame it on the economy , because she can’t deal with the alternative .
But Wayne insisted the low - priced restaurant is largely recession - proof , and it ’s the controversy that has stemmed the flow of margaritas .
Margie tried to smooth things over last month by inviting gay clients to a free lunch to talk it over , but she left in tears when asked if she would write a check to the group challenging Prop .
8 .

She blubbered all over again as she thought back on the last month .
She has been a nightly fixture at El Coyote for two decades , walking to work from her home just a few doors away .
It ’s been her life , she said .
And she ca n’t stand that it ’s been taken away .
On the other side , thousands of gay people can’t stand that their recent marriages could be taken away , and thousands more feel as though their civil rights have been violated .
So even if Margie returns to work at El Coyote , her husband said , “ she will never , ever be back here on a Thursday night . ”
Thursdays , as tradition had it , the place was mobbed with gay customers .
Advertisement
I had lunch at El Coyote on Thursday , and most of the tables were empty .
Margie was off in a dark corner of the restaurant -- at the table where Sharon Tate had her last meal -- exchanging Christmas presents with friends and her mother .
I sat on the patio with Wayne and two other El Coyote managers -- Arnoldo Archila and Bill Schoeppner -- who happen to be gay .
“ We always joked around with Margie , ” said Schoepp - ner , who ’s been on the job 26 years .
“ I ’m a Democrat and voted for Obama ; she probably voted for McCain -- so what ?
If she were a bigot or a homophobe , you would n’t have had all these gay people ” working at the restaurant or eating at it .
Advertisement
Besides , the donation was personal .
“ She did n’t cut a check from the restaurant , ” added Archila , a 28 - year employee .
“ The restaurant did n’t have anything to do with it . ”
Archila said he and other employees voted no on Prop. 8 and gave money to the legal challenge .
As someone who came to the U.S. 30 years ago from El Salvador , Archila said , he ’s always cherished this country ’s right of free speech and the diversity of opinion .
“ You can express yourself as a citizen , ” said Archila .
“ Not everyone has to believe the same things . ”

In the Gulf of Mexico 's densest jelly swarms , there are more jellyfish than there is water .
More than 100 jellies may jam each cubic meter of water .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
Large swarms of jellyfish and other gelatinous animals — sometimes covering hundreds of square miles of ocean — have recently been reported in many of the world 's prime vacation and fishing destinations .
In this interview with Lily Whiteman of the National Science Foundation , renowned " jellyologist " Monty Graham of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama discusses the origins and impacts of such swarms .
( Note : Jellyfish and other gelatinous animals are called " jellies " here . )
1 . What types of damage have jelly swarms caused ?
" Damage " can be seen as either economic or environmental .
Recent examples of jelly swarms that have created such problems include :
Tourism in Australia where deadly box jellies live and in the Mediterranean where stinging jellyfish closed down many beaches during the summer of 2008 .
Many important fisheries , including the Gulf of Mexico , where jellies regularly clog nets , fowl fishing gear or prey on eggs and larvae of fish .
Aquaculture operations are often affected .
One particular example was in 2007 when an extraordinarily large swarm of jellyfish virtually wiped out a salmon farm off northern Ireland .
Seafloor diamond operations off the coast of Namibia , where jellies have clogged vacuum pipes .
Nuclear power plants in many locations .
Recently , in November 2008 , a jelly swarm clogged intake pipes at the Diablo Canyon power plant in California , and thereby caused a temporary plant shut - down .
2 . How densely are jellies packed together in swarms ?
In most cases , a dense swarm would be a few animals in one cubic meter of water .
However , in extreme cases , there can be more jellies than water .
Such swarms may cover a hundred miles of more of coastline at a time .
3 . Are jelly swarms natural phenomena ?
Yes .
Jellies have likely swum and swarmed in our seas for over 600 million years .
When conditions are right , jelly swarms can form quickly .
They appear to do this for sexual reproduction .
Since males need to release gametes ( sperm ) into the water , they need to be very close to females .
Therefore swarming behavior is just a way for them to be close to each other .
4 . Are jelly populations increasing ?
In some locations , jelly populations are increasing .
But such increases are regional in nature ; we do not have evidence that there are " global " increases due to global influences , but evidence is mounting that climate change may have an effect .
5 . Are human - caused environmental problems promoting population explosions of jellies ?
Various types of environmental problems may promote the formation of jelly swarms .
These problems include pollution , the overharvesting of fish , the introduction of non-native jelly species into new habitats , the addition of artificial substrate ( like fishing reefs , and various offshore platforms ) in the ocean and climate change .
6 . How may climate change promote population explosions of jellies ?
Higher water temperatures may speed jelly reproduction as well as extend the growing season for jellies ; a longer reproduction season could result in more jellies .
Climate change may also increase the amount of food available for jellies .
Also , climate change may change ocean currents .
Changed currents may transport jellies — which drift with currents — into new habitats .
Because climate change appears to be a world - wide phenomenon , climate change may have worldwide impacts on jellies .
But we really do n’t know yet what the details regarding interactions between climate change and jelly populations .
7 . In light of the abundance of jellies , why do n’t we know more about them ?
Marine ecologists have traditionally regarded jellies as mere nuisances that interfered with studies of truly important creatures .
Because of such attitudes , ecologists have traditionally gone to great lengths to avoid jellies , rather than to study them .
In fact , in the past , when scientists accidentally caught jellies in their research nets , they often did horrific things to jellies — like pouring bleach over them in order to dissolve them away without destroying the hard critters that they really wanted to study .
Because jellies have traditionally been understudied , we do n’t have many accurate long - term records of their population sizes .
Therefore , in many places , we ca n’t yet say for sure whether or how much jelly population sizes may be changing .
8 . Are jellies finally getting the respect they deserve ?
Appreciation of the ecological importance of jellies has steadily grown since the 1980s , when jelly populations exploded in several ecosystems , including the Black Sea .
More scientists are now studying jellies in more locations than ever before .
9 . Why are jellies particularly difficult to study ?
Jellies are fragile and so they are often destroyed when we try to collect them in nets .
Also , jellies are difficult to preserve because their bodies are destroyed by many types of preservatives .
Plus , many types of jellies are too big or too small to be raised and studied in captivity .
10 .
Have you ever been badly stung by jellies while researching them ?
Yes , but not more than an uncomfortable sting .
I do have colleagues that have been hospitalized while studying jellies , though .
11 . In light of the fact that jellies are difficult to study and the ocean is so complex , how can scientists identify the individual impacts of each type of environmental disturbance on jelly populations ?
By developing computer models of marine ecosystems .
One of my main activities now is to help build such models , and then manipulate various factors in these models — such as water temperature or salinity and the size of fish harvests — in order to identify their relative influences on jelly populations .
12 . If some places have too many jellies , why do n’t people just eat them ?
Some jellies are eaten by humans and have long been considered a delicacy in some Asian countries .
In addition , processed jellies are sold in some Asian food stores in the U.S .
13 .
As long - lived , hardy and often abundant creatures , are jellies " the cockroaches of the sea ? "
Absolutely not !
Jellies are much better than cockroaches !
Jellies represent among the oldest living animals on Earth and if the past is prologue , these highly successful creatures will continue to thrive even under the changing conditions of today 's oceans .
I have said before that most likely cockroaches will be long gone when the last jelly swims in a lonely sea .

There 's a new name being bandied about to join the cast of Doctor Who ... and it's a little more believable : Michelle Ryan .

Ryan may be best known to Americans as the lead in the failed Bionic Woman reboot from 2007 , but prior to that , she had appeared in British drama Jekyll — written and exec - produced by new Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat .
According to British tabloid , the Sunday Mirror , an anonymous source involved in Who production said ,
Michelle 's been in secret talks with BBC bosses .
They are likely to announce her as Doctor Who 's new assistant very soon .
She is perfect for the role .
She is goodlooking and the right age to star alongside Matt .
Everyone agrees they look great together and reckon fans will think they 're the perfect team too .

If true , the decision would make sense — through Bionic Woman and current BBC series Merlin , Ryan has become comfortable with genre television fans , and a high - profile role on Who may give her career a boost in the same way that it did Billie Piper's .

Here at Hecklerspray , we have often been described as negative and cynical .
Now , that just hurts us .
So to prove we actually can be positive about things , we have decided to dedicate a list to one TV show we truly love , South Park .
And , in particular , its greatest creation , Eric Cartman .
In fact , we love South Park so much , we treasure it above KFC , Xbox and our own mothers .?
Really !
More than KFC .
It ’s that good .
And , of course , one of the main reasons for this love is Eric Cartman .
We think he is one of the greatest ever TV characters of all time .
But do n’t take our word for it , just check out his finest moments .
As always , if you think we have missed something , please let us know .
There are so many funny Cartman clips , keeping it down to just 24 was almost impossible .
Plus , we wanted to spread the clips around rather than just feature entire episodes .
Anyway , enjoy !

23 . Casa Bonita

ADVERT
Following a ruling last month by a Florida judge Cindy Lederman that the state ’s ban on gay and lesbian adoptions is unconstitutional , a new poll shows the majority of voters side with the judge .
55 % of those surveyed in a new Quinnipiac poll support a repeal of the law .
It ’s expected that the state will appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to overturn Lederman ’s decision .
UK Gay News reports :
“ Florida is currently the only American state that expressly bans all gays and lesbians from adopting .
The state does allow them to foster parent .
A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,370 Floridians found 39 % in favour of the ban .
The poll sample was split on gay marriage .
31 % opposed any legal recognition , 27 % backed gay marriage and 35 % approved of civil unions .
A national survey commissioned by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation of 2,008 US adults in November found 69 % oppose laws that would ban qualified gay and lesbian couples from adopting children . ”
The Prototype framework has been one of my most productive investments since I adopted it over a year ago .
Not only have I resorted to using the framework itself , but also learned and extrapolated from its internals .
Back then I evaluated both jQuery and Prototype but the latter seemed more stable and “ serious ” while jQuery seemed like the hobbyist alternative trying to do too much .
A week back , I revisited jQuery and chose to drop Prototype like a hot potato , making the switch to jQuery for all future projects .
jQuery ’s expressiveness makes it a delight to use and it really understands and addresses the common usage patterns –which in Prototype require a lot more plumbing .
CSS Selectors and Command - Chaining
j Query has the friendliest API and syntax hands - down , designed entirely around the user .
The most useful are the jQuery Selectors with support for CSS level - 3 selectors , hybridized with some XPath expressions and jQuery custom filters :
$ ( 'table.orders tr:odd checkbox [ name=purchase ] ' ) .css ( ' border ' , ' 1 px solid black ' ) .
attr ( ' checked ' , ' checked ' ) ;
The single line above says it all .
The selector in the first set of parenthesis uses part CSS selectors to find a table element with class ‘ orders ’ , part jQuery filters to filter only the odd rows , and part XPath expression to narrow down the selection to check boxes with the “ name ” attribute set to “ purchase ” .
Using command chaining , the selected nodes are easily updated using the css ( ) function to add a black border , followed by attr ( ) to add an HTML attribute checked =” checked ” .
A quick glance at the jQuery Selectors reveals the large vocabulary waiting to be exploited .
DOM Traversal and Manipulation
Walking the DOM has always been a the source of confusion because it quickly gets complicated for example when you want build a menu tree which requires expanding a menu item while simultaneously collapsing other menu items at the same level as well as their children .
j Query makes it easy to traverse siblings ( ) , children ( ) , descendants ( ) , parents ( ) or the closest ( ) nodes while also offering the not ( ) function to specify an exclude criteria .
All expressions accept the selectors applauded earlier .
For example if you want to clone ( ) the parent ( ) of a node and append ( ) html ( ) inside it you would write just that :
mynode.parent().clone ( ) .append ( ) .html ( ' hello ' ) ;
Event Handling
The Event handling features are standard - issue like the other frameworks but have some other practical offerings like the hover ( ) handler ( how many times have you used the onmouseover and onmouseout pattern ? ) , the one ( ) handler which registers an event handle for one time use , and even a live ( ) event handler which works for nodes added well after the event has already been registered .
These features address common developer usage patterns .
There have been dozens of occasions where I have registered a one - time event handler by removing the event handler inside the callback , or re/registering an event on newly added element .
j Query pins these scenarios without going overboard with API functionality .
The Rest
With Prototype a lot more plumbing had to be done by hand , and sometimes cutting and pasting snippets from prototype evangelists sharing their own solutions to the common scenarios .
j Query ’s documentation is also a pleasure to peruse if you want to find or explore new features .
The visual documentation is indispensable for those just starting off with jQuery .
Simon Willison ’s overview of jQuery is highly a recommended read before you dive into jQuery .
It is also the source for my own learning and consequently for this blog .
After spending less than 3 hours reading blog posts and perusing the documentation I was able to do a lot more in a lot less time then ever before .
The huge community and neatly organized jQuery plugins make me feel like a sucker for not having jQuery for my Scrabble pet-project .
jQuery is quickly gaining adoption while Prototype tries to stay light on features despite having a footprint that is n’t .
I am such a sellout .
Update , Jan 17 : The latest performance benchmarks came in around pretty much the same time I made this post .
Prototype has embarassingly poor performance , in some cases nearly 4 x worse than jQuery .

The Knight 's Tour is a mathematical problem involving a knight on a chessboard .
The knight is placed on the empty board and , moving according to the rules of chess , must visit each square exactly once .
Here are some Haskell implementations .
First Solution
-- --
Quick implementation by dmwit on #haskell -- Faster , shorter , uses less memory than the Python version .
-- import Control .
Arrow import Control .
Monad import Data .
List import Data .
Maybe import Data .
Ord import System .
Environment import qualified Data .

Using Continuations
An efficient version ( some 10 x faster than the example Python solution ) using continuations .
This is about as direct a translation of the Python algorithm as you 'll get without sticking the whole thing in IO .
The Python version prints the board and exits immediately upon finding it , so it can roll back changes if that does n't happen .
Instead , this version sets up an exit continuation using callCC and calls that to immediately return the first solution found .
The Logic version below takes around 50 % more time .

Oleg Kiselyov's Solution
Oleg provided a solution on haskell - cafe :
It seems the following pure functional ( except for the final printout ) version of the search has almost the same performance as the Dan Doel 's latest version with the unboxed arrays and callCC .
For the board of size 40 , Dan Doel 's version takes 0.047s on my computer ; the version below takes 0.048s .
For smaller boards , the difference is imperceptible .
Interestingly , the file sizes of the compiled executables ( ghc - O2 , ghc 6.8.2 ) are similar too : 606093 bytes for Dan Doel 's version , and 605938 bytes for the version below .
The version below is essentially Dan Doel 's earlier version .
Since the problem involves only pure search ( rather than committed choice ) , I took the liberty of substituting FBackTrack ( efficient MonadPlus ) for LogicT .
FBackTrack can too be made the instance of LogicT ; there has not been any demand for that though .

Vala has only been around since S9 properly , and only as a team member since S10 .
Her story arc was directly linked in to the Ori , similar to Teal'c with the Goa'uld , but Vala has n't spent 8 years working with the SGC to warrant her sticking around .
The fact Vala decided to help Ba'al 's host at the end of Continuum suggested to me that she thinks she 's found something she can devote herself to .
Afterall , with the fight against the Ori over , is there much incentive for her to be part of an Earth military unit exploring the galaxy ?
She 's SEEN the galaxy .
I remember when Alberto Gonzales ' confirmation hearings were underway , conservatives like Rush Limbaugh took to the airwaves to decry the racism of those liberals who dared oppose him .
Now the shoe 's on the other foot .
Even though most of Barack Obama 's nominations have sailed through confirmation hearings and votes with alacrity , there 's one notable exception -- Hilda Solis , Obama 's pick as Labor Secretary :
The confirmation of Rep. Hilda Solis , D - El Monte , as President Barack Obama 's Labor secretary has been delayed because of Republican objections .
Democrats have announced that a Republican senator is using a parliamentary procedure to delay Solis ' confirmation , the Washington paper Congress Daily reported Friday .
But while it does seem peculiar that conservatives would block the nomination of one of Obama 's few Latino candidates , no one is suggesting that racism is the motive here .
Actually , there 's a very simple answer to the above question : The Employee Free Choice Act .
As the Star - News report notes :
The anonymous hold - as the tactic is known - was placed because of Solis ' support for " card check " legislation aimed at facilitating union organization and another bill regarding pay - discrimination , and for non-responsive answers during her confirmation hearing , according to GOP aides , the paper reported .
During her nomination hearing before the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , Solis deferred questions on the controversial card check bill to Obama , to the frustration of GOP committee members , who strongly oppose the legislation .
Mario Solis - Marich at Nuestra Voice observes :
The Department of Labor has long been a strange relic to economic conservatives .
Where DC visitors to the DOL see an office building the GOP sees a wicked temple inhabited by evil wizards that actually count the unemployed and study statistics that often contradict core conservative economic superstitions .
The questions to Solis were reminiscent of a witch dunking where there are no right answers .
If Solis had drowned she would have been human and acceptable but her survival , due to her accurate and honest answers , indicated her pre-supposed guilt .
I reviewed the Solis hearing that seems to have befuddle the GOP inquisitors and found the Secretary Designate to be very even handed .
Solis admitted that she sponsored the Employee Free Choice Act ( apparently a type of anti-GOP spell ) and that President Obama has endorsed it .
However Solis also repeatedly indicated that she was not clear what her role would be in the coming debate surrounding the Act due to her potential new position and her inability to yet speak for the Administration .
Solis gave the same nuanced answers to Senate Democrats that wanted assurances about a host of progressive labor agenda items that she gave to the GOP .
The Secretary Designate was trying to express and open mindedness to a middle ground while respectfully deferring to the new President ( who by the way was still President elect at the time of the hearing ) .
Republicans are sending a clear signal with this delay that they intend to fight the Free Choice Act with every fiber of their beings .
Democrats has better be ready .
Fortunately , Hilda Solis already will be .
Democratic candidates are having a field day with the past eight years all over America , putting double digit leads together in swing states in what 's shaping up as the beginning of a vast Democratic majority .
Things are going to be a little tighter in comedian Al Franken 's race against longtime Minnesota conversative Norm Coleman .
Though Coleman held a lead in the early - going , Franken has closed fast .
Still , is there a chance Franken could walk away empty - handed on his big day ?
After the lead Coleman started with , it 's heartening for Democrats to see that Franken has closed the gap in some polls .
Since polling is a dangerous art best practiced by Nate Silver , you can judge for yourself here :
Complicating the race is independent candidate and former Jesse Ventura protege Dean Barkley , who is polling as high as 19 percent , and whose reform agenda may be hurting Franken more than Coleman .
Franken knows it 's going to be a battle , recently using Hillary Clinton in a television ad , but it might be time to break out the big guns : reprising his Stuart Smalley persona in the campaign commercial to rule them all .
For a debate nerd like me , there was no greater joy than hearing this race would feature five debates , and that may end up hurting Franken in the waning days of the campaign .
While he 's a brilliant guy , he 's still not the most polished pol , and it shows .

On top of today ’s exceptional news about Firefox surpassing 20 % worldwide market share during the month of November , we have further good news to share .
After Firefox reached the 50 % market share milestone in Indonesia back in July , we can now say the same about two more regions : Slovenia and Macedonia .
Below you ’ll find the November 2008 numbers according to Net Applications .
What ’s the key takeaway here ?
Our market share in the regions above has been growing like crazy .
For example , since our July announcement about Indonesia , we ’ve seen Firefox ’s share in Indonesia pick up another 7 % , Slovenia 4 % , Slovakia 5 % , and the Philippines an astounding 13 % !
A tremendous amount of credit here goes to the Mozilla community .
John Lilly summed it up best : “ The open web is more vibrant than ever , and the thousands of Mozilla contributors around the world have played a major role in making it that way . ”
KAORU Tomiishi sobbed as the body of her six - year - old son Koki was lowered into a small plot near the family home in Fukuoka .
She told mourners she wanted to find and kill the murderer .
Three days earlier , on September 18 , the 35 - year - old housewife from Japan 's southern island had led a frantic search for the boy after telling police he had wandered off in a local park .
Searchers found his body stuffed into a small gap in the wall of the park toilet .
He had been strangled , most likely with the strap of a mobile phone .
In a depressingly familiar turn of events , investigators announced soon after the funeral that Kaoru had confessed to the " impulse " killing .
" I felt there was no hope for the future , " said the mother of one , who had reportedly become overwhelmed by her parental responsibility .
" I thought about killing my son and also myself . "
Experts say the case is emblematic of a broader crisis .
Recent statistics record more than 100 cases of maternal filicide  mothers murdering their children  since the end of 2005 , including six in September this year .
Although the proportion of Japanese aged 14 and younger has been steadily shrinking in the past decade , the number of filicides has stayed roughly constant .
For web designers , there are four keys to surviving bad economic times : do good work , charge a fair price , lower your overhead , and be sure you are communicating with your client .
As a reader of 24 ways , you already do good work , so let ’s focus on the rest .
I know something about surviving bad times , having started my agency , Happy Cog , at the dawn of the dot - com bust .
Of course , the recession we ’re in now may end up making the dot - com bust look like the years of bling and gravy .
But the bust was rough enough at the time .
Bad times are hard on overweight companies and over - leveraged start - ups , but can be kind to freelancers and small agencies .
Clients who once had money to burn and big agencies to help them burn it suddenly consider the quality of work more important than the marquee value of the business card .
Fancy offices and ten people at every meeting are out .
A close relationship with an individual or small team that listens is in .
Thin is in
If you were good in client meetings when you were an employee , print business cards and pick a name for your new agency .
Once some cash rolls in , see an accountant .
If the one - person entrepreneur model is n’t you , it ’s no problem .
Form a virtual agency with colleagues who complement your creative , technical , and business skills .
Athletics is a Brooklyn - based multi-disciplinary “ art and design collective . ”
Talk about low overhead : they do n’t have a president , a payroll , or a pension plan .
But that has n’t stopped clients like adidas , Nike , MTV , HBO , Disney , DKNY , and Sundance Channel from knocking on their ( virtual ) doors .
Running a traditional business is like securing a political position in Chicago : it costs a fortune .
That ’s why bad times crush so many companies .
But you are a creature of the internets .
You do n’t need an office to do great work .
I ran Happy Cog out of my apartment for far longer than anyone realized .
My clients , when they learned my secret , did n’t care .
Keep it lean : if you can budget your incoming freelance money , you do n’t have to pay yourself a traditional salary .
Removing the overhead associated with payroll means more of the budget stays in your pocket , enabling you to price your projects competitively , while still within industry norms .
( Underpricing is uncool , and clients who knowingly choose below - market - rate vendors tend not to treat those vendors with respect . )
Getting gigs
Web design is a people business .
If things are slow , email former clients .
If you just lost your job , email former agency clients with whom you worked closely to inform them of your freelance business and find out how they ’re doing .
Best practice : focus the email on wishing them a happy holiday and asking how they ’re doing .
Let your email signature file tell them you ’re now the president of Your Name Design .
Leading with the fact that you just lost your job may earn sympathy ( or commiseration : the client may have lost her job , too ) but it ’s not exactly a sure - fire project getter .
The qualities that help you land a web design project are the same in good times or bad .
Have a story to tell about the kind of services you offer , and the business benefits they provide .
( If you design with web standards , you already have one great story line .
What are the others ? )
Do n’t be shy about sharing your story , but do n’t make it the focus of the meeting .
The client is the focus .
Before you meet her , learn as much as you can about her users , her business , and her competitors .
At the very least , read her site ’s About pages , and spend some quality time with Google .
Most importantly , go to the meeting knowing how much you do n’t know .
Arrive curious , and armed with questions .
Maintain eye contact and keep your ears open .
If a point you raise causes two people to nod at each other , follow up on that point , do n’t just keep grinding through your Keynote presentation .
If you pay attention and think on your feet , it tells the potential client that they can expect you to listen and be flexible .
( Clients are like unhappy spouses : they ’re dying for someone to finally listen . )
If you stick to a prepared presentation , it might send the message that you are inflexible or nervous or both .
“ Nervous ” is an especially bad signal to send .
It indicates that you are either dishonest or inexperienced .
Neither quality invites a client to sign on .
Web design is a people business for the client , too : they should feel that their interactions with you will be pleasant and illuminating .
And that you ’ll listen .
Did I mention that ?
Give it time
Securing clients takes longer and requires more effort in a recession .
If two emails used to land you a gig , it will now take four , plus an in - person meeting , plus a couple of follow - up calls .
This level of salesmanship is painful to geeks and designers , who would rather spend four hours kerning type or debugging a style sheet than five minutes talking business on the telephone .
I know .
I ’m the same way .
But we must overcome our natural shyness and inwardness if we intend not to fish our next meal out of a neighbor ’s garbage can .
As a bonus , once the recession ends , your hard - won account management skills will help you take your business to the next level .
By the time jobs are plentiful again , you may not want to work for anyone but yourself .
You ’ll be a captain of our industry .
And talented people will be emailing to ask you for a job .
Personal finance is about more than just spending less than you earn and staying out of debt .
You need a balance of insurance to protect your assets , investments to prepare for retirement , and a plan to take care of your loved ones when you pass away .
What follows are 10 personal finance essentials that everyone needs as part of his financial plan .
1. Make a Will or Estate Plan
What happens when you die ?
Who will take care of your children , pets , bills , property , etc . ?
Unless you have an estate plan , there will be a lot of guesswork and frustration on the part of your survivors .
You should decide how your assets are distributed after you die , not the state .
Creating a will makes life easier for your survivors .
You can create an estate plan with the assistance of an attorney , or with an online legal document preparation service such as Legal Zoom .
2. Obtain Sufficient Insurance
Insurance is there to protect you in case you ca n’t afford to pay for certain expenses as they arise .
Generally you get insurance for items that are expensive .
You will need many types of insurance .
Here are a few of the essentials :
Make sure you buy enough life insurance and other kinds of insurance .
3. Set up a High Yield Savings Account
One of the most important financial accounts you can have is a high yield savings account .
With it you can manage your money while it grows through the power of compound interest .
I link my high yield savings account to my checking account and have my paycheck direct deposited for easy access .
I recommend Ally Bank or FNBO Direct , which both offer free high interest savings accounts with easy access and high reliability .
4. Track Your Money
Everyone should have a very good idea of where his money is going .
You can subscribe to a rigid zero based budget , or you can be a little more fluid with your money .
But you still need to know where it goes .
There are many great tools available to help you out – including free online tools from Mint.com and Personal Capital , and tools you pay for , including You Need A Budget and the full desktop version of Quicken .
I used to be a Quicken user , but have since migrated to a different solution .
5. Build an Emergency Fund
Life comes at you fast .
Instead of living paycheck to paycheck , put some money away every month for unexpected expenses .
When you create an emergency fund you are giving yourself insurance against emergencies which could cause you to go into debt .
Your rainy day fund can help you avoid many expensive problems , which are often compounded by causing you to get into , or further into , debt .
6. Get Out of Debt
The powers of compound interest are amazing .
When you understand how truly powerful compound interest can be , you will realize just how important it is to have compound interest working for you instead of against you .
Debt is a killer .
Pay it off and start investing your money so you can rest easy in retirement .
There are many ways to get out of debt , including the debt snowball and the debt avalanche .
I recommend finding what works best for you , and sticking to it .
The faster you get out of debt , the faster you will be able to get your money working for you , instead of having it work for someone else .

7. Improve Your Credit Score
Your credit score is very valuable .
Your credit score affects your ability to get a loan , the interest rate you receive , your ability to get a cell phone contract , and possibly even your ability to get a job or security clearance .
Here are tips on how to understand your credit score and how to improve your credit score .
I recommend starting the process by getting up to date on all your loan payments .
Late payments have a massive negative impact on your credit score .
The next thing to do is work on your credit utilization , which is the amount of available credit you are using .
For example if you have a credit card with a $ 10,000 balance and you have a $ 1,000 balance , you are using 10 % of your available credit on that card .
Your credit utilization applies across all your credit accounts , and the lower , the better .
8. Start Investing for Retirement
I have no desire to work because I have to when I am 70 .
If I work when I am 70 , I want to do it because it energizes me , not because I need the money to pay rent or put food on the table .
Investing money in my 401 k plan , Roth IRA , and solo 401 k plan is part of my long term financial goal to avoid having to work into old age .
Remember , the more you invest now , the easier it will be later .
9. Increase Your Income
Your ability to create income is your greatest asset .
It ’s not your house , or car , or bank account .
Your greatest asset is you and your ability to generate more income and you need to nurture it and grow it .
In the long run , increasing your income is better than saving money .
There is only so much that you can cut back on before you ca n’t cut any more .
One of my long term plans is growing my alternative income streams .
10 . Negotiate to Save Money
There is an old saying , “ only fools pay sticker price . ”
While that may not always be the case ( try negotiating at Wal - Mart ! ) , there is some truth to that statement .
You would n’t go into a car dealership and offer to pay full sticker price on a car , especially in this economy .
Instead , you would negotiate a better deal .
Other examples where it may be worthwhile to negotiate include your cable bill or your property taxes .
Master these personal finance essentials .
If you have these essential personal finance topics covered then you can rest easy at night knowing that your financial house is in order and you are well on your way to financial success .
Tomorrow my illustration for Time Magazine ’s “ Person of The Year ” hits the newsstands .
While I ’m very honored to be validated by a periodical that is nothing short of an American institution , the moment is bittersweet because I ’m very disappointed by Obama ’s appointment of Rick Warren to deliver his invocation during Obama ’s inaugural address .
Rick Warren is against gay marriage and reproductive rights , and he does not believe in evolution ( maybe he offers himself as proof of lack of evolution ) .
I understand that Obama is trying to appeal to conservatives and evangelicals , but this move is symbolically a slap in the face to many people .
Warren is not a uniter , but a divider … he is intolerant in many of his views .
I still think Obama is the best choice for president , but I ca n’t condone Warren ’s involvement in Obama ’s inauguration , no matter how insignificant it is .
While I ’m on the subject of gay marriage , I will be donating a chunk of the proceeds from an inauguration poster of Obama I was asked to create to the movement to overturn Prop 8 .
At first I was considering pulling my inauguration poster , but I think re-directing funds from it to put into a cause I care about is actually more constructive .
Plus , I would n’t want withdrawing the image to come across as a blanket boycott of Obama .
I ’m sure I will ultimately disagree with Obama about many things , but I think I will agree with him on more .
I think it is important to speak one ’s mind , but also to not let the narcissism of petty differences sabotage our unity and progress .

Few topics have roiled the normally staid field of patent law more than the expansion of patents into the software industry .
As we 've documented in some depth here at Ars , the last decade has seen the Patent Office grant an unprecedented number of software patents , which has resulted in a dramatic increase in software - related patent litigation .
Earlier this month , the Brookings Institution hosted a conference on abstract patents .
Judging from the speakers at that conference , there 's a big cultural gap between technologists and the patent lawyers over the issue of software patents .
The lawyers recognized that the patent system is n't working well for the software industry , of course , but most favored incremental changes to patent doctrines rather than a fundamental reconsideration of the concept of allowing patents on software .
Perusing the comments sections of Ars Technica or Slashdot suggests that many of the people on the business end of software patents wish the patent bar would simply leave the software industry alone .
Given the case law that now governs software patent disputes , it may surprise both groups to learn that the Supreme Court actually declined to extend patent protection to software algorithms , preferring to leave the matter to congress .
In this feature , we 'll take a close look at the Supreme Court 's classic trio of software patent decisions .
We 'll explore what the Supreme Court originally said about the patentability of software , how the court distinguished between software and non -software patents , and what the consequences would be if lower courts more aggressively applied the limits on software patents that the Supreme Court articulated a generation ago .
Prologue : " Residual overhang of physicality "
One of the most basic disagreements in the software patent debate is over how to interpret the Supreme Court 's rulings on the patentability of software .
Software patent critics have long argued that the high court 's precedents rule out software patents .
Brookings Institution scholar Ben Klemens made that argument in a 2005 book ( we covered Klemens ' anti-software - patent organization last year ) , and his arguments were echoed by the Software Freedom Law Center 's Eben Moglen in an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court in 2006 .
Software patent supporters have a very different perspective .
For example , in a recent episode of the Intellectual Property Colloquium podcast , host Doug Lichtman talked with two leading patent scholars about the implications of last year 's In Re Bilski decision , which placed new limits on patenting abstract concepts .
Lichtman 's guests , law professors John Duffy and Robert Merges , seemed to regard past Supreme Court limitations on software patents as confused and anachronistic .
They lamented the " pointless metaphysical investigation " that the Supreme Court 's precedents require of those seeking software patents .
We are , they said , " stuck with this artifactual , residual overhang of physicality " that is " just the price we have to pay to get a software patent these days . "
Interpreting legal decisions is never an exact science , so it 's possible to find passages in the Supreme Court 's decisions that support either side of the software patent debate .
But an essential theme of all three decisions that we 'll look at is that mathematical algorithms are outside of the scope of what may be patented , and that it 's up to Congress , not the courts , to change that .
Indeed , we think it may actually be an advantage that the Supreme Court decided these cases so many years ago .
The fundamental principle that software is mathematics has not changed over the last 35 years , but the growing complexity of software systems may obscure that fact , especially for judges with minimal technical experience .
As the problems with software patents become more obvious , judges and bureaucrats alike would do well to dust off their copies of the Supreme Court 's classic software patent decisions .
We think they 'll find that the Supreme Court 's decisions are more relevant — and more restrictive of software patents — than they might have thought .
BILLIONS of dollars of superannuation savings could be unlocked for " nation building " as the Federal Government searches for ways to insulate the economy against the global meltdown .
The Infrastructure Minister , Anthony Albanese , held closed - door talks with super fund chiefs this week in an effort to persuade them to invest some of their trillion - dollar assets in fast - tracked projects that will yield commercial returns .
Mr Albanese confirmed to the Herald that Canberra would be prepared to bankroll more infrastructure if economic conditions worsened and private investors took flight .
The news came as investors lost faith in Australia 's largest mining companies .
Rio Tinto 's admission it would consider delaying some developments due to weak market conditions prompted a global sell - off in mining shares .
Rio's shares fell 16 per cent yesterday , while those of its hostile suitor , BHP Billiton , fell 13 per cent .

It did n't take long for Android 's built - in WebKit browser ( that performed well in our recent mobile browser Battlemodo ) to see a little competion in the form of Opera Mini 4.2 — the ubiquitous and lightweight software that 's installable in some form on just about every mobile platform that can run Java apps .
A beta version was released for Android today , and we put it through a quick test .

Opera Mini is notable for its practice of first loading your requested page on its own servers , which compress the pages and images before squirting it out to your phone over the network for quicker load times .
And speed is definitely its forté on the G1 — on T - Mobile 's 3G network in NYC , pages like the New York Times , ESPN and Gizmodo all loaded with only a second or two of " Processing " delay .
Granted , what you see are horizontal lines instead of text and a few shaded boxes instead of images , but zooming in does n't cause any additional loading delay , except for some images .
Zooming is pretty easy with a double tap or trackball click , and it works just like it does in other version of the browser .
Hitting the G1's " back " button zooms you back out , which is unintuitive at first but ends up making sense .
Javascript sites that have lots of dynamically loading bits , even those optimized for smartphone browsers like Google Reader or Gmail , will often revert back to their more dumbed down static HTML versions .
It 's hard to find a page that loads completely bork - tastically though , as all of the pages we used in the Battlemodo loaded without any problems .
No Flash , obviously , but YouTube 's non-mobile front page still loads as you would expect .

As far as betas go , it 's not terrible , but text entry fields have a strange bug which results in them taking up the entire screen ( as you can see in the gallery ) , and the only way to go back is to press the " Menu " button and close out the form .
So while you probably would n't want to switch to Opera for all of your browsing — it's a great backup to have for a quick load of a newspaper site or anything else fairly simple , especially if your connection is n't great .

GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) --
An Israeli artillery strike Thursday killed the third most senior Hamas leader in Gaza , Hamas television announced .
Firefighters try to douse a fire Thursday at the United Nations ' main relief agency in Gaza City .
Saeed Siam was killed " in the latest shelling on a house " in Gaza City 's Sheikh Radwan neighborhood , said Al - Aqsa TV , which showed images of a body it identified as Siam .
Siam served as interior minister in the Hamas - led government before it was dissolved in 2007 .
He ranked behind only former Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and former Foreign Minister Mahmoud al - Zahar in Hamas ' Gaza hierarchy .
The Israeli military confirmed it targeted a house where Siam was believed to be present .
Watch what little is left of Siam 's house »
Hamas vowed to avenge Siam 's death .
" His blood will be the fuel for the coming victory , " according to a statement on Al - Aqsa TV .
Meanwhile , Israel ground forces -- backed by massive air power and heavy shelling -- pushed deep into Gaza City on Thursday .
Heavy battles with Hamas militants damaged the United Nations ' main relief compound , a foreign media building and a Red Cross hospital .
Watch as civilians suffer most »
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon is in the region as part of the diplomatic effort to secure a truce .
He met with Israeli officials on Thursday , and condemned the attack on the U.N. Relief and Works Agency 's compound in Gaza City that destroyed relief supplies and wounded three people .
Watch as fire blazes at U.N. compound »
Speaking at a news conference in Tel Aviv with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , Ban said Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the shelling of the compound " was a grave mistake and he took it very seriously . "
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said that Barak actually told the U.N. chief that " if it was Israel 's fire , it was a grave mistake . "
Watch Regev respond to accusation »
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident , but maintained that Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the compound .
UNRWA Director John
Ging denied there were any militants at the compound , and also said that at the time there was no fighting in the area .
Ging said UNRWA 's headquarters -- located in a densely populated neighborhood -- was hit repeatedly by shrapnel and artillery , including white phosphorus shells -- the use of which is restricted under international law .
" It looks like phosphorus , it smells like phosphorus and it's burning like phosphorus , " Ging said .
" That 's why I 'm calling it phosphorus . "
Some 700 Palestinians were taking shelter in the compound at the time .

Ging said that Olmert apologized to Ban over the incident .
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the allegation of the use of white phosphorous , but Israeli spokesman Regev said Hamas recently fired phosphorus shells at Israelis .
In addition , the Foreign Press Association said international news agency offices in Gaza City were hit by Israeli fire Thursday and demanded Israel stop shooting at the building that houses them .
Palestinian security sources said two employees for Abu Dhabi television were wounded in the incident .
As it stepped up its military campaign , Israel on Thursday also dispatched senior Defense Ministry official Amos Gilad to Cairo to discuss a cease - fire proposal .
A Hamas delegation is also in the Egyptian capital , talking with leaders there who are trying to hammer out a temporary truce .
Israel said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel , according to the Israeli military .
More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed , including many civilians , Palestinian medics said .
CNN 's Kevin Flower and Michal Zippori in Jerusalem contributed to this report .

Martian Methane Reveals the Red Planet is not a Dead Planet
Bill Steigerwald
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
Mars today is a world of cold and lonely deserts , apparently without life of any kind , at least on the surface .
Worse still , it looks like Mars has been cold and dry for billions of years , with an atmosphere so thin , any liquid water on the surface quickly boils away while the sun 's ultraviolet radiation scorches the ground .
But there is evidence of a warmer and wetter past -- features resembling dry riverbeds and minerals that form in the presence of water indicate water once flowed through Martian sands .
Since liquid water is required for all known forms of life , scientists wonder if life could have risen on Mars , and if it did , what became of it as the Martian climate changed .
New research reveals there is hope for Mars yet .
The first definitive detection of methane in the atmosphere of Mars indicates the planet is still alive , in either a biologic or geologic sense , according to a team of NASA and university scientists .
" Methane is quickly destroyed in the Martian atmosphere in a variety of ways , so our discovery of substantial plumes of methane in the northern hemisphere of Mars in 2003 indicates some ongoing process is releasing the gas , " said Dr. Michael Mumma of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " At northern mid-summer , methane is released at a rate comparable to that of the massive hydrocarbon seep at Coal Oil Point in Santa Barbara , Calif .
" Methane -- four atoms of hydrogen bound to a carbon atom -- is the main component of natural gas on Earth .
It 's of interest to astrobiologists because organisms release much of Earth 's methane as they digest nutrients .
However , other purely geological processes , like oxidation of iron , also release methane .
" Right now , we do n’t have enough information to tell if biology or geology -- or both -- is producing the methane on Mars , " said Mumma .
" But it does tell us that the planet is still alive , at least in a geologic sense .
It 's as if Mars is challenging us , saying , hey , find out what this means . "
Mumma is lead author of a paper on this research appearing in Science Express Jan. 15 .
If microscopic Martian life is producing the methane , it likely resides far below the surface , where it 's still warm enough for liquid water to exist .
Liquid water , as well as energy sources and a supply of carbon , are necessary for all known forms of life .
" On Earth , microorganisms thrive 2 to 3 kilometers ( about 1.2 to 1.9 miles ) beneath the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa , where natural radioactivity splits water molecules into molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) and oxygen .
The organisms use the hydrogen for energy .
It might be possible for similar organisms to survive for billions of years below the permafrost layer on Mars , where water is liquid , radiation supplies energy , and carbon dioxide provides carbon , " said Mumma .
" Gases , like methane , accumulated in such underground zones might be released into the atmosphere if pores or fissures open during the warm seasons , connecting the deep zones to the atmosphere at crater walls or canyons , " said Mumma .
" Microbes that produced methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide were one of the earliest forms of life on Earth , " noted Dr. Carl Pilcher , Director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute which partially supported the research .
" If life ever existed on Mars , it 's reasonable to think that its metabolism might have involved making methane from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide .
" However , it is possible a geologic process produced the Martian methane , either now or eons ago .
On Earth , the conversion of iron oxide ( rust ) into the serpentine group of minerals creates methane , and on Mars this process could proceed using water , carbon dioxide , and the planet 's internal heat .
Although we do n’t have evidence on Mars of active volcanoes today , ancient methane trapped in ice " cages " called clathrates might now be released .
The team found methane in the atmosphere of Mars by carefully observing the planet over several Mars years ( and all Martian seasons ) with NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility , run by the University of Hawaii , and the W. M. Keck telescope , both at Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
The team used spectrometer instruments attached to the telescopes to make the detection .
Spectrometers spread light into its component colors , like a prism separates white light into a rainbow .
The team looked for dark areas in specific places along the rainbow ( light spectrum ) where methane was absorbing sunlight reflected from the Martian surface .
They found three such areas , called absorption lines , which together are a definitive signature of methane , according to the team .
They were able to distinguish lines from Martian methane from the methane in Earth 's atmosphere because the motion of the Red Planet shifted the position of the Martian lines , much as a speeding ambulance causes its siren to change pitch as it passes by .
" We observed and mapped multiple plumes of methane on Mars , one of which released about 19,000 metric tons of methane , " said Dr. Geronimo Villanueva of the Catholic University of America , Washington , D.C. Villanueva is stationed at NASA Goddard and is co-author of the paper .
" The plumes were emitted during the warmer seasons -- spring and summer -- perhaps because the permafrost blocking cracks and fissures vaporized , allowing methane to seep into the Martian air .
Curiously , some plumes had water vapor while others did not , " said Villanueva .
According to the team , the plumes were seen over areas that show evidence of ancient ground ice or flowing water .
For example , plumes appeared over northern hemisphere regions such as east of Arabia Terra , the Nili Fossae region , and the south - east quadrant of Syrtis Major , an ancient volcano 1,200 kilometers ( about 745 miles ) across .
It will take future missions , like NASA 's Mars Science Laboratory , to discover the origin of the Martian methane .
One way to tell if life is the source of the gas is by measuring isotope ratios .
Isotopes are heavier versions of an element ; for example , deuterium is a heavier version of hydrogen .
In molecules that contain hydrogen , like water and methane , the rare deuterium occasionally replaces a hydrogen atom .
Since life prefers to use the lighter isotopes , if the methane has less deuterium than the water released with it on Mars , it 's a sign that life is producing the methane .
The research was funded by NASA 's Planetary Astronomy Program and the NASA Astrobiology Institute .

THE US Securities and Exchange Commission , which sued Bernard Madoff last month for allegedly directing a $ US50 billion ( $ 71 billion ) fraud , is to withhold public access to a list of his assets filed on Wednesday .
A federal judge ordered Madoff to provide the commission with an account of all investments , loans , lines of credit , business interests , brokerage accounts and other holdings .
The court
did not authorise its public disclosure , said a commission spokesman , Andrew Calamari , who confirmed receipt of the list .
" I think one of the fears here is that much of this money may be in offshore funds , " said Professor John Coffee , of Columbia Law School , adding the commission wanted to keep the assets secret to protect them .
" There is the danger that foreign regulators and foreign creditors may seek to seize that money if the names and sources are made public . "
Madoff was charged last month by federal prosecutors with directing an alleged Ponzi scheme through his New York investment firm .
His lawyer , Ira Sorkin , has said Madoff 's company is co-operating with the Government .
Goode Concedes Defeat in VA - 05 Rep. Virgil Goode ( R - VA ) , has conceded defeat after the recount in VA - 05 was finished .
The new congressman from the Charlottesville district will be Tom Perriello ( D ) .
Goode seemed like a perfectly safe occupant of the seat until he denounced Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , the first Muslim member of Congress .
The resulting storm of protest ended his career .
All House races have now concluded .
The Democrats won 257 seats to the Republicans ' 178 .
After the 2004 elections , the Democrats had 203 seats in the House , so they have picked up 54 seats in the past two cycles .
This puts the Democrats almost back to where they were before the 1994 Republican wave ( 258 seats ) .
Maybe the Republicans can repeat 1994 in 2010 , but Charlie Cook thinks this is very unlikely unless the Democrats mess up big time , which is unlikely since many of them remember the 1994 debacle very well .
Minnesota Recount Continues
The canvassing board is continuing to count the challenged ballots one by one in the Minnesota Senate race .
In the past two days , 420 of the ballots challenged by Al Franken have been examined .
During this process , Coleman gained about 100 votes .
This is normal as Franken challenged many ballots that looked like they were for Coleman but had an outside chance of being invalidated or even ruled as Franken votes .
When the board starts examining the Coleman challenges , Franken will gain votes .
The Star Tribune puts Coleman 's lead at 358 votes as of the end of counting Wednesday .
A new wrinkle in the process is that Coleman is now claiming that as many as 150 votes were double counted by local elections boards .
Franken dismissed the claim as " just a theory . "
Such claims could provide the basis for a later court challenge if Franken is certified the winner .

With the meltdown on Wall St. fresh in everyone 's mind , a key appointment is the head of the SEC .
Yesterday , Obama named former SEC commissioner Mary Schapiro to the position .
Obama Chooses Rick Warren to Deliver Inaugural Invocation Obama has chosen pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inaugural .
Liberal groups are already up in arms over this choice .
It was a brilliant move on Obama 's part .
By reaching out to a relatively moderate evangelical who has focused on AIDS and world poverty and getting liberals to react angrily ( because Warren is antichoice and antigay ) Obama has accomplished two things .
First , a lot of evangelicals will come to regard Obama as not so bad after all , which will surely help him when he actually starts to govern .
Second , by getting liberals visibly furious with him before he is even inaugurated , he will be much better able to defend himself against right - wing cries that he is a " liberal " ( a pejorative in some circles ) .
The move costs him no political capital at all .
Warren gets a few minutes to speak on national TV .
He 's not going to use it to bash gays if he has any expectation of becoming the new Billy Graham .
But later when Obama does controversial things -- like pushing for some kind of national health insurance -- he can claim to be balanced by saying : " I am a centrist , look , I let Warren speak and I support national health insurance , something for everyone . "
That is hardly an even trade but it will get him a lot of mileage in the media .
Despite what some people may think , Obama is a very clever politician and fully understands that making small gestures to the right , however meaningless , generate good will he will need later .
The incident brings to mind the comment of John Mitchell ( Richard Nixon 's attorney general ) : " Watch what we do , not what we say . "

I think the " No " vote on the bailout took all of the Wall Street " free market " - championing Republicans and stock market shows by surprise and Tuesday they layered the networks ( CNN , MSNBC , NBC , FOX , ABC , CBS ) with story after story about credit problems that are going to come upon us .
I think they had no idea that the deal would n't pass and got caught flat footed .
Even Neil Cavuto was attacking John McCain 's economic advisor Douglas Holtz - Eakin , saying that it looks like McCain was playing politics with the bail out .
Wow , when have you ever seen Cavuto do that ?
Cavuto :
But you 're saying this is n't about politics Doug , but all you 're doing is sounding like a politician .

Well , something will get done I suppose , but I do believe Paul Krugman on the bail out narratives :
So now what ?
Like Jamie Galbraith , I 'd rather see Dodd - Frank - Paulson , which is much better than the original plan , pass than not .
The true cost to taxpayers will probably be close to zero , and it would buy some time .
But I 'm not passionate about this .
The real financial rescue still lies in the future , probably under the Obama administration .
We all spoke up with new ideas and made a difference .
( And there 's my Naomi Klein interview . )
You 'll notice that the Republicans are so touchy about the fact that Conservatism is the root cause of this problem that led to the failure of the financial institutions that a little truth spoken by Nancy Pelosi was used as a wedge by them .
Oh , please , do n't blame us for more destruction .
You 're so bad for pointing out the obvious .
Glenn Greenwald says Pelosi played it very well .
Strictly on the level of " Democratic v. Republican " political strategizing , Nancy Pelosi did exactly the right thing yesterday --- all very well - played by the House Democratic leadership .
We have to keep speaking the truth .
This is not a bi-partisan issue .
Republican and conservative philosophies have paved the way for this financial financial meltdown and we need to tell the American people about this as much as possible .
The minister must start listening to the experts , who have repeatedly made the point that most predatory risks to children lurk in those areas of the online world this kind of filtering will do little to combat .
Technical advice suggests chat rooms , email and peer - to - peer networks are the most dangerous .
Law enforcement agencies around the world have revealed that pedophiles use peer - to - peer networks to exchange explicit videos and images outside the world wide web .
Experts have also shown how the techno - savvy can use various techniques - including encryption - to bypass filters , leaving web sites you would expect to be blocked , open for all to see .
The most powerful and effective weapon against illegal behaviour online is the same as that for illegal behaviour in the real world : sophisticated law enforcement .
The successful operation against a child pornography network by the Australian Federal Police late last year , which resulted in more than 20 arrests , demonstrates that .
This crucial capability must not be neglected in favour of an unproven filtering concept experts say will be easy to get around , will not block some offensive content while blocking some acceptable sites , and will slow down the internet for everyone in the process .
Would n't the $ 40 million earmarked for the compulsory filtering policy be better spent on funding and resources for law enforcement , to better equip agencies to strike at the heart of child pornography production and distribution ?
There are other , more practical filtering options for individual computers , which allow choice , but this government does n't appear to want that .
Labor has closed the program established by the former Coalition government , which provided free , PC - based filters to all families .
These filters allowed families to complement their online safety arrangements with software tailored to their individual needs , without compromising overall internet performance .
Senator Conroy says too few people used the program .
But take - up is driven by demand , and while some parents choose to use a content filter , others , for their own reasons , do n't .
I installed a content filter on our family 's computer and believe it is a worthwhile additional safeguard to help protect my children from being exposed to explicit content .
You would think the take - up rate of the free filter program would tell the Government something about where internet filtering lies in terms of priority to families , but apparently not .
If anything , the minister seems to be using it to somehow justify Labor 's heavy - handed " big brother " approach .
As the debate about Labor 's controversial policy has raged , Senator Conroy has remained cryptic and vague , raising suspicion by talking about filtering not just illegal material , but also " unwanted " content that he refuses to specify .
He has also resorted to unedifying inferences against those who dared question his plan .
When a Greens Senator , Scott Ludlam , asked some perfectly reasonable questions during a senate estimates hearing last October , Senator Conroy responded : " I trust you are not suggesting that people should have access to child pornography . "
Newspapers have reported that the minister 's office tried to silence industry figures who had publicly spoken out against content filtering .
Last month Senator Conroy finally released a damning expert report on ISP - level filtering , which he had sat on since February .
Meanwhile , we wait for filtering trials to start , trials that have been delayed and which have next - to - no support among the industry .
Telstra BigPond - Australia 's largest ISP - has refused to take part , comparing internet filtering to " like trying to boil the ocean " .
The third largest , iiNet , is prepared to participate to highlight flaws .
No decent Australian would argue against the broad aim of making the online world as safe as possible .
But Labor 's fixation with compulsory , centralised filtering - which tells parents they are incapable of protecting their children - is not the answer .
Nick Minchin is the shadow minister for broadband , communications and the digital economy .
With only weeks remaining until the presidential election ( and I hope , my own re-election ) , I wanted to share with you a few items of interest that relate to our fight for accountability for this corrupt White House .
First , I was honored to speak at the Progressive Democrats of America ( PDA ) event in Denver during the Democratic National Convention .
PDA does amazing work pushing forward the vital cause of impeachment .
As Vice - Chairman of the Convention , it was important to me to represent your voices not only as we nominated Barack Obama as our nominee , but also in events like this – in order to demonstrate that many Democrats are as committed as ever to holding Bush and Cheney accountable .
A short clip of my appearance at the PDA event recorded by an audience member can be found HERE .
The full video , recorded by PDA , can be found HERE ( it may take a little while to download ) .
At the event I made clear that it is long past time that Inherent Contempt is invoked for renegade Bush officials like Karl Rove who defy congressional subpoenas .
I am confident that an Obama / Biden administration will respect the Constitution – but our shared hope for a good outcome in the November elections should not distract us from our constitutional obligations today .
Along these lines , the next two weeks will feature a renewed push for testimony or Inherent Contempt for Miers and Rove , as well as possible new charges of contempt against the US Attorney General , Michael Mukasey .
Recently – Joe Biden stated that the Obama administration would not shy away from investigating Bush / Cheney actions , and they would pursue action if they found them to be illegal .
This is terrific news and we must encourage soon - to - be Vice President Biden to keep this promise .
Despite our work , it is clear that Impeachment will not occur before the election .
How Congress lives up to its obligations after the election is an open question .
I , for one , will work with my colleagues to continue our push for accountability .
Remember : Bush 's crimes do n't expire because another president has been elected .
Cheney 's abuse of power still violate the constitution even after November 4th .
We must not allow such abuses to go unanswered , regardless of how much time is left in Bush 's term .
Keep up the fight .
Sincerely ,
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is looking into the conduct of a suspended Chattanooga police officer after an altercation last month with a Collegedale Wal - Mart greeter .
Officer Kenneth Freeman was placed on a 28 - day suspension this week after an investigation showed he shoved and knocked down a 71 - year - old Wal - Mart greeter while exiting the store on Christmas Eve .
The greeter told police he was trying to check the officer 's store receipt , but Officer Freeman would n't stop .
The greeter said he blacked out after Officer Freeman shoved him .
At the request of Hamilton County District Attorney General Bill Cox , the TBI began investigating the incident on Jan. 12 , said TBI spokeswoman Kristin Helm .
She would n't provide any more details about the investigation , except to say it was ongoing and the findings would be turned over to Mr. Cox 's office for review .
An internal affairs investigation found Officer Freeman used excessive force .
That report states that , after Officer Freeman knocked the greeter to the ground , he stood over the man and yelled , " Never put your hand on me " and " Do n't touch me . "
Officer Freeman was on - duty at the time of the incident , the report states .
He said he stopped at the Wal - Mart with another officer to buy last - minute Christmas gifts .
For complete details , see tomorrow 's Chattanooga Times Free Press .
Versus , like any company these days , is trying everything they can do to get press and notierity on the cheap .
They 've recently started a marketing campaign for the network that has people sending in photos with their best use of the letter " V " for their logo .
Basically various folks flashing the peace sign .
So what 's wrong with that you ask ?
Well just the fact that they are calling it " Show Me Your V " .
Puck Daddy has some of the more interesting reactions ...
Puck Daddy reader Tim : " In case you missed it , they have a new promotion that calls for its viewers to send in ' extreme ' pictures of themselves .
The promotion is called ' Show Me Your V ' .
The idea is for the people to be showing acts of vengeance , versatility ... whatever ... while flashing the hippie - gang - sign .
With the roughnecks that watch that station , there will be some interesting and literal interpretations of ' Show Me Your V ' .
Honestly , that 's the most hilariously flawed promotional name I 've come across .
Leave it to the national broadcaster of the NHL . "
Puck Daddy reader James : " Ripe for abuse , begging to be eaten up ....... wow my head is spinning . "
Oh , c'mon , it 's not that bad ... is it ?
On the one hand ... " Show Me Your V ? "
Maybe our minds are so far in the gutter that we 've got rats scurrying across them , but even Roger Moore 's James Bond would believe this double entendre is a tad too telegraphed .
That 's not a bad assessment , but " Show Me Your V " is almost so bad and obvious , that it 's even more funny .
I mean the pictures are completely lame , and no aspiring model has taken it to the next level as of yet , so maybe they 're trying to be serious with this whole thing .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama is expected to nominate New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to head the Commerce Department , a senior Democratic source said on Tuesday .
Obama is expected to announce the appointment during a news conference scheduled for 1140 EST / 1640 GMT on Wednesday in Chicago , his fifth since he began naming nominees for his Cabinet .
The appointment of Richardson , a former U.N. ambassador and energy secretary who became an Obama supporter earlier this year after dropping his own presidential bid , would make him the first Hispanic named to Obama ’s rapidly filling Cabinet .
Last week Obama announced members of his economic team including his nominee for Treasury secretary , New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner , and this week he unveiled his national security team including his designate for Secretary of State , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Richardson , 61 , had been a contender for the secretary of state post that went to his former Democratic presidential rival Clinton , but at Commerce he will play a key role in efforts to revive the faltering U.S. economy .

Feed the Animals is one of my favorite albums this year , a hyperactive mish - mash sampling hundreds of songs from the last 45 years of popular music .
Gregg Gillis created a beautiful , illegal mess of copyright clearance hell , which you should download immediately .
( It ’s free , but I kicked in $ 20 for Gregg ’s legal fund and a copy of the CD . )
Last month , Rex Sorgatz asked about collecting metadata on the album for data crunching .
After spelunking through Billboard ’s chart history , that sounded like my idea of a good time .
So I compiled all the data into spreadsheets , used Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk to collect some additional information , and pulled out a few charts .
As always , I ’ve provided CSV downloads for all the data along with the original output from Mechanical Turk , for those interested in experimenting with the platform .
Update ( October 30 ) : Here ’s the official sample list .
Results
Here ’s the final spreadsheet with all the collected data .
You can download the CSV or browse it using Google Spreadsheets .
For more information about how the data was collected with Wikipedia and Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk , I wrote about my methodology in the next section .
There are 14 tracks on Feed the Animals , with a total of 264 sampled songs .
“ What It ’s All About ” and “ Like This ” have 26 sampled songs each , tying for the most , while “ Do n’t Stop ” has the fewest at 11 songs .
Overall , the album averages 19.8 songs sampled per track .
The timeline below shows where each sample was triggered across the entire album , as a percentage of the song ’s duration .
( For example , a marker at the 50 % mark on the 9th line means that a sample started halfway through track # 9 , “ Hands In the Air . ” )
You can get a sense of the flow of the album , how Gregg spaces samples apart and occasionally switches moods entirely by introducing three samples in quick succession .
Using the sample release dates collected from Mechanical Turk , the chart below shows the median sample age for each track .
( The bars above and below each point represent the earliest and latest years for each track . )
I was surprised to see a trend — the album uses relatively recent songs for the first three tracks , before taking us back to the late ’ 80s and early ’90s for the middle of the album , with the exception of “ No Pause . ”
Then , every song from track 9 to the end of the album gets progressively more modern .
For the whole album , 1995 was the median year .
The chart below shows the sample release years in more detail , telling another story .
Here , we can see how heavily Gregg uses samples from the last three years , and strongly avoids samples for the previous three - year period from 2001 to 2004 .
( Too old to be cool , but not old enough to be retro ? )
I ’m sure there ’s more that can be explored here , so feel free to send on your own analysis .
Methodology
Getting the sample list was easy .
I took a snapshot of the album ’s Wikipedia entry and extracted all the samples using Excel ’s Text to Columns feature .
Now , I had a spreadsheet of all 264 songs sampled across 14 tracks , with each sample ’s original artist and song name .
But to get the sample ’s release year , I ’d need to go elsewhere .
The Last.fm and Yahoo !
Music APIs all support album release dates , but during testing , I found that the dates were unreliable .
( Compilation albums and reissues led to incorrect dates , and some artist / song searches led to incorrect results . )
Instead , I decided to use human labor to fill in the gaps using Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk .
I created a new request using the new web - based tools for generating HITs ( or “ Human Intelligence Tasks ” ) from a simple spreadsheet .
I paid $ 0.02 for each request , with each song verified by two different workers .
Each worker was asked to search for the song on Billboard.com , All Music Guide , Wikipedia , or Google , and fill in the original release year .
Here ’s an example of one of the requests .
Within an hour , all but 4 answers were submitted .
The median time to finish a request was an impressive 26 seconds .
( Amazingly , over 110 answers were completed in under 10 seconds without any errors . )
For 193 songs , about 73 % , the two workers agreed on the year , so were approved immediately .
For the rest , 27 % of the songs , the workers came up with different answers , so I checked them manually .
( In hindsight , I should have required three workers per song to resolve different answers . )
Surprisingly , I could n’t find a correlation between the amount of time spent on each task and the error rate .
Workers who made mistakes took just as long as the accurate workers .
The spreadsheet below is the source data from Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk .
( View it on Google Docs or download it in Excel format . )
The “ raw ” sheet is the default output from Amazon , while the rest of the sheets are my own edits , breaking out the final set of accepted answers , the responses that were immediately approved , and the ones that were contested .
Overall , it cost me $ 13.20 for all 528 answers and took a little over two hours , an hourly rate of about $ 1.64 .
Simple to use , affordable , and I ’ll almost certainly use it again — for something a little more interesting next time .
If anyone out there wants to take a pass at getting the sample endings , sample genres , or any other additional metadata with Mechanical Turk or otherwise , send it along and I ’ll add it to the spreadsheet .
Thanks !

October 30 : Here ’s the official sample list .
Before 2007 , using the internet on your phone would make you want to kill yourself , if you were dumb enough to believe the crap splattered across that tiny screen even was the " internet . "
But the combination of increased bandwidth and better mobile software means that more phones really are promising to deliver the real internet , in living color .
We tested eight different browsers , and while some put smiles on our faces , others proved that rendering HTML correctly is a far cry from actually giving you an awesome web experience .
And what about 3G vs. Wi -Fi ?
Everything the carriers have told you is a lie .
This is the true state of mobile web .

Before we give you the rundown of each of the most prevalent mobile browsers , here 's how they all stacked up in a timed test of how fast ( and how well ) they could render websites , chosen for their diversity and particular challenges :
CHART KEY : Number value is time for complete page load in seconds ; page rendering is rated from " Fail " to " Excellent " for each ; and the color ( red , yellow , green ) indicates overall performance taking into account both speed and rendering accuracy : Green = good overall , Red = fail overall .

This second chart runs through the same procedure with all of the phones that had Wi-Fi options :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
It 's a pretty daunting pile of numbers , so let 's break it down into standard prose , rating each browser as we go :

Android
A fast , smart mobile browser based on WebKit .
It tackles most sites with ( almost ) unrivaled grace and speed .
Panning and zooming could be smoother and more responsive , but with a ton of options for getting around a page — various touch methods and the trackball — few sites will be challenging to zip around .
The only thing we really miss is multitouch for zoom .
Buttons just are n't a very elegant or precise solution , and while the whole - page magnifying glass technique is nice , we 'd love something a bit more refined .
Overall though , we 're happy campers on Android 's browser .
Grade : B +

BlackBerry Bold
Leaps and bounds ahead of the browser BlackBerry users have put up with for years , it renders most pages correctly , even if scripts give it a conniption fit ( hence its long load times for Wikipedia and the WSJ ) .
It uses the standard " click to zoom " metaphor , which works well enough , though getting around a page with the trackball can be kind of a work out for you thumb .
The Column View , which squeezes a whole page into a single column , is fairly convenient and makes it easier to get around wider pages , even if it does n't work equally as well on every site ( nice on Wikipedia , ugly on Giz ) .
Hopefully they fix the script performance in the Storm , which is using an updated version of the Bold 's browser .
We humbly suggest they ditch their home - baked browser for one based on WebKit , which would help out there .
Grade : B-/C +

iPhone
What can we say ?
It 's still got the best mobile browser around .
It crushes basically everything but Android 's browser — which is also based on WebKit — in speed and outclasses its still classy brother - from - another - mother ( and everyone else ) with the ease and elegance of its multitouch zooming .
Some pages still give it fits , and it 's missing Flash support , but it really does deliver an unrivaled mobile web experience .
We love it , but make no mistake we 're eagerly waiting for something better .
( Mobile Firefox ?
Is it you ? )
Grade : A-

Nokia E71 Symbian S60
Hey look , another web browser with WebKit guts !
It does n't perform quite as well as Android 's or iPhone 's iteration where speed or render accuracy are concerned ( can any Symbian nuts explain why ? ) , but it does a serviceable job .
The big thing it has going for it is Flash Lite 3 support , though performance there is kinda assy and memory intensive .
Navigation is tougher with the E71's d-pad than with a trackball , but the whole page magnifying approach makes it easy enough to get around ( too bad you have to dig through a menu or two to get to it ) .
Not bad , but short of excellent .
Grade : B -

Internet Explorer on Windows Mobile
Jesus Christ .
This is a joke , right Microsoft ?
Hahaha .
No really , this is the worst smartphone browser on the planet .
It could n't render its way out of an ASCII - art paper bag .
It totally screwed up every single test page , except for Wikipedia , which it only mostly screwed up .
Good luck navigating a page if you 're granted the miraculous occurrence of it being rendered in a state that 's usable .
Grade : F-

Opera Mobile on Windows Mobile
Microsoft 's own intentions notwithstanding , you can use the internet on a Windows Mobile phone .
You just need Opera Mobile .
It 's kind of hobbled by Windows Mobile 's assy performance , but it usually gets the job done .
Not as quickly or always as accurately as its WebKit rivals , but it 's definitely usable .
Interestingly , it benefits more from the extra bandwidth offered by Wi-Fi than the WebKit browsers do .
Menu - based zoom is annoying and imprecise .
Touch - based panning worked okay , though a little laggy .
We mostly navigated with the Samsung Epix 's optical cursor , which worked pretty well , somewhere in between a d-pad and a trackball .
Grade : C

Sprint Instinct
Holy CRAP .
This is not the painfully lousy browser the Instinct shipped with not by a long shot .
The original was slow and fairly feeble , even if it was the head of its ( dumbphone ) class .
The new 1.1 browser really is a life - changing upgrade .
It suffers in the chart because it 's much slower than most other browsers , and zooming is still clumsy , but once the page loads , it 's much smoother to pan and actually move around .
I got a bit annoyed that it lied about pageload time , hanging at the last 2 percent of the status bar for half the load , but it usually gets things right .
This is the best non-smartphone browser you can get .
Grade : C +

LG Dare
Like the Instinct , the Dare proves you can actually get a usable browsing experience on a feature phone .
It 's a little nimbler at loading pages than its Korean blood rival , but the reason it ultimately posts lower marks than the Instinct is that it buckles way more easily under a moderate to heavy pageload , turning it into an unresponsive picture of the website you were trying to look at .
Still , it renders most pages fairly accurately , and we like the sliding zoom scroll bar , at least in theory , since it seems like an intuitive way to deal with the zoom issue .
Unfortunately , it works more like a glorified pair of buttons .
( Note : I do n't think the speed was actually a piddly 300 Kbps — I think it just had a problem dealing with DSL Reports ' mobile speedtest , even though it 's text - based for the dumbest of phones . )
Grade : C
Methodology
We tested every browser only using the full — not mobile — versions of selected sites , over 3G and , whenever possible , Wi-Fi .
All scripts were turned on , and the cache was cleared before each round of testing .
We took the average of a series of five sequential speedtests to give us an idea of the bandwidth we 're dealing with , and timed how long it took to completely load a site according to each browser 's progress bar .
We assessed whether or not it rendered the page correctly , on a scale ranging from " excellent " to " good " ( a couple things out of place ) to " utter fail " ( I 've seen prettier train wrecks ) .

A few additional issues to note : Internet Explorer would not work on Wi-Fi .
Opera yes , our Skyfire install , yes , Internet Exploder , no .
( Samsung suggested it might be because of Opera . )
We did n't pursue the matter because of how IE did in the 3G tests :
A page that looks like a pile of blended dog poo is going to look like that no matter how much faster it loads .
Sprint 's updated Instinct and Verizon 's Dare , which we included as best - of - class examples of feature phones , do n't have Wi-Fi capabilities .
We left out Opera Mini and Skyfire , since they both leave most of the hard work to servers which essentially spit out a kind of image file — besides , we do n't think this kind of internet - by - proxy browser will be around for much longer .

The Big Gulp
Remember our mantra it 's code that counts ?
It 's true for mobile internet too .
An awesome browser can make up for a mediocre network , but a terrible browser delivers a crappy experience no matter how great the network is .
It 's all about the browser .
As it stands , WebKit is clearly the best thing going , but even then , software implementation matters , or Nokia would deliver as good a performance as Android and iPhone .
Proving the point , it 's striking how little Wi-Fi actually boosted speed beyond 3G — hell , WebKit browsers on 3G slid past some of the others that were running on Wi-Fi .
Another thing to note is that the zoom metaphor is a tricky thing to nail .
Buttons are too brutish , the magnifying glass is imprecise .
Multitouch seems to be the best way to handle zooming in and out in a way that 's intuitive and precise .
Hopefully we 'll see other developers start to use multitouch interfaces in touchscreen phones ( * cough * ANDROID !*cough * ) .

As much as this blow - by - blow battlemodo shows you all the problems we encountered , the big picture is that really , mobile web is pretty dandy right now , and getting dandier .
It could be more reliable , faster , maybe a little more versatile , but for the most part , yes , you can access the internet on your phone .
Compared to just two years ago , that 's really saying something .
We can't wait to see what it 'll look like in two years .
Maybe Internet Exploder will actually work .
Nah , that 's a little too sci-fi .
Spending billions on trying to reduce carbon emissions is one giant con that is depriving third world countries of vital funds to tackle famine , HIV and other diseases , Sammy Wilson said .
The DUP minister has been heavily criticised by environmentalists for claiming that ongoing climatic shifts are down to nature and not mankind .
But while acknowledging his views on global warming may not be popular , the East Antrim MP said he was not prepared to be bullied by eco fundamentalists .
“ I ’ll not be stopped saying what I believe needs to be said about climate change , ” he said .
" Most of the people who shout about climate change have not read one article about it
“ I think in 20 years ’ time we will look back at this whole climate change debate and ask ourselves how on earth were we ever conned into spending the billions of pounds which are going into this without any kind of rigorous examination of the background , the science , the implications of it all .
Because there is now a degree of hysteria about it , fairly unformed hysteria I ’ve got to say as well .
“ I mean I get it in the Assembly all the time and most of the people who shout about climate change have not read one article about climate change , not read one book about climate change , if you asked them to explain how they believe there ’s a connection between CO2 emission and the effects which they claim there ’s going to be , if you ask them to explain the thought process or the modelling that is required and the assumptions behind that and how tenuous all the connections are , they would n’t have a clue .
“ They simply get letters about it from all these lobby groups , it ’s popular and therefore they go along with the flow — and that would be ok if there were no implications for it , but the implications are immense . ”
He said while people in the western world were facing spiralling fuel bills as a result of efforts to cut CO2 , the implications in poorer countries were graver .
“ What are the problems that face us either locally and internationally .
Are those not the things we should be concentrating on ? ” he asked .
“ HIV , lack of clean water , which kills millions of people in third world countries , lack of education .
“ A fraction of the money we are currently spending on climate change could actually eradicate those three problems alone , a fraction of it .
“ I think as a society we sometimes need to get some of these things in perspective and when I listen to some of the rubbish that is spoken by some of my colleagues in the Assembly it amuses me at times and other times it angers me . ”
Despite his views on CO2 , Mr Wilson said he does not intend to backtrack on commitments made by his predecessor at the Department of the Environment , Arlene Foster , to make the Stormont estate carbon neutral .
He said while he was n’t worried about reducing CO2 output , he said the policy would help to cut fuels bills .
“ I do n’t couch those actions in terms of reducing Co2 emissions , ” he said .
“ I do n’t care about Co2 emissions to be quite truthful because I do n’t think it ’s all that important but what I do believe is , and perhaps this is where there can be some convergence , as far as using fuel more efficiently that is good for our economy ; that makes us more competitive .
If we can save in schools hundreds of thousands on fuel that ’s more money being put for books or classroom assistants .
“ So yes there are things we can do .
If you want to express it terms of carbon neutral , I just express it terms of making the place more efficient , less wasteful and hopefully that will release money to do the proper things that we should be doing . ”

I 've just uploaded the document to scribd.com and you can see it just below .
Some background for those that do n't follow the blog : there is a complete grammar for the language Occidental available here that is also written entirely in the language , and in order to facilitate learning of the language as well as for my own use ( I just seriously started learning the language a few weeks ago ) I translated it into English , which you can see on the right .
This is the preliminary version with some typos and asterisks here and there when I 'm not sure either about the meaning of the word or the most appropriate English term , so think of it as version 0.1 .
If anyone wants to download the document , make some corrections and send it to me I 'll upload it to the same address .
Here it is :
Occidental Grammar
Imagine the school board meeting — the kids are reading some dangerous literature in English class .
Murder , drunkenness , torture , madness , and not even a sliver of moral instruction .
If the students were n’t already so resentful , they might even like what they ’ve been given to read , it ’s so cool .
Imagine the class discussion about the theme of , say , “ The Cask of Amontillado , ” and that one boy with a heavy metal T - shirt in the back finally joining the conversation with his interpretation : “ Some motherfuckers just have it comin’ . ”
2009 marks the bicentennial of Edgar Allan Poe , arguably the most famed and influential writer in American history .
Not only does his work entirely limn the culture , but he also created no fewer than two genres of popular fiction — mystery and modern horror — almost single - handedly .
Virtually anyone in the U.S. can recite his poetry ( a few lines here and there , at least ) .
His personal life and ambitions inform the clichés of the starving writer in his garret and that of the mad genius .
And it ’s nigh impossible for someone to graduate from an American high school without having read him .
Poe was also a player of hoaxes , a plagiarist , had a substance abuse problem , and could n’t keep a roof over his head .
Poe was a proponent of slavery , the worst sort of would - be social climber , and married a 13 - year - old girl in his cousin Virginia Clemm .
None of this information is new , of course — these fun facts are probably the answers to a fill - in - the - blank quiz given each year in some sixth - grade classroom in Ohio .
The problem is that Poe has been so completely taught that he is very rarely read with the eyes of a reader .
Unlike Hawthorne , with whom he is often paired in criticism and in those awful “ language arts ” classes , Poe had little interest in portraying a true - to - life America or plumbing our historical discontents .
Many of his stories take place in a world either fancifully sketched out or left purposefully ambiguous .
In stories such as “ The Tell - Tale Heart , ” the confession the narrator gives in order to prove his sanity occurs in a functional vacuum .
The settings of “ The Pit and the Pendulum , “ “ The Cask of Amontillado , ” “ The Man of the Crowd , ” and “ The Murders in the Rue Morgue ” could be identified as Spain , Venice , London , and Paris , but the locations are more like panoramas made from magazine clippings than they are representations of the actual places .
Poe even moved American stories , such as the true crime of the murder of Mary Rogers in Hoboken , New Jersey , to an explicitly parallel universe in which the murder finds its double in Paris : In “ The Mystery of Marie Rogêt , ” the Seine spells the Hudson River , and the Paris of the story is rather oddly New Jersey - shaped .
Poe ’s stories wo n’t lead to ersatz history lessons about the Puritans or any of the moral instruction that too often accompanies the reading of literature in schools .
They do n’t exist here , or anywhere else we could identify on a map as part of a dual language arts / social studies curriculum .
Poe ’s fictions exist in a no-place , in the interior of his own mind .
And what ’s in Poe ’s mind is n’t pretty .
In his short story “ The Imp of the Perverse , ” a man who got away with the perfect murder drives himself mad and is finally compelled to confess to the crime .
The imp is truly an “ imp ” - pulse , as Poe ’s unnamed narrator explains :
We stand upon the brink of a precipice .
We peer into the abyss — we grow sick and dizzy .
Our first impulse is to shrink away from the danger .
Unaccountably we remain … it is but a thought , although a fearful one , and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror .
It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height … for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it .
The important bit is that the abyssal compulsion the narrator surrenders to is n’t the murder , but rather the confessing to it .
Poe was consumed with madness and death .
There is no moral center in Poe ’s work , not in his mysteries , nor in his darker fiction , and not in his poetry .
Were he alive today , Poe would not be publishing in the most popular of periodicals — “ Cask ” appeared in Godey ’s Lady ’s Book when that magazine was the most widely read in the country — but instead in the micropresses of the horror genre .
As H. P. Lovecraft said in his own seminal critical work Supernatural Horror in Literature , it was Poe who first “ perceived the essential impersonality of the real artist … [ that ] the function of creative fiction is merely to express and interpret events and sensations as they are , regardless of how they tend or what they prove — good or evil , attractive or repulsive , stimulating or depressing …. ”
Poe was one of the first authors of modern horror in that he was not interested in resolving the social trespasses his work depicted with pat morally correct endings or appeals to cosmic justice .
In this way , he was also one of the only modern purveyors of dark fiction .
The bloodiest slasher flicks often betray a Puritanical ideology , with only the virginal characters allowed to survive .
Gangsta rappers love their mamas and write songs about them .
Noir writers made sure their sleuths had a code of ethical conduct , even if it only consisted of a single line they would not cross but that the baddies they hunted would .
Stephen King ’s novels summon up dark miracles that threaten families , towns , and occasionally civilization itself , but these evils are put down more often than not thanks to the power of friendship .
Poe ’s an acquired taste .
Then there is the detective story , which Poe invented .
He only wrote three Dupin mysteries , and undermined the genre nearly after creating it .
Everyone knows of the murderous orangutan and the letter hiding in plain sight , but few people read “ The Mystery of Marie Rogêt ” today because the ending does n’t satisfy : Dupin does n’t solve the case — he only draws the conclusion that the murderer acted alone .
A rewritten draft suggests that a botched abortion did the poor girl in .
In both versions , the rational Dupin throws up his hands ; the supernatural overwhelms the rational , and the chasm between the two can never be navigated .
Imagine Sherlock Holmes shrugging his shoulders after two adventures and turning to the oblivion of drugs forever .
Despite his occasional runs at the big - time during his life , Poe was often his own best market .
He launched the mystery genre with “ Rue Morgue ” while an editor at Graham ’s Magazine ; it ’s easy enough to get published when you ’re in the office a few days a week .
When his work did n’t get the attention he thought it deserved , Poe would often review it himself , either using a pseudonym or leaving off a byline completely .
These reviews were among the few positive ones
Poe ever wrote — he was a legendary scrapper and hatchet man , and eager to punch above his weight class by taking on Longfellow .
Today
Poe would be a blogger with a handful of publications in saddle - stitched rags and the occasional Webzine .
Amoral fiction is relegated to the underground these days .
Poe ’s genius simply happened to resonate with the historical moment in which he wrote , those decades when urbanism bred unparalleled crime and intimate violence ( and an endless appetite for texts about the same ) ; this is what saved him from obscurity .
Given
Poe ’s disinterest in the popular pastime of auctorial finger - wagging at an audience eager for moral blandishments and the endless censorious tangles in American schools and library systems , it is at first blush amazing that Poe has n’t been targeted more often than he has .
Poe ’s work certainly has n’t been censored as often as Huckleberry Finn .
Ultimately , though , there is simply no need for a moral panic over Poe .
The teaching is enough to defang the author .
When he first immigrated to the United States in the 1940s , comedian and spoken word performer Brother Theodore gave dramatic recitals of Poe ’s poetry and stories , only to discover that he was playing to mostly empty houses .
Few people wanted to sit through more
Poe as they ’d already gotten their fill thanks to tedious English teachers .
A quick Google search is illuminating .
On the wiki for the classes of one Ms. C Kelly , we can read the sort of Poe- related assignment kids are made to suffer through :
Students will research information and discuss their thoughts on whether Edgar Allen [ sic ! ]
Poe died from Alcoholism or Rabies .
[ capital letters sic ]
Students must include a minimum of three posts with thoughts and ideas that are supported and linked to website resources .
At least one post must be your informed position on the discussion topic and at least one of your posts must be to refute another classmate ’s stance based on a post that they contributed to the discussion topic .
In a better world , grade - schoolers would be excited to argue over alcoholism or rabies all night long , but the bright kids must have trouble taking seriously an assignment with the author ’s name misspelled , the ridiculous demand for “ thoughts and ideas ” in a Web post , and the notion that Poe ’s death was the result of one of only two possible causes .
The average student will just resent having to look stuff up .
On the off chance that reading Poe inspires a young student to embrace his or her own Imp of the Perverse , other elements of the curriculum are in place to handle such deviance .
Kelly ’s
Web site also includes a “ Tolerance Quiz ” .
Try this question out yourself :
4 . You see a couple that is covered from head - to - toe with tattoos and piercings .
What is your opinion of that couple as people ?
a . Not enough information to make that kind of judgment .
b . They must have some issues , and this I know for sure !
c. They are complete idiots who like to abuse themselves , are probably involved in illegal behavior , and are stupid .
If you answered b or c , you ’re intolerant because you have an opinion of the cultural signifiers two people went out of their way to sport in public .
Further , finding such a couple cool , awesome , and worthy of emulation is utterly outside the realm of possibility .
What would a properly tolerant grade - schooler think of the “ vulture eye ” of the murder victim in “ The Tell - Tale Heart ” ( no opinion , no opinion ! ) or of Poe ’s own brief life of misery and personal disaster ( not enough information ! ) ?
We get to read
Poe in school not because school defangs
Poe ; school defangs us so that we ca n’t sink our fangs into his stories the way he wanted us to .
Poe is torn to shreds by dopey assignments forcing us to compare and contrast the cat in “ The Black Cat ” to the bird in “ The Raven , ” term papers about Roderick Usher ’s inability to tell fantasy from reality , and endless other demands that we take the ineffable in Poe ’s stories and try to make them effable .
( It ’s eff - able all right ! )
How can we read Poe today ?
Even those who heroically managed to resist schooling well enough to find pleasure in reading have to search through two centuries of baggage to find the real Poe .
He is everywhere — on The Simpsons and The Gilmore Girls , in the National Football League , and if the industry gossip is true , in a script by Sylvester Stallone which the actor is also planning to direct .
“ Nevermore ! ” is n’t a coda — it ’s a punchline .
Then there are the well - known facts of his life , and the dubious results of biocriticism .
Every pale girl is Poe ’s wife , or his young mother who died when the author was a child .
Every fever is delirium tremens or rabies , just like Ms. C Kelly suggested .
Poe also left us without unforgettable , well - rendered characters of the sort readers of contemporary realism have been trained to see as the apex of quality literature .
What we are left with is what we ’ve always had : the power of the Gothic .
Joyce Carol Oates , who is at her best when at her darkest , sums up precisely what the Gothic still means in these post - everything times :
There is a profound difference between what appears to be and what is ; and if you believe otherwise , the Gothicist has a surprise for you .
The strained , sunny smile of the Enlightenment — “ All that is , is holy ; ” “ Man is a rational being ” — is confronted by the Gothicist , who , quite frankly , considering the history and prehistory of our species , knows better .
Oates mentions history and alludes to the widely held suspicion that the history of humanity is one limned with evil .
But what perpetuates evil but the normalization of evil , the transformation of it into the banal ?
Poe ’s triumph is that he portrayed evil without finally blinking and cobbling together some minor moral triumph or life lesson at the end of his tales .
His stuff is the scream of the Gothicist still echoing throughout our culture .
But we ca n’t live with his reminders 24 hours a day ; hell , we ca n’t live with his reminders across the course of a grade school language arts “ unit ” on Poe , so we do our best to protect ourselves with banality .
Perhaps it ’s no surprise that kids shoot up a school when the tolerance quizzes do n’t have the desired positive effect on interpersonal relations in the classroom .
After all , ai n’t we evil monkeys , far worse than an orang with a razor ?
And no , not all of us are .
But enough of us are , and Poe ’s fiction lets us live in their heads for a little while .
Live there and like it .
So how should we read Poe ?
In our banal little classrooms , we ’ve all read his stories for multiple - choice questions about theme , or as a reflection of “ our society ” ( our society ?
include me out ! ) , or as a biography arrayed in a patchwork of prose and poems .
But we should read
Poe for the sheer bloody - minded pleasure of knowing the truth : Some motherfuckers just have it comin ’ .

Ruby 1.9.1 and JRuby currently lead the pack of Ruby implementations when it comes to performance .
However , for various reasons , switching to either of these Ruby implementations might not be possible just yet , as Ruby 1.9. x breaks compatibility with 1.8.7 in some areas and JRuby still lacks some Ruby libs that use native extensions .
With that in mind , MRI 1.8.x seems here to stay for the near future , so there 's interest in improving its perfomance .
Brent Roman now brings a few performance improvements to Ruby 1.8.x MRI .
He started out trying to fix memory leaks in Ruby , particularly in continuations :
The basic technique is a refinement of the one Kurt Stephens suggested .
It not only eliminates the leaks in this one liner :
loop {@x=callcc{|c|c}}
but also in our multi- threaded robotics application .
Our Ruby process used to grow to 20 + MB during a day long run .
The same run now stays smaller than 10MB .
As it turns out , the leaks are caused by GCC optimizations that interact badly with Ruby 's conservative GC :
The garbage collector 's leaking memory is not really its own fault .
The trouble is that the ' C ' machine stack is filled with object references .
The main reason for this is that gcc compilers create overly large stack frames and do not initialize many values in them .
Certain ' C ' constructs used in the Ruby interpreter 's core recursive expression evaluator generate especially large , sparse stack frames .
The function rb_eval ( ) is the worst offender , creating kilobyte sized stack frames for each invocation of a function that may call itself hundreds of times .
This results in stacks that are hundreds of kilobytes , often full of old , dead object references that may never go away .
Brent has provided a few patches ( against Ruby 1.8.7 - patlevel72 which aim to fix these problems .
Testers report significant speedups with the patches while running real world Rails apps .
A few issues were reported as well , so it remains to be seen where this goes .
These patches are another example of the open source ( Ruby ) community improving MRI .
Mod_rails ( or REE ) is another example , which made MRI 's Garbage Collector fork - friendly ( see the linked news item for an explanation ) .
MRI 's performance can also vary significantly depending on how it was compiled .
Are you planning on sticking with Ruby 1.8.x in 2009 ?
If yes , what are the main reasons ?

Well it would seem that the debut episode of the #reddit podcast internet audio production was a success .
Several people pointed out an issue with the quality of the recording .
I know for a fact it stems from a wiring issue in my home .
It only seems to be overly obnoxious when I use a specific phone .
Also I discovered at the last minute the Windows version of Audacity is a little different from the Linux version I am familiar with .
Minor issues aside , I think we all had a good time , and made an entertaining show .
The date for the next recording will be in the next three days ( 6,7,8 of ’09 ) .
There has been lots of interesting stuff going on , so be sure to have some notes ready , and charge up your phones .
Unless it becomes a major issue it will remain an open show where anyone may participate .
The call in number will be posted in #reddit on Freenode shortly before the show will begin .
If anyone has questions , comments , or suggestions please send them !
Feel free to comment to this blog , or make a self submission in /r/ podcast and ask.redditpodcast a question .
If anyone wants to help out , we could use someone to make show notes .
We are also looking for groovy royalty free music , or even better – musicians from the community looking for some free promotion .
I did the intro for the first show , and the closing music was mixed by a friend of mine .
I may have a link to the 15 min set in the future .
That the French resent the global supremacy of the English language is nothing new , but as Hugh Schofield finds out , a newly evolved business - speak version is taking over .
They were giving out the annual Prix de la Carpette Anglaise the other day .
Literally it means the English Rug Prize , but doormat would be the better translation .
Quelle horreur !
Lord Nelson is the inspiration for a French rock band
As the citation explains , the award goes to the French person or institution who has given the best display of " fawning servility " to further the insinuation into France of the accursed English language .
Among the runners - up this year : the supermarket company Carrefour ­which changed the name of its Champion chain of stores to Carrefour Market , not using the French word " marche " .
Also the provocatively - named Paris band Nelson ( it is the Admiral , not Mr Mandela , that they have in mind ) whose frontman J.B. sings in English because , he says , French does not have the right cadences for true rock .
Worst offender
But topping the poll for grave disservices to the mother tongue is France 's higher education minister , Valerie Pecresse .
Valerie Pecresse has decided if you cannot beat then , join them Her crime : proclaiming to the press that she had no intention of speaking French when attending European meetings in Brussels , because , she said , it was quite obvious that English was now the easiest mode of communication .
The rise and rise of the English language is a sensitive subject for many here in France , who believe that French has every bit as much right to be considered a global tongue .
Even conceding to English victory in the war for linguistic supremacy , the French believe that the least they can do is defend their own territory and keep the ghastly invader at a decent remove .
Personally , I sympathise greatly with defenders of the French language
The same group that sponsors the Prix de la Carpette also brings legal actions against companies that , it says , breach the law , for example , by not issuing French language versions of instructions to staff .
Personally , I sympathise greatly with defenders of the French language .
I think it is true that culturally the world will be diminished if one monolithic form of discourse squashes the rest .
But then I am also a realist .
Recently I have spent a lot of time in French multinational companies , and what is inescapable is the stranglehold that English already has on the world of business here .
French executives draft reports , send e-mails , converse with their international colleagues - and increasingly even amongst themselves - in English .
It is of course a kind of bastardised , runty form of business - speak full of words like " drivers " and " deliverables " and " outcomes " to be " valorised " , but is nonetheless quite definitely not French .
New language
This brings me to Jean - Paul Nerriere .
Monsieur Nerriere is a retired French businessman who one day in the course of his work made a fascinating observation .
In a meeting with colleagues from around the world , including an Englishman , a Korean and a Brazilian , he noticed that he and the other non-native English speakers were communicating in a form of English that was completely comprehensible to them , but which left the Englishman nonplussed .
He , Jean - Paul Nerriere , could talk to the Korean and the Brazilian in this neo-language , and they could understand each other perfectly .
But the Englishman was left out because his language was too subtle , too full of meaning that could not be grasped by the others .
In other words , Monsieur Nerriere concluded , a new form of English is developing around the world , used by people for whom it is their second language .
It may not be the most beautiful of tongues , but in this day and age he says it is indispensible .
He calls the language Globish and urges everyone - above all the French - to learn it tout de suite .
In his book Do n't Speak English , Parlez Globish , Monsieur Nerriere sets out the rules .
Yasser Arafat , an ' excellent exponent ' of ' Globish ' Globish has only 1,500 words and users must avoid humour , metaphor , abbreviation and anything else that can cause cross-cultural confusion .
They must speak slowly and in short sentences .
Funnily enough , he holds up the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as an excellent exponent .
Many in France consider Monsieur Nerriere a traitor for promoting the dreaded Anglais , but he insists he is not .
He says the French have to recognise that the language war is lost .
" We 're just urinating on the ashes of the fire , " he says .
We should look on Globish not as a triumphant cultural vehicle for les Anglo - Saxons , but as a tool , he says : essential but purely utilitarian .
For lovers of English there is another consideration , only half - serious I admit .
But what if this were all a devious Gallic plot ?
After all , if Globish really does take over the planet with its stunted business - speak , its bland insignificance , its cultureless access - for - all availability , then where does that leave the real English ?
Will the language of Shakespeare suffer by association , leaving the field open one day for the resurgence of the other great tongues of the world ?
Like French ?

A couple of years ago I wrote and released a Ruby on Rails plugin called loads_from_amazon .
It made it relatively simple to populate a model with data based on an amazon search , and was very helpful in the project I was then working on .
That project ended and I ’ve not had time to maintain the plugin since .
It was based on a clunky amazon ECS library and I kept meaning to rewrite it to sit on something more up to date , like amazon - ecs , but the time never materialised .
Today I stumbled upon acts_as_amazon_product which looks like it does everything my plugin did , and more .
If you ’re looking for that functionality , it seems like that ’s the place to go .

My unwinking , analytical gaze of efficiency now turns to the toilet .
Unfortunately , the design of the modern Western toilet is highly inefficient , in fact , it is so inefficient that it is actually harming our health .
The modern toilet has only been around for about 150 years — the “ porcelain throne ” was created to “ give dignity ” to the water closet , rather than considering human physiology .
There are three fundamental problems with the Western toilet :
It ’s designed to be used in the sitting position , and this is an ineffectual position for evacuating the bowels
The use of toilet paper is an ineffectual way to clean one ’s posterior Defecating in fresh water , and flushing the feces away for treatment does n’t make sense
Let ’s examine these fundamental problems :
Squat Toilets
Squatting is the natural position for elimination — it makes the process easier and more complete .
Two thirds of the human race squat to answer the call of nature .
According to Jonathan Isbit , author of Nature Knows Best : The Health Benefits of the Natural Squatting Position , squatting prevents “ fecal stagnation ” which is a prime factor in colon cancer , appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease ( more details here ) .
Virtually every physician and physiologist who has ever troubled to write on the subject agrees that the squatting position is the optimal position for elimination ( for a survey of the research see The Bathroom by Alexander Kira ) .
For example , F. A. Hornibrook , author of the Culture of the Abdomen , says that unfortunately “ constipation has become a contentment in Western countries ” .
Squat toilets are also easier to clean , because they are simpler and there ’s not as many surfaces to clean .
Blue Earth Ceramics is the only manufacturer of squat toilets in the U.S .
Jonathan Isbit sells a device called Nature ’s Platform that allows you to squat on a conventional toilet .
His description is as follows : “ It has a five - degree slope so that you do n’t have to balance on the balls of your feet .
It folds up in 3 seconds so other family members are not inconvenienced .
It is lightweight , but still strong and stable enough to hold a 300 - pound man or woman . ”
Bidets
Toilet paper an ineffectual way of cleaning one ’s posterior .
Not to get too graphic — but it just smears more than cleans .
Using water for cleaning is much more effective , and it has a therapeutic effect on damaged skin ( it ’s gentle on rashes or hemorrhoids ) .
The use of toilet paper also requires enormous resources .
We use 36.5 billions rolls of toilet paper in the U.S. each year , this represents at least 15 million trees pulped .
This also involves 473,587,500,000 gallons of water to produce the paper and 253,000 tons of chlorine for bleaching purposes .
The manufacturing process requires about 17.3 terawatts of electricity annually .
Also , there is the energy and materials involved in packaging and transporting the toilet paper to households across the country .
Toilet paper also constitutes a significant load on the city sewer systems , and water treatment plants .
It is also often responsible for clogged pipes .
In septic systems , the elimination of toilet paper would mean the septic tank would need to be emptied much less often .
Basically , the huge industry of producing toilet paper could be eliminated through the use of bidets .
Instead of using toilet paper , a bidet cleans your posterior using a jet of water .
Some bidets also provide an air - drying mechanism .
In Japan , high - tech bidets called Washlets are now the most popular electronic equipment being sold – 60 % of households have them installed .
In Venezuela they are found in approximately 90 % of households .
Inexpensive bidets are available –you can find a $ 65 bidet seat that attaches to your toilet .
This model uses no electricity or hot water .
After using a bidet , most people find cold water is fine , and not particularly shocking to one ’s rear .
Occasionally , a few sheets of paper are needed to dry oneself .
Many people say that even a bidet is unnecessary , the say a garden type pump sprayer works best .
Indeed , this method of washing is common in Asia .
You can also find simple travel bidets for under $ 20 .
This book is a good source of information on bidets : Everything There Is To Know , From The First and Only Book On The Bidet .
The book discusses the different models of bidets , the health aspects and ecological benefits .
Waterless Composting Toilets
The sewer systems we use today are entirely ineffectual and unnecessary .
The primary flaw in our design is that we use fresh water to dispose of feces .
This is perhaps the most ineffectual thing to do with human manure — it pollutes fresh water , and it requires municipalities to maintain extremely costly sewage treatment infrastructures .
Even after treatment , sewage can still wreck havoc on rivers and groundwater .
The most effective and straightforward thing to do with sewage is to compost it ( or use it to produce fuel via biogas ) .
It ’s a valuable resource .
I ’ve written about the benefits of composting toilets and buildings that are completely sewer - free .
See also the Composting Toilet Systems Book and Humanure Handbook for more information .

During the current economic downturn , finally some positive employment news is coming out of Sweden : Haxriket i Norden , a company based in Ahus , is looking to hire 20 witches to staff its phones and internet website .
The company specialises in fortunes , predictions and other advice at a price of just USD 2.45 per minute .
The Local newspaper reports that qualified candidates for the position must be experienced in “ contact with the other side , runes , tarots , crystals , herbs , rituals , exorcism , meditation , personal coaching , and more . ”
Interested witches must also have a fixed telephone line and Internet connection , but can enjoy the advantages of working from home .
Haxriket ’s massive hiring wave is the result of an internal shakeup in the company in which several formerly - employed witches had to be terminated for violating telemarketing ethics that were put into place in 1994 by Sweden ’s Trade Ethical Council for Telemarketing .
What they did was not mentioned .
Qinna Blomgren , who claims to title of “ top witch ” and part - owner of Haxriket , told The Local , “ We ’ve really cleaned house .
In order to work with us you do n’t only need to have certain skills , but you also have to be serious and prepared to continually develop .
We have a responsibility to our customers , and therefore our witches go through an employment exam so that we can see that they really can do what they say they can . ”
Local authorities do n’t mind Haxriket ’s business at all .
“ When it comes to the type of activities described in the announcement , with cards , and crystal and the like , it has a lot to do with what each individual believes , and that is n’t something about which we can have an opinion , ” Arbetsformedlingen ’s Britt - Marie Grahn told the paper .
There ’s a bunch of buzz lately in tech and marketing circles with an ever - increasing disdain for self - imposed titles .
The one which stands out in the marketing niche is some incantation of “ social media ( or new media ) consultant ( or expert or specialist ) . ”
Mix and match as you please .
As an aside , there is a backlash across the web with an ever - increasing disdain for the word entrepreneur as literally everyone who has created some sort of .com is slapping the title on themselves .
Literally throngs of individuals ( and even agencies ) are dubbing themselves with impressing - sounding titles and claims without evidence to prove they ’ve had success doing much of anything .
But is this any different than how the snake - oil types trotted themselves around in previous years in whatever the hot industry of the day was ?
Not really – there have always been the types of people who prey upon those with a lack of knowledge .
On the plus side , the web makes it simple to see who is full of hot air and who actually knows how to produce successful , tangible results in the social space .
Here ’s what matters and what is meaningless :
What matters :
Strong Google PageRank of their website / blog ( not easily faked – look for 4 - 5 minimum ) .
Some say it is the ultimate measure of online influence .
This matters , if they ca n’t create a positive reputation for themselves , can they really help you ?
Number of RSS subscribers to their blog ( or a client blog they helped build ) through Feedburner ( also not easily faked , takes great effort to acquire ) .
Again , if someone does n’t have experience building something themselves , how can they possibly help you ?
Consistent , intelligent comments and interactions on their blog / in the social web
Client case studies / success stories showing tangible results from their online campaigns ( links / traffic driven / responses / PR/sales , etc. ) .
from their online campaigns ( links / traffic driven / responses / PR/sales , etc. ) .
Placements / quotes / case studies in trade media
Links from industry - leading blogs
Their clients / their work is being talked about on popular blogs
Lots of information and positive reactions available on them through a Google blog search / Technorati search / FriendFeed search / Twitter search .
Past client testimonials from legitimate online businesses
Referrals from other marketing agencies
This one is a bit nebulous but I ’ll say it anyway : true web “ street savvy ” ( Have they made something that hit page 1 of Digg ?
Shared highly on StumbleUpon ?
Do they actually have people on staff who are bloggers / social media power users / message board gurus ? )
Creativity and knowledge behind building marketing initiatives / web apps that spread organically
Understanding how SEO , online marketing , PR , etc. all come together
What is meaningless / worrisome :
Number of followers on Twitter , number of friends on Facebook / MySpace , etc. ( can be achieved through spam tactics )
Big / instant promises , self - imposed titles without any social proofing
Excessive use of jargon with no background / clarification supplemented
Low score in SEO tools like Website Grader
Pop - up subscriptions on their page
Big success with traditional advertising / PR / Marketing is n’t necessarily an indicator of web - based results
Not able to show you samples of successful campaigns
Their blog or website is n’t organized , clean and usable
Unwillingness to allow you to speak with previous clients
No previous clients
Suggests a paid blogging campaign
Gushingly positive press releases about themselves ( seen this tactic recently by some “ expert ” blatantly hyping the fact they had a high number of Twitter / Facebook friends – not sure anyone is gullible enough to fall for this , but it was actually quite a pathetic tactic . )
Links from spam blogs or to spam sites
They keep a blog but receive no comments / no subscribers / no traffic
The social web is not a new concept , and many people have been using it daily from the IRC days and the start of message boards / forums into the present incantation of what we have come to call social media .
You can and should easily be able to find and work with people that will lead you down the right path .
There ’s no rush — take your time and properly vet any individual or agency that you ’re thinking of hiring , as you should with any type of business partner .
Even feel free to ask someone if you ’re not sure , there are plenty of helpful individuals who are willing to answer your questions to connect you with the right people .
Dealing with an unscrupulous or well meaning but inexperienced person or agency can potentially harm your brand on the web for years to come , hurt your positioning in Google , and destroy your chances of future success in the social web .
Be meticulous and do your homework , as you would in any other area of business .
Titles , jargon , pitches and bullet points on a website are as meaningless as ever and should be treated so .
They are necessary but empty .
Proof , case studies , referrals , experience and tangible evidence of success are what matter .

Larison ponders the phenomenon :
Everyone who is voting Obama to punish the GOP thinks that there is some small chance that the GOP might change its ways .
The diversity of views among Obamacons reflects how many different future directions are expected , guaranteeing that many will be disappointed , but it also reflects how badly the GOP has failed on multiple fronts that it is simultaneously losing so many prominent and obscure Catholic pro-lifers , libertarians , foreign policy realists , moderates and small - government conservatives , among others , to a Democratic nominee who genuinely is the most liberal of any they have had since 1972 .
Under normal circumstances , a vote for Obama ought to be unthinkable for almost all of the people on the right who have endorsed him , but the GOP has failed so badly that it has made the unthinkable mundane and ordinary .
It ’s reaching a point where the report of another Obamacon endorsement is no more remarkable than when the leaves start falling in autumn .
Far more important in the aftermath than coming up with new and amusing ways to mock the Obama endorsers is an effort to understand and remedy the profound failures that made this phenomenon possible before a major realignment does occur .

Another extrasolar planet has been found , this time a Neptune - sized world orbiting a star 120 light - years from Earth .
It was found by a network of automated telescopes set up to search for other worlds , known as “ HATNet , ” which is operated by the Center in Arizona and Hawaii .
This latest extrasolar world , called HAT - P - 11b is the 11th planet found by HATNet , and the smallest yet discovered by any projects that are searching using the transit method .
As a planet passes directly in front of ( transits ) its parent star , it blocks a small amount of light coming from the star .
In this case , the planet blocked about 0.4 percent of the star ’s light .
This discovery puts the current extrasolar count at 335 .
Transit detections are particularly useful because the amount of dimming tells the astronomers how big the planet must be .
By combining transit data with measurements of the star ’s “ wobble ” ( radial velocity ) made by large telescopes like Keck , astronomers can determine the mass of the planet .
While Neptune has a diameter 3.8 times that of Earth and a mass 17 times Earth ’s , HAT - P - 11b is 4.7 times the size of Earth and has 25 Earth masses .
A number of Neptune - like planets have been found recently by radial velocity searches , but HAT - P - 11b is only the second Neptune - like planet found to transit its star , thus permitting the precise determination of its mass and radius .
The new - found world orbits very close to its star , revolving once every 4.88 days .
As a result , it is baked to a temperature of around 1100 degrees F .
The star itself is about three - fourths the size of our Sun and somewhat cooler .
There are signs of a second planet in the HAT - P - 11 system , but more radial velocity data are needed to confirm that and determine its properties .
Another team has located one other transiting super - Neptune , known as GJ436 b , around a different star .
It was discovered by a radial velocity search and later found to have transits .
“ Having two such objects to compare helps astronomers to test theories of planetary structure and formation , ” said Harvard astronomer Gaspar Bakos , who led the discovery team .
HAT - P- 11 is in the constellation Cygnus , which puts in it the field of view of NASA ’s upcoming Kepler spacecraft .
Kepler will search for extrasolar planets using the same transit technique pioneered by ground - based telescopes .
This mission potentially could detect the first Earth - like world orbiting a distant star .

Lawyer : Justice Department could drop Siegelman conviction John Byrne
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Justice Department reopens investigation into juror misconduct The Justice Department has reopened an investigation into potential juror misconduct in the bribery conviction of former Democratic Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , whose case has widely been panned as an example of political prosecution .
The revealed was first reported by Glynn Wilson , on the Locust Forks Journal .
The filing is available at his site .
" In light of recent information from a new whistle - blower in the Bush Justice Departments political prosecutions still under investigation by Congress , including the case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , the federal court in Montgomery has re-opened the investigation into juror misconduct , according to a document just filed with the appeals court in Atlanta , " Wilson wrote .
The Justice Department 's appellate response indicated that the investigation was reopened after concerns were raised about the fairness of the trial .
 Out of an abundance of caution , the Department of Justice recently reopened the investigation into this matter in response to concerns raised about the completeness of the investigation ,  Justice Department officials , led by Acting US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama Louis Franklin , Sr. wrote in a footnote on page 10 .
One of Siegelman 's attorneys , Vince Kilborn , told Wilson the information was " significant " and that the three - judge panel -- all Republicans -- considering Siegelman 's appeal could drop the case against him at a hearing next Tuesday , Dec. 9 .
 They could very well ,  Kilborn said .
 If it s unanimous it will come down quicker .
If theres a dissent , it takes longer . 
He said theres no way to guess , but the public should be able to gather some information about what the judges are thinking by the questions they ask .
Kilborn told Wilson " he was not concerned about the all - Republican three - judge panel selected to hear the oral arguments and decide the appeal , " and that he expected direct questions in the brief session scheduled next week .
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna was among the first to provide a detailed history and exposition of the Siegelman case , and the first media outlet to interview Siegelman 's daughter , Dana .
Siegelman was convicted of bribery charges in relation to a donation from the founder of HealthSouth in 2006 .
He was freed on bail on appeal earlier this year .
Wilson 's detailed report is available here .
In the wake of the latest salmonella outbreak in peanut butter products , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) is calling on President Obama and Congress to “ bring the food safety program at the Dept. of Health and Human Services into the 21st century . ”
[ social_buttons ]
“ This latest outbreak proves again that FDA is woefully inadequate to the task of protecting American consumers from unsafe food .
It presently inspects low risk peanut butter plants rarely , or not at all , leaving the job to state inspection agencies . ”
– CSPI
The organization stated that because of the long shelf life on the peanut products , the current outbreak that has already sickened hundreds of people has the potential to sicken and kill many more if the FDA does not act effectively to remove the products from the food system .
The peanut butter recall affected products made with peanut paste and peanut butter made by the Peanut Corporation of America , and that ingredient is found in ice cream , cookies , cakes , and other baked goods .
CSPI also believes that because there is no safety expert in charge of both the policies and the enforcement of inspections , the needed changes will not happen .
One bill sponsored by Representative Rosa DeLauro would create a new Food Safety Administration at HHS , bringing the different elements together and putting an expert in charge .
“ President Obama promised a “ government that works . ”
When it comes to food safety , fixing FDA ’s food safety program is an example of a “ shovel ready ” regulatory reform that could be done quickly and that would bring real benefits to American consumers . ”

In addition to the benefits detailed in previous articles in this series , the move to 64 - bits in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard will enhance Apple 's efforts to secure its operating system .
Over the last eight years , Mac OS X has enjoyed a tranquil existence in stark contrast to the high profile security threats and attacks suffered by mainstream Windows users .
Microsoft 's monopoly over the PC world has long meant that anyone interested in creating extensive , easily spread damage through software exploits would focus their efforts on Windows .
Microsoft's Security Efforts
Since Microsoft 's OS was originally developed primarily for business computers sitting together in a trusted LAN environment , it was not only easy to exploit software flaws in the system but also trivial to find ways to fool the system into forwarding viral payloads to other systems .
Once exposed to the open Internet , Windows did n't stand a chance .
Reinforcing the Windows PC to survive the onslaught of malicious exploits saturating the Internet would be a complex and expensive task , one Microsoft did not immediately recognize as a priority .
However , once Windows started gaining a reputation for lax security after falling victim to a series of famous exploits in the late 90s and into the beginning of the current decade , Microsoft began reevaluating its priorities .
Longhorn , which was intended as a close successor to 2001 's Windows XP , ended up being pushed off as the company was forced to initiate a major new effort to solve the outstanding security issues in XP .
Toward the end of 2004 , Microsoft shipped XP SP2 , the product of extensive work within the company using code scanning , auditing , testing , and fundamental feature and architectural reviews , in addition to external source code auditing and penetration testing .
In addition to Microsoft 's efforts to identify and patch flaws and vulnerabilities in its software , the company also initiated measures to make unknown vulnerabilities more difficult for attackers to find and exploit .
This included having a firewall installed by default and requiring that RPC servers authenticate communications , so that remote attackers would need to present valid credentials before ever being given access to anything that might be attacked to allow entry .
Microsoft is now very public about its security efforts , and takes every opportunity to tout its recent security work as a defense against any criticisms of its past mistakes in taking a less than serious approach to security .
Apple 's Security Efforts
In contrast , Apple has never experienced a security crisis related to Mac OS X . Virus writers have nearly zero financial motivation to create new attacks from scratch that target Macs .
The theoretical potential of " hackers " attacking Macs for fame and glory , as imagined by pundits with a bias against Apple , has simply failed to materialize over the last half decade , despite their insistence that the threat is so alarmingly close as to be palpable .
Even in cases where exploits have been found or artificial attack installers have been designed , viral outbreaks have n't occurred because installations of Macs are n't ubiquitous enough to sustain the critical mass required for an acute network infection .
Add in the fact that Mac OS X was n't dragging along the same legacy of promiscuous LAN origins as Windows , and you have a series of factors that combined to give Apple a pass from focusing on security retrofitting in crisis mode .
Instead , Apple has had the luxury of planning Mac OS X releases to roll out security features incrementally .
As with its other plans for feature enhancements in Mac OS X , the company has remained tight lipped on many of its security efforts .
There 's evidence the company has performed code security scanning , as simple buffer overflows have been cleaned out of many system libraries , according to a security expert familiar with the history of the OS .
Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger eliminated most of the easy local buffer overflows , while 10.5 Leopard has expanded upon that to remove many of them from remotely accessible network services .
Leopard also incorporates stack protection , library randomization , a non-executable
stack , and sandboxing for some system processes .
These features are incremental improvements in security that will be expanded upon in Snow Leopard .
Mac OS X's sandboxing is provided by the Mandatory Access Control ( MAC ) framework , an implementation of the MAC framework from TrustedBSD .
Sandboxing imposes permission controls on processes that can , for example , limit them from connecting to a network , from writing any files , or from writing any files outside of specific directories .
While sandboxing does n't prevent a process from being attacked , it does limit the amount of damage malicious attackers can cause once they gain control of a sandboxed application .
On the iPhone , sandboxing is used to restrict each application from accessing anything outside of its own data files and preferences .
Even apps that have access to the public networking APIs are restricted from direct access to the communications or networking hardware .
On page 2 of 2 : Security in 64 - bit Snow Leopard ; and Security before it 's needed .
Security in 64 - bit Snow Leopard
In addition to expanded sandboxing , the move to 64 - bit computing will provide a series of other benefits related to security .
Apple 's 64 - bit binaries set all writable memory as non-executable by default , including thread stacks , the heap , and any other writable data segments .
This is already present to an extent in today 's Leopard Server , which runs some services , such as the Apache web server , as 64 - bit processes .
Using the vmmap command reveals that no memory allocated by these 64 - bit apps is both writable and executable .
On 32 - bit Intel systems , while no memory is marked as both writable and executable , the legacy x86 processor design does not enforce the permissions bits , but 64 - bit CPUs do .
This feature prevents exploits from injecting malicious executable code into memory and tricking the app to run it as it if were its own instructions .
Another security weakness in the x86 architecture solved in the move to 64 - bits is the use of registers for function call arguments .
This makes exploits using return - into - libc techniques much more difficult .
On 32 - bit x86 , function arguments are passed directly on the stack , so when an attacker has overwritten the stack segment , they can completely control the arguments passed to a function that they cause the compromised program to " return into , " according to a security researcher .
The move to 64 - bits also greatly enhances the Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ) techniques used to secure Leopard .
Currently , 32 - bit binaries are restricted to a relatively small 4GB allocation , making it easier to predict useful addresses for malicious code to target .
Additionally , Leopard keeps dyld , Mac OS X's dynamic loader ( responsible for loading all of the frameworks , dylibs , and bundles needed by a process ) in the same known location , making it relatively trivial to bypass the existing ASLR .
With the much larger address space available to 64 - bit binaries , Snow Leopard 's ASLR will make it possible to hide the location of loaded code like a needle in a haystack , thwarting the efforts of malicious attackers to maintain predictable targets for controlling the code and data loaded into memory .
Without knowing what addresses to target , the " vast majority of these exploits will fail , " the security expert explained .
Security before it 's needed
Apple 's sheltered existence in isolation from regular malware attacks puts it in the enviable position of being able to focus on building security features proactively , rather than in response to ongoing , embarrassing exploits .
For Mac users , that means the window of opportunity for malware exploits is being closed off before circumstances change enough for the platform to become a viable target .
The company is being relatively quiet about its security efforts because it does n't want to be directly compared against Microsoft , which is ahead in some security areas , at least in its latest software releases .
However , Microsoft 's installed base of the billion PCs running Windows worldwide is not protected by advancements in the latest releases because relatively few users have upgraded to the latest releases .
That give Apple a strong position in maintaining its security halo because the Windows PC world is so rife with low hanging fruit for malicious attackers that the Mac platform remains an undesirable target .
That leaves disgruntled pundits with nothing to complain about outside of misleading vulnerability counts .
So while PC users contend with the constant din of security issues and performance sapping layers of security software , Mac users are free to just enjoy the silence .

Metal : Super - fast Endpoints within your Rails Apps
Yesterday , David Heinemeier Hansson officially announced Rails Metal - a new feature of edge Rails ( and so Rails 2.3 ) .
Metal uses edge Rails ' use of Rack to present a more barebones interface to incoming requests .
Instead of routing every request through the full Rails stack , Metal lets you circumvent it to respond to certain requests in a fast , lightweight fashion - ideal for polling requests , say .
DHH 's summary is okay , but Jesse Newland 's tour of Rails Metal really makes the concept click .
He puts together a basic " Hello world " method in a regular Rails controller and one in Rails Metal .
The Rails controller performs at 45 requests per second but the Rails Metal equivalent returns 1175 requests per second !
David Heinemeier Hansson followed up with a more realistic benchmark where the Rails controller served 800 requests per second and Metal 3000 per second , though there 's a little more to it as he explains ..
An interesting side effect of Rails Metal is that you can now run Sinatra applications ( and , potentially , those of similar micro frameworks ) at full speed " within " a Rails application .
Jesse gives an example of this , but the commit of interest is here .
If Sinatra is of interest to you , check out Sinatra : 29 Links and Resources for a Quicker , Easier Way to Build Webapps over at Ruby Inside .
Support from : 1st Easy offers UK Rails hosting ( dedicated and shared ) running Phusion Passenger ( mod_rails ) and LAMP stack .

BBC News security correspondent , northern Greenland
The United States abandoned a nuclear weapon beneath the ice in northern Greenland following a crash in 1968 , a BBC investigation has found .
Its unique vantage point - perched at the top of the world - has meant that Thule Air Base has been of immense strategic importance to the US since it was built in the early 1950s , allowing a radar to scan the skies for missiles coming over the North Pole .
The Pentagon believed the Soviet Union would take out the base as a prelude to a nuclear strike against the US and so in 1960 began flying " Chrome Dome " missions .
Nuclear - armed B52 bombers continuously circled over Thule - and could head straight to Moscow if they witnessed its destruction .
Greenland is a self - governing province of Denmark but the carrying of nuclear weapons over Danish territory was kept secret .
' Darker story '
But on 21 January 1968 , one of those missions went wrong .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
We reunited two of the pilots , John Haug and Joe D'Amario , 40 years on to tell the story of how their plane ended up crashing on the ice a few miles out from the base .
In the aftermath , military personnel , local Greenlanders and Danish workers rushed to the scene to help .
Eventually , a remarkable operation would unfold over the coming months to recover thousands of tiny pieces of debris scattered across the frozen bay , as well as to collect some 500 million gallons of ice , some of it containing radioactive debris .
A declassified US government video , obtained by the BBC , documents the clear - up and gives some ideas of the scale of the operation .
It would be very difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we could n't find them
William H Chamber
Former US nuclear arms designer
The high explosives surrounding the four nuclear weapons had detonated but without setting off the actual nuclear devices , which had not been armed by the crew .
The Pentagon maintained that all four weapons had been " destroyed " .
This may be technically true , since the bombs were no longer complete , but declassified documents obtained by the BBC under the US Freedom of Information Act , parts of which remain classified , reveal a much darker story , which has been confirmed by individuals involved in the clear - up and those who have had access to details since .
The documents make clear that within weeks of the incident , investigators piecing together the fragments realised that only three of the weapons could be accounted for .
Even by the end of January , one document talks of a blackened section of ice which had re-frozen with shroud lines from a weapon parachute .
" Speculate something melted through ice such as burning primary or secondary , " the document reads , the primary or secondary referring to parts of the weapon .
By April , a decision had been taken to send a Star III submarine to the base to look for the lost bomb , which had the serial number 78252 .
( A similar submarine search off the coast of Spain two years earlier had led to another weapon being recovered . )
But the real purpose of this search was deliberately hidden from Danish officials .
One document from July reads : " Fact that this operation includes search for object or missing weapon part is to be treated as confidential NOFORN " , the last word meaning not to be disclosed to any foreign country .
" For discussion with Danes , this operation should be referred to as a survey repeat survey of bottom under impact point , " it continued .
' Failure '
But the underwater search was beset by technical problems and , as winter encroached and the ice began to freeze over , the documents recount something approaching panic setting in .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
As well as the fact they contained uranium and plutonium , the abandoned weapons parts were highly sensitive because of the way in which the design , shape and amount of uranium revealed classified elements of nuclear warhead design .
But eventually , the search was abandoned .
Diagrams and notes included in the declassified documents make clear it was not possible to search the entire area where debris from the crash had spread .
We tracked down a number of officials who were involved in dealing with the aftermath of the incident .
One was William H Chambers , a former nuclear weapons designer at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory who once ran a team dealing with accidents , including the Thule crash .
" There was disappointment in what you might call a failure to return all of the components , " he told the BBC , explaining the logic behind the decision to abandon the search .
The US was flying so - called Chrome Dome missions over Greenland " It would be very difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we could n't find them . "
The view was that no - one else would be able covertly to acquire the sensitive pieces and that the radioactive material would dissolve in such a large body of water , making it harmless .
Other officials who have seen classified files on the accident confirmed the abandonment of a weapon .
The Pentagon declined to comment on the investigation , referring back to previous official studies of the incident .
But the crash , clear - up and mystery of the lost bomb have continued to haunt those involved at the time - and those who live in the region now - with continued concerns over the environmental and health impact of the events of that day in 1968 .

My little foray into Austrian economics is now taking me down a rabbit hole that I really should climb out of ( I ’ve got work to do ) but is just too fascinating to leave .
Paleolibertarian , Rothbardian , Misesian Austrian economist Lew Rockwell responded to my post :
The author hilariously sees Austrian economics as divided into two parts : the nice one , entirely in the super - wealthy Koch Brothers ambit , and the mean one , in mine !
A little background : when I started the Mises Institute ( an organization unmentioned by Time ) 26 years ago , the head of the Koch family foundation angrily pledged to destroy me if I went ahead .
“ We have worked too hard to rid Austrian economics of Mises , ” he said .
Hayek , he claimed , was their man , though , of course , he was far better than that , and a good supporter of the Institute .
But the real problem turned out to be Murray Rothbard .
It was the greatest of the Misesians and the founder of modern libertarianism whom the Koch World Empire longed to smash , and still does .
Murray , founder of Cato , was the one man in the ambit to say no when the Kochs decided to jettison Mises for reasons of DC preferment .
Otherwise , they felt , it would be harder to curry favor with the Fed and the Republican party .
Hayek ’s views on central banking , gold , conservatism , and competitive currencies are no more DC - friendly than Mises ’s and Rothbard ’s , but they are ignored , and just his name invoked .
Over more than 40 years , I have had the honor to work with such giants of economics and liberty as Mises , Hazlitt , Hayek , and especially Rothbard .
Indeed , Hazlitt told me that my “ greatest achievement was to give Rothbard a platform , ” and I think I have also helped support the Menger , Bohm - Bawerk , Mises , Hayek , Rothbard tradition , and some of the many important scholars working in it .
That ’s why such Koch mouthpieces as Reason will say anything on orders .
The Kochs also oppose the great Austro - libertarian statesman , Ron Paul , for his refusal to endorse the Fed when he was head of one of their organizations .
None of us , however , is backing down .
Among young people , in fact , we ’ve already won .
Mises held that ideas can beat back the state .
Ideas can also triumph over billions of oil dollars , and the establishment ’s antique media .
I had no idea what he was talking about regarding the billionaire Koch brothers , but a little Googling soon taught me that such salonfähig libertarian establishments as the Cato Institute , Reason magazine , and the George Mason University economics department are all mere tentacles of the “ Kochtopus . ”
And Tyler Cowen , who got me started on this whole adventure , is seen by some Austrian true believers of the Mises school as perhaps the Kochtopus ’s most monstrous creation .
To quote ( extensively ) from David Gordon ’s history of the Kochtopus vs. Rothbard struggle on LewRockwell.com :
Walter Grinder , working from the Koch - dominated Institute for Humane Studies , promised a “ Rothbardianism with manners . ”
In his view , Rothbard had been too acerbic ; through a policy of suaviter in modo , Austrian views could better gain access to the mainstream .
…
Grinder and others in leadership posts at IHS concluded that they should concentrate on elite universities such as Harvard , Yale , and Princeton in the United States , and Oxford and Cambridge in England .
If students could be recruited from these universities or , if already sympathetic , admitted to their programs , success was at hand .
Grinder placed particular emphasis on Tyler Cowen , a brilliant student who had been interested in Austrian economics since his high school days .
Cowen enrolled in an Austrian economics program at Rutgers , where he impressed both Joe Salerno and Richard Fink with his extraordinary erudition .
When Fink moved to George Mason University , Cowen moved with him ; and he completed his undergraduate degree there in 1983 .
Grinder considered him the next Hayek , the hope of Austrian economics .
In accord with the elite universities policy , Cowen went to Harvard for his graduate degree .
There he came under the influence of Thomas Schelling and gave up his belief in Austrian economics .
After he finished his PhD in 1987 , Cowen was for a time a professor at the University of California at Irvine , and he used to visit me sometimes in Los Angeles .
I was impressed with his remarkable intelligence and enjoyed talking with him .
But I remember how surprised I was one day when he told me that he did not regard Ludwig von Mises very highly .
Here he fitted in all - too - well with another policy of Richard Fink and the Kochtopus leadership .
They regarded Mises as a controversial figure : his “ extremism ” would interfere with the mission of arousing mainstream interest in the Austrian School .
Accordingly , Hayek should be stressed and Mises downplayed .
…
Cowen eventually returned to George Mason University as a Professor of Economics .
He is said to be the dominant figure in the department .
Because of his close friendship with Richard Fink , who left academic work to become a major executive with Koch Industries and the principal disburser of Koch Foundation funding , Cowen exerts a major influence on grants to his department .
Although he is largely favorable to the free market and believes that the Austrian school has contributed insights , Cowen remains a strong critic of Austrian and Rothbardian views .
He has published a book that sharply attacks Austrian business cycle theory , Risk and Business Cycles : New and Old Austrian Perspectives ( Routledge , 1997 ) ; and in an article written with Fink , “ Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs : The Evenly Rotating Economy of Mises and Rothbard ” ( American Economic Review , Volume 75 , Number 4 , September 1985 ) , he argued that a key feature in the economic theory of Mises and Rothbard , the evenly rotating economy , is fundamentally flawed .
It was ironic that the hope of Austrian economics , according to Grinder , and the prime ornament of his stress on elite universities , wrote an article for the most prestigious economic journal in the United States critical of the theory Grinder wished to propagate .
Cowen has also criticized libertarian anarchism , another fundamental plank in Rothbard ’s thought .
He has defended government funding of the space program and limited government subsidies for the arts .
Now I get why citing Tyler Cowen on matters Austrian so raises the hackles of some Austrian true believers .
He ’s an apostate !
Notice how Gordon makes no attempt to explain what ’s wrong with Cowen ’s critique of Misesian and Rothbardian ideas–it ’s enough just to point out that he has strayed from orthodoxy .
Theirs is the true path , and all others are in error .
As William F. Buckley wrote in his somewhat nasty obituary of Rothbard :
In Murray ’s case , much of what drove him was a contrarian spirit , the deranging scrupulosity that caused him to disdain such as Herbert Hoover , Ronald Reagan , Milton Friedman , and –yes–Newt Gingrich , while huffing and puffing in the little cloister whose walls he labored so strenuously to contract , leaving him , in the end , not as the father of a swelling movement that “ rous[ed ] the masses from their slumber , ” as he once stated his ambition , but with about as many disciples as David Koresh had in his little redoubt in Waco .
That bit about the number of disciples is not as true now as it was in 1995 , when Buckley wrote it .
Thank ( or blame ) the Internet for that .
I can attest from personal experience that a link from LewRockwell.com , while not nearly the traffic driver that a headline on the TIME.com or CNNMoney.com homepages can be , brings more readers than a link from , say , Andrew Sullivan .
Still , just as the great Austro - libertarian statesman Ron Paul ’s support in this year ’s presidential campaign turned out to be a mile deep and just a few inches wide , faithful - to - the - Mises - line Austrian economics will almost surely remain a pursuit for a small if enthusiastic minority .
Because that ’s the way the small if enthusiastic minority seems to prefer it .
The Government is using the threat of a wholesale nationalisation of banks in an attempt to force institutions to lend billions to small companies struggling to survive as Britain slips into recession .
Downing Street yesterday made plain its fury over high street banks which refuse to use the massive injection of taxpayers ' money they have received to come to the rescue of businesses hit by the credit crisis .
Lenders have also faced criticism over interest rates charged to homeowners and for stepping up repossessions .
Meanwhile , Gordon Brown dismissed suggestions that he should take advantage of his reviving popularity by calling a June general election , insisting he was fully focused on steering Britain out of the downturn , starting with Monday 's pre-Budget report .
It will spell out plans for tax cuts and assistance for the country 's 4.7 million small firms .
The aid will be funded by increases in government borrowing , which is on course to exceed £ 100 bn next year .
Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , will also announce that taxes will have to rise in the medium term to reduce the national debt .
The financial stimulus package is designed to breathe new life into the economy but Mr Darling fears the behaviour of the banks could undermine the moves .
He is expected to announce controlson the interest rates charged on small business loans , as well as measures to stem the rising tide of repossessions .
Ministers are irritated that banks the Treasury bailed out are dragging their feet over passing on the money .
The Treasury took stakes in HBOS , Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland in return for £ 37bn of public funds .
The banks promised to return lending to last year 's levels .
John McFall , the chairman of the Treasury select committee and an ally of Mr Brown and Mr Darling , raised the prospect of state control , saying : " If the banks do not play ball , and will not resume lending , then the demand for full - scale nationalisation may well grow . "
No 10 refused to rule out such a step , regarded by officials as the " nuclear option " .
Mr Brown 's spokesman said : " In these circumstances , of course we have got to look at all the options .
But we want to work constructively with the banks to ensure they fulfil the commitments they have entered into . "
Asked a second time about full nationalisation , he replied : " It would clearly be foolish for anybody to rule out specific options at this stage .
" The Government has made little effort to disguise its frustration at the behaviour of banks towards small businesses and mortgage - payers .
Mr Darling is preparing to use his pre-Budget report to fire a shot across their bows with tough demands on lending .
He is not expected to impose further legal sanctions on banks , such as the appointment of a powerful watchdog to monitor lending rates , but officials want to keep options in reserve if the banks fail to respond .
As figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed a 12 per cent increase in house repossessions in the third quarter , Mr Brown signalled further help was on the way for families at risk of losing their homes .
He acknowledged that Northern Rock , which is already in public hands , was among the worst offenders .
" We have been talking to Northern Rock about its practices and I think you will see some changes ... very soon , " he said .
Mr Brown dismissed suggestions he could call a general election on 4 June , to coincide with European and local elections , if Labour 's recovery in the polls is sustained into next spring .
" My undivided attention is on the economy , I 'm not thinking about anything else , it 's 100 per cent of my attention and you just discount all these stories .
I 'm actually not thinking about anything related to internal politics . "
Angela Knight , the chief executive of the British Bankers ' Association , insisted that lending to small firms was at the same level as last year .
Meanwhile , Honda said that production would halt at its Swindon plant for two months , but none of its 4,800 workers would be laid off .
Belfast Telegraph
This morning , I received an email from someone who called Obama a Muslim .
I 'd guess that hundreds of thousands , even millions of people have forwarded some kind of email , or made some remark in an email about Obama being a Muslim or having been trained in a madrassa .
The truth is that Obama went to school in Indonesia in a non-religious school .
He is not a Muslim , never was one .
He is a Christian .
Here 's my take on who the people who forward such messages are .
First , there are the people who want to believe it and are willing to forward on this kind of message without the most basic fact - checking .
No intelligent pundit or politician or honest , un - bigoted person , including Republicans and right wingers , would EVER forward such a message or make any kind of such statement .
It 's pretty simple when you exclude the intelligent , unbigoted and honest people .
That leaves bigots , liars and morons .
A lot of you who fit the profile of having forwarded one of these emails , or worse , having started one , probably do n't realize you 're a bigot .
Maybe you 're a racist .
Maybe you 're an anti-muslim , maybe both .
Maybe your priest or minister does n't like Obama 's position on abortion and just threw in the Muslim lie to help sell the idea of opposing him and you 've bought that story .
Maybe you 've even forwarded or printed out pictures of Obama that make himlook like a a terrorist .
I 've actualy seen printouts like this at a local take - out snack place .
I look at the guy who displays these and consider him to be the lowest piece of ... life .
Not surprisingly , the same guy also posts blatantly racist pictures that are anti black and anti Latino .
Ironically , his son dates an African American .
Finally , there 's one more group of people who forward the messages .
These are righ wingers and or bigots who are not stupid , but they think the people they forward the message to are .
Or they think the recipients are intolerant bigots .
Either way , they are nasty , ugly people .
It raises an interesting question .
Who is worst , the bigot or the person who panders to bigotry and uses it to promote intolerance and lies to further his cause .
Permission granted to respond to ALL and send this article to groups that have received " Obama is a Muslim " emails .
Do n't let the cretins and haters send this garbage out unanswered .
There are a lot of people on those lists who are offended by the message but do n't know what to say or who do n't want to get in an argument .
But beware , there are nuts out there .
Some of those liars , bigots , morons and panderers will get nasty .
I got the email this morning because some right wing jerk decided to hassle me by putting me on mailing lists .
CHICAGO  From a dismal parking lot on this city ’s South Side , a bus is scheduled to pull out on Monday headed east , packed with people from the neighborhoods where President - elect Barack Obama first cut his teeth as an organizer hoping to make a difference in the world .
The riders on the Fellowship Bus , as they are calling it , are making a bare - bones 1,200 - mile round trip to Washington to be present as Mr. Obama takes the oath of office .
They are leaving without hotel reservations , an agenda of any kind or even much of a chance that they will get close enough to the Capitol to see the main event .
Nor will they get much sleep , as the bus will turn around as soon as the inauguration is over .
But none of that matters much .
“ We just had to be there for him , ” said the Rev. David Bigsby , a Baptist preacher who has a seat on the bus .
“ He was such a blessing to our community and churches . ”

AS LONG as people have looked up at the night sky , they have wondered whether humanity is alone in the universe .
Of places close enough for people to visit , Mars is the only one that anybody seriously thinks might support life .
The recent confirmation of a five - year - old finding that there is methane in the Martian atmosphere has therefore excited the hopes of exobiologists — particularly as the sources of three large plumes of the gas now seem to have been located .
These sources are probably geological but they might , just , prove to be biological .
The possibility of life on Mars is too thrilling for mankind to ignore .
But how should we explore such questions — with men , or machines ?
Since America is the biggest spender in space , its approach will heavily influence the world's .
George Bush 's administration strongly supported manned exploration , but the new administration is likely to have different priorities — and so it should .
Bug -eyed monsters
Michael Griffin , the boss of American 's National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , a physicist and aerospace engineer who supported Mr Bush 's plan to return to the moon and then push on to Mars , has gone .
Mr Obama 's transition team had already been asking difficult questions of NASA , in particular about the cost of scrapping parts of the successor to the ageing and obsolete space shuttles that now form America 's manned space programme .
That successor system is also designed to return humans to the moon by 2020 , as a stepping stone to visiting Mars .
Meanwhile , Mr Obama 's administration is wondering about spending more money on lots of new satellites designed to look down at the Earth , rather than outward into space .
These are sensible priorities .
In space travel , as in politics , domestic policy should usually trump grandiose foreign adventures .
Moreover , cash is short and space travel costly .
Yet it would be a shame if man were to give up exploring celestial bodies , especially if there is a possibility of meeting life forms — even ones as lowly as microbes — as a result .
Luckily , technology means that man can explore both the moon and Mars more fully without going there himself .
Robots are better and cheaper than they have ever been .
They can work tirelessly for years , beaming back data and images , and returning samples to Earth .
They can also be made sterile , which germ - infested humans , who risk spreading disease around the solar system , cannot .
Humanity , some will argue , is driven by a yearning to boldly go to places far beyond its crowded corner of the universe .
If so , private efforts will surely carry people into space ( though whether they should be allowed to , given the risk of contaminating distant ecosystems , is worth considering ) .
In the meantime , Mr Obama 's promise in his inauguration speech to “ restore science to its rightful place ” sounds like good news for the sort of curiosity - driven research that will allow us to find out whether those plumes of gas are signs of life .

AROUND THE WEB
Dr Carr 's nephew , an engineer from Gosforth , Newcastle , said : " We just can not believe it was there .
No -one had any idea what kind of cars he had parked in there .
We knew he had some cars , but we had no idea what they were .
The US regulators have given the go ahead for a biotech company to carry out the world ’s first trial of a treatment using embryonic stem cells , in this case to treat victims of spinal cord injury that leaves them unable to walk .
Although heralded as an early sign of new US president Obama ’s support for embryonic stem cell research , Dr Thomas Okarma , president and CEO of Geron Corp. of Menlo Park , California , the company that will be carrying out the trial , told Associated Press that strictly speaking it was not so in this case , since the next phase of the project would have been eligible for federal funds under Bush .
It was the earlier development phases that had to be done with private funds because of funding restrictions on embryonic stem cell research brought in by Bush in 2001 , said a report in Times Online .
Today ’s ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) allows Geron to give 8 to 10 patients with spinal cord injury a single injection of cells made from embryonic stem cells .
The testing will be done at several medical centres throughout the US and the patients will receive their injections within 2 weeks of their injury ; unfortunately patients whose injuries are older than this are unlikely to benefit from such therapy .
According to a Geron statement , the Phase I trial is designed to establish the safety of the treatment , called GRNOPC1 , in patients with “ complete ” American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) grade A subacute thoracic spinal cord injuries .
Okarma told AP that they will also be looking for the possible return of feeling or movement in the legs .
Animal studies have shown that injected embryonic stem cells can turn into specialist cells that replace damaged sheaths around nerves that have suffered “ demyelination ” and thereby restore their ability to send signals that control muscle and sense feelings .
Embryonic stem cells are like master cells , they can become virtually any cell of the body , which comprises about 200 types of tissue .
There are other kinds of stem cells too , like adult stem cells , but they are more limited in what types of cell they can become and harder to “ coax ” , so embryonic stem cells are considered the “ gold standard ” in stem cell research .
They are however more controversial because harvesting them involves destroying embryos , whereas adult stem cells can be recovered without harming the donor .
If successful , the trial will lead to therapies with the potential to transform the lives of thousands of people who every year become paralysed from the chest down , and for whom few treatments exist .
Experts predict that if successful , the therapy could be in general use within three to five years .
Okarma said in a press statement that :
“ This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics — one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing : the restoration of organ and tissue function by the injection of healthy replacement cells . ”
He said that : “ the ultimate goal is to achieve restoration of spinal cord function ” .
Although the FDA decision is independent of the White House , it is being received as a symbol of a new attitude to embryonic stem cell research and Obama is expected to start lifting funding restrictions next week , said a Times Online report .
Dr Richard Fessler , professor of neurological surgery at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University , said that :
“ The neurosurgical community is very excited by this new approach to treating devastating spinal cord injury . ”
“ Demyelination is central to the pathology of the injury , and its reversal by means of injecting oligodendrocyte progenitor cells would be revolutionary for the field .
If safe and effective , the therapy would provide a viable treatment option for thousands of patients who suffer severe spinal cord injuries each year , ” he added .
Polling figures suggest most Americans are in favour of stem cell research , but it was strong opposition lobbying that persuaded Bush to impose restrictions on federal funding .
Okarma said that the delay caused by the funding restriction meant there “ are people out there who might have benefited , but who now cannot , ” he told the press .

We are in the middle of a very severe recession that 's going to continue through all of 2009 - the worst U.S. recession in the past 50 years .
It 's the bursting of a huge leveraged - up credit bubble .
There 's no going back , and there is no bottom to it .
It was excessive in everything from subprime to prime , from credit cards to student loans , from corporate bonds to muni bonds .
You name it .
And it 's all reversing right now in a very , very massive way .
At this point it 's not just a U.S. recession .
All of the advanced economies are at the beginning of a hard landing .
And emerging markets , beginning with China , are in a severe slowdown .
So we 're having a global recession and it's becoming worse .
Things are going to be awful for everyday people .
U.S. GDP growth is going to be negative through the end of 2009 .
And the recovery in 2010 and 2011 , if there is one , is going to be so weak - with a growth rate of 1 % to 1.5 % - that it 's going to feel like a recession .
I see the unemployment rate peaking at around 9 % by 2010 .
The value of homes has already fallen 25 % .
In my view , home prices are going to fall by another 15 % before bottoming out in 2010 .
For the next 12 months I would stay away from risky assets .
I would stay away from the stock market .
I would stay away from commodities .
I would stay away from credit , both high - yield and high - grade .
I would stay in cash or cashlike instruments such as short - term or longer - term government bonds .
It 's better to stay in things with low returns rather than to lose 50 % of your wealth .
You should preserve capital .
It 'll be hard and challenging enough .
I wish I could be more cheerful , but I was right a year ago , and I think I 'll be right this year too .
Today I learned what many knew last Friday – that Merrill Lynch executives paid out billions in bonuses just before being absorbed into Bank of America , after Merrill ’s $ 15 billion net loss in the fourth quarter and as the economy was deteriorating and the government was spending billions to bail out some of the nation ’s most prominent financial institutions .
President Obama branded Wall Street bankers “ shameful ” yesterday for giving themselves these ridiculous over - payments .
It ’s good to see a commander in chief become angry with the gluttony that has ruled some corners of corporate America .
As literally millions of people in this country are without jobs , these hyenas act as if they ’re at the country club , redecorating their offices and buying the latest this and that .
As for me , I am sick and tired of the lions of American business ruling as they please .
It ’s time for a sea change in how things are done and by whom .
Who ’s with me ?
総務省が行なっている 「 インターネット上の違法・有害情報への対応に関する検討会」が、最終取りまとめに入った。12月17日までパブリックコメントを募集している。
地方自治体の取り組みなどはまだ把握できていないが、行政と企業の取り組みという点では網羅性が高く、良くまとまっていると言えるだろう。これから違法有害関係の取り組みを行なう部署にいる人などには、いい資料となるはずだ。
ただ、これからの具体的な取り組み策がここに書かれているわけではない。個別の取り組みは、これから民間ベースで具体化していかなければならない問題である。
個人的にはこれまでどおり、規制よりも先に教育があるべきという考え方に揺らぎはないが、実際に教育へ着手してみると、いろいろなことが分かってきた。MIAUとして学校教材としてのリテラシー読本 「 ” ネット ” と上手く付き合うために」を作成したが（リンク先PDF）、これは当初、親に向けた内容になるはずだった。しかし学校で子供たちの実態をヒアリングしていく課程で、学校での教育がまず先に困っているという現状が分かった。
具体的にはまず、情報教育のカリキュラムが古すぎるということ、そして問題に対しての対処を求められるのが、常に学校であるということである。
実際に学校に出向いて授業をやって分かったことは、現在の学校教育のスタイルは、我々の行なった出張授業のような「パッケージ型教育コンテンツ」が入れ込みやすいということである。子供たちの学習能力にはばらつきがあるが、教育システムはレベルの高い子にも低い子にも、一定レベルの情報をインプットし、一定のアウトプットを求めることで習熟度を測る。「みんなが知っておくべきこと」を一元的に教えるには、便利な仕組みだ。
学校教育に関しては、制度やシステムで対応できる。しかし親に対しての啓発で、このような手法は通用しない。大人を教育するということは、次元の違う話であることを実感させられる動向が目に付くようになってきている。
持たせない選択の落とし穴
そもそも 「親」という集団には、特徴的な属性がほとんど存在しない。唯一の共通項は「子供を学校にやっている」というだけであり、職業、年収、家族構成などがバラバラで、教育方針すらも微妙に（最近は大きく）異なる場合が多い。それらの集合体に対して、一元的に何かを教えるというようなことは、非常に難しい。
唯一のよりどころは、学校をハブとした地域性である。県、市、町と単位を小さくしていくことで、現状把握が可能になる。例えば県単位や市町村単位で存在する「青少年健全育成条例」は、その地域において成立したコンセンサス内で、子供の育成を図るための取り決めを独自に決めることができるわけである。
青少年健全育成条例の限界は、対象が人の目に触れる「物理物」しか制御できないということだ。例えばエロ本の販売規制やゾーニング、子供の深夜徘徊といったことは制御可能でも、ケータイやパソコン内で行なわれるネットの情報までは、大人や店舗が協力しようにも、やりようがない。協力を求める対象が全然違うわけである。
しかし、これも物理物規制でやってのけようとする動きも出てきている。顕著な例は、携帯電話を子供に持たせないという動きだ。いくつかの町村単位でこの方針を打ち出したところもあり、政府の教育再生懇談会も同様の見解を発表している。これは、情報端末という物理物を制御することで、情報をも制御しようとする例である。
持たせない活動としては、特定地区など小規模なエリアでは実行可能であろう。少なくとも、「隣近所同じ学校子供はみんな持ってない」という状況であれば、誰も欲しがらなくなる。ある意味、おもちゃと一緒である。
この方策には、悩ましい点が多い。確かに携帯にはおもちゃ的な要素もあるが、おもちゃだとしても与えない方がいいのか、昔ながらにブランコや縄跳びで遊んでいる方がいいのか、というところが気になる。物心ついた頃からすでに手元に情報機器があって、その経験が人の繋がり方や発想、能力、可能性を広げていくということも考えられるわけだが、不所持規制は、子供たちにそっちの未来への選択権を与えないことになりはしないのか。そこが心配である。

Ontario's Special Investigation
Unit says a single bullet shot by an Ottawa police officer hit two people in separate rooms when police tried to gain control of a knife - wielding woman at an apartment building in the city 's west end early Monday morning .
The SIU says Samantha Soderlind , 25 , was shot in the chest by one of the officers ; the bullet then passed through her body , went through the bedroom wall of the apartment , and struck Steven Lindsey , 27 , in the face .
Lindsey was apparently at Soderlind 's apartment at 810 Pinecrest Road to help her .
He later called police and two officers responding to the call told him to wait in the bedroom while they tried to gain control of the situation .
Both received non-life threatening injuries and are recovering in hospital .
The SIU is called in when police are involved in incidents involving the public which result in death or serious injury .
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Special Investigation Unit at 1-800-787-8529 , ext. 1867 .

Federal Tax Brackets
Your tax bracket is the rate you pay on the " last dollar " you earn ; but as a percentage of your income , your tax rate is generally less than that .
First , here are the tax rates and the income ranges where they apply : Tax Year : Filing Status : Single Married filing jointly Married filing separately Head of household
If your taxable income is between ... your tax bracket is : and % and % and % and % and % and % and %
To take an example , suppose your taxable income ( after deductions and exemptions ) is exactly $ 100,000 in 2012 and your status is Married filing jointly ; then your tax would be calculated like this : ( $ 17,400 minus 0 ) x .10 : $ 1,740.00 ( 70,700 minus 17,400 ) x .15 : 7,995.00 ( 100,000 minus 70,700 ) x .25 : 7,325.00 Total : $ 17,060.00
This puts you in the 25 % tax bracket , since that 's the highest rate applied to any of your income ; but as a percentage of the whole $ 100,000 , your tax is about 17 % .
This next calculator lets you try it out with your own numbers : Tax Year : Filing Status : Single Married filing jointly Married filing separately Head of household Taxable Income : $ Tax : $ ... as a percentage of income : % Tax Bracket : % Where Tax Brackets Apply " Taxable Income " above is really Regularly Taxed Income minus Adjustments , Deductions , and Exemptions .
Payroll Tax ( Social Security and Medicare ) , and Qualified Dividends and Long Term Capital Gains are separate calculations .
( See this Tax Calculator for more . )
The obvious way to lower your tax bill is to increase the untaxed area at the bottom of the diagram .
Contributions to deductible retirement accounts count as adjustments ; mortgage interest and contributions to charity count as deductions .
Tax Hikes ,
Tax Cuts 1993 saw a tax hike on the wealthy ( via two new brackets at the top ) , and then 2001 through 2003 saw a series of tax cuts that lowered the tax brackets as follows : 1992 1993 -
2000 2001 2002 2003 -
2012 2013 -
2017 2018 -
2020 15 % 15 % 15 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 15 % 15 % 15 % 12 % 28 % 28 % 27.5 % 27 % 25 % 25 % 22 % 31 % 31 % 30.5 % 30 % 28 % 28 % 24 % 36 % 35.5 % 35 % 33 % 33 % 32 % 39.6 % 39.1 % 38.6 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 39.6 % 37 % From 2000 to 2002 most brackets dropped by one percent , and there was a new low bracket added at the very bottom .
In 2003 most brackets got an additional cut of two percent with a 3.6 percent cut at the top .
( But note that the rich still paid more in 2003 , and everybody else paid less , than was the case in 1992 . )
In 2013 , the 2003 - 2012 rates were permanently extended for everyone except singles making over $ 400 K and couples making over $ 450 K .

The 19 - year - old , from Haslemere , Surrey , was devastated when his left hand was ripped off on a summer 's evening in 2006 as his friend was driving him home from a day out - destroying his dreams of joining the British Army .
Palin actual quote was : " They 're our next - door neighbours and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska , from an island in Alaska . "
Palin also made the third annual list for her inability to name newspapers she reads .
When questioned by CBS anchor Katie Couric , Palin said she reads " all of them , any of them that have been in front of me over all these years . "
Palin 's quotes were pivotal , said Shapiro , associate librarian and lecturer in legal research at the Yale Law School who compiles the list .
" This quote helped shape the election results , " he said of the Russia quote .
" As it sank in the public realised this was someone really , really inexperienced and perhaps lacking in curiosity about the world . "
Shapiro issued his Yale Book of Quotations , with about 13,000 entries , two years ago after six years of research .
He expects to release the next edition in about five years , but in the meantime plans to issue annual top 10 lists .
Picking the best quotes this year was especially challenging because the presidential race and financial crisis provided so much material , Shapiro said .
Last year 's list ranged from " Do n't tase me , bro " - shouted by a Florida college student who was shut with a Taser stun gun - to a quote from a Miss Teen USA contestant who gave a confused and mangled response to a question about why one - fifth of Americans cannot locate the US on a map .
Shapiro said that when he began the list he thought he would select the most profound , eloquent or witty quotes .
But the celebrity culture and political discourse led him down a different path .
" What I have come to do is pick some quotes that really say something about our culture and they tend almost exclusively to be quotes that are notable for negative reasons rather than being admirable or eloquent , " Shapiro said .
Palin 's running mate , Senator John McCain , also made the list twice , once for his " the fundamentals of America 's economy are strong " comment in April and again for saying " maybe 100 " when asked last January how many years US troops could remain in Iraq .
Shapiro said the quotes may have been somewhat unfairly construed .
" Nonetheless , these quotes cemented his image as someone who was out of touch with economic realities or indifferent to economic realities and being someone who was fanatical about prosecuting the war in Iraq , " he said .
Shapiro relies on suggestions from quote - watchers around the world , plus his own choices from songs , the news and movies , and then searches databases and the internet to determine the popularity of the quotes .
Phil Gramm , a McCain adviser , made the list for saying " We have sort of become a nation of whiners " in July in reference to Americans concerned about the economy .
President - elect Barack Obama did not make the list , not even for his much - criticised remark in which he said some small - town Americans " cling to guns or religion " .
" To me it did n't seem like a very remarkable or very foolish quote , " said Shapiro , who describes himself as a liberal Democrat .
" Ultimately I decided against it , but it was a close call . "
However , a crude remark about Obama by the Reverend Jesse Jackson did make the list .
Jackson apologised for the comment during what he thought was a private conversation in July .
" It indicates Republicans do not have a monopoly on quotes that are deplorable , " Shapiro said .
While Obama dominated the year and produced memorable quotes , " quotes from people like Palin were more celebrated and said more about our times than anything Obama said . "

NASA´s new Water Recovery System will make it possible to double to six the number of crewmembers who can live aboard the International Space Station .
Michigan
Tech researchers helped optimize the design , increasing its efficiency by 30 percent .
[ NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ( NASA - MSFC ) ]
Two hundred and fifty miles above the Earth puts you a long way from the nearest kitchen tap .
And at $ 10,000 a pint , the cost of shipping fresh water aboard the space shuttle is , well , astronomical .
So astronauts on the International Space Station have to recapture every possible drop .
That includes water evaporated from showers , shaving , tooth brushing and hand washing , plus perspiration and water vapor that collects within the astronauts ' space suits .
They even transfer water from the fuel cells that provide electric power to the space shuttle .
Until now , however , NASA has not attempted to tap one major potential source of water : urine .
That will soon change with the deployment of the new Water Recovery System .
It departed Friday , Nov. 14 , from the Kennedy Space Center on the Space Shuttle Endeavor .
The Water Recovery System , made possible in part by researchers at Michigan Technological University , can transform ordinary pee into water so pure it rivals the cleanest on Earth .
David Hand was the lead researcher on the project , which ran from 1993 to 1997 at Tech .
It was a memorable time .
" We received jars of sweat from NASA , " he said .
" Then we did experiments on the system , measured it at every step , evaluated it and made recommendations . "
Under the new system , urine undergoes an initial distillation process and then joins the rest of the recovered fluids in the water processor .
The processor filters out solids such as hair and lint and then sends the wastewater through a series of multifiltration beds , in which contaminants are removed through adsorption and ion exchange .
" What 's left over in the water are a few non adsorbing organics and solvents , like nail polish remover , and they go into a reactor that breaks them all down to carbon dioxide , water and a few ions , " said Hand , a professor of civil and environmental engineering .
After a final check for microbes , the water is again clean and ready to drink .
NASA 's Layne Carter , the Water Recovery System lead engineer at Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , credits Hand and the rest of the Tech research team with making the system as good as it is .
" Without a doubt , if it had n't been for their modeling effort , we never would have been able to redesign the multifiltration beds and achieve that level of efficiency , " Carter said .
" They did a fantastic job . "
Using mathematical models , the Tech researchers helped improve the overall design of the multifiltration beds ,
The redesigned beds have 30 percent more capacity , which means that NASA does n't have to send about 60 pounds of additional supplies up to the space station annually .
" That may seem trivial , but it saves NASA about $ 600,000 each year , " Carter said .

False advertising !
( From a YouTube video by mrvmtz that appears to debunk the claim . )
Remember those videos from a while back that showed groups of friends pointing ringing cellphones at popcorn kernels , which then popped , implying phones emit enough radiation to heat kernels to 300 degrees Fahrenheit ( the temperature at which popcorn pops ) ?
And then remember how those videos turned out to be a viral marketing hoax ?
That was fun , was n't it ?
Well , the fun is over .
Today , a short five months after the videos were revealed as a phony , the National Advertising Division ( NAD ) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus released a statement ( PDF ) that whips a ruler across the knuckles of Cardo Systems , the company that released the videos .
" In non-traditional media , to the extent that advertising claims are communicated , advertisers are required to substantiate those claims with competent and reliable scientific evidence , " said the statement .
Which means you can't just totally make stuff up to scare people into buying your products .
The original videos are no longer publicly accessible , suggesting that Cardo may have been sufficiently chastened .
And they say industry self - policing does n't work !
Still , these NAD guys may be tough , but I 'd take them any day over the riotous crowd of mommy bloggers that set angry fire to this Motrin ad .
The ad dared to poke fun at the idea of wearing your baby in a sling , and then compounded its sin by suggesting that baby - wearing may lead to back pain .
Motrin , seriously , next time you want to claim that funny - looking things look funny , or that carrying a heavy weight on your back for hours could hurt it -- make sure you substantiate .

A worrying claim that has circulated for years is that 18,000 Americans die every year because they do n’t have health insurance .
A thought - provoking analysis revealed that this is little more than an urban legend .
The source of this widely - repeated factoid turns out to be a 2002 report sponsored by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , the leading organization using it to call for a complete restructuring of our healthcare system and the adoption of universal healthcare by 2010 to solve this problem .
What makes this analysis valuable to read is that if we do n’t accurately define and understand the problem we ’re trying to solve , then the solution is n’t likely to work .
While it seems intuitive , will nationalized health insurance really help to improve health , and especially help those with the poorest health and the least access to care , and reduce health disparities in our country ?
Or could it actually make things worse for the very people we ’re trying to help , as well as cause greater hardship for even more people ?
By failing to correctly identify the problem , what other , better solutions might we be overlooking ?
This is not about not caring about the uninsured , but to remind us that sensationalizing an issue with scares and myths wo n’t lead to better reasoning .
A year and a half ago , the widely claimed numbers of uninsured people were examined and found to have been exaggerations , nonetheless , the proposed solution was to mandate insurance coverage for everyone .
The pilot study for that proposal , however , has sadly failed to improve health care and healthcare access for people ; is leading to unforeseen intrusions into private lifestyles and doctor - patient relationships , with costly preventive health mandates that are n’t evidence - based but designed to make money for stakeholders ; and has proven to be a financial disaster , expanding bureaucracy and requiring increasingly more taxpayer federal funds to keep it solvent .
This latest analysis was written by Greg Scandlen and published at the State Policy Network , an independent nonprofit think tank to explore the soundest information and the most effective solutions for policy issues , while preserving a free society .
He examined the RWJF report , Care without Coverage , behind the claim that there are 18,000 deaths a year from lack of insurance .
This report had been issued by the private organization , the Institute of Medicine , as part of its Coverage Matters series .
Mr. Scandlen explained that this report had n’t actually conducted original research , but was a meta - analysis of existing studies .
“ There is little consistency between these studies in quality or methods , and all are ‘ observational rather than experimental , ’ as the IOM report acknowledges , ” he wrote .
They were epidemiological studies reporting correlations that cannot identify the cause for observed relationships between insurance and health .
“ In other words , there may be some other condition that leads people to be both uninsured and in poor health , ” he said .
Very few of these underlying studies adjusted for socio-economic differences in the populations , which is a major problem since income and education are closely associated with health outcomes regardless of the kind of insurance coverage involved .
We know , for instance , that people on Medicare all have the same insurance coverage , but 54 % of those under the poverty level report themselves as being in poor or fair health , as compared to only 25 % of those above 200 % of poverty .
The “ universal ” systems in Canada , the United Kingdom , New Zealand , and Australia report even bigger income - based disparities with lower - income adults over three times as likely as higher - income adults reporting themselves to be in “ fair or poor health . ”
While IOM did not correct for income differences in the populations ( insured vs. uninsured ) , it had available a proxy for income …
IOM might have studied people on Medicaid as being both low - income and fully - insured .
But this result did not suit its predisposition , so it chose to downplay it .
Deep in the report it acknowledges that , “ study results for overall health status , cancer outcomes , and hospital - based care , ( find that ) adults with Medicaid frequently fare no better and sometimes far worse than uninsured patients in their health - related outcomes ” …
In fact , the evidence strongly suggests that insurance is not the most important factor in health — income and education are .
But RWJ was n’t paying IOM to come to that conclusion .
Mr. Scandlen had reviewed all of the 139 studies in the report and found that 26 studies had compared uninsured people only to those with private insurance — in other words , they had failed to compare the uninsured to those receiving government health coverage in existing programs , Medicaid and Medicare .
He found that 44 studies had compared the health outcomes of Medicaid enrollees to people who had no insurance and more than 3 out of 4 found that those with government - provided healthcare coverage did worse than the uninsured on a range of health treatments and outcomes .
It turns out that the 18,000 death figure was not based on looking at a single medical record or cause of death , it was a mathematical prediction , based on a string of flawed and unsupportable assumptions .
He found the “ tortured methodology ” that came up with the 18,000 deaths figure buried in Appendix D :
First , they rely entirely on a single study that estimated “ a higher overall mortality risk for uninsured adults of 25 percent .
” Linda Gorman deconstructs this original study persuasively .
She notes the study by Peter Franks begins by looking at people who were uninsured or privately insured in 1971 and then looks at their mortality in 1987 .
Never mind that this entire population likely went through many spells of being covered or not being covered in the intervening years .
IOM then assumes that the incidence of diseases like diabetes , hypertension , breast cancer , and HIV are the same in the uninsured population as they are in the privately insured population .
So they multiply the death rate for the insured by 125 % and get the “ excess mortality ” of the uninsured .
Voila !
18,000 dead .
As Scandlen went on to explain , the problems with the IOM ’s math began by failing to accurately identify who the uninsured are and to recognize that they are a very diverse group , ranging from " young healthy people who do n’t want insurance " to " pretty poor people , " all with vastly different mortality rates .
The uninsured also have different disease rates than the general population , he said , because they tend to be younger ( older people are covered under Medicare ) .
Gorman ’s analysis noted that the authors claimed their findings supported government - provided “ universal health insurance to reduce both financial barriers to care and the risk of premature mortality . ”
But , she wrote , “ the study itself provided no information about the effects of government coverage on mortality because it excluded “ adults with Medicaid , Veterans Administration insurance , or Medicare . ”
A 1994 study by researchers at the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health had examined the effects of government coverage on mortality .
It reported that people on public programs had higher mortality than either the uninsured or those with private insurance .
Mortality most related to income level .
Gorman also pointed out that most deaths among younger adults , who make up much of the uninsured , are due to accidents , suicides and assaults ( confirmed in Health United States 2007 issued by the Department of Health and Human Services ) , issues for which health insurance has little affect .
Finally , she went step - by - step in describing the math used to arrive at the 18,000 death figure .
Scandlen concluded that one thing that is almost certainly not true about the uninsured is that 18,000 of them die each year simply because they do not have coverage .
Nor is there any evidence that government insurance will solve the real reasons behind health disparities , as intuitively correct as it might seem .
Food for thought .
Former Sen . Tom Daschle , tapped by President Obama to lead his healthcare reform campaign , failed to pay more than $ 128,000 in taxes in the three years before Obama nominated him in December to head the Department of Health and Human Services .
The disclosure -- involving unreported income and the use of a car and driver provided to Daschle -- comes 2 1/2 weeks after Obama ’s choice to head the Treasury Department , Timothy Geithner , admitted that he had not paid about $ 43,000 in taxes .
Geithner was ultimately confirmed by the Senate , but the revelations about Daschle ’s taxes cast a shadow over the man that many hoped would be able to build political consensus behind an ambitious effort to reshape the nation ’s healthcare system .
Daschle did not comment publicly Friday on his tax problems , which are being investigated by the Senate Finance Committee ahead of his confirmation hearing before the panel .

But a spokeswoman for the former Senate majority leader and close Obama ally stressed Friday evening that the tax errors were the result of simple mistakes that Daschle had worked in good faith to correct .
“ Sen .
Daschle is embarrassed and disappointed by these errors , ” spokeswoman Jenny Backus said .
The bulk of the unpaid taxes -- first reported Friday by ABC News -- stems from a lucrative business relationship that Daschle began with a wealthy investor shortly after Daschle left the Senate in 2005 .
That year Daschle was paid $ 83,333 a month -- or $ 1 million a year -- to advise a private equity fund , according to a confidential draft report prepared by Republican staffers on the Senate Finance Committee .

The South Dakota Democrat was hired by Leo J. Hindery Jr. , a longtime friend of Daschle ’s , to consult for InterMedia Advisors .
The private equity fund invests in media companies , including the Christian publishing house Thomas Nelson , the Gospel Music Channel , and Cine Latino , a leading Spanish - language movie channel .
Hindery , a Democratic donor who made a fortune in cable television , also provided Daschle with a car and driver beginning in April 2005 .
Daschle estimated that 80 % of his use of the car was for personal reasons .
But he did not pay any taxes on the service until Jan. 2 , 2009 , when he filed amended returns for 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .
Daschle this month paid more than $ 100,000 in taxes and interest for the car service , according to Backus .
Advertisement
He paid an additional $ 32,491 to cover taxes and interest for a monthly payment that was not reported in 2007 .
According to the committee report , InterMedia officials told committee staffers that unreported payment was the result of an employee being out on maternity leave when the May 2007 payment was processed .
InterMedia had also not generated the proper tax form for Daschle at the time .
Finally , Daschle paid nearly $ 6,000 in taxes and interest on donations that he had improperly classified as tax - exempt charitable donations .
Backus said Daschle and his wife had believed their donations to a wounded Iraq war veteran were tax - deductible .
While Obama ’s vetting team reviewed Daschle ’s tax records , however , they discovered the payment had not gone through a qualifying charity .

Daschle has thus far paid a total of $ 140,167 in back taxes and interest , according to the draft committee report .
After news of the tax issues leaked Friday evening , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement supporting the Obama nominee .
“ The president has confidence that Sen .
Daschle is the right person to lead the fight for healthcare reform , ” Gibbs said .
A month ago , Obama ’s pick for Commerce secretary , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , withdrew his name from consideration because of an investigation of a campaign donor who had obtained state contracts .
Whether Daschle will face greater difficulties with members of the Senate remains unclear .

Republican committee staff members are continuing to look into Daschle ’s travel on a corporate jet owned by education loan provider EduCap Inc. , according to one staffer who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue .
And Iowa Sen. Charles E. Grassley , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee who is leading the inquiry , has been careful in recent days to avoid discussing Daschle ’s prospects .
Friday , his spokeswoman Jill Gerber issued a statement pledging an open process .
“ Sen .
Grassley ’s position for this nomination is the same as it has been for every other nomination processed by the Finance Committee since 2001 , that all relevant information about a nominee must be made public in order for the confirmation process to go forward in the committee , ” she said .

The committee , which will meet privately with Daschle on Monday , has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing .

Found a great site about making orgone generators .
It 's metal flakes mixed with epoxy , stuck to a board .
Mmmm .
Hi tech !
Here 's a quote from the instruction page , just to reassure fellow readers that this has nothing to do with scientology :
" We were getting pretty hammered by aliens when we first started using the ( orgone generator ) , and were fairly at our wits ' end trying to find ways to neutralize their attacks .
I wo n't go into the details , but some of you resonate to what I 'm saying here .
We 'd been using the mobius coil in our Terminators for about six months at that point , and had put a very large mobius coil in the energized grid in the floor of the Zapporium and noticed that as long as we were inside , with the frequency generator turned on at 15 Hz , we could n't be touched .
It came to a head , though , when a Draconian overlord talked Carol into having a telepathic dialogue , which he apparently assumed was an invitation to enter the Zapporium , which he did .
We were in bed , which is the Zapporium 's floor , and I was awake , looking at Carol beside me .
I saw the transparent visage of a Draconian as he sort of eased into Carol 's body , like a movie special effect .
I was astonished to see that his / her face looked just like Richard Gephardt 's if you were to stretch it lengthwise .
I woke Carol from her trance and we both agreed that it was n't a good idea for her to ' dialogue ' with this person , as he / she was fundamentally untrustworthy at this point . "
Twitter , a micro- blogging service , is one of the most famous online services used by bloggers and journalists .
Many people think its a useless service but it has turned out to be very useful in some critical situations .
At first glance , it seems to be that why would someone be interested in what other people are doing ?.
Anyone who is good in MySQL and PHP can design this site very easily .
Not everyone has time to tell people that he or she is having lunch or coffee .
And not everyone is interested to know who is sleeping or just had breakfast .
But is the one of the life saver sites of the world wide web that is performing its role effectively for the awareness in the emergency or uncovered situations .
Like on April 10 2008 , James Buck , a graduate journalism student at UC Berkeley , and his translator , Mohammed Maree , were arrested in Egypt for photographing an anti-government protest .
On his way to the police station , Buck used his mobile phone to send the message “ Arrested ” to his 48 " followers " on Twitter .
Those contacted UC Berkeley , the US Embassy in Cairo and a number of press organizations on his behalf … ( Read full story at Wikipedia )
On 27th November 2008 , in Karachi , riots and deadly fights between two political groups were going on across the city .
Being biased and restricted , media did n’t covered the real situation .
At that day , twitter was there to keep us well informed .
Many Tweeters living in Karachi were twitting about what is going on in their area .
Many journalist and curious people from other countries also joined the tweeting …asking about the updates and situation .
Twitter is one of the services in today 's world that challenges Governments , Agencies and Media to hide the actual facts .
The Middle East may be a half a world away but events there -- and their impact here -- are being closely monitored by the Los Angeles Police Department .
Over the weekend , the LAPD opened its emergency operations center in the wake of Hamas rocket attacks against Israel and the Jewish state 's bombing and invasion of the Gaza Strip .
The center will be staffed indefinitely on a round - the - clock basis , said LAPD Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger .
The center " acts as a clearinghouse , " says Paysinger , collecting information about the latest news related to the conflict and the reactions in Los Angeles , including " spontaneous protests " such as the one that took place Friday outside the Israeli Consulate on Wilshire Boulevard .
Confidants of Mr. Emanuel ’s said he decided to try his hand at business because he wanted financial security for his family , before eventually returning to public service .
Image Mr. Emanuel , who is set to become White House chief of staff , at a news conference on Monday .

“ He had a number in his head to make enough for the family , ” said Ezekiel J. Emanuel , one of Rahm ’s two brothers and a prominent bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health .
It was Morton L. Janklow , the literary agent for several former presidents , who introduced Mr. Emanuel to Mr. Wasserstein .
Erskine B. Bowles , the White House chief of staff and a former investment banker , also said he recommended Mr. Emanuel .
Mr. Emanuel met in Mr. Wasserstein in his New York office , where they had a wide - ranging discussion about the future of financial regulation , as well as Mr. Emanuel ’s plans .
Jeffrey A. Rosen , now deputy chairman of Lazard and a former managing director of Wasserstein Perella ’s international practice , said Mr. Emanuel was “ both a developed and a raw talent . ”
“ His years in the White House and what he ’d done before that really honed what I ’d call deal - making instincts , which could be easily translated into the business arena , ” Mr. Rosen said .
“ Plus , he was someone who was well connected in Chicago and highly respected . ”
Mr. Emanuel turned out to be an effective banker , proving a quick study with financial concepts , even as he relied on others in his office for heavy number crunching , former colleagues said .
He worked 12 - hour days and was known among clients for his relentlessness , constantly on the phone or sending e-mail , and being unafraid to pitch deals .
Revenue in Wasserstein ’s Chicago office climbed significantly after his arrival .
There is no evidence Mr. Emanuel used his political clout on behalf of his clients , but his connections certainly helped drum up business and contributed to his hiring , former colleagues said .
Indeed , a partial list of clients from Mr. Emanuel ’s Congressional financial disclosure in 2002 is easily linked up to the various strands of his political career , including his time as a fund - raiser for Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and then for Mr. Clinton ’s first presidential run .
Half the fun of surfing the Internet is stumbling across tasty little Web treats that you never would have thought to look for .
Traditional social bookmarking sites like Digg and Delicious are great for finding articles and other text that other Web surfers have tagged as interesting .
For the visually oriented , the pickings have been slim .
Now , however , a handful of photo - oriented bookmarking sites are emerging to entertain the eye as well as the mind .
The sites — We Heart It , FFFFound and Vi.sualize.us — resemble constantly changing art installations .
Similar to a white - walled gallery , they present their goods with little to no flourish : simple , clean interfaces are all that stand between visitors and eyefuls of color .
The sites work similarly to their text - based brethren .
When members discover an image worth preserving , they bookmark it , either by right - clicking or using a site - specific browser button .
Although the sites are still light years away from the popularity of their older siblings -– Digg alone boasts 35 million unique users per month and as many as 20,000 submissions per day -– they are steadily gaining a loyal following .
Here ’s a bit more about each of the sites .
Please note that images on all of them can be slightly not - safe - for - work , so proceed with caution when browsing .
FFFFound : Tokyo - based design firm Tha started FFFFound as a side project in June 2007 .
“ We just genuinely wanted to share images that are considered good by a community of people , ” said Erica Sakai , a spokesperson for the company .
“ At the time , there were no Web sites that offered this kind of service . ”
As members add fresh fodder to the site , images appear and drift down the homepage , forming a steady stream of album covers , typographical posters , experimental photography and snapshots of street graffiti .
Unlike the other sites , FFFFound is a closed to new contributors .
Ms. Sakai said the team elected to cap the community ’s size for fear FFFFound would become overly cluttered and unmanageable .
But any visitor is free to browse the catalog of 500,000 images .
Vi.sualize.us : Victor Espigares , a software engineer in Spain , was flipping through a photographer ’s portfolio on the Web when he was struck by a particular image .
“ I was thinking about bookmarking the picture — but not the site — and found that I had no choice , ” said Mr. Espigares .
“ So I started to think about filling that need .
Later , I started to think a little bigger and realized that others might have a similar need . ”
Vi.sualize.us features more variety than the other sites : anything from T - shirt designs to artsy studio shots and illustrations are likely to pop up .
Since the site began in September 2007 , the community has expanded to roughly 10,000 members with a collection of nearly 300,000 images .
We Heart It : Unable to land an invitation to FFFFound , Fabio Giolito , a Brazilian Web developer , created We Heart It in March partially as an alternative to the exclusive site .
“ As a designer , I keep an inspiration folder on my computer where I throw all the cool images and links I find , ” said Mr. Giolito .
“ I created the site to organize things that I like .
People liked it , so I opened it to everyone . ”
With its wealth of portrait and fashion photography , the site is similar to Flickr but with a more risqué and avant - garde feel .
Unlike the other two visual - bookmarking sites , We Heart
It also allows its 16,000 registered users to tag favorite videos from Vimeo and YouTube .
The site currently has more than 200,000 submissions , and Mr. Giolito estimates a new selection is added each minute .

Editorial : What were the neuroscientists thinking ?
14 January 2009
Modern - day neuroscience might benefit from adopting a similar stance .
The field has produced some wonderful science , including endless technicolor images of the brain at work and headline - grabbing papers about the areas that " light up " when registering emotions .
Researchers charted those sad spots that winked on in women mourning the end of a relationship , the areas that got fired up when thinking about infidelity , or those that surged in arachnophobes when they thought they were about to see a spider .
The subjective subject of feelings seemed at last to be becoming objective .
Now it seems that a good chunk of the papers in this field contain exaggerated claims , according to an analysis which suggests that " voodoo correlations " often inflate the link between brain areas and particular behaviours .
Some of the resulting headlines appeared in
, so we have to eat a little humble pie and resolve that next time a sexy - sounding brain scan result appears we will strive to apply a little more scepticism to our coverage .

Many Canadians , especially those who watch American television , have heard about the switch from analogue to digital TV broadcasts that is scheduled to take place in the United States on February 17 .
While John Podesta , cochair of Barack Obama ’s transition team , asked lawmakers in letters on January 8 and 16 to delay the changeover because millions of viewers are n’t prepared , it was still scheduled to go ahead as planned when the Georgia Straight went to press .
According to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission , the switch “ will free up the airwaves for police , fire , and emergency rescue communications , allow broadcasters to offer programming with better picture and sound quality and offer more programming choices , and allow for advanced wireless services ” .
It will also generate revenue for the U.S. government , which is auctioning off sections of the broadcast spectrum to telecommunications and Internet companies .
Broadcasts originating in Canada wo n’t be affected , and Canadians with analogue cable TV will still be able to watch American channels .
However , Canadian viewers who receive American TV broadcasts “ over the air ” with a rabbit - ear antenna will no longer be able to watch U.S. networks without a digital - to - analogue converter .
Although they ’re not commonly used in Canada , converters are available at one local big - box retailer for $ 89.99 .
Canada ’s digital conversion , scheduled for August 31 , 2011 , could prove to be even more problematic than the American switch .
Ian Morrison , spokesperson for Friends of Canadian Broadcasting , told the Straight that the lack of a clearly defined transition plan will cause trouble for over - the - air viewers .
“ The private sector does n’t care very much about the over - the - air people because — and one could say I ’m being cynical , but I ’m just explaining it from an economic point of view — they tend to be lower - income , so they ’re not as important to the advertisers , and of course their business is to deliver audiences to advertisers , ” Morrison said by phone .
Morrison added that when over - the - air viewers “ all of a sudden find out in 2011 that they ca n’t get television anymore — and many of these people are voters — all hell ’s going to break loose ” .
According to BBM Nielsen estimates for 2008 –2009 , 9.6 percent of households in Canada receive television broadcasts over the air .
( The figure is only seven percent in Vancouver but rises to 13.5 percent for Francophone Quebeckers and 15.3 percent for Francophone Montrealers . )
The switch could deny more than 1.25 million Canadian households access to what the Broadcasting Act of 1991 calls “ a public service essential to the maintenance and enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty ” .
“ This is predominantly momentous for those Canadians whose literacy or household income prevents ready access to print media or Internet resources ” ¦this is not only a cultural problem but could manifest itself as one that concerns public safety and education as well , ” states the Ottawa - based Public Interest Advocacy Centre in a May 2008 submission to the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
In the U.S. , the government is issuing two digital - converter coupons , each worth US $ 40 , to households that request them , underwritten with the proceeds from the broadcast - spectrum auctions .
Unfortunately , the program ran out of funding earlier this month , resulting in a waiting list and prompting the Obama team ’s bid to push back the transition date .
Although the U.S. plan is flawed , Canada has nothing even approaching that in the works .
In an e-mail response to an interview request , Stéfanie Power , a spokesperson for Industry Canada — which is overseeing the digital switchover — said that at this time , the government has no plans to subsidize the purchase of converter boxes .
Although the CRTC failed to respond to an interview request , the commission ’s chair , Konrad von Finckenstein , has publicly expressed apprehension .
“ Undoubtedly , Canadian consumers will expect similar assistance , especially once the U.S. plan receives wider promotion over the airwaves , ” he said in a June 2008 speech at the Broadcasting Invitational Summit in Cambridge , Ontario .
He added , “ Frankly , I am surprised that neither the industry nor its various umbrella groups have raised this issue more forcefully . ”
With no government movement toward a U.S. –style voucher system , the Public Interest Advocacy Centre proposed low - cost basic cable as a solution in its May 2008 CRTC submission .
In a telephone interview , executive director Michael Janigan described the organization ’s proposal as “ a limited basic - service package available at a reasonable price which would include the existing local channels plus the must - carry stations that they currently have , and that it would be price - capped ” .
While broadcast - spectrum auctions in the U.S. have raised nearly US $ 20 billion , there has been little public discussion of the subject in Canada .
In her e-mail , Power said that about 20 percent of the freed - up spectrum will be used by “ public safety services ” , while the rest will be allocated for commercial use after “ future consultations ” .
While there ’s probably a fair bit of hedging going on — waiting to see what happens with the American switchover — it does appear that Canada is in poor shape to successfully effect a digital switchover in two - and - a - half years .
“ Ultimately , there ’s a political dimension to this , that they ’ll wake up and there ’ll be an ” ˜uh - oh ’ , which might lead to a deferral of the conversion , ” Morrison said .
“ Who ’s going to pay the capital costs ?
That was always a problem , but especially now that access to capital is hurt by the economic downturn .
So I ’m a skeptic on 2011 . ”
Obama camp claims ' imposing ' lead in early voting Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday October 31 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Barack Obama 's campaign said Democratic voters were piling up imposing early voting totals in battleground states , warning that John McCain must win big on election day on Tuesday to catch up .
" The die is being cast as we speak , " Obama 's campaign manager David Plouffe said in a conference call with reporters , saying the Democrat was running strong in swing states Florida , Colorado , New Mexico and others .
" So Senator McCain , on election day is going to have to not just carry the day but carry it convincingly , " Plouffe said .
Plouffe also said that the campaign would expand its advertising in the frenetic final days of the campaign into Republican McCain 's home state of Arizona , following polls which suggest the race had tightened there .
The campaign would also take out advertising spots over the final weekend in normally Republican states like Georgia , after being encouraged by early voting figures and North Dakota , he said .
Plouffe said that in the crucial swing - state of Florida , Democrats had built a 200,000 strong gap over McCain after early and absentee voting -- reversing the trend from 2004 when President George W. Bush beat John Kerry in the state .
" In 2008 , as of last night , we had just about a 200,000 vote edge over the Republicans , which is , obviously , a big change from 2004 , " Plouffe said .
Republicans went into election day that year with an edge of around 40,000 votes .
In the western swing state of Nevada , 43 percent of Democrats who voted early were either new voters or sporadic voters -- a prized demographic as campaigns seek an edge in close fought states , Plouffe said .
In North Carolina , Plouffe said , 19 percent of Democrats who voted early had never voted in a general election before , bolstering Obama 's hopes of bringing large numbers of new voters into the process .
" We very much like what we 're seeing in early vote .
And obviously , in states like Colorado , Nevada , North Carolina . "
The McCain campaign scheduled its own conference call later on Friday to address the state of the race , four days before election day .
" The pundits have written us off much as they have done before , but we are closing my friends , and we are going to win Ohio , " McCain said in the crucial midwestern battleground state on Friday .
" We 're a few points down ... but we 're coming back strong . "
They asked not where he had been or what he had been doing .
Instead thousands of jubilant devotees simply trudged to the remote jungle spot in south - east Nepal where a teenage " Buddha Boy " reappeared to preach to villagers , more than a year after he went missing .
Ram Bahadur Bamjon became famous three years ago when tens of thousands of people flocked to watch him sitting cross -legged under a tree for almost ten months .
His followers - who say he is the reincarnation of Buddha - claimed that during this time he neither ate nor drank .
Then , last spring , his supporters said that the teenager was planning to go away and meditate for three years in an underground bunker .
He was last seen in August 2007 , preaching to crowds in Nepal ’s Hallori jungle , around 100 miles south of Kathmandu .

Whatever encouraged Mr Bamjon to re-emerge is unclear , but police said that on Monday he appeared , long - haired , dressed in white and looking in good health , and preached to villagers for around 45 minutes .
Local officials said he plans to speak to people for an hour a day for another week .
" Hundreds of devotees , including many from neighbouring India are trekking the five kilometres to see him , " said one police officer , Prakash Sen .
" He spoke to the devotees standing near a temple in the forest .
He had shoulder - length hair and had his body wrapped in a white cloth .
Since many people are walking to see him , I think he has some of the qualities Lord Buddha had . "
When Mr Bamjon first became famous reporters filmed him eating , even though his supporters said he could go without food or drink for days .
He was also spotted sleeping when his followers said he was meditating in private .
However , a number of witnesses spoke of the young man ’s ability to sit fixed in one spot for hours on end
There has been no formal declaration by Buddhist authorities on whether they consider the teenager to be the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama , who was born in south - western Nepal in 500 BC and later became revered as the Buddha , or " Enlightened One " .
Buddhist priests have been divided on the issue , despite the claims of his followers .
Meanwhile local volunteers have collected thousands of dollars from people who have visited the young man , prompting accusations that he is merely at the centre of a clever and enlightened money - making scam .
Star Wars Death Star Grooms Cake Presents a Kinder , Gentler Side of The Empire
I kind of like the whimsical interpretation of the Death Star in this Star Wars groom ’s cake .
It ’s very “ death machine sits on a fluffy cloud at the end of a Skittles rainbow . ”
‘ Cause you know there ’s no better place for a death machine to sit than on a fluffy cloud .
Or a pair of cybernetic legs .
Or a motion - tracking tripod .
But mostly a fluffy cloud .
Judy shares details on this mechanical Pangaea - looking confection , featuring four layers of chocolate chip cookies , white chocolate mousse filling , butter cream frosting , a garnish of Skittles and Sweet Tarts , and the dimples of forest pixies :
The cake was done for my friend ’s brother ’s wedding .
The Death Star idea came from him being such an avid Star Wars fan …
It took about 3 hours baking time between the cookies , round ball cake and mixing up the mousse and frostings .
Then about 1 1/ 2 hours to decorate … no time at all for the bottom round part , mostly that time was just ate up with covering the ball and gluing on the exterior pieces .
Once placed out for service , it cut and served exactly like any other cake would — - because the chocolate chip cookies making up the “ cake ” part were soft and chewy .

Since Bernie Madoff has put Ponzi schemes back onto the front pages , it ’s worth considering whether we are all complicit in the biggest Ponzi scheme of them all , the idea that the global economy can grow indefinitely .
I grew up on the idea that humanity would grow out into space , and that resources were for all practical purposes infinite .
It may well be that in some possible worlds , that could still be true , but it ’s increasingly looking like we ’re going to be stuck here with only one world ’s resources to draw on .
And while most reasonable people are aware that we ’re using up much of our children ’s inheritance , and handing them debt in exchange , I do n’t think as a society we ’ve really come to grips with the consequence of that knowledge .
We ’re rather like the investors who were complicit in Madoff ’s scheme , playing along while the getting is good .
At least some of us know that the game is rigged , but we ’re not going to be the first to blow the whistle .
Former World Bank economist Herman Daly wrote a vivid piece on the subject of the Ponzi economy back in October , entitled The Disconnection Between Financial Assets and Real Asssets :
The current financial debacle is really not a “ liquidity ” crisis as it is often euphemistically called .
It is a crisis of overgrowth of financial assets relative to growth of real wealth — pretty much the opposite of too little liquidity .
Financial assets have grown by a large multiple of the real economy — paper exchanging for paper is now 20 times greater than exchanges of paper for real commodities .
It should be no surprise that the relative value of the vastly more abundant financial assets has fallen in terms of real assets .
Real wealth is concrete ; financial assets are abstractions — existing real wealth carries a lien on it in the amount of future debt .
The value of present real wealth is no longer sufficient to serve as a lien to guarantee the exploding debt .
Consequently the debt is being devalued in terms of existing wealth .
No one any longer is eager to trade real present wealth for debt even at high interest rates .
This is because the debt is worth much less , not because there is not enough money or credit , or because “ banks are not lending to each other ” as commentators often say .
Can the economy grow fast enough in real terms to redeem the massive increase in debt ?
In a word , no .
As Frederick Soddy ( 1926 Nobel Laureate chemist and underground economist ) pointed out long ago , “ you cannot permanently pit an absurd human convention , such as the spontaneous increment of debt [ compound interest ] against the natural law of the spontaneous decrement of wealth [ entropy ] ” .
The population of “ negative pigs ” ( debt ) can grow without limit since it is merely a number ; the population of “ positive pigs ” ( real wealth ) faces severe physical constraints .
The dawning realization that Soddy ’s common sense was right , even though no one publicly admits it , is what underlies the crisis .
The problem is not too little liquidity , but too many negative pigs growing too fast relative to the limited number of positive pigs whose growth is constrained by their digestive tracts , their gestation period , and places to put pigpens .
Also there are too many two‐legged Wall Street pigs , but that is another matter .
Growth in US real wealth is restrained by increasing scarcity of natural resources , both at the source end ( oil depletion ) , and the sink end ( absorptive capacity of the atmosphere for CO2 ) .
Further , spatial displacement of old stuff to make room for new stuff is increasingly costly as the world becomes more full , and increasing inequality of distribution of income prevents most people from buying much of the new stuff — except on credit ( more debt ) .
Marginal costs of growth now likely exceed marginal benefits , so that real physical growth makes us poorer , not richer ( the cost of feeding and caring for the extra pigs is greater than the extra benefit ) .
To keep up the illusion that growth is making us richer we deferred costs by issuing financial assets almost without limit , conveniently forgetting that these so ‐called assets are , for society as a whole , debts to be paid back out of future real growth .
That future real growth is very doubtful and consequently claims on it are devalued , regardless of liquidity .
This is economic heresy , something that goes so contrary to our every assumption that we ’re convinced it must be wrong .
Surely we can go on somehow , and get back to the way it was before the crash !
If we can ’t , we imagine a dreary world without possibilities , in which there is no motivation , no improvement , and no opportunity .
There is an alternative that Daly , in another piece , calls A Steady State Economy , and that others call “ ecological economics “ .
Here ’s Daly :
A failed growth economy and a steady - state economy are not the same thing ; they are the very different alternatives we face .
The Earth as a whole is approximately a steady state .
Neither the surface nor the mass of the earth is growing or shrinking ; the inflow of radiant energy to the Earth is equal to the outflow ; and material imports from space are roughly equal to exports ( both negligible ) .
None of this means that the earth is static — a great deal of qualitative change can happen inside a steady state , and certainly has happened on Earth .
The most important change in recent times has been the enormous growth of one subsystem of the Earth , namely the economy , relative to the total system , the ecosphere .
This huge shift from an “ empty ” to a “ full ” world is truly “ something new under the sun ” as historian J. R. McNeil calls it in his book of that title .
The closer the economy approaches the scale of the whole Earth the more it will have to conform to the physical behavior mode of the Earth .
That behavior mode is a steady state — a system that permits qualitative development but not aggregate quantitative growth .
Growth is more of the same stuff ; development is the same amount of better stuff ( or at least different stuff ) .
The remaining natural world no longer is able to provide the sources and sinks for the metabolic throughput necessary to sustain the existing oversized economy — much less a growing one .
I like Daly ’s distinction between qualitative development and quantitative growth .
The consumption of electronic media perhaps gives a foretaste of an economy in which qualitative complexity might replace quantitative addition as the raw material of exchange .
Obviously , we ’re not there yet , as we ’re still consuming lots of resources to build the substrate for our increasingly intellectual economy , but I love that he ’s broken the naive assumption that if we do n’t have growth , the only alternative is stasis .
It ’s clear that getting to a steady - state economy will be hard , perhaps even impossible ( although it ’s worth noting that living systems have accomplished that feat . )
But what a challenge !
How do we keep the dynamism of modern capitalist economies without borrowing from the future ?
What does it mean to keep the real costs of what we consume on the balance sheet ?
Will the economy of the future be built on aesthetic value exchange ( the whuffie of Cory Doctorow ’s imagination ) , with renewable energy in harness and physical materials seamlessly recycled .
Great questions , great opportunities for us to invent the answers !
For anyone who did n't know , the clue was in the very long queue that was forming behind the cashpoint .
The machine at the BP garage in Stretford , Manchester , had a malfunction that made it dispense double the amount requested by customers .
Word soon got around – and for five hours , it continued to pay out before someone contacted the Nationwide Building Society to report the fault .
The company said yesterday it was disappointing that no one had reported the fault earlier .
The machine gave out £ 60 every time it was asked for £ 30 , but gave away more cash in different multiples depending on the amount requested .
Some customers reportedly used several cards to withdraw money .
The Nationwide said it appeared the employee of a firm it used to top up the machine had loaded the notes incorrectly .
A 33 - year - old man , who benefited to the tune of £ 150 but did not want to be identified , said : " The banks have had enough off us so it 's good to get a little back .
My friend texted me about 2 pm .
I could n't believe it .
You had to wait a while because people were putting their cards in five and six times but it was well worth it . "
At one point , 50 people were in the queue .
Shan Cliff , 21 , said : " Most people have taken out hundreds of pounds .
No one 's going to turn down free money .
I do n't know whether it will show in our accounts but it 's their mistake not ours . "
Legally it is up to the bank whether it attempts to identify every faulty transaction and reclaim any overpayment .
However , in previous cases banks have simply written off their losses .
A spokeswoman for Nationwide said : " We can confirm there was a problem and the ATM has been taken out of action while the problem is investigated .
" It will be put back in place and ready for action for the weekend .
Obviously , some people were deliberately using the machine to take money which does n't belong to them and we were disappointed people did n't alert us to it earlier in the day .
" I can confirm there was a problem with a third party supplier incorrectly loading the machine .
At this stage we are still investigating the problem but we will reserve the right to contact people on an individual basis regarding this matter . "
The issue that is set to move to center stage , sometime in the next nine months , has less to do with theoretical inflation , or theoretical deflation .
Rather , the question of which ‘ flation we experience next year is likely to be determined by the exploding supply of US Treasuries .
Sure , banking systems worldwide are being recapitalized , as governments attempt to replace part of the debt currently being destroyed .
And sure , some of that capital or even alot of that capital is not getting into the system , and is being hoarded .
And yes , there is deflationary pressure at the margin right now , at least on a directional basis , as the price of most assets continues downward .
On the opposite side of the ledger , USD cash and JPY cash strengthen .
However , it will not be possible for the USD to strengthen past the moment that auctions of US Treasuries start to go badly , as buyers either refuse to buy or start to demand much higher rates ( lower prices ) for those bonds .
When that point is hit ( or anticipated ) the USD will be unable to strengthen and the full effects of the current reflationary efforts will rush to center stage , as our purchasing power heads downward again .
So in a way , the inflation - deflation debate here in the US now moves directly to the fate of the US Treasury bond market .
On the matter of anticipation : investors in the US Treasury bond market can roughly be divided into two groups .
The first are price insensitive buyers like foreign governments who recycle dollars , and large pension funds who buy because of investment mandates .
The second are discretionary buyers , like mutual funds , hedge funds , individuals .
The second group will very likely have started exiting the US Treasury bond market before there are actual problems with rolling over the maturing debt .
This could begin at any time .
And there are hints the reactions may have already begun .
I have watched the growth of the public debt for years .
It was only 18 months ago that I wondered when the debt limit ceiling would be raised beyond 10 Trillion .
As you can see in the above graphic , we have exploded past that level now .
With more to come .
My view is that because current events in equity and credit markets are so dramatic , the market has not yet paid attention to the coming boundary , of debt - ology .
However , I expect participants to direct their thinking this way quickly , once the intensity of the crisis lessens .
I see two areas , where markets will inevitably focus .
First ,
The FED could be getting close to more unconventional measures , like direct buying of long - dated Treasuries to bring long - rates down .
Second , the quantity of new Treasury issuance , both in train and intended , is so gargantuan that it ’s not clear how the world would be able to actually take up the supply .
There may be structural limitations .
Simply put , it ’s not clear there ’s enough available capital in the world to increase the US debt position further .
After all , we have already been sucking up the world ’s savings for most of this decade .
It strikes me the only method to ensure this new supply is taken up would be that other central banks would eventually have to monetize the USA , in the same way the USA is monetizing its own banking system .
So future Treasury issuance may depend either on our own central bank to monetize it , or for foreign central banks to do the same .
When either happens , I ’m of the opinion it ’s Game Over .

ATHENS , Greece ( CNN ) --
Greek students have called for daily protests starting Monday , 10 days after the police killing of a 15 - year - old boy in Athens sparked demonstrations that have thrown the country into turmoil .
Riot police avoid being hit by a Molotov cocktail thrown by protesters in Athens .

Monday 's sit-in is set to take place in front of the country 's national police headquarters , with students urging similar demonstrations in front of police precincts across the country .
They have called for roads to be blocked on Tuesday , a demonstration Wednesday outside the courthouse where the police involved in the shooting will be testifying , and a nationwide protest on Thursday .
Authorities are bracing for potential violence following more than a week of riots which have become an outlet for simmering anger about the economy , education and jobs .
The unrest is threatening the government 's hold on power , with some opposition groups calling for fresh elections .
Stores and international businesses have been attacked , and at least 280 people have been detained by police .
Of that total , 176 were arrested , 130 of them over looting .
There was a rash of demonstrations Saturday , the one - week anniversary of the death of Alexis Grigoropolous , including attacks on a police station in the Athens district of Exarchaia and on the environment ministry building by angry protesters with stones and Molotov cocktails .
The main demonstration Saturday was a peaceful candlelit vigil in front of Parliament on Syntagma Square in the capital .
Several thousand people turned out for the demonstration , many of them students but including people of all ages and from all walks of life .
Demonstrators held a similar sit-in in the northern city of Thessaloniki .
Some stayed for an all - night sit-in .
There was relative calms in the streets and across the country as Sunday dawned .
The two officers involved in the December 6 shooting were remanded into custody Wednesday pending trial .
One is charged with premeditated manslaughter and the other with acting as an accomplice .
Journalist Anthee Carassava contributed to this report .

Psychological ( " personality " ) Types According to Jung 's theory of Psychological Types we are all different in fundamental ways .
One 's ability to process different information is limited by their particular type .
These types are sixteen .
People can be either Extroverts or Introverts , depending on the direction of their activity ; Thinking , Feeling , Sensing , Intuitive , according to their own information pathways ; Judging or Perceiving , depending on the method in which they process received information .
Extroverts vs. Introverts
Extroverts are directed towards the objective world whereas Introverts are directed towards the subjective world .
The most common differences between Extroverts and Introverts are shown below :
Extroverts
are interested in what is happening around them
are open and often talkative
compare their own opinions with the opinions of others
like action and initiative
easily make new friends or adapt to a new group
say what they think
are interested in new people
easily break unwanted relations Introverts
are interested in their own thoughts and feelings
need to have own territory
often appear reserved , quiet and thoughtful
usually do not have many friends
have difficulties in making new contacts
like concentration and quiet
do not like unexpected visits and therefore do not make them
work well alone
Sensing vs. Intuition
Sensing is an ability to deal with information on the basis of its physical qualities and its affection by other information .
Intuition is an ability to deal with the information on the basis of its hidden potential and its possible existence .
The most common differences between Sensing and Intuitive types are shown below :
Sensing types
see everyone and sense everything
live in the here and now
quickly adapt to any situation
like pleasures based on physical sensation
are practical and active
are realistic and self - confident Intuitive types
are mostly in the past or in the future
worry about the future more than the present
are interested in everything new and unusual
do not like routine
are attracted more to the theory than the practice
often have doubts
Thinking vs. Feeling
Thinking is an ability to deal with information on the basis of its structure and its function .
Feeling is an ability to deal with information on the basis of its initial energetic condition and its interactions .
The most common differences between Thinking and Feeling type are shown below :
Thinking types
are interested in systems , structures , patterns
expose everything to logical analysis
are relatively cold and unemotional
evaluate things by intellect and right or wrong
have difficulties talking about feelings
do not like to clear up arguments or quarrels Feeling types
are interested in people and their feelings
easily pass their own moods to others
pay great attention to love and passion
evaluate things by ethics and good or bad
can be touchy or use emotional manipulation
often give compliments to please people
Perceiving vs. Judging
Perceiving types are motivated into activity by the changes in a situation .
Judging types are motivated into activity by their decisions resulting from the changes in a situation .
The most common differences between Perceiving and Judging types are shown below :
Perceiving types
act impulsively following the situation
can start many things at once without finishing them properly
prefer to have freedom from obligations
are curious and like a fresh look at things
work productivity depends on their mood
often act without any preparation Judging types
do not like to leave unanswered questions
plan work ahead and tend to finish it
do not like to change their decisions
have relatively stable workability
easily follow rules and discipline
These four opposite pairs of preferences define eight different ways of dealing with information , which in turn result in sixteen Psychological Types :
ENTp , ISFp , ESFj , INTj , ENFj , ISTj , ESTp , INFp , ESFp , INTp , ENTj , ISFj , ESTj , INFj , ENFp and ISTp , where E - Extrovert , I - Introvert , S - Sensing , N - Intuitive , T - Thinking , F - Feeling , j - Judging , p - Perceiving .
So , ENTp for example would be Extrovert , Intuitive , Thinking and Perceiving type .

FORMULA BIT
The formal solution looks something like this :
Which looks a bit ( Dennis the ) menacing .
dW / dt is the rate you 're getting wet ( mass of rain per time incident on your body . )
ρ is the density of the rain shower ( mass of water in unit volume of atmosphere . )
V is the velocity of the rain relative to you , and d A represents a little bit of your body surface .
The large " S " shape tells you to add together all the rain falling on these little bits of body surface to calculate the total amount of wetness per time .
( Picky note : the summation should only be done over body surfaces facing the rain , or the equation will accidentally calculate " negative " rain that it thinks has passed right through your body . )
The relative velocity of the rain depends on the rain 's velocity , and your own velocity .
This is where we can introduce the possibility of someone running around in the rain .
The relative rain velocity , V , is equal to the true velocity of the rain minus the velocity of your body .
We can now put these in the above equation and write :
Where V P is the velocity of the person and V R the velocity of the rain .
( They 're not the wrong way round , because we dropped the minus sign . )
SO WHAT ?
Precisely !
The problem with a solution like this , is that although it is designed to be exactly correct , it is far too complicated to be of much use - because it can't easily be calculated .
For a start , the shape of a human body is too complex , and all parts of it are in different states of motion when running .
To get some answers the formal solution must be simplified by making some assumptions and approximations .
Physicists do this all the time - it is called " cheating " .
AN APPROXIMATE SOLUTION
This is where the fun starts .
To get some idea of how running around in the rain affects wetness , we 'll need to make some fairly significant simplifications .
We will assume that the rain is falling vertically and also that the person is running horizontally .
To get around the problem of our complex body shape , we 'll imagine our person as a rectangular block - like a house brick standing on end .
The smaller top surface of this " brick " is of area a and represents all our own top surfaces ( head and shoulders . )
The larger front surface of this brick is of area A and represents our front surfaces ( chest , stomach , front of arms , front of legs etc . )
This approximation wo n't give us the complete truth - but it might provide some insight into what is going on .
This enables us to produce our first " total wetness " equation .
It can be derived from the formal solution above , or worked out by other reasoning .
Anyway , here goes :
THE ( SIMPLIFIED ) TOTAL WETNESS EQUATION
Here W is the " total wetness " ( the total mass of rainwater on your body ) , ρ is the rain shower density as before , a our top surface area and A our front surface area .
V R and V P are the velocities of the rain and person respectively and t is the time spent out in the rain .
Looking at the equation , it 's clear that there is little we can do about the rain velocity , rain density and the size of our bodies ( except by dieting . )
The only quantities we can directly control in the total wetness equation are t ( the time spent in the rain ) and V P ( how fast we 're running . )
The equation tells us quite clearly that we get most wet if we :
1 ) stay out in the rain for a long time ( no surprise there )
and / or
2 ) run very fast
So running fast actually makes us wetter according to this analysis - the reason being that you are moving your front surface through the " rain field " , scooping up water as you go .
By the way , should you ever want to get really wet , the equation suggests you should stay out in the rain for a long time whilst running around like a maniac .
There 's more to it than this though .
Although running fast looks like a bad idea , what if we are running towards shelter - surely by running we will minimise the time spent in the rain ?
This is a fair point , and makes the first equation look incorrect - but in fact it is fine .
This is because the equation " knows " nothing about the possibility of shelter .
It simply tells us that if you 're in the rain , the best thing to do is stand still .
However , we can introduce the idea of shelter into it to get some further advice .
Let 's assume that when it starts to rain , you identify the nearest shelter and run towards it .
If the distance to the shelter is D , then the time spent in the rain ( t in the above equation ) will be D/V P .
If we insert this into the " total wetness " equation to replace t , we get the " modified simplified total wetness equation " which now includes the distance to the shelter D :
So here we have it - more mathematical advice to avoid getting wet .
Because we divide by V P in this equation , maximising our velocity now emerges as a good idea , assuming there is a shelter available .
SO SHOULD I RUN IN THE RAIN OR NOT ?
When it starts to rain , first identify the nearest shelter , and then run to it as quickly as you can .
This is remarkable , because that is precisely what most people do !
The power of mathematics has finally given us the reassurance that , when we run for that bus shelter , store canopy or random shop ( and start pretending to browse ) , we are getting it exactly right !
Bad news for Billy
Whizz though - the equation shows that you get wet no matter how fast you run , with a minimum value of W = ρAD .
PS : If the rain is falling at an angle it is possible to decrease your total wetness by running in the correct direction .
Unfortunately this may not coincide with the nearest shelter direction .
If you are worried about this , we may be able to deal with it in a further instalment .
PPS : Alternatively , ignore the maths and get an umbrella .

Mother and her baby son attacked by two pitbulls - but dogs ' owner walks away
A mother has told how she was mauled by two pitbull terriers and her baby knocked to the ground in his pram .
Concert pianist Mary Duella , who was left with deep wounds to her arm and leg , is due to have a skin graft and faces permanent scarring .
She is also unsure if she will be able to play the piano professionally again but is determined to resume her career .
Mauled : Mary Duella , 35 , suffered deep wounds to her arm and leg after being attacked by two pitbull terriers
The 35 - year - old was walking home with her 19 - month - old - son Daithi after playing at a jazz concert nearby to raise awareness for an arts cafe .
She was metres away from her home next to Plumstead Common last Sunday when two dogs ran past her as their owner shouted at them to come back .
' They just turned on me , knocking me to the floor and the baby 's buggy was knocked over too , ' she said .
Knocked over : 19 - month - old Daithi Duella was sleeping in his pram at the time of the attack
' I had one attached to my arm , another to my leg and I had all these things racing through my mind .
' The first was my baby - as long as they were on me they could n't attack him .
Mercifully he was still asleep and so not making any noise .
' The second was my career and if I 'd ever be able to play again .
I just had to lie there and wait for them to stop . '
Eventually the owner managed to pull the dogs off Ms Duella before putting them on a leash and calmly walking away from the scene as neighbours , who heard Ms Duella 's screams , came out to help her .
Husband Darragh Morgan , also a professional musician , cancelled the rest of his tour in Lisbon to catch the first flight home on hearing the news .
Ms Duella was taken to St Thomas ' Hospital where she has had two operations while under general anaesthetic to remove dead skin and deep clean the wounds .
She is due to have skin removed from one part of her leg to be grafted onto the leg wound .
The bites were so deep her muscles have been ruptured , but both Ms Duella and violinist Mr Morgan are hopeful that she will fully recover .
Mr Morgan , 34 , said : ' It was just horrible being away from her when I heard what had happened .
' Of course I cancelled the rest of my performances and the next tour and Mary has had to begin postponing concerts until next year .
Vicious :
Mary believes the law should be tougher on the owners of pitbull terriers
' She is shattered from not getting any sleep in hospital and keen to get some counselling .
' Our moods are swinging from shock , to anger at the owner and these types of dogs .
There 's also a huge amount of relief that it was n't worse .
If it had been the baby he would have been killed .
' I truly believe that the law should be a lot tougher and if anyone is even caught with one of these dogs not on a leash they should be prosecuted . '
Police are investigating the attack .

How To Upgrade FreeBSD 7.0 to 7.1 Stable Release
Q. How do I upgrade FreeBSD 7.0 server to latest 7.1 server with stock GENERIC kernel installed ?
A . The freebsd - update utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases .
Systems running 7.0 - RELEASE , 7.1- BETA , 7.1- BETA2 , 7.1- RC1 , or 7.1 - RC2 can be only upgrade as follows .
ADVERTISEMENTS
Login as root user and type the command :
WARNING !
These examples may crash your server if not executed with care .
Upgrading system is a complex procedure .
Backup your data , config file and make sql dumps before you use the following instructions .

Backup your data , config file and make sql dumps before you use the following instructions .
If you are using custom kernel configuration , you need to perform source code update using cvsup method
# freebsd - update upgrade -r 7.1 - RELEASE
During this process , FreeBSD
Update may ask the user to help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that the automatically performed merging was done correctly .
# freebsd - update install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# reboot
After rebooting , freebsd - update needs to be run again to install the new userland components , and the system needs to be rebooted again :
# freebsd - update install
Users of Intel network interfaces which are changing their name from “ em ” to “ igb ” should make necessary changes to configuration files BEFORE running freebsd - update , since otherwise the network interface will not be configured appropriately after rebooting for the first time , especially firewall and other networking options in /etc /rc.conf file .
# reboot
Users of earlier FreeBSD releases ( FreeBSD 6.x ) can also use freebsd - update to upgrade to FreeBSD 7.1 , but will be prompted to rebuild all third - party applications ( e.g. , anything installed from the ports tree ) after the second invocation of “ freebsd - update install ” , in order to handle differences in the system libraries between FreeBSD 6.x and FreeBSD 7.x .
Upgrade all packages
You also need to update all packages , type :
# portsnap fetch update
# pkg_version - vIL=
# portupgrade -a
One of the first things the Obama Administration is interested in doing is exploring how the United States government can use open source software rather than rely on proprietary software that is viewed as costing to much money .
So at a time when corporations are cutting jobs left and right and our economy is in jeopardy , one of the first priorities of President Obama is to determine whether it is feasible to stop relying on proprietary software bought from companies like Microsoft , Oracle and IBM .
Much like those who supported Obama only to find out that he would appoint a fiercely pro RIAA attorney to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States , I suspect that there are many in Silicon Valley and beyond who supported President Obama and are now enormously troubled by the fact that his Administration seems ready and willing to proceed with open source , anti-proprietary solutions .
This does not bode well for those concerned by what President Obama ’s view of proprietary rights will be .
I know that many governments around the world are turning to open source solutions to cut costs , and according to a recent article by the BBC , the global loss due to proprietary software is $ 1 trillion a year , with the loss to the US being about $ 400 billion .
But what exactly does it mean that proprietary software causes a loss ?
I guess the thinking is that if you go open source then US companies and governments do n’t have to pay $ 400 billion a year to those companies that develop proprietary solutions .
That is n’t exactly a loss though is it ?
Of course not .
If the US were to go open source then take another $ 400 billion out of the US economy , not a wise thing to do at the moment if you ask me .
Although it would sure go a long way to paying for the pork that is going to be in the next stimulus package .
Killing US high - tech industry in order to pay for stimulus that will have questionable value does n’t seem like a good trade - off to me .
Open source advocates are going to love the fact that Obama wants to transition the US government away from proprietary solutions .
I do n’t have any dislike for open source advocates , and I wish them well .
I do have a different view of the economics though , and of the patent system .
I hear all the time that software patents prohibit innovation , but then when you talk to those who say they cannot create because of patents it is clear that they do n’t understand patent law and are saying that not because it is true , but because that is what they belief .
It always comes as a shock to computer programmers when they learn that just because it is in a patent does n’t mean you ca n’t take it without infringing .
They just do n’t fully understand that for their to be infringement each and every element of a patent claim needs to be taken and residing in the allegedly infringing product .
If you explain it that way then those who are honest realize that most software patents really prevent very little creativity .
I do n’t harbor ill will against those who are anti-software patent , I just wish we could really have an open discussion about the issues with the legal reality mattering .
I know there are software patents out there that should never have issued , but when the talk centers on patentable subject matter or myths then I have problems .
Software ought to be patentable subject matter , and stuff that is not specific and enabled ought not to be patented .
But before public sentiment is turned against software innovations should n’t we get the facts about infringement straight and ask what is really best for the economy and to foster innovation ?
In any event , the fact that President Obama wants to discuss open source is fine , but it does make me wonder what he thinks about patents .
There is just a diametrically opposite view between open source and proprietary innovations , and it is critically important to know whether the man who will appoint the next Director of the USPTO believes in the patent system or believes that patents hurt innovation .
There is simply no proof that patents harm innovation , and the tales that patents do harm innovation are based on inaccurate understandings of the law and faulty economic analysis .
Since the patent system in the US has been strong we have enjoyed tremendous economic growth .
That is not coincidental ; it is cause and effect .
President Obama he has turned to Scott McNealy , a co-founder of Sun Microsystems , to lead his open source charge , a fact that is sure to irritate some supporters in Silicon Valley who do not particularly identify with Sun .
While you might expect many in the tech community to embrace a movement toward open source , here is what Ars Technica had to say , in part , about Obama ’sdecision , particularly the decision to turn to McNealy :
Although Obama ’s interest in open source looks like a promising sign that the incoming government is serious about reforming federal IT procurement policies , the decision to call on Sun ’s eccentric co-founder is an incomprehensible twist .
McNealy ’s long history of bizarre and contradictory positions on open source software make him a less than ideal candidate for helping to shape national policy on the subject .
Asking Scott McNealy to write a paper about open source software is a bit like asking Dick Cheney to write a paper about government transparency .
And here is what CNET had to say , in part :
While I agree with those benefits [ of open source ] , I ’m not a supporter of mandates .
I would n’t want the government mandating Microsoft software –why would I therefore seek an open - source mandate ?
Open source has done remarkably well in the U.S. federal government without mandates , and will continue to do so because of the benefits identified by McNealy .
The trouble I have is that once again the US government seems to be interested in picking the winners and losers rather than letting the marketplace do that .
As some industries get bailed out and other do not , and as some companies within industries get bailed out and others in the same industry do not , this is just more evidence of the government putting its finger on the scales .
It is naive to think that if the federal government goes open source that it will not cause many companies that deal with the federal government to go open source .
As the tidal wave continues it will be good for the open source community and service companies , and a whole lot of high paying , high - tech jobs will be lost .
That is simply not a good trade , not right now at a time when our economy is so fragile .
It 's that time of year where the industry tends to look back on the previous 12 months and try to make predictions about where we are going .
For example , Eric Roch gives his top - ten predictions for 2009 which include :
2 . Big bang SOA software projects shut down in favor of incremental projects with well defined ROI .
4 . Difficulty in differentiating major SOA software vendor 's offerings drives down software costs 5 . Information technology looks to open source SOA as a way to save costs and will often opt - out of commercial support programs pressuring for profit open source even as adoption accelerates .
7 . Arcane architecture terms like SOA , WOA and REST become less relevant as tools to support the technologies blur distinctions .
In a comment to Eric 's post , Mike Kavis adds :
I also predict that Cloud Computing will take over the hype machine from SOA ( if it has n't already ) and the same discussions we had with SOA will now occur with the clouds .
You remember those : Real deal vs. next fad , talk to the business vs do n't talk to the business , and all of the arguing over semantics and terminology .
In a separate article , Joe McKendrick takes a stab at some predictions too , while starting with a brief retrospective :
The year 2008 was the best of times and the worst of times for service oriented architecture .
SOA seemed to become more and more pervasive across companies , and many companies in general seemed positive about the results being delivered so far .
At the same time , there has been no shortage of anti-SOA backlash and skepticism about the return on investment and business value of SOA .
Joe 's predictions , which have some agreements with Eric's , include :
1 ) Economic turmoil will return SOA to its roots - bottom up , incremental .
Uncertainty in the economy will carry through 2009 , but we ’ll move into the recovery stage .
However , this wo n’t change the razor - edge competitive environment - companies will continue to seek solutions that help streamline and cut costs .
This is a natural role for SOA - based practices – remember , Web services and SOA were forged in the wake of the downturn of 2001 as a way to increase IT efficiency and value to the business with minimal additional investments .
3 ) Internal clouds and micro-outsourcing .
There has been a lot of industry discussion about the “ internal cloud , ” in which services are provided to users and systems within organizations .
The beauty of internal clouds , of course , is that they offer more control over applications and data .
Clearly a natural role for SOA , which will be the backbone of any emerging internal clouds .
As part of this role , expect to see SOA play a greater role in grid computing and virtualization as well .
Dana Gardner reports on what a range of analysts are predicting on enterprise IT , SOA , cloud and business intelligence , including :
Finally , Zapthink presents their own retrospective on 2008 and predictions , which start with :
[...] we will see at least one notable and well - publicized SOA failure and one notable and well - publicized SOA success .
So that we can accurately determine if we successfully called this prediction at this time next year , let ’s define our terms .
By “ notable and well - publicized ” , we mean that the company in question will be featured in at least one major IT industry trade magazine and perhaps even a major international news daily .
The success or failure will have significant business impact specifically attributable to the organization ’s adoption of SOA .
On the success side , it might mean specific revenue , product release , merger and acquisition opportunity , or reduced liability directly attributable to a particular SOA project .
On the failure side , it would mean a large investment in SOA , whose “ failure ” ( as determined by the company in question ) resulted in loss of revenue , market share , opportunity , compliance , or other negative impact .
Either way , we will acknowledge that by this time next year , there will be at least one undisputed success and one undisputed failure due to SOA .
For their next prediction Zapthink share a view on cloud computing and SOA that we have heard from others :
We have already started to hear more about cloud computing and anything cloud - related as the year drew to a close .
We expect the din of the cloud - related chatter to turn into a real roar by this time next year .
Everything SOA - related will probably be turned into something cloud - related by all the big vendors , and companies will desperately try to turn their SOA initiatives into cloud initiatives .
Time will tell if this emphasis on cloud computing is a good thing for the future of SOA and IT , but we are hopeful that some of the themes that are emerging in cloud computing will borrow heavily from what was learned about SOA , and Service - oriented cloud computing initiatives become the rule in 2009 , rather than the exception .
Only time will tell as to which , if any , of the predictions mentioned above prove accurate .
But it is interesting to see the inherent agreement on certain topics , such as cloud computing , governance and small - scale SOA .
The Truth
The Tempest sits on a quiet side street in San Francisco , just a few blocks from the Moscone Center .
Eric , the bartender and proprietor , resembles a cross between Wilford Brimley and Popeye .
The interior consists of a single large square room .
There is a pool table , a bar that runs the length of the wall opposite the entrance , and a sprinkling of small square particleboard tables and shabby chairs .
A handful of bicycles hang from the high ceiling , for reasons unclear .
The walls are festooned with various mass - market beer posters and memorabilia celebrating Eric ’s beloved home - state Kansas Jayhawks .
The high ceilings and generic dive bar atmosphere almost make it feel more like a movie set of a bar than an actual bar .
At some bars you have a drink ; at The Tempest you just drink .
The beer selection is decent , the prices cheap , the service prompt .
Neither the small TVs hanging above the bar ( sporting events , naturally ) nor the music play loudly ; the only real noise is the best noise for a bar : conversation .
The Tempest is exactly the bar it wants to be .
And on Monday 5 January 2009 , the eve of the final Macworld Expo Apple keynote address , it was filled with Mac nerds from across the continent .
Because Eric is both the owner and sole employee , The Tempest is exempt from California ’s law banning smoking in bars and restaurants .
And so patrons smoke .
For better or worse , this bestows The Tempest with a visceral timelessness .
Smell is the sense most connected to memory , and The Tempest smells like a throwback to a bygone era .
It is as it was .
Come next January , The Tempest will remain unchanged .
Macworld Expo will not .
In 2004 IDG changed the name of the show to “ Macworld Conference and Expo ” , but it ’ll always be just “ Macworld Expo ” to me , and , colloquially ( and much to the chagrin of my friends at the same - named magazine , who are constantly fighting both to keep the w lowercase and to emphasize that the Expo is run by a different arm of the same parent company ) , we all just really call it “ Macworld ” .
Even at its nadir early this decade , when the show was truly only about the Mac and not an ever - expanding universe of Apple platforms ( iPod and iPhone ) , and when the Mac platform itself seemed on unsteady ground , Macworld Expo San Francisco was still big .
For the last few years , though , the show has bulked back up to its prime fighting weight — more exhibitors , bigger crowds .
The Moscone Center complex consists of three buildings : North , South , and West .
West is where WWDC takes place .
It ’s a lovely convention and conference space , above ground , airy , flooded with sunlight .
The North and South halls are older and below ground , connected by a wide subterranean passageway underneath Howard Street .
There is nothing wrong with either North or South , but there ’s nothing particularly right about them , either .
South is the main hall , housing Apple ’s massive exhibit space ( “ booth ” does n’t do it justice ) and most of the other major A - list exhibitors .
South Hall always looks good at Macworld Expo — North Hall is where you go to judge the health of the show .
In weak years , North Hall has resembled more of a flea market than a top - line technology convention .
In strong years , the entrance to North Hall fills you with a Holy crap , we ’re only halfway done feeling after having made your way through the South Hall .
( Everyone walking the show floor starts in the South Hall . )
The North Hall looked good , if not great , this year .
The key to a good Expo is the mix between exhibitors .
It ’s a cocktail .
A healthy Expo has the right ratio of large , expensive , polished booths and those with a decidedly lower - rent production value to them .
These small pedestrian booths are often just the exhibitors you want to meet — not glib salesmen or polished marketroids , but actual engineers , designers , and entrepreneurs , people who ’ve put their lives into and banked their careers on the products they ’re exhibiting to promote .
These are the booths where you find Expo gold — products you need or want but had never heard of before .
But an overabundance of these unpolished exhibits gives the overall show floor a rather ragtag appearance .
There ’s a symbiotic relationship at play between the large and small exhibitors , sort of like that between the Orange Julius and Macy ’s at your local mall .
Apple ’s massive , central exhibit space has always been the sun around which the rest of the Expo orbits .
It ’s hard to imagine the South Hall at Macworld Expo without it .
( Perhaps the entire Expo can now move across the street to Moscone West — better to make the show look entirely different than to attempt a combover to mask the bald spot Apple is leaving behind in the South Hall . )
I walked the floor several times over several days this year , and spoke to dozens of exhibitors .
Always the same two questions :
How ’s the show going ?
and So what about next year ?
The answers were nearly always the same : Pretty good — we did n’t know what to expect , but we ’ve been busy .
And :
We ’d like to come back again next year , but we want to see who else is going to be here first .
I do n’t know if Macworld Expo is going to survive without Apple , but the overwhelming majority of exhibitors I spoke to very much want it to .
But Apple ’s decision raises a crisp question .
What , exactly , is the point ?
The show was created 25 years ago , long before personal computers even shipped with networking features .
Today , everyone not only uses the Internet , they carry it with them everywhere they go .
1
You no longer need to be in the same place to forge a community or to gain a customer .
Apple has repeatedly asserted — including Phil Schiller , at the outset of his keynote address — that they no longer need Macworld Expo because they reach so many customers through Apple Stores .
Something along the lines of an entire Macworld Expo worth of customers visit Apple Stores worldwide every single week .
No doubt that ’s true .
But there are major differences .
For one thing , at an Apple Store you meet Apple retail sales people .
At the Expo , you can meet people who actually create and design Apple products .
And the difference for exhibitors other than Apple is stark .
First , as IDG ’s Paul Kent pointed out , 90 percent of the products exhibited at Macworld Expo this year are n’t available in Apple ’s retail stores .
But even for those products that are , they ’re just boxes on shelves .
You do n’t meet customers by getting your product in the Apple Store , and there is something palpably different and important about meeting your customers and your peers in person .
As the world goes ever more digital , the remaining real - world interactions become more valuable .
If the only purpose of Macworld Expo , from Apple ’s perspective , was to showcase the company ’s own latest products , then they ’re right , they no longer have any need for it .
But the rest of us do .
Macworld Expo brings together the full spectrum of people involved in this racket .
Designers , engineers , marketing guys , managers , the press , and , yes , just plain users .
There is nothing else like Macworld Expo , and if it fades away , there will be nothing to take its place .
What everyone wishes is that Apple had n’t done this .
That we could plan on coming back next year and have it be the same .
But we ca n’t have that .
Apple did pull out .
It will never be the same .
What it will be , we do n’t yet know .
“ I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine - to - five hours , ” Hunter S. Thompson wrote .
I suggest a corollary : that the truth often resists being written down or transmitted over a wire , and will only be told to your face .
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will direct federal regulators today to move swiftly on an application by California and 13 other states to set strict automobile emissions and fuel efficiency standards , two administration officials said Sunday evening .
The directive makes good on an Obama campaign pledge and signifies a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy .
Granting California and the other states the right to regulate tailpipe emissions would be one of the most emphatic actions Obama could take to quickly put his stamp on environmental policy .
Automobile manufacturers will quickly have to retool to begin producing and selling cars and trucks that get higher mileage than the national standard , and on a faster phase - in schedule .
The auto companies have lobbied hard against the regulations and challenged them in court .
The decision is a major victory for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - California , who pressed the Bush White House relentlessly to allow the California law , signed into law in 2002 by former Gov. Gray Davis , to go forward .
It required carmakers to reduce greenhouse emissions 30 percent by 2016 .
But it could not take effect until the U.S. EPA granted California a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act to set rules tougher than federal law requires .
The EPA had granted such waivers routinely more than 40 times back to the early 1970s .
As a result , California became a trendsetter in air pollution regulation for the rest of the country , passing the first rules to ban leaded gasoline , require catalytic converters and other environmental standards , nearly all of which were copied by other states then adopted by the federal government .
The Bush administration denied the waiver in late 2007 , saying that allowing California and the 13 other states the right to set their own pollution rules would result in an unenforceable patchwork of environmental law .
The auto companies had advocated the denial , saying a waiver would require them to produce two sets of vehicles , one to meet the strict California standard and another that could be sold in the remaining states .
The Bush administration ’s environmental agency director , Stephen L. Johnson , echoed the automakers ’ claims in denying California ’s application , ignoring the near - unanimous advice of agency lawyers and scientists that the waiver be granted .
Beyond acting on the California emissions law , officials said , Obama will announce that he is moving forward with nationwide regulations requiring the automobile industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to comply with a 2007 law — rules that the Bush administration decided at the last minute not to issue .
He will also order federal departments and agencies to find new ways to save energy and be more environmentally friendly .
And he will highlight the elements in his economic plan intended to create new jobs around renewable energy .
Obama will use the announcement to bolster the impression of a sharp break from the Bush era on all fronts , following his decisions last week to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba ; tighten limits on interrogation tactics by Central Intelligence Agency officers ; order plans to withdraw combat forces from Iraq ; and reverse Bush ’s financing restrictions on groups that provide or discuss abortion overseas , administration officials said .
The announcements , to be made in the East Room , will begin a week of efforts to get the economic stimulus plan through Congress .
The White House hopes the Senate will confirm Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary on Monday , and Obama plans to travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with both Senate and House Republican caucuses and lobby for his stimulus package .
Obama ’s aides expect the House to vote on its plan on Wednesday .
On Wednesday , Schwarzenegger sent a letter to Obama asking him to “ immediately reconsider ” the Bush administration ’s denial of California ’s waiver request .
In the letter , the governor called Bush ’s decision ‘ fundamentally flawed , ’ and added that if Obama approved the program it “ will not only reduce these emissions , but will also save drivers money and reduce our nation ’s dependence on imported oil . ”
The 13 states that have adopted California ’s standards but could not enforce them until the waiver was signed are Arizona , Connecticut , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
Other states , including Florida , Iowa , North Carolina , and Utah are considering adoption of the program .
The California Air Resources Board has estimated that by 2020 , the new rules would cut greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles by 18 percent , and 27 percent by 2030 .
The head of California ’s Air Resources Board , Mary D. Nichols , also wrote to the new director of the environmental agency , Lisa P. Jackson , asking for a quick reversal of the Bush policy .

The founder of the Lashkar - e - Taiba militant group , which has been blamed for the Mumbai attacks in India , has been detained by Pakistani authorities , according to his spokesman .
It is understood Hafiz Mohammad Saeed is being held in his house in eastern Pakistan .
" Police have encircled the house of Hafiz Saeed in Lahore and told him he cannot go out of the home , " his spokesman Abdullah Montazir told Reuters .
" They have told him detention orders will be formally served to him shortly . "
Saeed quit the leadership of Lashkar - e - Taiba in 2001 to become head of a charity , Jamaat - ud - Dawa .
However , analysts have suggested the charity is being used as a front for the militant group .
Saeed quit the leadership of Lashkar - e - Taiba in 2001 to become head of a charity , Jamaat - ud - Dawa .
However , analysts have suggested the charity is being used as a front for the militant group , which was banned by the government in 2002 after it and another militant group were blamed for an attack on the Indian parliament .
Jamaat - ud - Dawa was already on a Pakistani watchlist and police in Karachi and Hyderabad today sealed its offices in the cities .
The house arrest followed an announcement by the Pakistani prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , that his government would comply with UN curbs on Saeed and his charity .
Gilani told the visiting US deputy secretary of state , John Negroponte , that Pakistan would fulfil its " international obligations " after the UN sanctions .
A spokesman for the central bank said directives had been issued to banks to freeze the accounts of Jamaat - ud - Dawa and all those included in the UN sanctions .
The UN's security council committee has added Saeed and Jamaat - ud - Dawa to a list of people and organisations linked to al - Qaida or the Taliban , along with three of Saeed 's associates .
They will be subjected to sanctions in which their assets are frozen and restrictions are imposed on travel .
Saeed founded Lashkar in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir .
He quit in 2001 , days before it was banned , but stayed as head of the charity , raising funds and seeking recruits .
Researchers Develop Super - Efficient LED
Light
January 12th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
LED light bulbs are already more efficient than your average bulb , but researchers at the Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute have developed a new kind of LED that exhibits both improved energy efficiency and lighting performance .
The researchers ‘ polarization - matching LED shows an 18 percent increase in light output and a 22 percent increase in wall plug efficiency ( the amount of electricity that the LED converts into light ) .
Renssalaer ’s LED is more powerful thanks to a reduction in “ efficiency droop ” , which makes LEDs most efficient when receiving low - density electrical currents and least efficient when higher density electrical currents are received .
The research team figured out that the region of the LED where light is generated contains materials with mismatched polarization .
By reducing the polarization mismatch , electron leakage can also be reduced , thus increasing energy efficiency .
So Renssalaer ’s researchers introduced a new design with better matched polarization .
As expected , they saw a reduction in efficiency droop and electron leakage .
Since LED lights are not yet entirely mainstream , advances made now can easily be implemented in both current and future LED installations .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A brick is a modular masonry unit , something that would n't appear to " want to be " composed into undulating surfaces .
Of course this does n't stop architects from trying , from using limitations as inspiration and opportunities for doing something new .
The idea of creating curves from orthogonal materials is not new .
Modern examples of undulating brick walls include such mid-century designs as Eero Saarinen 's 1955 MIT Chapel , where fairly regular ins - and - outs create an embracing space for worship .
[ MIT Chapel by Eero Saarinen | image source Similar forms were created by Uruguay 's Eladio Dieste , an engineer who exploited a technique of reinforcing brick walls , an innovation that could be considered his own .
The Church of Christ the Worker is a stunning examples of how Dieste engineering prowess led to sensually appealing forms , undulating in plan but also leaning in section , following the roof also undulating overhead .
The image below shows how he revealed the thickness of these walls , showing how the bricks supported themselves in relatively thin sections , unlike the thick load - bearing masonry walls of the Monadnock Building and the like .
[ Church of Christ the Worker by Eladio Dieste | image source
Thanks to engineers like Dieste , and advances in computer drafting and manufacturing , architects are trying similar forms , but less regular and repetitious .
An unbuilt 1999 project in Green Bay , Wisconsin by Office dA -- a firm that thrives on the unconventional composition of materials -- is a good example of this trend .
Gaps in a rectangular shell give the impression of carvings in a brick mass .
Up close the " truth " is revealed , that the wall is but a wrapper that is manipulated for effect .
[ Witte Arts Building by Office dA | image source Erick van Egeraat 's design for an art gallery in Cork , Ireland is a masonry execution of " blob " architecture , achieved via a thin - joint mortar system , in which bricks are glued together on a backing , more akin to precast systems than the conventional on - site stacking of bricks .
Egeraat uses this technique as a sort of flourish in the Crawford Art Gallery 's facade , a one - off design not dependent on structure like the earlier examples above .
The subsequent implementation of undulating brick walls is more in keeping with Dieste 's techniques than Egeraat's .
[ Cork Gallery of Art by Erick van Egeraat | image source ROTO Architecture 's design for a building at Prairie View A&M University in Texas recalls Dieste 's expression of the wall 's thickness , as well as SITE 's series of 1970's Best Product showrooms which treated the brick facade like a thin veneer shed by the big box behind it .
Prairie View 's brick facade peels away to allow access to , and light to enter , the interior .
This playful maneuver activates a long elevation otherwise punctuated by small , apparently random windows .
[ Architecture and Art Building by ROTO Architects | image source Last is 290 Mulberry , a condo building now under construction in New York City .
Designed by SHoP Architects , the facades are covered in a patterned brick that appears at once undulating and folded .
The vertical joints in the rendering below make me believe that the construction is more akin to the precast Crawford Art Gallery than the other examples here .
In design it recalls the mid-century designs of Saarinen and Dieste , where repetition is key ; it is evident here , but in a more complex and decorative form .
It creates a pattern , a texture that unfortunately recalls architecture 's past , not its future .

BBC diplomatic correspondent , Washington
Violence has erupted as Obama 's administration prepares to take office US President - elect Barack Obama has signalled clearly that he intends to grapple with the problems of the Middle East from the outset of his presidency .
Richard Haass , head of the Council on Foreign Relations , underlined the point .
" What the Gaza crisis has done is to remind us - as if anyone really needed reminding - that the Middle East is not stable , " he said .
" And it wo n't wait for the new administration to decide when it is ready to address it . "
But what can the Obama administration do differently ?
' Other ways '
There has been a good deal of speculation - especially in the British press - about the possibility that the Obama team might take the unprecedented step of seeking direct talks with Hamas .
Everyone I have spoken to here rules this out - certainly unless Hamas renounces violence and meets a variety of other conditions .
But Robert Malley , head of the International Crisis Group 's Middle East programme , said : " This is not an on and off switch , where you either embrace Hamas or necessarily boycott it .
There may be other ways . "
He spoke of his hope that the incoming Obama administration would " show some creativity in terms of allowing third parties to talk to Hamas and not trying to stand in their way " .
Hamas may not see any sense in reconciliation with Fatah If , for example , there were to be a Palestinian national unity government encompassing Hamas members , he hoped that an Obama administration would " judge it by its behaviour and what it does on the ground " .
Does it adhere to its ceasefire ?
Does it allow the PLO [ Palestine Liberation Organisation ] chairman to negotiate an agreement with Israel ?
Does it say that it will allow that agreement to be put to a popular referendum and adhere to the results of that referendum ?
" That 's how the next administration may in fact want to deal with this problem without tackling that very poisonous question of whether you actually engage with Hamas , " Mr Malley said .
' Bankrupt policy ' For Mr Haass , the shift in US foreign policy towards the Middle East is a matter of tone as well as substance .
He believes that the new president should move swiftly to set out his thinking on the region .
Such a step , he says , would underscore " a new American activism and a new American emphasis on diplomacy " .
We have been seeing over the past two years the impossibility of half a Palestinian entity making peace with Israel
Robert Malley , International Crisis Group
What is absolutely clear , though , is that the existing policies of the Bush era cannot continue , especially those that sought to capitalise on Palestinian division .
According to Mr Malley this was a " bankrupt policy " right from the outset .
" It was n't simply accepting Palestinian divisions , it was encouraging them , " he said .
" We have been seeing over the past two years the impossibility of half a Palestinian entity making peace with Israel , especially when we are talking about fundamental issues like Jerusalem , statehood , borders , refugees and so on . "
Indeed , Mr Malley believes the Bush administration 's position has shifted slightly in recent days .
The recent United Nations Security Council resolution on the Gaza fighting , which the US supported even though it abstained , calls for Palestinian national reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas .
This , he says , " is an extraordinary turnaround for the Bush administration , something which they fought tooth and nail against for two years .
" Clearly it is something that is going to have to happen if the goal is to have genuine , meaningful negotiations on existential issues between Israel and the Palestinians . "
How that gets translated into policy , Mr Malley says , will be crucial .
The new president faces many challenges in the Middle East " How do you actually say you want unity , but at the same time you do n't want to deal with one party to that unity ?
" That 's the dilemma that the Obama administration is going to face and I do n't know , right now , if they know how they will deal with it . "
But all this talk of Palestinian unity as the principal way ahead begs a fundamental question - one that is even more stark in the wake of the fighting in the Gaza Strip .
Why should Hamas in particular , which may well emerge from this experience bloodied but with its reputation bolstered , agree to seek reconciliation with its Fatah rival ?
" That 's a very interesting question , " Mr Malley said .
" There are things that were possible two years ago which may not be possible now . "
Gloomy conclusion
There were , he said , " various different soundings coming from Hamas " .
With the right mix of inducements and pressure , he hoped Hamas could be brought round to see the benefits of reconciliation with Fatah .
But his overall conclusion is gloomy .
" At this point my fear and my suspicion is that neither Hamas nor Fatah sees a real benefit in reconciliation , because each side would have to give up something that is far too precious .
" Hamas would have to give up monopoly control over the Gaza Strip and Fatah would have to give up its virtual monopoly control over West Bank and the PLO .
" And those are assets that both would be very hard - pressed to relinquish . "

A depraved mother who tortured her six children with years of incest and abuse in a " House of Horrors " in the west of Ireland was jailed for seven years today .
The 40 - year - old alcoholic , from Roscommon , admitted she was the worst mother in the world after she put her youngsters through a harrowing catalogue of neglect including forcing her 13 - year - old son to have sex with her .
She is the first woman in the history of the Irish state to be convicted of incest .
The woman , who can not be named to protect her children , was sentenced to seven years after pleading guilty at Roscommon Circuit Court to 10 charges , including two of incest , two of sexual abuse and six of neglect and wilful ill - treatment and neglect of the children between 1998 and 2004 .
Judge Miriam Reynolds told the court that the children had been failed by everybody .
" Any possibility of them having a normal and proper life has been stolen from them by this woman who called herself their mother , " the judge said .
" They feel guilty .
They feel they did something wrong .
I can assure them that they did not . "
The judge has also suggested that new laws may be needed to deal with incest cases involving mothers .
" The children have to know that this is wrong and that their mother was punished for it .
She must be punished for it , " she told the court .
Judge Reynolds imposed 10 sentences ranging from 18 months to seven years - the longest term for sexual assault - all of which will run concurrently .
Horrific details of how she abused her children were laid bare yesterday .
Six young children were forced to endure years of depravity at the family home , described in court as a " house of horrors " .
The court yesterday heard that :
One of the children , a 13 - year - old boy , was forced to have sex with his mother on four occasions .
He and his brothers and sisters were dirty , smelly , hungry , cold and lived alongside rats and mice .
Their mother admitted a total of 10 charges , including two of incest , two of sexual abuse and six of neglect and wilful ill - treatment and neglect of the children .
The 40 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , is the first woman in the state to be convicted of incest against one of her children and is due to be sentenced today .
The offences took place at the family 's three - bedroom bungalow in Co Roscommon between 1998 and 2004 .
Childcare staff told Roscommon Circuit Court yesterday that a right - wing Catholic organisation was behind a High Court move to prevent the children being taken into care .
Senior childcare officials with HSE
West outlined their views to Judge Miriam Reynolds after details of the nightmare existence of the six young children were revealed .
In an interview with gardai in 2006 , she admitted that her children were often blue with the cold , only had dinner twice a week and had lice crawling around their bodies .
" It was a house of horrors ... with bells on , " the woman told gardai .
She added : " I can safely say I am the worst mother in the world ... I do n't deserve to get them ( the children ) back . "
The children are now all living with foster families , they are all extremely damaged and one of them has threatened suicide .
The oldest boy , in a victim impact statement , said he would never forgive his mother .
Since 1996 , home - help and social workers had been visiting the family because of childcare issues , but Judge Reynolds expressed her concern that it had not been until 2004 that the children were eventually taken into care .
Senior childcare workers with HSE
West told the judge that on September 30 , 2000 , a voluntary agreement was reached between the health board and the mother , to have the children cared for by an aunt and uncle .
But the mother had become involved with " a right - wing Catholic organisation " to finance and support her going to the High Court to get an injunction restraining the Health Board from acting .
The mother personally moved the injunction at the High Court three days later , Judge Reynolds heard .
HSE
West childcare manager Paddy Gannon said that after she obtained the ex-parte injunction restraining the Health Board for carrying out the care arrangement , she personally presented it to childcare officials in Co Roscommon .
" It was a bolt from the blue , " said Mr Gannon .
" The Health Board was prevented from moving the children from the home as part of a care plan . "
Mr Gannon said that around the time of the High Court application , he received correspondence from Mina Bean Ui Chroibin , stating that it was support the family needed and not intrusive action by the health board .
Mr Gannon intimated that he believed Bean Ui Chroibin 's organisation was behind the application to the court , but he had no evidence to that effect .
Shock
Because of improvements at the family home up to May , 2004 -- largely brought about by the " shock " of the circumstances leading to the High Court action , Mr Gannon said -- the health authorities did not move to take the children from the family home until the abuse was reported to them by one of the boys .
Yesterday , a stunned courtroom listened to shocking details of the family 's home life .
From the time they were born until they were placed in foster care in 2004 , the children were subjected to appalling neglect and a range of disturbing abuse , the court heard .
In a statement taken in June 2005 , one of the boys described his home as a kip .
It was always untidy with rubbish thrown everywhere .
The house was always cold and the walls were damp .
The range was only lit once a month and the children were left alone at night while their mother went to the pub .
He and his brother were left to care for the younger children and their mother would come home at between 3 am and 4 am , very drunk and arguing .
His sister , now aged 12 , told a similar story in her statement .
Any food she got to eat was cold and when her mother was drunk the house was " scary " .
She was bullied at school and the other children called her smelly .

I never thought I 'd see the day that gold markets went into backwardation ( spot prices higher than futures prices ) .
However , the seemingly unthinkable has indeed happened .
Of course , I 'm not suggesting that backwardation will be a permanent feature of the market , as the misalignment of interest rates that theoretically caused gold backwardation is most likely not a permanent feature , either .
Nonetheless , the question remains :
Where do we go from here ?
This writer speculates that gold could very well turn out to be in a win - win situation , whether there is deflation or inflation .
How is this possible ?
Adam Smith told us that gold is a barbaric relic , although it is more commonly known as the metal of kings .
I remind you all that the world is still full of barbarians .
The above - ground stocks of gold , presumably available for disinvestment at any time , are some 60 - fold of annual production of about 2,500 metric tons .
This is why gold has never been in backwardation .
Unlike any other commodity , all gold that has been mined throughout the ages is still out there somewhere .
At an estimated 150,000 metric tons , this above - ground stock of gold -- with most obvious portions in private hands or tucked away in central bank vaults -- dwarfs annual production .
Unlike industrial commodities such as copper , aluminum , or zinc , where prices can go into backwardation at the slightest hint of a temporary supply disruption from major producers , contango pricing has always been the norm for gold , where futures prices exceed the spot price .
A new £ 4.7 m primary school in Sheffield is facing criticism for dropping the word " school " from its title after governors decided the term had " negative connotations " .
The headteacher of Sheffield 's Watercliffe Meadow , Linda Kingdon , said the south Yorkshire school , which is due to open on Monday , will instead be called a " place for learning " .
" We decided from an early stage we did n't want to use the word ' school ' , " she told local newspaper the Sheffield Star .
" This is Watercliffe Meadow , a place for learning .
One reason was many of the parents of the children here had very negative connotations of school .
" Instead we want this to a be a place for family learning , where anyone can come .
" We were able to start from scratch and create a new type of learning experience .
There are no whistles or bells or locked doors .
We wanted to de-institutionalise the place and bring the school closer to real life . "
Local MP Richard Caborn questioned the decision to drop the word school from Watercliffe Meadow 's title .
" I 'm always open to new ideas but the reality is education is about preparing young people to live in the real world , " he said .
" I just do n't think the case has been made to drop the word school to a place of learning .
I do n't know why they have done it . "
Councillor Andrew Sangar , Sheffield city council 's cabinet member for children 's services and lifelong learning , said : " It 's a school , we consider it a school and that 's how we refer to it .
" How a school chooses to manage and refer to itself is a matter for the board of governors and the community it serves and we 're relaxed about that . "
The primary school is to replace Shirecliffe , Busk Meadow and Watermead infant and junior schools .
More than 140 reporters and cameramen are expected to squeeze into a court house in the city of Perugia this morning for the opening of what has been billed as Italy 's trial of the year .
And all eyes will be on Amanda Knox , the 21 - year - old American student whose sexual appetites are at the centre of the case .
In the dock with her will be her24 - year - old ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito .
They have spent more than a year in Perugia 's jail waiting to be tried for their alleged role in the murder of the Surrey student Meredith Kercher , 21 , sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her Perugia bedsit in November 2007 .
Ms Knox leapt to notoriety in the days after the murder , kissing and cuddling Mr Sollecito in front of the lenses of the cameras , and her wildly conflicting accounts of how she had passed the evening on which her flatmate Meredith died put her under investigation .
Those accounts included a confession , later retracted , that she had heard Meredith 's screams but had merely blocked her ears .

Despite being behind bars the whole time , the vivacious , sexually adventurous , guitar - playing student from Seattle has become a minor celebrity in Italy , ranked in a poll in December as one of Italy 's " women of the year " .
Her Christmas activities in jail were minutely reported – nuns taught her how to dance and she watched Kung Fu Panda – as was her poignant plea to her family for thermal underwear , warm socks and flannel sheets .
When she played a walk - on part in a video shot in the prison , in which she recited Hamlet 's " To be or not to be " speech , the issue of whether or not the video should be screened at a film festival became a national controversy ( in the end , it was not ) .
Her diaries have been leaked to the press and are minutely scrutinised for evidence of sexual deviancy .
It is all prurient and intrusive but by no means irrelevant .
For the question of Ms Knox 's sexual appetites , and how far she will go to gratify them , go to the heart of this disturbing case .
One person is already serving a long jail sentence for killing Ms Kercher : Rudy Guede , 22 , originally from the Ivory Coast , was found guilty of murdering her after a fast - track trial that finished in October , and was sentenced to 30 years .
But prosecutor Giuliano Mignini has maintained from the first weeks of the investigation that Ms Knox and Mr Sollecito were also involved , and the judge in Guede 's trial , Paolo Micheli , not only endorsed that view but said that the " risk of their repeating the offence " was so strong that neither of the accused could be let out on bail , although both have clean records .
At the end of that first trial , Mr Mignini told Judge Micheli that Ms Kercher 's murder " was premeditated ... a ' rite ' celebrated on the occasion of the night of Halloween " , postponed for one day because there was a Halloween dinner party in Ms Kercher 's room .
He added : " The presumed assassins contented themselves with the evening of 1 November to perform their do - it - yourself rite , when for some hours it would again be the night of All Saints . "
He described the murder scene , saying Ms Kercher was on her knees , Guede holding her rigid and Mr Sollecito grasping one arm while Ms Knox wielded the knife .
The satanic Halloween rite version of the murder has gone around the world , but Judge Micheli rejected it out of hand in his summing - up .
Mr Mignini's Halloween scenario was " to say the least , a fanciful descriptive reconstruction " , he wrote , which belonged to the world of comic books .
Nor did the judge give much credit " to the kneeling position espoused by the prosecutor in describing a scene suggestive of an orgy " .
What persuaded Judge Micheli to send Knox and Sollecito to trial for murder was was the weight of circumstantial evidence against them , as well hotly contested forensic claims , including DNA traces on Ms Kercher 's bra strap and on a knife found under Mr Sollecito 's bed .
The couple , who had been together only for weeks , gave contradictory accounts of how and where they spent the evening when Ms Kercher was killed .
Both said they had been smoking cannabis since the afternoon , which was why their memories were unreliable .
After Ms Knox retraced her admission that she had heard Ms Kercher 's screams , she said she had spent the night with Mr Sollecito in his flat , only going back to her own flat in the morning to have a shower and change .
But Judge Micheli found her account unconvincing , " mucking about in the house and taking a shower with all that blood [ from the murder ] around " .
He agreed with the prosecutors ' contention that the crime scene had been tampered with and partially cleaned up in a successful attempt to remove Ms Knox 's fingerprints .
And he went along with the prosecution 's claim that Ms Knox was responsible for the idea of involving Ms Kercher in a sexual game , " being the only person in a position to know that that evening Meredith would be alone in the house " .
The trial will drag on in the traditional Italian way for months .
This week , lawyers for Ms Knox demanded the withdrawal of a new book of sexy gossip about her , plus € 500,000 in damages .
The publishers , Bompiani , refused , saying the book was already in circulation .
Italy already knows plenty about " Foxy Knoxy " , but it is keen to learn more .
UAE to Become First Arab Country with Nuclear Power
January 16th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Iran is on its way to having nuclear energy , but the United Arab Emirates may get there first .
Yesterday , the UAE embassy in Washington announced that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is scheduled to sign a nuclear cooperation pact with the country .
The UAE agreed to numerous conditions for Rice ’s approval , including inspections from the International Atomic Energy Agency and a ban on building uranium enrichment plants .
The country expects to have a working reactor by 2017 .
In the meantime , British , French , and American companies are competing for the contract .
Eventually , the UAE wants 25 % of its power to come from nuclear sources .
That means building at least six nuclear plants , each valued at approximately $ 5 billion .
Many members of Congress in the United States are protesting the reactor , claiming that a nuclear stockpile in the UAE will add volatility to the region .
But if the UAE will allow inspectors to examine its reactor , there is little reason to complain — especially since the country needs to prepare for electricity demands that will nearly double by 2020 .

[ h/t to Heather ]
Sean Hannity tried yesterday to regurgitate Ann Coulter 's absurd claim ( pulled , as near as we can tell , from her nether regions ) that Barack Obama wants to be called by his full name simply because he 's following the tradition in which a president 's full name is used when he 's sworn in .
And to back him up , he brought on Bill Cunningham , the Cincinnati radio - show host who got into trouble during the campaign by haranguing Obama over his middle name at a John McCain rally ( McCain in short order repudiated him and apologized to Obama ) .
Hannity : Now we find out that Barack Obama says he plans to use the name Barack Hussein Obama when he 's sworn in on Jan. 20 .
Does that -- does that now -- have you been vindicated here and is it now acceptable ?
Cunningham :
You know , Sean , I kind of expect McCain at some point to repudiate Barack Hussein Obama because back in February , I said he was a hack from Chicago , he swam in the deep blue waters of corruption , comes out of the pool without a drop on him .
And at this point , maybe McCain would say that Cunningham was right and that he was wrong , and that he might have won Ohio if he had listened to me .
Hannity and Cunningham natter on about how mean it was of everyone to jump on right - wingers who trotted out Obama 's middle name with great regularity as a reminder to voters of his alleged " foreignness " .
Finally , Alan Colmes ( who 's getting unusually spunky in his final weeks ) chirps up :
Colmes :
We 're missing something here , which is that when Bill Cunningham ... you know , when you say his name Hussein , when Coulter says B. Hussein Obama -- leaving out his first name entirely -- the intent is a little different , is n't it , Bill ?
Cunningham :
It is not .
My intent was to use the three names to show him respect .
[ Laughter all around ]
Colmes :
That is funny .
Cunningham :
You know , like Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Lyndon Baines Johnson .
I wanted to respect him .
Colmes :
Let me get this straight .
When conservatives would say Hussein , and underscore Hussein , and Coulter for example would n't even say his first name , just go right to the Hussein , it was just to show respect , and not point out that he 's got a name that sounds like a guy we deposed in Iraq .
There was no intent to do that , right , Bill ?
Cunningham :
Well , I wanted deep respect , and I wanted to highlight his roots in Jakarta , Indonesia , where he was a Muslim for four years in two schools .
Colmes : I see .
I see .
Here we go with the Muslim stuff again .
These guys do n't even bother trying to tell semi-credible lies anymore , do they ?
Cunningham blows up his own fake " respect " immediately by admitting his intent was to spread the " Obama was once a Muslim " falsehood .
Is it any wonder they finally lost ?
Cluestick for Bill : Obama probably won Ohio because guys like you represented the Republican Party .

Researchers Harness Power of Osmosis for Water Purification
January 30th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
As the world approaches peak water , technology to harvest freshwater from non-potable sources becomes increasingly important .
Researchers at Yale University have recently developed such desalination technology using the power of osmosis .
While desalination systems have been around for years ,
Yale doctoral student Robert McGinnis and his advisor Menachem Elimelech have taken a novel approach that requires only one - tenth the electric energy used in traditional systems .
The researchers use “ forward osmosis ” ( natural water diffusion ) to draw pure water from contaminants to a concentrated salt solution .
The desalinated water can easily be removed with a low heat treatment that requires minimal energy input .
Yale University will market the innovative technology through a new company called Oasys .
We ’ll post more information as it becomes available .

Madoff : One of Many Scammers ?
As the Economy Tanks , More and More Ponzi Schemes Come to Light
As America sinks deeper into recession , more and more investors apparently are learning that their savings are gone , not because of a down market , but because they were victims of a scam .
Government investigators said they have seen millions of dollars disappear recently as Ponzi scams and other schemes come to light .
These are n't of the scale of the $ 50 billion that Bernard Madoff is alleged to have lost , but hundreds of millions of dollars have vanished .
Officials point to the cases of Arthur G. Nadel in Florida , Joseph S. Forte in Philadelphia and James Ossie in Atlanta as among the most notable allegations .
Call them mini-Madoffs .
" With the economic downturn that we are experiencing , Ponzi schemes are just crashing , " said Stephen Obie , acting director of enforcement at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Officials say it does n't necessarily mean more scams are occurring , it just means that more are being exposed as scams .
The commission said the number of tips to the agency has doubled since July .
In the last 12 months , it has filed 15 cases and Obie expects that to rise by 25 percent in the coming months .
" These schemes rely on new people to be found and people are n't investing .
People are hurting .
And because people are hurting , they are seeking redemptions from what they think are these legitimate schemes , " Obie said .
" Between not having new investors and having old investors redeem , the Ponzi schemes are just collapsing . "
The most recent case to come to light involves Nadel , a Florida hedge fund manager who has been missing for more than a week and was charged Wednesday with misleading investors .
After the 76 - year - old Sarasota - based manager 's disappearance , hundreds of investors learned that $ 300 million of their money was gone , too .
Nadel left a suicide note at his home in which he described " extreme guilt " over losing other people 's money .
However , his car was found at a Sarasota airport and officials believe he planned his disappearance .
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Nadel recently transferred at least $ 1.25 million to secret bank accounts that he controlled .
It is quite a downfall for a man named " America 's Top Ranked Money Manager " in 2003 by The Wall Street Digest , an investment newsletter .
" The community is very shocked , obviously , " said Gordon Garrett , a friend of Nadel 's and president of the Jazz Club of Sarasota .
" Art and his wife Peg have been very prominent members of our community , very involved with the arts . "
Losing Money and Misleading Investors
Garrett did n't have any money invested with Nadel 's company , Scoop Management , but his group does not need to cancel eight concerts that Nadel had promised to sponsor .
Things are a little bit more grim at the local YMCA .
Neil Moody , who was a general partner in some of Scoop Management 's funds , donated $ 1.12 million to the YMCA Foundation of Sarasota .
That money makes up about 13 percent of the group 's $ 8.6 million endowment .
Moody 's first gift came in 2005 and he insisted that it be invested with one of Nadel 's funds , Valhalla Management .
" The fund did not meet our investment guidelines , so he made a personal guarantee that it have a return of 10 percent , per annum , " foundation president Karin Gustafson said .
" He believed that that fund could outperform any other funds that were being managed for us . "
Tony Souza , executive director of Habitat for Humanity , Sarasota , said the Nadels were strong supporters of charities in the area .
Peg Nadel has been chair of Habitat 's capital campaign for the last year and a half .
" They have provided a lot of money to many of the bigger nonprofit corporations in Sarasota , " Souza said .
" Of course , this is a total shock to all of us .
A total shock .
Everyone considered them to be great philanthropists in the community .
They 've been around for a while .
" There are many , many black tie events and fundraisers here in Sarasota , and you would always see them very prominently there , " Souza added .
" They were involved right across the board . "
The couple had their own nonprofit foundation , the Guy - Nadel Foundation , which gave thousands of dollars to various charities , according to its tax records .
In 2006 , the most recent tax filing , the couple gave $ 112,000 to the Sarasota Opera , $ 4,000 for animal shelters , $ 150,000 to youth social agencies , $ 135,000 to a theater company and $ 144,800 to various churches for everything from a youth bus to general charity .
Ponzi Schemes : Large to Small Scale
Brad Garrett , a former FBI agent and ABC News consultant , said the discussions about Madoff could have helped bring other scams to light .
" It does n't mean there are more of them .
It just means that people are talking about them more .
People are coming forward .
People are complaining that they lost money , " Garrett said .
" One of the problems is people are embarrassed sometimes that they got caught up in these things and they end up not reporting them , particularly if it's not a huge amount of money . "
Garrett said such scams will exist regardless of the economy .
" Ponzi schemes attract people because they give them an outrageous percentage " return on investments , he said .
" There will always be a percentage of us that will do that because there 's that too - good - to - be - true thing .
And we 're hoping that it 's too good to be true . "
In the past two weeks , two other Ponzi schemes have been prosecuted by federal authorities .
Forte is alleged to have scammed $ 50 million out of investors in the Philadelphia area .
" Forte engaged in lies , deception and rapacious behavior at the expense of innocent investors , many of whom considered themselves his friends and close acquaintances , " said Daniel M. Hawke , director of the SEC's Philadelphia regional office , in a statement .
" Using other people 's money , Forte promised and reported outrageous returns over more than a 10 - year period , and because of his relationships with investors , was able to lull them into trusting him with their funds . "
Starting in 1995 , Forte allegedly reported to investors annual returns ranging from 18.52 percent to as high as 37.96 percent .
But such returns were just an illusion .
From January 1998 through October 2008 , the trading account had roughly $ 3.3 million in losses .
Scams Run Global
Then just last week , Ossie of Atlanta and his company CRE Capital Corporation were charged with operating a Ponzi scheme involving more than 100 people .
The scam involved about $ 25 million in foreign currency transactions .
Ossie allegedly promised pool participants that they would earn a 10 percent return on their money within 30 days by trading United States and Japanese currency pairs .
" Investors must run the other way when approached by anyone claiming to guarantee exorbitant monthly returns , like those promised by CRE and Ossie , " the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 's Obie said in a statement .
" Such representations should raise an immediate red flag that such investment is too good to be true . "

Paul McCartney , The Killers and The Cure will headline this year ’s Coachella Festival , which takes place between April 17 - 19 .
Speculation about the acts playing and the announcement of the final lineup have reached fever pitch this week , but everyone can now breathe a sigh of relief and figure out whether its worth spending $ 269 on a three - day pass .
Other notable appearances include Morrissey , Franz Ferdinand and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
Among the surprise inclusions are Leonard Cohen , Amy Winehouse and industrial pioneers Throbbing Gristle .
Presumably My Bloody Valentine are headlining one of the stages on the Sunday and not going on before the Cure , because Robert Smith ’s audience may not have their hearing intact after Kevin Shields has finished with them .
The full lineup is on the official poster below .

THE extraordinary rainstorms last June caused catastrophic soil erosion in the grain lands of Iowa , where there were gullies 200 feet wide .
But even worse damage is done over the long term under normal rainfall  by the little rills and sheets of erosion on incompletely covered or denuded cropland , and by various degradations resulting from industrial procedures and technologies alien to both agriculture and nature .
Soil that is used and abused in this way is as nonrenewable as ( and far more valuable than ) oil .
Unlike oil , it has no technological substitute  and no powerful friends in the halls of government .
Agriculture has too often involved an insupportable abuse and waste of soil , ever since the first farmers took away the soil - saving cover and roots of perennial plants .
Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland .
This irremediable loss , never enough noticed , has been made worse by the huge monocultures and continuous soil - exposure of the agriculture we now practice .
To the problem of soil loss , the industrialization of agriculture has added pollution by toxic chemicals , now universally present in our farmlands and streams .
Some of this toxicity is associated with the widely acclaimed method of minimum tillage .
We should not poison our soils to save them .

Just yesterday in a forum I wrote about uneducated and poor people and their attitude toward prop 8 .
The reason I came to my reasoning is my life experience , so here is a short resume :
Born 1948 in Brussels , Belgium and in one of the " bad areas " , my parents were poor , I went to school and at 13 started with " reform school " , at 14 I was a construction worker .
I was some kind of a street fighter .
At 16 some professor Higgins thought I was Eliza Doolittle and taught me English and it changed my life or what would have been my life without him and the English language .
So when you 're poor your language and accent is different than the other people , so they notice right away where you 're from and may eventually shun you , just like Blacks or Hispanics .
As a street fighter the worst insult was calling someone a Fa***t and had I been one , no one would ever have known and I would have beaten the life out of this guy .
In this area where poor people live there are gay people and they ( still today ) will never come out and the reason is simple come out and you 'll be shunned , laughed at , insulted to your face and do n't try a smart answer as this is your ticket to the hospital .
What move out of the bad area ?
That near impossible because of the rent and the low paid job you have , a better paid job ?
you lack the education and your speech will give you away .
So who is coming out of the closet ?
To us poor , Black or Hispanics it 's those rich kids who can afford it .
Do we like those rich bastards born with a silver spoon ?
They just land the best paid jobs because papa is helping , sure the liberal are helping but at the end of a demonstration they go back to their nice homes and we go back to our hovels , to an overworked wife , with kids they have no control on and the alternative is pray , pray God , go to church and hope for the best .
Can anyone give me a good reason why the poor people should vote no on prop 8 ? , favor the oppressor ?
Due to my " special " life I stayed in South side Chicago for 3 or 4 days with a black family my buddy and his wife took me to their local to watch a basket ball game and introduced me to the boss , I was the only white in there but I felt OK , as these were the real people , like me , hard working , with low pay ( this happened in ' 75 ) .
The next day I went back to the bar alone , the owner was acting nervous he bought me a beer , told me to sit at the corner of the bar , 10 minutes later my buddy was back , and I was told that as a white man I should never go alone in a bar in this area as this was playing with my life ...
What of me ?
I am socially unadapted as I am rejected by my lower class environment as being the " intellectual " , and cannot have the kind of conversation I 'd like to have with them , and still not really accepted by the old enemy but with whom I can converse with .
I never went back to school seeking a diploma , the reason is why should I lower myself in working hard to get a sheet of worthless paper showing that I have accepted the rule of the oppressor ?
I went and studied political science for a year in University I paid for it myself and could never receive a diploma , but I needed the knowledge .
So as you can see old hatred die hard with the Black and the poor .
With the recession / depression coming , more and more poor and uneducated people are joining the military and that 's also no surprise to me as this is the reason why the government needs poor and uneducated people and needs the church to steer them in the " right " direction .
The new 17 " MacBook
Pro claims an industry leading 8 hours of battery life , thanks to a series of innovations Apple highlighted in the new notebook 's introduction .
Even so , many of the advancements are not actually new , but rather the product of Apple 's incremental engineering efforts to increase its notebooks ' usability and desirability by thinking differently .
The new high end notebook uses a 95 watt - hour Lithium - Polymer battery , which the company hailed as a physically compact breakthrough over the batteries used in competing laptops .
It 's true that many PC laptops continue to use Lithium - Ion batteries , which package cylindrical cells inside a case , a practice that wastes a lot of internal space around the cells with dead air .
Some of the cheaper PC laptops even still use relatively ancient Nickel Metal Hydride battery technology , which is even less space efficient .
However , Apple has been using Lithium - Polymer battery technology for years , both in iPods and in its notebook line .
Rather than packaging cylindrical cells inside a battery module , Li-Poly batteries use sheets of polymer plastic that can be shaped as needed , resulting in a more compact and dense battery unit .
In the images below , from Apple 's video on battery technology shown in the Macworld keynote , Li-Poly sheets are spooled into bundles ( below top ) and then pressed into a thin unit ( below middle graphics ) .
The result is a thin package ( below bottom ) .
Apple uses Li-Poly batteries in the MacBook Air , and they 're also used in iPods and iPhone models to deliver a slim profile .
One notable difference in the 17 " MacBook
Pro is that while thinness is a top consideration , physical size is n't .
That allowed Apple to install a relatively huge battery , affording the laptop a very long lifespan relative to industry norms .
The replacement battery rebels
Another aspect that allowed Apple to use a larger than typical battery is the company 's fearless ability to buck convention .
In this case , the prevailing consensus that a full size notebook must have a replaceable battery so that it can be swapped out with a spare .
The company 's track record for using non-replacable batteries in its iPod and iPhone models has long been ridiculed by pundits who have insisted that the company made that engineering decision primarily to force users to pay hefty fees to replace the batteries once they reached the end of their useful lifespan .
The real reason of course was to make a device that was easy to build and lacked a battery cover and the latches and connectors required to support user - swappable battery modules .
Apple traded those features for the space to install a larger battery , giving its devices longer battery life in a more compact profile .
The market solved the battery replacement cost itself , with companies offering third party , do - it - yourself kits for battery replacement in the price range of $ 10 to $ 20 .
Last year , Apple took an even bolder step in releasing the thin MacBook Air without a replaceable battery module .
That unleashed a new wave of bitter complaint from pundits , but resulted in a very thin enclosure that prompted healthy sales of the thin new notebook .
While the company 's mid-range 13 " and 15 " notebooks were sold with replaceable battery units , the new high end 17 " model does away with all the covers , latches , and battery module packaging to make room for a larger battery pack that can't be swapped out without a screwdriver .
The result will likely be more complaint from the defenders of the status quo , but also a real breakthrough in usability .
The 40 % larger battery used in the 17 " MacBook Pro gives it up to 8 hours of life , making it far more practically useful than a conventional 5 hour replaceable battery that requires also carrying a separate spare battery , and probably also an external charger .
3X longer life
Enhancing the battery 's lifespan is an improved recharging system Apple calls Adaptive Charging , which more precisely monitors the charge level of the battery 's individual cells , and delivers the optimal current required to recharge them .
The company says this helps prolong the lifespan of the battery from the typical span of 300 charging cycles to up to 1000 .
That also means fewer battery packs will end up in landfills , putting a greener shine on the new notebook 's environmental credentials .
With notebooks now accounting for more than half of the computers Apple sells , battery technology is a key area of research , one that the company is addressing with advanced research into battery chemistry and packaging design .
This enables the company to produce differentiated products that stand out against the sea of commodity PC notebooks that are fighting primarily only to be cheaper , resulting in a need to use older technology that does n't demand any investment in innovative research .

Make medicinal marijuana legal
by : Shelley A. Krayer , member of DAWN , Inc. for Independent Living
recipient : local and federal legislators ; President Obama
There are a number of people who could benefit from the legalization of marijuana .
When people think of marijuana , they usually see it as a " gateway " drug to other , harder drugs .
It has been known to be useful in reducing nausea in several conditions ; in my case , I have glaucoma -- it reduces eye pressure , among other benefits .
The same kind of paranoia is present when doctors hesitate to prescribe pain medicine to patient because of fear of addiction .
But think about this ... if marijuana were legalized , a lot less people would seek it just for the high , and the people who needed it medically would n't have to worry about being prosecuted for possession of a controlled dangerous substance .
DECEMBER 31--Following his arrest earlier today for drunk driving , Charles Barkley told Arizona cops that he ran a stop sign because he was in a hurry to pick up a girl who had ' given him a ' blow job ' one week earlier , ' which the former NBA star described as ' the best one he had ever had in his life . '
According to a Gilbert Police Department report , a copy of which you 'll find here , police asked Barkley where he was going at the time of the 1:26 AM traffic stop in Scottsdale .
' You want the truth ?
I was gonna drive around the corner and get a blow job , ' answered Barkley , who is pictured in his mug shot .
A cooperative Barkley also joked with a civilian police employee that , ' I 'll tattoo your name on my ass ' if it would get him out of the DUI charge .
Barkley , 45 , was busted after failing field sobriety tests , and had blood drawn so investigators could establish his alcohol content .
Barkley was cited for a misdemeanor charge and released at the scene , thus avoiding a trip to the Maricopa County jail .
Barkley , now a basketball commentator on TNT , was elected to the NBA Hall of Fame in 2006 .
His 16 - year career included an MVP award and a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball squad , the so - called Dream Team that captured the gold medal .
He has several prior arrests , including a 1997 aggravated battery bust and a 1991 assault collar .

It was the invention of the null reference in 1965 .
At that time , I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language ( ALGOL W ) .
My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe , with checking performed automatically by the compiler .
But I could n't resist the temptation to put in a null reference , simply because it was so easy to implement .
This has led to innumerable errors , vulnerabilities , and system crashes , which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years .
In recent years , a number of program analysers like PREfix and PREfast in Microsoft have been used to check references , and give warnings if there is a risk they may be non-null .
More recent programming languages like Spec# have introduced declarations for non-null references .
This is the solution , which I rejected in 1965 .

Up for sale this weekend at Barrett - Jackson ’s auction in Scottsdale , Arizona is this 1970 Chevrolet Yenko Nova .
I used to own a 1970 Nova , so this particular car brings back some fond memories .
Don Yenko built 175 of these cars , only 25 of which appeared in the silver color shown here .
This particular car is powered by the infamous Chevrolet 350 V - 8 .
Yenko also built a 427 Nova , but only for 1969 , as insurance on the big block cars became too outrageous in 1970 .
The last time a Yenko Nova changed hands , it commanded $ 285,000 .
It will be interesting to see what this “ underpowered ” but still beautiful car will bring on the block .

There was a thread last week where someone asked who would be interested in a hypothetical Haskell job .
He got about 20 positive responses .
This agrees with the experience of Microsoft Research in 2006 when they advertised for a third person to help with GHC development .
They also had about 20 applicants .
So next time I hear the " you ca n't get the programmers " line I 'm going to respond with something like this : " If you post an advert for a Haskell developer you will get 20 applicants .
All of those people will be the kind of developer who learns new programming languages to improve their own abilities and stretch themselves , because nobody yet learns Haskell just to get a job .
" If you post an advert for a Java developer you will get 200 applicants .
Most of them will be the kind of developer who learned Java because there are lots of Java jobs out there , and as long as they know enough to hold down a job then they see no reason to learn anything . "

I ’ve been working on a Java app which needed Rhino for scripting .
The app would need to run untrusted JavaScript code from 3rd parties , so I had to find a way to block access to all Java methods , except the ones I wanted .
This would not be a problem if there was an easy way to disable LiveConnect – the feature of Rhino which provides java access to scripts – but there is no such thing .
However , after a lot of digging around , I finally found a way to do this without too much hacking .
In fact , it can be done by just extending a few of the Rhino classes , and using the setters provided to override some of the default ones .
Note about newer versions of Rhino
If you have a recent version of Rhino , you may have a built - in method to create a sandbox .
As commenter “ Friend ” pointed out , initSafeStandardObjects ( ) can be used to do that .
ClassShutter
Let ’s first look at the ClassShutter , which can be used to restrict access to Java packages and classes .
//cx is the Context instance you 're using to run scripts cx. setClassShutter ( new ClassShutter ( ) { public boolean visibleToScripts ( String className ) { if ( className .
startsWith ( " adapter " ) ) return true ; return false ; } } ) ; //cx is the Context instance you 're using to run scripts cx.setClassShutter ( new ClassShutter ( ) { public boolean visibleToScripts ( String className ) { if( className.startsWith ( " adapter " ) ) return true ; return false ; } } ) ;
The above will effectively disable access to all Java classes onwards from the point where the shutter was set .
However , if you run any scripts before setting the shutter , classes accessed there can still be used !
You can use this to your advantage , for example to provide specific classes in the scripts under different names or such .
You probably noticed the comparison to “ adapter ” in the shutter .
This is for when you implement interfaces or extend Java classes .
Rhino will create new classes based on those interfaces / classes , and they will be called adapterN , where N is a number .
If you block access to classes starting with adapter , you ca n’t implement or extend , and my use - case required that .
However , there is a limitation in the ClassShutter …
Reflection
As you may know , you can use someInstance.getClass ( ) . forName(“ some.package.Class ” ).newInstance ( ) to get a new instance of some .
package .
Class .
This will not get blocked by the ClassShutter !
We need to disable access to getClass ( ) to block this .
While the ClassShutter is relatively well documented , doing this required more research .
A post in the Rhino mailing list finally pushed me to the right direction : Overriding certain NativeJavaObject methods and creating a custom ContextFactory and WrapFactory for that .
Here is an extended NativeJavaObject , which blocks access to getClass .
You could use this approach to block access to other methods too :
public static class SandboxNativeJavaObject extends NativeJavaObject { public SandboxNativeJavaObject ( Scriptable scope , Object javaObject , Class staticType ) { super ( scope , javaObject , staticType ) ; } @ Override public Object get ( String name , Scriptable start ) { if ( name .
equals ( " getClass " ) ) { return NOT_FOUND ; } return super .
get ( name , start ) ; } } public static class SandboxNativeJavaObject extends NativeJavaObject { public SandboxNativeJavaObject ( Scriptable scope , Object javaObject , Class staticType ) { super ( scope , javaObject , staticType ) ; } @ Override public Object get ( String name , Scriptable start ) { if ( name.equals ( " getClass " ) ) { return NOT_FOUND ; } return super.get ( name , start ) ; } }
To make the above class work , you need two more classes :
A WrapFactory which returns our SandboxNativeJavaObject’s
public static class SandboxWrapFactory extends WrapFactory { @ Override public Scriptable wrapAsJavaObject ( Context cx , Scriptable scope , Object javaObject , Class staticType ) { return new SandboxNativeJavaObject ( scope , javaObject , staticType ) ; } } public static class SandboxWrapFactory extends WrapFactory { @ Override public Scriptable wrapAsJavaObject ( Context cx , Scriptable scope , Object javaObject , Class staticType ) { return new SandboxNativeJavaObject ( scope , javaObject , staticType ) ; } }
And a ContextFactory , which returns Context ’s which use SandboxWrapFactory :
public class SandboxContextFactory extends ContextFactory { @ Override protected Context makeContext ( ) { Context cx = super .
makeContext ( ) ; cx. setWrapFactory ( new SandboxWrapFactory ( ) ) ; return cx ; } } public class SandboxContextFactory extends ContextFactory { @ Override protected Context makeContext ( ) { Context cx = super.makeContext ( ) ; cx.setWrapFactory( new SandboxWrapFactory ( ) ) ; return cx ; } }
Finally , to make all this work , we need to tell Rhino the global ContextFactory :
ContextFactory .
initGlobal ( new SandboxContextFactory ( ) ) ; ContextFactory.initGlobal(new SandboxContextFactory ( ) ) ;
With this , we are done .
Now , when you use ContextFactory.getGlobal ().enterContext ( ) , you will get sandboxing contexts .
But why did we need to set it globally ?
This is because it would appear that certain things , such as the adapter classes , use the global context factory to get some context for themselves , and without setting the global factory , they would get unlimited access .
In closing
I hope this is useful for someone .
It took me a long time to figure it all out , so here it is now , all documented in one place . =)
The mailing list post where I found the direction for blocking getClass can be found here .
Thanks to Charles Lowell .
There is also the SecurityController , which may be useful in further securing the class .
And as a final warning , while this approach works for me , and I have n’t yet found any way to get past the sandboxing and into Java - land … but there may be a way , and if you find one , do let me know .
We at Gunaxin love drinking beer , but of course , sometimes we get hungry .
So why not eat some food cooked with beer ( or any alcohol for that matter ) .
But we ’ve always heard that all the alcohol cooks away , so is n’t this just a waste of beer .
Well , according to a study by the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory , it looks like we were wrong .
Below is a chart of remaining alcohol after different cooking times .
Baked / Simmered – Stirred Not Stirred Cooking Time 15 m 30 m 1 h 1.5 h 2 h 2.5 h 25 m Alcohol Remaining 40 % 35 % 25 % 20 % 10 % 5 % 45 %
And this means that it ’s not a waste of beer , well not totally .
You know you want to stick a beer can up a chicken ’s ass right now , though since the beer will evaporate in a beer can chicken I ’m not sure if the acohol will stick around for this one .
Of course , there are plenty of other recipes where the alcohol wo n’t just boil away , such as beer battered chicken , beer braised ribs , sweet potatoes ( you know , the one that your great aunt must have used a cup of bourbon instead of a table spoon ) and Chili .
I usually cook my chili for several hours to tenderize the meat , but there are quite a few recipes out there that only call for fifteen minutes or so of cooking , and that means a high alcohol content ( for food anyway ) .
At first this sounds great , but after a little calculation it turns out that a pot of chili simmered for only 15 minutes will have an alcohol content of only around .75 % ( a beer is typically around 4 - 5 % abv ) .
You ’ll have to eat quite a bit of chili before that buzz hits you .
NASA successfully tested an internet - like protocol for space , which could some day automate communication with craft and bases beyond Earth ’s orbit ( Illustration : NASA / JPL )
NASA has finished its first deep - space test of what could become an ‘ interplanetary internet ’ .
The new networking commands could one day be used to automatically relay information between Earth , spacecraft , and astronauts , without the need for humans to schedule transmissions at each point .
Spacecraft beyond Earth ’s orbit usually communicate directly with Earth – the first to do so through an intermediary were the Mars Explorations Rovers , which launched in 2003 .
The Spirit and Opportunity rovers transmit data to orbiters , which then send the data back to Earth .
But human intervention is still required to schedule communications sessions for orbiters and landers .
“ The traditional method of operations is largely manual , ” says Jay Wyatt of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ People get in a room and decide when they can send data . ”
A new method would automate and streamline this process by sending data through an interplanetary ‘ internet ’ .
Just as data is sent from one point to another on the internet via a linked network of hubs , or nodes , spacecraft scattered throughout the solar system could be used as nodes to transmit data through space .

Last week , NASA completed a month - long test of a simulated network of Mars landers , orbiters and mission operations centres on Earth .
For the test , dozens of images of Mars and its moon Phobos were transmitted back and forth between computers on Earth and NASA ’s Deep Impact spacecraft .
The craft , which sent an impactor into Comet Tempel 1 in 2005 , has been renamed “ Epoxi ” now that it its mission has been extended to search for extrasolar planets .
Internet pioneer
Also transmitted were a four - node diagram of the internet ’s ancestor , ARPANET , and a photograph of networking visionary J C R Licklider .
The test was the culmination of a collaboration between internet pioneer Vinton Cerf and NASA that began in 1999 .
The new protocol is somewhat different from the one that forms the backbone of the internet , called TCP / IP .
On Earth , if some data is lost between a sender and a recipient , the two communicate back and forth until all the information is sent .
That ‘ handshake ’ works well on Earth , where the network is almost always continuously connected , says Adrian Hooke , team leader at NASA Headquarters in Washington , DC .
But in space , probes pass behind planets and out of range , power outages are common , and distances between planets vary as the planets move in their orbits .
In addition , at distances not far beyond the Moon , the time required to beam data between a sender and a recipient makes back - and - forth communication between the two inefficient , says Hooke .
Space hackers
To avoid such issues , the new protocol , called Disruption - or Delay - Tolerant Networking ( DTN ) , commands each node in the network to store information until it can find another node that can receive the information .
Data is relayed in a chain and should only need to be transmitted once .
“ The nodes themselves can take care of making sure the data moves progressively from the source to its destination , ” Hooke told New Scientist .
To guard against hackers , the data transmitted over DTN is encrypted .
In order to transmit or accept data , a node must identify itself to its companion , a concept called ‘ mutual suspicion . ’
International network
On Earth , DTN has been tested in a variety of projects – from boosting cellular connections in remote locations and improving battlefield communications to using snowmobiles to extend internet access to reindeer herders .
Hooke hopes to incorporate the protocol on upcoming space missions , beginning with robotic missions to the Moon .
“ The goal is by the end of 2011 to have these protocols ready to go out of the box , so we can give them to project managers to load onto spacecraft , ” Hooke says .
The team is also working to get the protocol accepted by the international community , so that other spacecraft could join the network .
Spacecraft communicating through DTN could also alleviate traffic on NASA ’s Deep Space Network , a collection of ground - based radio antennas used to communicate with space probes .
Some say the network will soon have trouble meeting demands on its time .
The DTN protocol has been erased from Epoxi , one of the conditions for use of the spacecraft , Hooke says .
But the team plans to set up a permanent DTN node at the International Space Station .
The protocol will be uploaded to a payload aboard the station in mid-2009 .

The Dr. Noodle Improbability
Dr Friedrich Noodle was the first Earth scientist to ever discover faster than light travel .
Unfortunately , due to miscalculations and oversights he thought he had built a time machine .
Instead of opening a 4th dimensional rift through time , his machine opened a 4th dimensional rift through space .
His invention in effect would take you to a random location within the universe .
This was unfortunate , as most of the universe is empty space , and he had not thought to take the precaution of vacuum sealing his machine .
Now , if one were taken to a random spot anywhere in the universe , the chance of landing in a galaxy and not in the seemingly endless open space in between them is less than one in 6 billion ( 6,000,000,000 ) .
Unfortunately , this figure is somewhat meaningless , as the human mind has a difficult time understanding large numbers .
To help you grasp the vast unlikelihood of this event I will need the help of a volunteer .
Though unlikely this event was , Dr. Noodle did indeed land in a galaxy , a moderately sized spiral galaxy in fact .
Unfortunately , this is only the first hurdle , and by far one of the easiest .
Given that he landed in a galaxy , the Dr's chance of landing relatively near a star ( within 10 AU or so ) is about 1 in 1.6 trillion ( 1,600,000,000,000 )
Now amazingly enough , Dr. Friedrich Noodle not only landed in a galaxy , but within 10 AU of a star .
Now given that he landed near such a solar system , it would still need to contain a rocky planet located within the habitable zone and capable of sustaining human life .
Not only that , but he would have to land on said planet 's orbital path .
A feat with a probability of around 1 in 1.2 quadrillion ( 1,200,000,000,000,000 ) Incredibly enough , he did indeed land on the orbital path of the perfect planet , one capable of sustaining human life .
Even more incredibly , he managed to land within 1 mm of the surface over a flat grassland with moderate temperature , and not anywhere inside the earth itself or dangerously high above the ground .
A feat with a probability of nearly 1 in 12 quadrillion ( 12,000,000,000,000,000 ) Let 's just take it at my word that that last event was unlikely .
Now the real problem with opening inter-dimensional rifts with convertibles , is that even on the miraculous occasion that all the above chances are met ( which they were ) , and you are not exposed to the vacuum of space ( which the Dr. was not ) your initial velocity most likely will not be anywhere near the same magnitude or direction as that of the planet you land on , or the atmosphere around it .
This would most likely result in either an immediate crater in the ground below you , or your sudden annihilation by the high winds of the atmosphere around you .
Incredibly enough , Dr. Noodle managed to enter the atmosphere with a velocity within .001 % of the magnitude and direction of the planet he landed on .
Upon entering he felt nothing more than a slight breeze as the south wind gently brushed the top of his head .
Every single one of these near impossible events were met .
And Dr. Noodle managed to land nearly perfectly on a life bearing planet .
This is one of the most incredible feats of chance to have ever occurred in the universe , in fact , it should be downright impossible .
I just wanted to make sure you understand that in some sense he was an incredibly lucky person of a degree that is mind boggling .
Now I say he was ' in some sense ' lucky , because unfortunately , he still had a 50 % chance of exiting the rift with his head oriented toward the sky ...
Luck is all a matter of perspective I guess .
Or more specifically in this case , orientation .

17 - year - old dead after Taser blast Nick Cargo
Published : Sunday January 11 , 2009

An autopsy will decide whether a Virginia teenager was officially electrocuted by police in his own home on Thursday night .
17 - year - old Derrick Jones of Martinsville was pronounced dead at a local hospital following an encounter with a police officer that ended in a Taser blast and immediate attempts to revive him by the officer , and later paramedics .
Jones , 15 - year - old Justin Gregory and three others spent the day roughhousing in Jones ' duplex apartment , according to Gregory .
Alcohol was involved , and altercations between Jones , at one point laying down in the middle of the street , and Gregory , resulted in neighbors calling the police .
Officer R. L. Wray found signs of forced entry and blood on a wall said by Gregory to be caused by the teens over the course of the day , and leaned into the living room of the apartment with his Taser drawn .
Jones , who had been drinking , was said to have " moved rapidly " towards the officer while making unspecified " not too kind " comments .
Jones was immediately unresponsive after being Tasered halfway into the living room , according to Gregory , who disagreed with the officer 's account and said that regardless of the situation , " too much force " was used on the 130 - pound teen , who stood at 5 ' 7 " .
He told his mother that Jones " just melted " on the floor .
" It was the last time they saw him move . "
The officer was " well within the guidelines " of department procedure in using the device on Jones , according to Police Chief Mike Rogers .
The department 's " Use of Force " policy states that the Taser is only to be used when less drastic methods would facilitate the subject 's escape or expose others to physical injury .
Virginia State Police are investigating the incident .
A CBC study has shown that the Taser has killed at least 400 people in the United States and Canada since 2001 .
The research showed that a person hit with a Taser could face as high as a 50 percent chance of cardiac arrest .
Arizona - based Taser International has released studies of its own denying a link between its products and reported deaths , and has even argued against medical examiners in court when a Taser product is found to be a factor in a death .
Police have been accused of misusing or overusing their Tasers in lieu of less electrifying techniques such as physical force or pepper spray in their encounters with such individuals as Robert Dziekanski , Elizabeth Beeland , Inman Morales , Andre Thomas , Mace Hutchinson .
" You have people who are often in custody , and when they are in custody and it's being used repeatedly on them , it 's hard to describe it as anything else but torture , " Amnesty International USA 's executive director Larry Cox told CBS ' Early Show in November 2007 .
The Taser works by injecting electricity directly through metal prongs that have been shot into its target 's body .
The shocks cause severe pain and temporary paralysis along with a rise in heart rate .
Among those benefiting financially from the marketing of Taser International 's products to police departments are former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and his former police commissioner Bernard Kerik .
" The penalty for resisting arrest should not be death , " Cox said .

[ Notes from an interview with Peter Salus , published in A Quarter Century of UNIX , by Peter H. Salus , Addison - Wesley 1994 . ]
Sunil Das told me he thinks you were in the US in 75 and gave the em editor to Bill Joy .
Has this any basis in fact ?
I developed ' em ' at QMC in the autumn of 1975 , to enable us to exploit more effectively some vdu terminals that we had recently acquired .
We had a background of experience in developing applications on graphical displays with both cursor - key and tablet - driven cursor positioning ( this experience came to us with William Newman , who spent a year and half working with us between working at Utah and Xerox PARC - see Alan Kay 's article in Sigplan notices March 1993 for more on the history of those places and the links between them ) .
I concluded that Unix's ' raw ' mode of terminal input , which was at that time almost totally unexploited , could be used to give some of the convenience and immediacy of feedback for text editing that we were used to in our single - user graphical systems , and this led me to develop ' em ' .
Then I spent the summer of 1976 as a visitor to the CS Dept. at Berkeley .
I worked in a room full of teletype terminals using the departmental Unix .
I had brought ' em ' with me on Dectape and installed it there for my own use .
( Although 'em ' was designed for vdu's , its single - character interaction could be used - painfully slowly - in TTY's - the current line being re-printed after each interaction ! )
One day , sitting at the next terminal was this fairly frenzied hacker / PhD student ( Bill Joy ) who told me that he was writing a Pascal compiler .
I showed him ' em ' , and he said " that 's nice , the system support people might be interested in that " .
He took me and introduced me to them .
They had a couple of PDP11's ( I 'm not sure which models ) supporting several rooms full of vdu terminals connected at 9600 baud , an environment in which ' em ' could really shine .
I explained that ' em ' was an extension of ' ed ' that gave key - stroke level interaction for editing within a single line , displaying the up - to - date line on the screen ( a sort of single - line screen editor ) .
I explained that this was achieved by setting the terminal mode to ' raw ' so that single characters could be read as they were typed - an eccentric thing for a program to do in 1976 .
The system support person ( I do n't recall his name , but I have a vague recollection that he went to Bell Labs later .
Bill Joy might be able to tell you his name ) said something like : " That 's very nice , but if we made it available to all of our users the overheads associated with running in raw mode ( a process swap on each key depression ) would swamp the cpu " .
I was rather depressed by this reaction , thinking " I guess I have been unrealistic in developing an editor that is so expensive to run - it's ok in our small system , but it 's no use in the big Unix environment at Berkeley " .
Nevertheless ,
Bill and the system support people took a copy of my source to see if they would use it .
I then went to the East Coast for a week or so .
When I returned , I found that Bill had taken my code as a starting point and had got a long way towards what was to become ' ex ' and subsequently ' vi ' , and that the editor was installed on the service machines - of course it still required ' raw ' mode , but clearly , the benefits had outweighed the objection .
By the way , ' em ' stands for ' editor for mortals ' - I christened it that after Ken Thompson visited our lab at QMC while I was developing it and said something like : " yeah , I 've seen editors like that , but I do n't feel a need for them , I do n't want to see the state of the file when I 'm editing " .
[ The above is the bare - bones story of how ' em ' led to ' vi ' .
There is more that I could write about how ' em ' was developed and what stimulated me to do it , but I 'm not sure whether you need that level of detail ] .
How did you get UNIX v4 in 73 ?
William Newman was a Visiting Research Fellow in our Lab for a little over a year from about October 1971 ( he then moved to Xerox PARC , and is now at Rank Xerox EuroPARC in Cambridge ) .
We had discovered the value of interactive minicomputer systems with his guidance .
He and Mike Cole developed a single - user interactive operating system ( called MIFS ) at QMC .
MIFS ran on an Interdata computer and was loosely modelled on TENEX .
It was developed to support two research projects , one by William to investigate the design of a graphical programming language and one by a group of us to investigate the design of a new machine architecture , using microprogrammed emulation .
Like Unix , MIFS included a wide range of components and tools - a filing system , a systems programming language , a compiler - compiler , a line editor ( with single - character interaction ) , a debugger , etc .
Nearly all of these were developed by William and Mike .
We had n't heard of Unix while MIFS was under development , but while William was still with us he made a visit to Bell Labs .
When he came back he said " they seem to have developed something like MIFS at Murray Hill , but it supports multiple users and runs on PDP11s " .
Mike Cole obtained some documentation , studied it , and concluded that it could indeed bring us great benefits - it offered most of the facilities that we had found so useful in MIFS and went well beyond it .
QMC was the first UK site to get UNIX .
Heriot - Watt was the second .
I see in the first UKUUG newsletter that your configuration was a PDP11 / 40 but no RK05s .
Did Ken [ Thompson ] give you 9 - track ?
No .
I do n't think we had a 9 - track drive , just Dectape and a System Industries 10 Meg exchangeable drive ( does your UKUUG newsletter confirm that configuration ? )
The real problem was that Ken did n't have a driver for the SI controller ( and nor did anyone else in the world ) .
Obviously , we could n't develop a new driver using a Unix system with Dectape as the only peripheral - the swaps would have rendered the process horrendously slow !
Mike Cole was our system guru , and he solved the problem .
He picked up the v4 release from Ken on Dectape in the Summer of ' 73 , on his way to spend a couple of months visiting Xerox PARC ( William Newman was there by that time , and Mike went there to work with him ) .
While at PARC he went to Bezerkeley , wrote and compiled a simple driver for the SI controller and built a kernel that included it .
But Bezerkeley did n't have any SI disks , so he could n't test it there !
When he got back to QMC the Dectape was duly mounted , and hey presto ! - fortunately
Mike was a very good programmer !
A few comments from Mike Cole ....
George 's account is largely correct but there are a few points that unfortunately diminish my apparently legendary programming skills !
My memory is a little hazy in places but I think the following was the sequence of events in the summer of ' 73 .
I did n't pick up the tape from Bell Labs on my way to the West Coast .
Rather , while at PARC I spent a few afternoons in Mike Stonebraker 's group at Berkeley and obtained a copy of Unix and the documentation from them ( having obtained the requisite AT&T ; dispensations ) in the process .
I then set about learning sufficient C to write the SI disk driver and build a system using their 11/45 with LA30 Decwriters ( a painful experience ) .
As I recall they were in the throes of developing Ingres at that time .
Since it was so critical that the system worked first time when I got back to QMC I decided to stop over at Bell Labs on my way back to the UK in Oct.
Ken Thompson checked over my code , found a bug or two ( almost certainly to do with using pointers in C incorrectly ) and dumped the entire Unix software onto 7 or 8 Dectapes .
Unix then entered the UK for the first time in a PanAm bag !
I 'm really surprised to discover that Heriot Watt was the second UK Unix site .
I was always under the impression that it was either Kent via Steve Binns or UCL via Steve Wilbur .
Being the first site in the UK I remember being invited to both Edinburgh and Cambridge in ' 74 to present what we were doing with this odd - ball operating system called Unix .
I was struck by the very negative response , particularly from Neil Wiseman 's and Charles Lang 's people at Cambridge who just would n't contemplate adopting a system for which there was no support from the supplier ( as I recall they were using RSX - 11 at the time ) .
Such are the disappointments of the early evangelists !
Presumably Peter Salus 's research has already established that Jim Curry brought Unix into Europe for the first time , installing it at IIASA in Austria .
As I recall , Jim left PARC shortly after William went there .
Jim visited us at QMC in the winter of ' 72/'73 and helped to convince me that we were n't entirely crazy to base our new teaching system on Unix .
More about the 'em ' editor
At 5:21 pm +0100 3/9/98 , Eric Fischer wrote : * I just discovered your web page on the history of the " em " text editor .
*
There are several things I 'm curious to know more about so I hope you * do n't mind if I ask you a few questions : * * *
You mention that em was an extension of the standard ed text * editor ; did it entirely replace the ed line - oriented interface * the way vi does , or was the character - oriented interaction * invoked by a particular ed command ?
Em was just a compatible upgrade to Ed which allowed visual editing wihin a single line .
I used this approach partly because it could be implemented on any vdu ( by sending a RETURN character followed by a new version of the line after each alteration ) and partly because I did n't really know how to do a full - screen editor !
In fact it could even be used on a TTY , although the interaction was painfully slow and the each successive version of the line was printed on a new line .
* * *
In the version of your account published in A Quarter Century * of Unix , you indicate that em did not use the same keys for * editing commands as for typing text , yet it also ran on ADM - 3 * terminals and Teletypes , which have few special keys .
Does this * mean that control - key sequences were used for the editing functions , * as in emacs , or was there another mechanism ?
On ADM - 3s and most other contemporary vdus it used control keys .
At QMC we modified some VDUs .
We had some ITT 3210 vdus that had a block of blue ' arrow keys ' on the right of the keyboard .
These were only functional when the terminal was in ' full screen mode ' , when they could be used to move the cursor to a new screen position and overtype the character at that position .
This was all local interaction ; in ' full screen mode ' the contents of the screen were transmitted only when the Send key was pressed .
We modified the these terminals to send control codes when the ' arrow keys ' were pressed in normal character input mode .
This enabled the software to intepret them as editing codes .
This enabled me to implement Em in a more usable manner .
It also led to the development of ' ded ' , a full screen editor that was modeless , by my colleague Richard Bornat .
Subsequently , we obtained a larger number of Hazeltine 1510 terminals .
These were microprocessor controlled and we re-programmed them to provide a larger set of dedicated cursor control and character editing keys ( move forward a word , move backward a word , delete character backward , delete character forward , delete word backward , delete word forward , etc. )
This provided another huge step forward in usability and allowed us to maintain our modeless approach to screen editing , which was , we feel , superior to the Vi approach .
* * *
Do you remember any of the commands that em used , or still have * copies of any of the documentation or source code ?
After the above correspondence , the following files became available :
Source code for ' em ' ( including Ken Thompson 's origianl code for ' ed ' ) and accompanying documentation files .
Hardcopy of the " em " manual page .
Other topics that I hope to get around to writing about :

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Israel has blocked attempts to get a water purification station into Gaza and the equipment must now be brought back to France , the French Foreign Ministry said on Friday .
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Eric Chevallier said France had complained to Israel about its refusal to let in the equipment and had still not received a satisfactory explanation .
“ An important amount of aid was let in ( to Gaza ) , but for reasons which we have difficulty to explain , the water purification could not enter , ” he told a news conference .
“ We have decided to repatriate it . ”
Chevallier said the equipment was badly needed in Gaza , which is reeling from a 22 - day Israeli offensive .
Officials had hoped to transport it across the Israel - Gaza border last Sunday but were denied access .
France summoned Israel ’s ambassador to complain after French diplomats were blocked for hours on the Jewish state ’s border with the Gaza Strip .
Chevallier said the fate of the water unit was also raised but Israel refused to budge .
“ There were a very great number of steps taken at all levels to try to get the water purification station into Gaza , ” he said .
Ariane Sherine explains where the idea for the Atheist Bus Campaign came from and Polly Toynbee talks to Richard Dawkins about the word ' probably '
guardian.co.uk
Today , thanks to many Cif readers , the overall total raised for the Atheist Bus Campaign stands at a truly overwhelming £ 135,000 , breaking our original target of £ 5,500 by over 2400 % .
Given this unexpected amount , I 'm very excited to tell you that 800 buses – instead of the 30 we were initially aiming for – are now rolling out across the UK with the slogan , " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , in locations all over England , Scotland and Wales , including Manchester , Edinburgh , Glasgow , York , Cardiff , Devon , Leeds , Bristol and Aberdeen .
From today 's launch , two hundred of the buses will run in London , because the campaign was originally started as a positive counter - response to the Jesus Said ads running on London buses in June 2008 .
These ads displayed the URL of a website which stated that non-Christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from God and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell … Jesus spoke about this as a lake of fire prepared for the devil " .
Our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism .
In addition , we 're running adverts on two further types of media .
In my last Cif blog on the campaign , I asked Cif readers for ideas on alternative ways to spend the funds , and also for thoughts on different slogans .
Commenters WoollyMindedLiberal , PaoloV and Catch22 suggested that we use quotes from famous freethinkers , and we 've done just that : from Monday January 12 , 1,000 tube cards will run on London Underground featuring atheist quotations from Douglas Adams , Albert Einstein , Emily Dickinson and Katharine Hepburn ( see above ) , alongside the original campaign slogan .
An animated version of the slogan will also appear on two large LCD screens on Oxford Street ( opposite Bond Street tube station ) , so that you can see the advert live without having to wait for an atheist bus .
And , to thank all donors and show the strength of atheism in the UK , every ABC advertisement will contain the line " This advert was funded by public donations " .
Amazingly , the campaign has now gone international .
Spain 's Union of Atheists and Freethinkers are launching buses across Barcelona today with a translation of our slogan , Italy 's Union of Atheist , Agnostics and Rationalists are also planning to roll out atheist buses , while the American Humanist Association have been inspired to launch a campaign , and buses carrying their slogan " Why believe in a God ?
Just be good for goodness ' sake " have now been running for over a month in Washington DC .
Sadly , not every country has been so open to the idea : the Atheist Foundation of Australia tried to place the slogan " Atheism – celebrate reason " on buses , but were rejected by Australia 's biggest outdoor advertising company .
The campaign 's success is thanks to Cif and Cif readers .
If Matt Seaton had n't allowed me to run with the idea here , and so many of you had n't been so enthusiastic about it and donated generously to it , it would never have happened .
There may be further campaign developments , and the campaign website and Facebook group will be regularly updated with the latest news ; but for now , I hope you enjoy seeing the adverts on the streets , and that they brighten these bleak January days just a little bit .
As Charlie Brooker – one of the first people to donate to the Atheist Bus Campaign – says : " Public transport in Britain suggests there is n't a God anyway , but in case anyone has n't noticed , or feels isolated for thinking such a thing , this campaign should help . "
I hope it does .
Stupid Celebrity of the Day Award Goes To ....
The Stupid Celebrity of the Day award goes to ... prankster , or might we even suggest daredevil , .
His claim to fame was the MTV television show Jackass and at this moment that title seems oh so perfect .
Johnny was detained today at LAX airport for having a grenade in his carry - on bag .
Ok , first things first .
The grenade was fake but does that really matter ?
Who would even think to bring a grenade to the airport ?
Seriously !
Knoxville was at the American Airlines terminal trying to get through a checkpoint when the on duty screener saw the suspicious item .
The actor was detained , questioned and was given a ticket for having a " prohibited item . "
No worries , he made his flight on time .
FYI : replicas of firearms are illegal .
We think American Airlines should have booted him from the flight .... but that 's just our two cents .
