Major Brisbane traffic changes leading to delays of up to 50 minutes around the $ 380 million Go Between Bridge at Milton have been announced and will come into effect next month .
These changes include reducing the inbound and outbound lanes on Coronation Drive around the bridge 's construction site near Hale Street from three lanes down to two lanes .
Traffic using the Riverside Expressway and heading towards the Inner City Bypass will have to use the left - hand lanes , not the right - hand lanes as they do now .
These changes around the Go Between Bridge , formerly known as the Hale Street Link , will run from November 1 for the next four months while the Coronation Drive overpass is built .
Brisbane City Council 's deputy mayor Graham Quirk has defended the lengthy delays expected while the number of traffic lanes are reduced as a necessary difficulty to allow the bridge to be built .
The city elders of Milan wanted Mike Bongiorno interred alongside one of Italy 's greatest writers , Alessandro Manzoni .
His family decided to respect his wishes and have him buried instead in a village on the shores of Lake Maggiore .
But Silvio Berlusconi's government decreed he should have a state funeral , and yesterday thousands of mourners , including the prime minister , packed Milan cathedral for a service celebrated by a bishop and four priests .
Carabinieri in full dress uniform , carrying swords and wearing plumed tricorns , stood guard over the coffin .
For a day and a half it had lain in state in the grounds of the Sforza castle as thousands more people filed past .
Crafted in mahogany , it bore a red sash on which was printed in gold letters : " Cheer Up ! "
Only perhaps in Berlusconi's Videocracy could a state funeral be accorded to a TV quizmaster .
Bongiorno , who died of a heart attack in Monte Carlo on Tuesday at the age of 85 , was Italy 's Bruce Forsyth .
Just as the host of the Generation Game would burst on to the set with " Nice to see you , to see you – nice ! " , so Italy 's veteran showman had his signature greeting of " Allegria ! " .
But while Forsyth has had to content himself with a modest CBE , Bongiorno – once notoriously described by Umberto Eco as embodying " absolute mediocrity " – was sped into the afterlife with honours normally reserved for his country 's most valiant heroes and illustrious geniuses .
For almost 20 years , he was the top presenter on Berlusconi's Mediaset network .
He pioneered the presenter - endorsed advertising that has become one of the network 's hallmarks , and a rich source of income for its billionaire owner .
After a reportedly acrimonious break , Bongiorno defected to Rupert Murdoch 's Sky network in March – just weeks before Berlusconi's wife announced she was divorcing him , and launched the first in a stream of allegations concerning the prime minister 's sex life .
The death of the compere came at another ominous moment for Berlusconi .
Last week saw the first serious breach in his governing majority when Gianfranco Fini , the " post - fascist " speaker of the lower house , openly criticised him .
Fini 's attack followed the publication of a statement to police by a businessman who claims to have procured some 30 women for parties at Berlusconi 's Rome residence , and paid at least six who stayed the night .
Yesterday 's service was carried live by all three major networks , with images from the cathedral intercut with footage of Bongiorno 's career : the giant timepiece used in the Italian version of Beat the Clock ; Bongiorno awarding prizes in the local re-make of Wheel of Fortune ; the quizmaster flanked by showgirls .
Though state funerals have since been held for victims of notable disasters , the last individual to be honoured in this way , four years ago , was Nicola Calipari , an intelligence chief shot dead in Iraq .
Bongiorno returned from the US as a boy with his Turin - born mother and during the Second World War joined the anti-fascist partisans .
He was captured and spent time in Mauthausen concentration camp .
Bongiorno's characteristic , crescent - moon smile was seen by viewers on the first day of official TV transmissions in Italy by the state - owned RAI and he was among the earliest television celebrities to throw in his lot with Berlusconi 's nascent commercial network .
In a 1961 essay , Eco wrote that Bongiorno 's secret was not to make any viewer , even the most naive , feel inferior .
But the view of most left - wing intellectuals mellowed with time , perhaps a reflection of their gradual resignation to an Italy Berlusconi and his associates have made their own .
An editorial in the radical daily , Il Manifesto , last week credited Bongiorno with having furthered the " elementary schooling of the small screen " .
The bishop , Monsignor Erminio De Scalzi , paid a more effusive tribute , ending his sermon on the word " allegria " .
Speaking to reporters outside the cathedral , Berlusconi described Bongiorno as " a good , simple , positive man " .

Such hidden nightspots have become all the rage among a certain Tokyo set — weaned on anime and text messaging — that has graduated from dancing under the strobe lights at big Western - style nightclubs .
Infused with a knowing , postmodern nostalgia for pre-Sony Tokyo , these hard - to - find hangouts feel as intimate as living rooms and are often just as small .
They are not advertised on party fliers or virally hyped on Mixi — Japan 's answer to MySpace — but , oddly enough for a society intravenously hooked up to high - speed gadgetry , traded solely by word of mouth .
Tokyo , especially after dark , is notoriously hard to penetrate .
With its winding mazelike streets , the city is a challenge for even seasoned taxi drivers .
( Many bicyclists have GPS devices on their handlebars . )
So imagine hunting down the restaurants , bars and clubs that are stashed away in patchwork alleys , nondescript apartment buildings , faceless office towers and basement stairwells illuminated by red bulbs .
Discreet , out - of - the - way bars have been a staple of Japanese culture for decades .
Before World War II , Tokyo was filled with these pocket - sized dives — called nomiya ( counter bars ) — with space for just six or seven stools .
Behind the counter was a proprietor , whose role was both confidant and caregiver to the regulars .
When the city was rebuilt , however , most were bulldozed in favor of larger , glossier , more Westernized offerings .
Now a younger , postwar creative class is reviving nomiya culture — with a decidedly modern spin .
“ I do n't go out that often , but when I do , I like to go to these little secret places , ” said the contemporary artist Takashi Murakami , tinkering with a trademark anime sculpture .
“ There is something very familiar and personal about them that I find comforting .
They may have a modern design , but the feeling is more like traditional Japan . ”
For those looking to trade their track suits for a kimono , the retro-chic is partly a reaction to Tokyo's bloated cosmopolitan nightlife , which continues to be dominated by huge dance clubs with aspirational American names like Harlem , Air and Unit .
One of the more popular these days is Womb in Shibuya , which draws thousands on Friday nights dressed in almost identical T - shirts and limited - edition sneakers , dancing to techno under blue lights , a giant disco ball and the ubiquitous chill - out lounge with white vinyl banquettes .

Robert Maday , authorities say , was a busy man in his 26 - hour bid for freedom :
He overpowered and embarrassed two experienced police guards .
He bought a new set of clothes and eluded a manhunt that encompassed the full depth and breadth of the Northwest suburbs .
He carjacked two vehicles and robbed a bank of $ 7,000 .
But it all ended Friday with the Elk Grove Village man face down in handcuffs on a West Chicago lawn , left to contemplate another yearslong sojourn among the " hundreds of low - life morons " in federal prison he once vowed never to rejoin .
Maday was captured , police said , after the stolen car he was driving , with officers in close pursuit , sideswiped a Jeep and caromed into a traffic light at the intersection of James Street and Route 59 .
In his wake , he left a trail of heroes , fall guys and exhausted officers who worked through the night and reportedly were about to close in on him , even before he is believed to have carjacked a Volkswagen Jetta and robbed a Bloomingdale bank Friday morning .
Authorities were quick to credit the eagle eyes of a West Chicago officer who spotted the Jetta and initiated the contact that ended in Maday 's capture .
But the Cook County state 's attorney was nearly as quick to suspend the two agents who had been transporting Maday when he escaped .
The agents were taking Maday from a Kankakee County lockup Thursday to the Rolling Meadows courthouse to be sentenced for several suburban robberies , when he overpowered them , stole their weapons and left them handcuffed in their squad car , police say .
" The escape of Maday is an extremely serious breach of security , and the State 's Attorney 's Office has begun an internal investigation to determine the facts as to how this prisoner was able to escape from custody , " said Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez in a statement released Friday .
Alvarez said a preliminary investigation " determined that there were violations of office policies that govern the transport of prisoners . "
Beyond that , however , neither she nor police would say how Maday , cuffed at the feet and hands in the back seat of the squad car , managed to get the drop on the two experienced agents .
Federal authorities insisted it wo n't happen again .
" I can't speak for how other departments transfer their suspects , " said Kim Widup , U.S. marshal for the Northern Illinois District .
" I know how we will transport him , and he will not get away . "
Maday was taken to the federal lockup in Chicago by 5 p.m.
Friday after briefly being treated at Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield for back pain .
He is expected to face myriad new state and federal charges .
The massive manhunt for Maday began Thursday in the parking lot of a Rolling Meadows Meijer store , where police say he left his guards handcuffed while he bought a new set of clothes with money he stole from them , then used one of the two guns he took from them to threaten a woman and steal her car .
Using a hidden key , the agents freed themselves and called 911 .
Schools and businesses in the area were put on " soft " lockdown - with no one allowed to enter or leave - while authorities swarmed an apartment complex where Maday was believed to have fled .
That search was broken off after several hours , but police continued to pursue leads throughout the night .
Police working on a special U.S. marshal 's task force said they learned Maday had contact with acquaintances in Bloomingdale and Glendale Heights .
The acquaintances cooperated with the probe , officials said .
" He wanted a confrontation , " said an investigator who worked through the night on the case .
" If he wanted to run , he could have .
He had three different cars and many , many opportunities to flee on an interstate . "
Instead , police say , Maday greeted an unsuspecting 32 - year - old receptionist when she arrived for work at the Blackberry Falls Professional Center in Hoffman Estates , displayed a weapon and took off in her Volkswagen Jetta .
Then , at about 9 a.m. , according to authorities , he went to the First American Bank at the corner of Gary Avenue and Schick Road that he had robbed a year ago and again made off with several thousand dollars .
Police radios crackled with rumors and sightings throughout the morning - including one case of mistaken identity that led to an uncomfortable confrontation at the home of a woman whose husband had been the object of a tip .
" I 'm really ( upset ) right now , " the woman said Friday morning .
Then , just as Bloomingdale police were concluding a news conference to describe the bank robbery and carjacking , a report came that a West Chicago officer had spotted the Jetta heading north on Route 59 .
Deputy Chief Bruce Malkin said the officer initially pulled Maday over into a fast - food parking lot near the city 's downtown , but as the officer approached , gun drawn , Maday sped off and fled north .
The officer , a two - year veteran with a U.S. Marine background , radioed for backup and within minutes , other squad cars joined the pursuit .
Fugitive 's path
According to witnesses , Maday apparently attempted to squeeze between two cars , sideswiped one of them , a Jeep , and was launched into a traffic light at Route 59 and James Avenue .
Police said that as they approached , Maday made a peculiar hand gesture as if he were thinking of pulling a weapon , but instead dropped to the ground in surrender .
Police said they recovered both stolen weapons , one of which was in Maday 's waistband .
A West Chicago woman who was driving one of the cars Maday apparently tried to drive between said the scene was " like a movie . "
" He clipped the rear of the Jeep and then hit a light pole and that thing just flew up , " Michelle Lorman said .
The pole flew into the air and the Jetta came down in a group of 8 - foot - tall bushes nearby .
The 54 - year - old West Chicago man who was driving the Jeep was treated at Central DuPage Hospital for apparently minor injuries .
Another witness , Mike Panos of Plainfield , said he was staying at his girlfriend 's house in West Chicago and was awakened by the sounds of the chase .
" I heard the cop cars flying by and then heard the car smash into a light pole , " Panos said .
" It 's kind of crazy , because you live in the suburbs and now this weird stuff is happening out here . "
U.S. Marshal Chief Inspector Jason Grunwald expressed relief that the ordeal was over .
" It 's been a tense 24 hours since he 's been on the run , " Grunwald said .
" As fugitives stay on the run longer and longer , they get more and more desperate . "
Widup used a question about similarities to the Harrison Ford movie " The Fugitive " to praise officers who worked throughout the night without sleep .
" Hollywood has its own version of things , " he said .
" These guys would have stayed awake two more days if needed and that 's what Hollywood does n't show . "
Identified in one federal report as a " career offender , " Maday has a rap sheet dating back at least 22 years .
He was released from a Pennsylvania prison in September 2005 after serving 11 years for armed robberies .
He returned to Illinois but still had to report to Illinois officials as part of his parole .
While still on parole , however , he was arrested last December and later convicted of several bank robberies in Arlington Heights , Hoffman Estates , Bloomingdale , Lake Zurich , Huntley and Buffalo Grove .
He was being held in Kankakee County jail while awaiting sentencing of 12 to 15 years according to a plea agreement on the federal charges .
Federal authorities said they have not yet scheduled arraignment on an expected raft of new charges arising from his 26 or so hours of freedom .
He is being held in Chicago on the basis of the original convictions .
While free on parole , Maday apparently made at least two Web postings alluding to his time in the Lewisburg , Pa. , federal penitentiary .
In one , he ridicules two of his former jailmates who committed new crimes within a year of their release and were returned to prison .
" When you get back to the federal pen , say hello to the hundreds of low - life morons we left behind and greet them with hugs and kisses , " wrote an author identifying himself as Robert Maday of Des Plaines , " because that 's your family forever now . "

Mother of Severely Burned Florida Boy Pleads for End to Childhood Violence Valerie Brewer said she knows the teens accused of setting her son on fire .
Oct. 15 , 2009  --
The mother of a Florida boy who was severely burned after a group of teenagers set him on fire said adults need to do something to stop the wave of violence among children .
" People really need to wake up and see what 's going on with this generation .
They need to take hold of our children and really do something , " Valerie Brewer told " Good Morning America " today .
" The violence across our nation , across our world with our children is getting stronger and stronger , and we need to stop it now , so this does n't happen to somebody else . "
" It 's just unimaginable , " she said .
" Violence does n't solve anything . "
Brewer said her son is heavily sedated and has a tube to help him breath and can't speak .
It 's unclear how much he remembers of the vicious attack , in which five teens allegedly doused him with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire , sending 15 - year - old Michael running for a nearby pool .
He was left with severe burns over 65 percent of his body .
But Brewer said her son can open his eyes when he hears her voice .
He even tried to ask her to take his tubes out .
" I know he 's in excellent hands , " she said .
" He 's very strong . "
Dr. Nicholas Namias of Jackson Memorial Ryder Hospital , where Michael is being treated , said the burn covers portions of nearly every part of his body save for a strip down his front .
He cautioned that the teen 's condition could worsen in the coming days .
" It 's a rocky ride .
Things get worse before they get better , " Namia told " Good Morning America . "
" What 's going on now is the whole body goes under a huge inflammatory response , and so we start seeing difficulty with the lungs and kidneys . "
Even if Brewer makes it through the next few weeks , there is still the likelihood of organ failure and the painful prospect of multiple operations to replace the burned skin , his doctors said .
Namia said it was hard to tell whether Michael 's reaction of running to the nearby pool made things worse or saved his life .
" I still want every kid out there to remember stop drop and roll , " he said .
" The running part may have fanned the flames . "
Bank of America and Jackson Memorial Foundation have set up a fund in Brewer 's name .
Donations are being accepted at any Bank of America branch , and the Jackson Memorial Foundation can be reached at ( 305 ) 355-4999 .
Mother Knows Teens Who Allegedly Burned Her Son
The alleged assault , police have said , was prompted by an argument over a $ 40 video game .
Charged in the attack were Steve Shelton , 15 , of Deerfield Beach ; Denver Jarvis , 15 ; Jeremy Jarvis , 13 ; Matthew Bent , 15 ; , and Jesus Mendez , 15 ; all of Pompano Beach , Fla .
The boys are all charged with aggravated battery , according to the sheriff 's office .
In addition , Mendez , who police allege flicked the lighter that caused the fire , is charged with attempted second degree murder .
The four 15 - year - olds could be charged as adults because of the " degree of cruelty " involved in the attack , officials said this week .
But the fifth boy , 13 - year - old Jeremy Jarvis , may be too young to be charged as an adult .
Valerie Brewer said that she knows the teens who were arrested but said she did n't want to speak about them .
The vicious attack has shocked the Deerfield Beach community , nestled on the Florida coast north of Fort Lauderdale , not only for the act of setting Brewer afire but for the teens ' chilling reaction .
" I 'll be honest with you .
A couple of them were laughing about it last night .
[ Only ] one of them seemed genuinely sorry for what he did , " said Sgt. Steve Feeley , according to ABC News affiliate WPBF .
" The sheriff called it one of the most heinous crimes he had seen in his 31 years in law enforcement .
It 's a cliche to say a crime has shocked a community , but this crime really has shocked the community , " sheriff 's office spokesman Jim Leljedal told ABCNews.com .
Teen Burned Over a $ 40 Video Game
The Broward County State Attorney 's office has 30 days to decide whether or not to try Shelton , Bent , Mendez and Denver Jarvis as adults .
According to Assistant State Attorney Maria Schneider , in Florida people who are 14 and older can be transferred to adult court for certain types of serious felonies .
" Certainly the degree of cruelty and lack of consideration for others in this crime is something we take very , very seriously , " Schneider said .
Jeremy Jarvis could only be transferred to adult court by way of a grand jury for certain offenses but not for aggravated battery , because he is only 13 .
Schneider said her office has made no decision yet on whether or not to charge the juveniles as adults .
" We are nowhere near that point yet , " she said .
In making the decision , Schneider said the state attorney 's office would take into account any prior records of the juveniles , their behavioral history and the victim 's family 's wishes .
Authorities are calling the crime a " torturous attack " and said it all may have started over a video game .
Authorities said Brewer owed Bent $ 40 for a video game .
When Brewer did n't pay up , Bent tried to steal a bicycle belonging to the Brewer family .
The attempted theft was reported to the police .
The next day Brewer went to an apartment complex where the five suspects cornered him near a swimming pool , according to authorities .
At that point , the sheriff 's office alleged , Denver Jarvis splashed Brewer with rubbing alcohol and Jesus Mendez used a lighter to set him on fire .
Brewer ran into the pool to try to douse the flames .

Recently by Gary North : Who Will Inherit Your Money When You Die ?
I do not recall this in my lifetime .
A majority in the House of Representatives has co-signed H.R. 1207 , a bill introduced by Ron Paul to have the Federal Reserve System audited by an independent government agency , the Comptroller General ’s office .
The bill has been bottled up in committee by Barney Frank , who has insisted that he is doing this in order to better coordinate consideration of the best way to gain greater transparency from the Federal Reserve .
He has not said that he favors an independent audit of the FED .
It would be easy for Congressman Frank to hold hearings on the bill .
This would allow Dr. Paul to bring in expert witnesses on the FED to make the case for an independent audit .
It would get a lot of YouTube play .
It would be the first time since the replacement of eccentric Congressman Wright Patman in 1975 as the chairman of the House Banking Committee that the FED has been exposed to anything like serious criticism in Congress .
( Patman , an inflationist and a greenbacker , hated the FED .
He was chairman of the House Banking Committee , 1965 — 75 . )
Congressman Frank has yet to announce hearings .
There was a posting on the DailyPaul site that Frank will hold hearings soon .
Someone heard it on the radio .
I will believe it when I see the YouTube videos .
The FED in June hired a public relations expert , Linda Robinson , to deal with Congress .
She was formerly a lobbyist for Enron .
I have little doubt that it was H.R. 1207 that forced the FED into this move .
Now Ron Paul ’s book , End the Fed , is about to be published .
It is expected to become a best - seller .
Think about this .
There have been books attacking the Federal Reserve System for over ninety years , but they have been written by obscure people who no one in the general public has heard of .
They have not sold well .
They have not been written by someone who persuaded over half of the House of Representatives to support a bill to audit the FED .
They have not been written by someone who once raised over $ 30 million in a run for President .
This is unprecedented .
For the first time in the history of the Federal Reserve System , there are literally millions of people who have heard of the FED and who would like to see it shut down .
There have been academic and investment critics of this or that policy of the FED , most notably Milton Friedman , who criticized the FED for not inflating enough , 1930 — 33 .
But there has never been a serious audience ready to listen to arguments on why a system of 12 private banks should oversee monetary policy , and why one of them , the New York Federal Reserve Bank , should execute this policy without having to answer to anyone .
THE BLOOMBERG LAWSUIT
The Bloomberg news service has sued the Board of Governors of the FED under the Freedom of Information Act .
The lawsuit says that it is illegal for the Board of Governors to refuse to release information on which banks have received financial aid from the FED .
The Board of Governors countered with this argument .
The New York FED is a privately owned entity .
It executes monetary policy .
It is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act .
The FED also argued that the banking system would be threatened by the release of this information .
This case went to court .
The judge ruled on August 24 that the Board of Governors of the FED must make this information public no later than August 31 .
On August 26 , the FED asked the judge not to enforce her ruling .
Why not ?
Because it would be bad for the banking system .
She had heard that argument before .
Well , what else ?
The Board of Governors ’ lawyer insisted that the Board has no knowledge of what the New York FED — its legal agent — really does .
The lawyer said , “ We do n’t control the system of record - keeping in New York . ”
She insisted that the Board of Governors just cannot find out what the New York FED did with the money in time to meet the deadline .
Apparently , the Board of Governors , a government agency , has taken seriously Jesus ’ words regarding charity ( alms ) :
But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly ( Matthew 6:3— 4 ) .
The two FEDS , the government one and the private one , were surely involved in the charity business , to the tune of a trillion dollars or so .
This was a system of handouts on an unprecedented scale .
The Father in Washington has surely rewarded the FED in the past .
The FED expects more of the same in the future .
But now this pesky lawsuit forces an opening of the books .
Is the lawyer ’s argument credible ?
Perhaps the judge will not regard it as credible .
So , the FED had another argument .
The FED wants her to wait until the case can be heard on appeal .
But there was a hitch .
The FED did not say when it intends to appeal .
Here is the FED , with a court ruling against it , and with the clock ticking , admitting that it has no date set to file an appeal .
Its lawyers apparently had no fall - back position .
Is this credible ?
Of course not .
Will it work ?
We shall see .
If it does work , and if H. R. 1207 remains bottled up in committee , the growing army of people who have finally found out about the FED will have two more pieces of evidence that the U.S. government does not run the FED .
If the bill passes the House and the Senate , Obama will veto it .
The FED is not going to be audited by the government .
That is not how the world works .
The FED is only officially under government authority .
Except in wartime , it has never been under government authority .
It was set up to provide the illusion of government control .
That illusion has worked since 1913 .
The FED does face a major problem .
If it escapes from both the Congress and the courts , this will sell lots more copies of “ End the Fed . ”
On the other hand , if the court system finally forces the FED to reveal who got what and on what terms , then banks in the future will hesitate to go to the FED , hat in hand , because the public learn who was begging for a bailout .
This is not the sort of information that big bank bankers want the financial press to discover , let alone the Internet .
The handouts went to the big banks .
Most banks were ignored .
They were allowed to sink or swim .
This has created a problem : bank bankruptcies every weekend for as far as the eye can see .
416 PROBLEM BANKS
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , flush with a $ 30 billion loan from Congress , has announced that its list of problem banks climbed in one month from 305 to 416 .
The list is secret , of course , for the same reason that the New York FED ’s list is secret .
The FDIC does not want to cause a run on any of the 416 banks .
A bank run these days takes the form of wire transfers and checks written to other banks to open an account .
The money supply remains constant .
Some banks lose ; others win .
The bad banks go bust .
The FDIC then has to buy up all of their bad assets .
Solvent banks then buy the good assets .
The big winners are the solvent banks that buy their rivals ’ assets at fire - sale prices .
The big losers are taxpayers and investors who believe that all of the Treasury debt that Congress must sell to cover its loan to the FDIC will be repaid in real money some day .
On August 27 , the FDIC announced that its member institutions lost $ 3.7 billion in the second quarter of 2009 .
In a press release that was reminiscent of “ Spin City , ” the head of the FDIC , Sheila Bair , announced :
“ While challenges remain , evidence is building that the U.S. economy is starting to grow again , ” said FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair .
“ Banking industry performance is — as always — a lagging indicator .
The banking industry , too , can look forward to better times ahead .
But , for now , the difficult and necessary process of recognizing loan losses and cleaning up balance sheets continues to be reflected in the industry ’s bottom line . ”
Translation : “ The economy is better off than the banks are , and the economy remains in the pits .
Why ?
Because banks are not lending .
Someday , things will turn around for the banking system as a whole , but do n’t get your hopes up .
Cleaning up bank balance sheets these days is comparable to cleaning up the Augean stables , for all you classics buffs out there . ”
Chairman Bair went on to say , “ The FDIC was created specifically for times such as these .
No matter how challenging the environment , the FDIC has ample resources to continue protecting depositors as we have for the last 75 years .
No insured depositor has ever lost a penny of insured deposits … and no one ever will . ”
Translation : “ Congress may have to fork over another couple of hundred bullion — maybe $ 500 billion , if Senator Dodd ’s bill is signed into law — but no one will ever lose a penny in an FDIC - insured bank .
But taxpayers will pay a pretty penny to whoever buys all those T - bills that Congress will have to issue to keep the FDIC solvent . ”
The press release reported the following .
Total assets of insured institutions declined by $ 238 billion .
The number of institutions on the FDIC ’s “ Problem List ” rose .
At the end of June , there were 416 insured institutions on the “ Problem List , ” up from 305 on March 31 .
Total reserves of the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) stood at $ 42 billion .
[ No mention of the $ 30 billion loan from Congress to get reserves back up . ]
How bad is this number : 416 problem banks ?
Not as bad as 1882 problem banks .
That is the estimate of Institutional Risk Analytics , a private research firm .
The organization gave a grade of F to 1882 banks , as of June 30 .
This figure was up by 16.5 % since late March .
What about the number of A - rated banks ?
The number was down by 21 % since late March .
This list does not include the 19 big banks that went through the stress tests , which all of them passed .
The stress tests assumed that big banks would have enough capital to withstand a 9 % loss rate over the next two years .
The problem is , according to the company ’s managing director , that we are already at 9 % loss rates , and we are not yet at the bottom of the cycle .
If the economy does not recover by the 4th quarter , banking statistics will head down in 2010 .

The Federal Reserve System intervened to save the financial system in 2008 .
But has the system as a whole recovered ?
No .
Has unemployment stopped rising ?
No .
Has the economy recovered ?
No .
GROWING HOSTILITY TO THE FED
Always in the past , the Federal Reserve has remained free from serious criticism .
The media are obedient lap dogs .
So are the academic economists .
The textbooks never point out that the FED is the enforcing arm of a huge cartel .
The professors refrain from applying to the FED their analyses in their chapters on cartels .
Today , for the first time , there is a growing audience of intelligent people who are being exposed to the truth about the FED .
This has taken place outside Establishment channels , which includes the largest talk radio shows .
The FED has had a 90 - year free ride .
That ride is over .
The FED will never again get off scot - free .
The Web is sufficient to continue to inform people regarding the economic disasters that the FED has caused by its anti-recession , big - bank bailout policies .
Bernanke is pursuing the same low - interest rate policy that Greenspan pursued from mid-2000 to mid-2004 .
A few mainstream critics of Greenspan now say that his policy failed .
But they refuse to say that Bernanke ’s policy is the same , and that the resulting crises will be worse .
The critics do not see the operations of the FED in terms of a consistent theory of monetary cause and effect .
They view monetary policy as somehow based on the personality of the Chairman .
Before , Greenspan was “ the Maestro . ” Bernanke is “ the Professor . ”
The policies are the same : pump and dump .
The FED pumps up the money supply , and the Treasury dumps T - bills and T - bonds on the FED .
The FED has promised to unwind its doubled monetary base ( balance sheet ) when the economy revives .
In recent months , it has sold off some debt .
The monetary base is down from its peak .
The Treasury has been able to sell its debt to investors who still dear the economy .
This can not go on for more than a year unless the economy stays in recession .
The size of the deficits will be too great .
The FED really is trapped unless the economy revives , commercial bank credit to private industry revives , and price inflation remains low .
But a revival of commercial bank lending will turn the FED ’s monetary base into spendable money .
The M1 money supply will double .
The M1 money multiplier will go positive .
At that point , the FED will have to unwind , meaning sell off assets .
To whom ?
At what interest rate ?
It will be in competition with both the Treasury and Fannie / Freddie .
CONCLUSION
The FED has never had to play defense .
It has had a free ride .
The free ride is over .
The general public has still not heard of the FED .
The FED still has the advantage of invisibility .
But it is losing that invisibility .
This is not going to change .
The FED is a legitimate target for people who think the government botches the economy .
It is the classic example of the much - praised government - business alliance .
It is the consummate model of that alliance .
When it fails to achieve its twin official goals of low unemployment and low price inflation , millions of its economic victims will figure out who the culprit is .
End the Fed .

To the long list of reasons American companies are n’t hiring  business losses , tight credit , consumer retrenchment  add the fact that many of their older workers are unable , or afraid , to retire .
In other parts of the developed world , people are retiring as planned , because of relatively flush state and corporate pensions that await them .
But here in the United States , financial security in old age rests increasingly on private savings , which have taken a beating in the last year .
Prospective retirees are clinging to their jobs despite some cherished life plans .
As a result , companies are not only reluctant to create new jobs , but have fewer job openings to fill from attrition .
For the 14 million Americans looking for work  a number expected to rise in Friday ’s jobs report for August  this lack of turnover has made a tough job market even tougher .
Consider Barbara Petrucci , a dialysis nurse who had expected to stop working soon , or at least scale back to part time .
Now that her family savings have been depleted by market declines , she expects to stay on the job for a long , long time .
Brian Burke offered injured player Steve Moore an opportunity to resume his hockey career while both sides were still embroiled in a lawsuit in Colorado , according to documents obtained by CBC News .
Moore has not played since getting hit from behind by Vancouver Canucks forward Todd Bertuzzi while a member of the Colorado Avalanche in a March 8 , 2004 game .
Burke was Vancouver 's general manager at the time of the incident , but the Aug. 12 , 2005 , offer letter was made while he was serving as GM for Anaheim .
It was a two - way contract offer that would have paid Moore $ 475,000 US in the NHL and $ 75,000 if the player suited up for Portland , the American Hockey League affiliate of the Ducks .
Brian Burke was general manager with the Anaheim Ducks when he reached out to Steve Moore 's agent .
( ( Chris Carlson / Associated Press ) )
" In my opinion , Steve had progressed to the level of a competent minor league forward who would fill on occasion in the event of injury , " Burke said in the letter , directed to Larry Kelly , Moore 's agent .
" I would like to give Steve a chance to continue that development into a full - time National Hockey League player . "
The offer letter has come to light amid proceedings this week before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice .
Moore , who turned 31 on Tuesday , suffered three broken vertebrae in his neck and a concussion .
He is suing Bertuzzi , the Canucks and Orca Bay Ltd. , former owner of the NHL franchise .
Tim Danson , Moore 's lawyer , told CBC on Friday that far from a bona fide offer , Burke 's entreaty was a self - serving attempt to mitigate potential legal damages .
" For Brian Burke to be writing these letters , knowing that Steve Moore was n't healthy , knowing that he was n't medically cleared to play hockey — and now we know all these years later he 's never been cleared to play hockey again — is really to add insult to injury . "
Burke said in the letter he had to come to understand that Moore had made physical progress in his rehabiliation from the hit .
Not so , said Danson .
" Steve Moore 's condition at the time Brian Burke made these offers was quite frankly , very worrisome .
He had severe head injuries and the doctors were very concerned .
Burke declines to comment
Now general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs , Burke declined to comment when contacted by CBC Sports .
The legal battle moved to Canada after the Colorado courts threw out the lawsuit in October 2005 , citing lack of jurisdiction owing to Moore not having established sufficient residency in the state .
Burke made two more attempts to reach out to Moore with an offer after the initial contact , including once just after the suit was thrown out in Colorado .
Danson also objected on Friday to Moore being considered a minor league player by Burke , stating that the Richmond Hill , Ont. , native was playing on the first and second lines with the Avalanche , a first - place club .
That assessment would likely raise eyebrows among hockey observers .
Colorado would ultimately finish fourth in the Western Conference that season , which was Moore 's first full campaign in the league until his injury .
He had scored five goals and seven assists in 57 games before being cut short by the Bertuzzi hit .
Steve Moore has not played professional hockey since the Bertuzzi hit .
( ( Chuck Stoody / Canadian Press ) )
The genesis of the brutal hit dated back to an earlier game when Moore raised the ire of the Canucks for hitting Vancouver captain Markus Naslund while he was in a vulnerable position
" I think it 's a marginal player going after a superstar with a head - hunting hit , '' Burke said at the time .
The return encounter had newspaper headlines predicting a physical battle , although Naslund said publicly beforehand that he did n't want retaliation .
" When he plays , every time he's on the ice , everyone on our team will know , " Canucks player Wade Brookbank told the Vancouver Sun the day before the fateful game .
" We may not go crazy , but he 'll know we 're there . "
Burke 's offer letter for Moore to join the Anaheim organization is dated just four days after the NHL reinstated Bertuzzi .
The player would ultimately serve a 20 - game suspension .
Criminal charges filed against Bertuzzi in Vancouver resulted in a guilty plea and a sentence of one year 's probation plus 80 hours of community service .
Bertuzzi , 34 , went on to represent Canada on the 2006 Olympic hockey team .
It was a contentious decision , and one that stung Moore personally , he told CBC's The National later that year .
" When you are picking an Olympic team , you are picking people that represent your country and what your country is all about for the world to see , " Moore said .
Bertuzzi is now in his second stint with the Detroit Red Wings .
The suit has pitted Bertuzzi against his former coach Marc Crawford to some extent .
Bertuzzi said in a statement of claim that the Canucks coach told the team during the second intermission of the game that Moore " must pay the price " , with Crawford countering that the Vancouver forward acted in " direct disobedience " of the bench .
Moore 's brother , Dominic , played on the Maple Leafs last season — Burke 's first in Toronto — although he was later dealt at the trade deadline to Buffalo .
Bernard Madoff , once one of the most powerful men on Wall Street , now shares a cell with a 21 - year - old drug offender and eats pizza cooked by a convicted paedophile , according to a new legal filing that offers an insight into the fraudster 's prison life .
Joseph Cotchett , a California lawyer , sat with Madoff for a four - and - a - half - hour interview in July , and says he gave details of his new prison associates .
" Rather than spending time on private planes or his yachts , or residing in his luxury apartment in Manhattan , his Montauk , Long Island and Palm Beach mansions , or his property in Cap d'Antibes , France , " he says , " Madoff now shares a cell with a 21 - year - old inmate convicted of drug crimes .

" Madoff sleeps in the lower bunk and he eats pizza cooked by an inmate convicted of child molestation .
His recreation consists of walking around the prison track at night . "
Madoff , 71 , is serving 150 years after admitting he ran history 's largest pyramid scheme .
He agreed to meet Mr Cotchett in an attempt to shield his wife , Ruth , from a legal assault by the attorney 's firm , which is suing a slew of Madoff relatives , employees and business partners that it says knew , or should have known , about the scheme that cost investors $ 65 bn ( £ 40bn ) .
The suit also provides new allegations about what Mr Cotchett says was the unprofessional atmosphere at Madoff Investment Securities in New York , where Madoff was only pretending to invest his clients ' money .
The fraudster employed " street tough men from Harlem , who were not to be messed with " to bring drugs to the office , and topless waitresses were hired for cocaine - fuelled parties .
And , the complaint alleges , drug use was so " rampant " in the office that it was referred to as " the North Pole " .
BEIJING 
So far this week , the World Trade Organization has rebuffed China in an important case involving Chinese restrictions on imported books and movies .
The Chinese government dropped explosive espionage charges against executives of a foreign mining giant , the Anglo - Australian Rio Tinto , after a global corporate outcry .
And on Thursday , the government said it had backed off another contentious plan to install censorship software on all new computers sold here .
Throughout its long economic boom , China has usually managed to separate its aggressive push into the global business arena from domestic politics , which remained tightly controlled by the Communist Party .
But events this week raise the question of just how long it will be before the two meet .
In each of those matters , politics and business collided , and business won .
Business does not always win , and when it does , as in these cases , the reasons are as often as not a matter of guesswork .
But in at least some high - profile matters , China appears to be facing the reality that the outside business world can be freewheeling and defiant when its profits are threatened .
And so China ’s authoritarian system may also have to evolve in ways its top leaders may not readily endorse .
Beijing has a global footprint now , a consequence of its booming domestic growth and breakneck international expansion .
And decisions that once were made on purely parochial grounds  like censoring Web sites , protecting the interests of its state - owned companies and restricting the flow of foreign news and entertainment into China  now have international ramifications .
Mrs Hatoyama is a regular on the Japanese chat show circuit Japan 's new first lady is something of a Renaissance woman : designer , former actress , cookbook author , television personality - and perhaps most controversially a self - professed space traveller who has visited Venus with aliens .
If that were not enough , she also claims to have met Tom Cruise in a former life , when he was Japanese .
Miyuki Hatoyama , married to Japan 's new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama since 1975 , looks set to break the usually reserved mould of Japanese political wives .
But Mr Hatoyama has not tried to tone down his wife 's eccentric ways .
He has made no secret of his devotion to her , saying " she is like an energy refuelling base " .
' Life composer '
Her life was unusual by Japanese standards even before meeting Yukio in a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco in the early 1970s .
Born in 1943 in Shanghai , while the city was under Japanese occupation , she then grew up in the western Japanese city of Kobe .
When the sun is up , I always eat it
Miyuki Hatoyama
As a teenager she joined the Takarazuka Revue , a troupe of female singers and dancers who have achieved cult status in Japan for their glitzy interpretations of romantic musicals .
She divorced her restaurateur first husband and married Yukio Hatoyama in the US - a mild scandal for the son of an established political family .
Since then , Mrs Hatoyama has built a career as what she calls a " life composer " - a clothes designer , interior decorator and author of cookbooks including one called Miyuki Hatoyama 's Spiritual Food .
She styles her husband 's hair and chooses his clothes for public appearances .
She has also become a regular on the chat show circuit , discussing topics ranging from food , to politics to religion .
Profile : Yukio Hatoyama
But as her husband emerged as a clear favourite for the premiership earlier this year , it was her comments on her past lives and travels aboard an alien spaceship that attracted the most attention from the international media .
" While my body was sleeping , I think my spirit flew on a triangular - shaped UFO to Venus , " she said in an interview for a book on prominent people entitled Most Bizarre Things I 've Encountered , published last year .
" It was an extremely beautiful place and was very green . "
On a daytime chat show she revealed that having met Tom Cruise in a past life , she now wanted to make a film with him .
" He was Japanese in his past life , and we were together so when I see him , I will say ' Hi , it 's been a long time ' and he will immediately understand . "
" I will win the Oscar for sure . "
Mrs Hatoyama also explained how she " eats the sun " every day , to gain energy .
" When the sun is up , I always eat it ...
I tear it off and eat if like this , " she said on the chat show , joking with the host .
" Yum , yum , yum , " she said .
" That gives me great power . "

View of the LHC ( large hadron collider ) in its tunnel at CERN ( European particle physics laboratory ) near Geneva , Switzerland , Thursday , May 31 , 2007 .
The LHC is a 27 - kilometre - long underground ring of superconducting magnets housed in this pipe - like structure or cryostat .
The cryostat is cooled by liquid helium to keep it at an operating temperature just above absolute zero .
It will accelerate two counter - rotating beam of protons to an energy of 7 tera electron volts ( TeV ) and then bring them to collide head on .
Several detectors are being built around the LHC to detect the various particles produced by the collision .
A pilot run of the LHC is scheduled for summer 2007 .

French police have arrested a scientist working at the giant European CERN atom smasher laboratory .
He is being held on suspicion of being linked to al Qaida .
The physicist was one of more than 7,000 working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research whose massive underground particle accelerator spans the French and Swiss borders .
CERN said he was assigned to analysis projects under contract with an outside institute .
The man had no contact with anything that could be used for terrorism , said the organisation .
The LHCb experiment where he worked is the smallest of a series of installations along the 17 - mile circular tunnel under the borders .
The projects are aimed at making discoveries about the makeup of matter when the Large Hadron Collider - the world largest atom smasher - starts collecting data later this year or early next year .
LHCb is an experiment set up to explore what happened after the Big Bang that allowed matter to survive and build the universe we inhabit today .
The Big Bang was a vast explosion that scientists theorise was the beginning of the universe 14 billion years ago .
The European laboratory has been working for years to build the collider .
The man , who has not been named , was arrested yesterday in the eastern French city of Vienne accused of links to terrorist organisations in Algeria .
The case is being handled by the anti-terrorist section of the Paris prosecutor 's office .
Many of the scientists at the laboratory , whether or not they are employees of the organisation or of other institutes around the world , live in France , and about half the operation is on French territory .
The man has been working on analysis projects with the LHCb experiment at CERN since 2003 .
" None of our research has potential for military application , and all our results are published openly in the public domain , " the organisation said in a statement .

The Large Hadron Collider : End of the world , or God 's own particle ?
A bewildered Cole Moreton goes in search of the science behind the spin ...
Yes , but what is it ?
That has been many people 's reaction to the furore over the Large Hadron Collider , due to be switched on this Wednesday .
The biggest , most expensive experiment in history is attracting both scientific hyperbole and hysteria .
Some say it will reveal the universe 's secrets and lead to the elusive Theory of Everything .
A few fear that unleashing unimaginable power beneath the Swiss countryside will result in the end of the world .
But how ?
And what do all these words mean ?
Large
Is an understatement .
A giant circular tunnel , with several loops , stretches for 27 km under the land between France and Switzerland .
One of its experimental chambers is bigger than the nave of Westminster Abbey .
Hadron
The name for one of the types of particle that make up an atom .
These tiny bits of energy will be propelled by giant magnets around the tunnel circuit at almost the speed of light .
Collide
Is what they will do when they meet other hadrons being beamed in the opposite direction , at the same great speed .
The resulting explosion will create 100,000 times more heat than the sun , apparently .
Thankfully , it will only happen for a moment , in an area a billion times smaller than a speck of dust .
Cern
Pronounced " sern " .
The French acronym for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research , which built the £ 5 bn collider .
The money came from 20 countries , including Britain , which has played a leading role .
The Big Bang
Is what they are trying to recreate .
Or rather what happened a trillionth of a second after the universe was created by an explosion , 13.7 billion years ago .
For that tiny moment , it is believed everything was molten plasma .
This cooled to create everything we see around us .
The hope is that by remaking the moment , in miniature , the scientists will be able to see things that are invisible now .
The God Particle
Big name , very small thing ; and the first great discovery they hope to make .
It is believed we have only detected a quarter of the particles in everything .
We do n't , for example , know why things have mass .
( To get a feeling for what that is , hit yourself over the head with an inflatable hammer , then a real one .
The one that hurts has more mass . )
In 1964 Professor Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University predicted an unseen particle that provided mass ( its official name is a Higgs boson ) .
The hope is it will be detected for the first time .
Other possible revelations include so - called dark matter , which in theory " stretches through space like an invisible skeleton " .
The Theory of Everything
The Holy Grail of science .
A unifying theory providing one explanation for the forces at work in the natural world , from the nucleus of an atom to the movements of the planets .
Sounds like alchemy to non-scientists , but some very respectable minds believe it is possible , and that the collider may show the way .
The End of the World
Some scientists , on the other hand , went to the European Court for Human Rights to try to stop the collider being turned on .
They fear it may create a black hole – which would certainly violate our rights by sucking the planet into ... well we do n't really know .
Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith of Cern says : " The chance we produce a black hole is minuscule . "
Which is not all that reassuring .
But he adds : " Even if we do , it ca n't swallow up the Earth . "
It would be too small , and disappear in moments .
Belfast Telegraph
Ever since Glenn Beck took to the Fox television airwaves recently to offer a bizarre reading of the art commissioned 70 years ago for New York 's Rockefeller Center , I 've been puzzled by the graphic design element of his 9 - 12 Project .
The logo ( pictured ) for his affiliated groups ' rally in Washington , D.C. , this weekend derives from century - old communist , socialist and other left - wing designs .
Those were the motifs he railed against in his Rockefeller rant .
For the logo , three raised and clenched red fists are superimposed over the U.S. Capitol .
Obviously the bloody fist represents the tea - baggers ' themes of unity and resistance .
But do Beck ; the corporate - sponsored astro-turf group , FreedomWorks , headed by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R - Texas ) ; the Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights ; the private - property group , the National Assn. of Rural Landowners ; and the rest of the march sponsors know the symbol 's origins ?
Unity and resistance are what the fist represented in 1917 , when it was first employed by the Industrial Workers of the World , a union organization founded by socialists .
And in the 1940s , when it stood for various nations ' communist party organizations .
That 's also what it meant when it was revived in the 1960s , appearing as a symbol for the SDS , as well as anti-war and feminist movements .
It was the basis for the black - power salute given by John Carlos and Tommie Smith at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics .
And today , it 's the symbol for the Progressive Labor Party ( pictured ) , a political outfit whose website says it " fights to smash capitalism . "
Turnout for the 9 - 12 Project 's Saturday march on Washington was a bust ; 30,000 protesters signed up in advance ( MSNBC reporter David Shuster tweeted that D.C. park police called that figure " generous " ) .
But even if three times that many actually showed up , the number would fall far short of the hundreds of thousands ( and even millions ) claimed to be planning to attend .
Even in that reduced crowd , however , surely someone recognized how odd the right - wing gathering 's left - wing logo was .
Maybe Beck will explain .
Sort of .

Alex Hartley says there will be " magic " in the island project The Arts Council has awarded Devon artist Alex Hartley £ 500,000 to tow part of an Arctic island to the UK .
Rocks from the island in the Svalbard archipelago north of Norway will be dug by excavator and placed on a barge .
They will then be brought to the UK where they will be put on a floating football pitch - sized platform to create the work , to be called Nowhere Island .
It will be in Weymouth for the Olympic sailing in 2012 , before a tug tows it around the South West coast to Bristol .
Gillian Taylor , from Arts Council England , said there would be an environmental education programme linked with the artwork .
The donor island was found by Mr Hartley in 2004
She said : " We wanted something big and special and thought - provoking on an environmental issue .
" Good art is about ideas .
And it 's going to be a fantastic piece of art work .
" Lots of people will think it is worth the money . "
Mr Hartley , from Dunkeswell , fought off a number of competitors to win the race to the £ 500,000 commission from London 2012 and the Arts Council .
It is one of 12 arts projects chosen nationally to represent each of the UK regions as part of the Cultural Olympiad to run alongside the sporting events in 2012 .
It is slightly absurd ... but when you see the island there will be magic in it
Artist Alex Hartley Mr Hartley found the unnamed island on a climate change expedition in 2004 .
People will be invited to become citizens of Nowhere Island , although no - one will be allowed on it except Mr Hartley .
After the project finishes the island will be towed back to Norway .
He said : " I 'm not going to get rich from this project . "
He maintained that the environmental cost of towing the island was outweighed by the " poetry of the project " .
" It is slightly absurd , but it is really easy to engage people with .
" When you see the island there will be magic in it . "

Astronomers at the University of Western Ontario have recovered a golf - ball sized fragment of a meteorite that hit an SUV in southern Ontario .
The University of Western Ontario released this composite image of the meteorite as seen from Hamilton .
( ( UWO ) )
The exterior of the 46 - gram fragment of an " ordinary chondrite " meteorite is completely fusion - crusted , meaning it melted in the Earth 's atmosphere .
The researchers said chondrite is a particularly important type of meteorite because it provides information about material that formed in the early solar system .
They estimate the rock to be about 4.6 billion years old .
The researchers had appealed to the public for help in locating the meteorite that lit up the sky west of Lake Ontario in September , and had released images , video and maps of its possible location .
Yvonne Garchinski of Grimsby , Ont. , saw media coverage of the meteor 's fall on Sept. 25 , described as a fireball about 100 times brighter than the full moon , and made a connection between it and the smashed windshield of her sport utility vehicle .
Her son
Tony also found unusual rocks on the car 's hood the morning after the meteor strike , but thought they were the result of vandalism and filed a police report .
The university 's network of cameras in southern Ontario captured the descent of the meteor and allowed researchers to project where it might have landed .
The meteor first appeared on camera above Guelph , Ont. , and was tracked to an area between Hamilton and St. Catharines .
Astronomers at UWO , in London , estimate the meteor was travelling across the sky at nearly 75,000 km/h .
Orbit to be reconstructed
Phil McCausland , a postdoctoral fellow at Western 's Centre for Planetary Science & Exploration , said the visual records , radar and sound wave data of the meteor event will allow scientists to reconstruct its orbit before it hit the Earth .
" We can also figure out where it came from and how it got here , which is rare .
In all of history , only about a dozen meteorite falls have that kind of record , " he said in a release .
Peter Brown , a professor at Western , said the find is the equivalent of sending a probe into space and having it return with a sample .
" We 've worked out the orbit , where it came from , so it becomes a material within context .
It 's like a geologist who can pick up a rock which may be interesting , but if you know where it came from , that context , it means so much more .
Most meteorites , we do n't have the context .
This one we do , " said Brown .
The meteorite is on loan from Garchinski : meteorites found in Canada belong to the owner of the land on which they fall .
McCausland and Brown agree it's likely there are more meteorites to be found in the Grimsby area .
( CNN ) -- A Chinese ship with 146 people aboard was hijacked Monday in the Indian Ocean , the European Union Naval Force said .
The bulk carrier De Xin Hai was hijacked around noon about 550 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles and 700 nautical miles off Somalia 's eastern coast , the EU Naval Force said in a statement .
The EU force found the ship not long afterward .
Two pirates could be seen on deck , but as many as 20 could be on board , a task force spokesman said .
The 146 people on board included 25 Chinese crew members , said John Harbour , a commander with the British Royal Navy who serves with the EU Naval Force .
The naval force was monitoring the ship 's movements Monday afternoon .
The ship was dragging two skiffs behind it , much like the kind of skiffs that pirates have been known to use to hijack ships in the waters off Somalia .
My secret shame
In a world of distributed version control systems I ’m ashamed to confess I still use Subversion .
We use it at work , exclusively .
I use it at home , by default .
Worse still , in a small way , I help promote and perpetuate this antiquated version control system : if you want to mirror a Subversion repository or set up a Subversion pre-commit hook , you may well find some faded notes I wrote on these subjects .
Whisper the words .
I still like Subversion .
What do I like most ?
The command to revert a change .
Merge it backwards .
$ svn merge -- change - 666
Branches and tags are one and the same .
For someone who grew up with CVS , that ’s quite a relief .
Anyone can grasp the versioned file tree model .
No one wants their version control system to surprise them .
My boss , who does n’t get to program as much as he ’d like , has discovered a shiny Subversion client — and he does n’t even use Windows .
The sales team , who do use Windows , can use Subversion to collaborate on their office documents .
TortoiseSVN interfaces to the Word diff tool , a nice touch .
And software developers can surely find stable Subversion plug-ins for whatever tools they use .
The Subversion documentation is solid and has been for some while .
I ’m surprised anyone ever arrives at my website seeking tips , but arrive they do , and in ever - increasing numbers .
Subversion does enough .
The hard parts of my job are deciding what software to write , writing it , and working as a team .
Version control should be frictionless , the easy bit .
Which it is .
Of course Subversion has weak points .
It should be faster ( whee , see how git flies ! ) and merging can be irksome ( improving on CVS was n’t much of a target ) .
But the biggest annoyance I ’ve had with Subversion is caused by its ubiquity and its continuing upgrade trajectory .
Somehow I ’ve ended up accessing 1.4 and 1.5 format repositories on a machine which hosts 1.4 , 1.5 and 1.6 clients in /usr / local / bin , /usr / bin and / opt / local / bin , not necessarily in that order .
Silly me , I ’m sorted now , I think , but I ’d happily see Subversion go into maintenance mode .
For managing change , give me stable software .
Do it the same , but better !
As mentioned at the start of this post , though , the world of version control has itself changed .
Subversion represents evolution : by being a better CVS , it aimed to supplant its ancestor and become the VCS of choice for open source projects .
CVS has indeed been supplanted , but true progress has come from the distributed version control revolution .
We ’ve been talking about a single , central source tree which develops in discrete steps .
Everyone has a local working copy of the files in this tree , which they keep up to date , routinely merging changes back to base .
Check out , check in .
It is an easy model to understand , but in practice there can be problems .
What happens when you ca n’t access the tree ?
Or when it gets pulled in different directions ?
Or when you lose track of who merged what where when ?
Now consider the distributed version control world , where the model extends to multiple trees .
Everyone copies the entire repository as needed .
Clone , merge .
In this distributed world a project need n’t have a single , central repository [ 1 ] .
What ’s more , there is no single leading distributed version control system .
As a result , open source projects are spoiled for choice .
The rise of the DVCS is a fascinating history , though one I ’ve yet to directly engage with — unless you count the growing collection of DVCSes taking root on my hard disk ( none of which shipped with my operating system ) .
I like the feel of git .
Python will migrate to mercurial .
For now , I ’m staying put .
Definitive commentary
Ben Collins - Sussman is one of the original designers and developers of Subversion , and co-author of Version Control with Subversion .
His essays on the changing field of version control make fine reading .
A couple of years ago he wrote :
Today , Subversion has now gone from “ cool subversive product ” to “ the default safe choice ” for both 80 % and 20 % audiences .
The 80 % companies who were once using crappy version control ( or no version control at all ) are now blogging to one another — web developers giving “ hot tips ” to each other about using version control ( and Subversion in particular ) to manage their web sites at their small web - development shops .
What was once new and hot to 20 % people has finally trickled down to everyday - tool status among the 80 % .
The great irony here … is that Subversion was originally intended to subvert the open source world .
It ’s done that to a reasonable degree , but it ’s proven far more subversive in the corporate world ! —
Ben Collins - Sussman , Version Control and “ the 80 % ” , October 2007
In April last year he followed up with :
[ … ] we think that [ Subversion ] will probably be the “ final ” centralized system that gets written in the open source world — it represents the end - of - the - line for this model of code collaboration .
It will continue to be used for many years , but specifically it will gain huge mindshare in the corporate world , while ( eventually ) losing mindshare to distributed systems in the open - source arena …
Subversion is n’t anywhere near “ fading away ” .
Quite the opposite : its adoption is still growing quadratically in the corporate world , with no sign of slowing down .
This is happening independently of open source trailblazers losing interest in it .
It may end up becoming a mainly “ corporate ” open source project ( that is , all development funded by corporations that depend on it ) , but that ’s a fine way for a piece of mature software to settle down .
— Ben Collins - Sussman , Subversion ’s Future , April 2008
Long live Subversion
Ben Collins - Sussman backs up his essay with a graph showing the increasing numbers of Apache Subversion servers discoverable on the internet .
His claims square with my personal experience .
I ’m a corporate Subversion user and I do n’t see my employer switching version control systems any time soon ( it ’s my decision as much as anyone ’s ) .
What ’s more , Subversion is used in most of the companies I know of , where it has supplanted both legacy and proprietary systems .
As stated already , version control is n’t the hard part of my job , but should I ever need to change jobs , Subversion wo n’t stand in my way .
[ 1 ] : A project may well choose to nominate a single central repository as the “ master ” repository .
The functionality offered by distributed version control systems is effectively a superset of that offered by centralised ones .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Fox business news channel of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp has agreed to simulcast the radio show of Don Imus , the ratings - grabber who stirred a national controversy on race two years ago .
Radio personality Don Imus talks on air during his return to radio in New York , December 3 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
Fox Business Network ( FBN ) said on Thursday it had signed a multiyear deal to show the Imus program on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. starting on October 5 .
“ The program will incorporate additional business news into its format , which now offers a mix of current affairs , politics , entertainment and sports , ” Fox said in a statement .
The Imus show will continue to be syndicated on the radio by Citadel Broadcasting Corp .
Fox Business Network launched in October 2007 to compete with CNBC , a unit of NBC Universal which is owned by General Electric and Vivendi .
Since its launch , Fox Business Network ’s morning audience has regularly been dwarfed by CNBC , and television analysts have said it needs a jolt .
Imus may provide that , but his show also raises questions about whether the network will continue to concentrate on business news or is ready to move in other directions to attract viewers .
Imus ’ show of off - color humor and politics will air in the critical hours before markets open in New York .
The “ Money for Breakfast ” show from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. will be canceled and the “ Opening Bell ” show will continue in the 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. slot .
Imus , among the highest - rated radio hosts in the United States , caused a scandal in 2007 when he referred to a mostly black women ’s basketball team as “ nappy headed hos . ”
The phrase combines a term for short , curly hair with slang for whore and was widely criticized as racially charged and offensive .
Imus apologized , but the comment led MSNBC cable television to cancel the simulcast of his radio show , which was also aired by CBS Radio .
CBS then fired Imus when the controversy persisted .

Conservative columnist George Will , having argued earlier this week for a US withdrawal from Afghanistan , today says we should get out of Iraq sooner rather than later .
Will ’s main arguments are :
1 . The past 6 1/2 years in Iraq have produced 4,327 American dead and 31,483 wounded
2 . The US military is exhausted and needs a break
3. Afghanistan is spiralling down
4 . It is a poor use of US troops to deploy them for a ) nation - building or b ) baby - sitting and correcting other peoples ’ politicians
5 . The Iraqi government is an ingrate and makes no secret of its belief that it does not need US troops
6 . It may be true that Iran will inherit Iraq as a client if the US leaves , but this outcome is unavoidable and cannot be forestalled by a longer US stay
7 . An extension of the US presence in Iraq will not succeed in ensuring Iraqi democracy , which is fragile and may not survive regardless of what the US does
8 . A longer US stay cannot prevent Iraq from falling back into civil war
9 . Either the surge succeeded or it did not .
If it did , then Iraq is secure and the US is n’t needed .
If it did not , then no further surge is likely to , either .
Will alleges that deaths from political violence have increased since the US stopped patrolling the cities , but as I argued earlier this week , the two - month average of civilian and security forces ’ deaths in Iraq since US patrols ceased is lower than some recent months when the US was in charge .
( We are not talking about ordinary criminal murders here , as some of Will ’s Neocon critics imply ; we are talking about guerrilla attacks for political purposes ; Washington DC does n’t routinely have the facade of government buildings torn off by massive bombs ) .
Will , like myself , was a skeptic on the surge and he points to Iraq ’s obvious continued instability as evidence that the surge ( the addition of 30,000 troops for counter - insurgency in 2007 ) only papered over long - term trends toward violence that are now re-emerging .
Me , I say violence did decline , but that it was mainly as a result of the ethnic cleansing of the Sunnis from Baghdad .
Shiite militias cannot kill Sunnis in their neighborhoods if there are not longer any Sunnis in their neighborhoods .
So is Will right ?
On the whole , yes .
The US cannot afford a large , long - term military commitment to Iraq , either in blood or in treasure .
The Iraqis do n’t want us there .
The US military cannot , whether it stays 2 years or 5 , forestall Iran being highly influential in Shiite Iraq , and nor could it probably forestall an Arab - Kurdish civil war .
( It could not stop the Sunni - Shiite civil war of 2006 - 2007 from unfolding under its nose in Baghdad– and it is weak up north , so how could it stop Arab - Kurdish violence ? )
Will and I probably disagree about US obligations to help with Iraqi rebuilding ( and resettling the 4 million displaced Iraqis the US helped create ) .
But we can agree , at least , that the US military is not the right agency for nation - building or for telling Iraqi politicians what to do .
Anyway , the Iraq withdrawal is in my view a done deal .
Bush negotiated it with the Iraqi parliament , and Obama is committed to it .
Iraqi parliamentarians and militias will not put up with a long - term US military presence in Iraq .
The dwindling band of Neoconservatives , who believe in force - feeding “ democracy ” to colonized peoples , are virtually the only ones who even demur .
Iraq is not a good candidate for democracy .
It has severe ethnic divisions and grievances , a very valuable primary commodity in the form of petroleum , and a low real per-capita income ( which is distorted by the oil wealth , which , however , is not shared with the population directly ) .
The three characteristics I just mentioned are highly correlated with substantial internal violence , and do not bode well for stable democracy .
I wish Iraq well , but Will is right that three or four more years of US troop presence are not going to change these dynamics .
And , what the Neoconservatives ignore is that the US troop presence is viewed as an occupation by most Iraqis and by virtually everyone in the Arab world , so that it is provoking opposition and instability , not forestalling them .
Most Neoconservatives do n’t know anything serious about Iraqi society or indeed about the actually - existing Middle East .
I think some of them want the US in Iraq for reasons that have to do with their devotion to Israel ; and while the US should work for the security of all its allies , the Neocons are just wrong that US troops in Iraq help with that .
Since they cannot allow themselves to see that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is a huge catastrophe , likewise they cannot admit to themselves that the US presence in Iraq is a disaster .
Will would have strengthened his argument if he had pointed out that the new Iraqi military has had some success in restoring basic order to Basra , Amara and Nasiriya , and that if anything the Iraqi army seems to be getting better at domestic security provision .
( His gaffe in thinking that violence has increased on average since July 1 may have made this argument difficult for him to put forward . )
Will ’s tough - guy rhetoric about not caring if Iraq sinks or swims is the one element of his article with which I strongly disagree .
I care , I just think its swimming can be arranged for in ways other than the US infantry .
In making his argument about Iraq , Will essentially supported Obama against the Neoconservatives in his own party .
He might even be signalling that he thinks Republicans would be foolish to run on staying in Iraq in the 2010 congressional midterms , contrary to the advice they would get from John McCain , the Weekly Standard , the American Enterprise Institute , and Sarah Palin ( none of whom Will likes very much ) .
Thus , although the form of the argument was similar , the Iraq article differed significantly in its political implications from his Tuesday piece on Afghanistan .
Obama has put a lot of the eggs of his presidency in the AfPak basket .
Will is saying that was a mistake .
Obama may end up having to depend on Republican support to prosecute the Afghanistan War .
Will is saying that the Republicans are mistaken to back the war and implying that Obama could drag his party down on this issue .
The Neoconservatives attacked Will on that column , as well .
But I think he , and not his Neoconservative critics , has the greater chance of seeing his ethos prevail over time in the Republican Party .
Any Republican presidential candidate in his or her right mind will run against the Afghanistan War in 2012 .
If the Republicans rally to support of Obama ’s war , they will deprive themselves of a key critique that is increasingly popular with the US public , and will doom themselves to “ me - too - ism , ” always dangerous to a political opposition party .
Will ’s critics will mainly come from the ranks of those whose palms are greased by the military - industrial complex .
The war industries are an important component of the Republican Party , but they do n’t always get their way there ; and they are perfectly capable of throwing their support to the Democrats , if they think the latter will keep the bomb - manufacturing factories open and producing .
Will is repudiating his hawkish stances in the 1980s and through 2003 .
It would not be fair to accuse him of 1930s style isolationism .
He just is not exercised by the alleged threat from the Muslim world in the way he was about International Communism .
Either he is becoming an outlier in the party , or he is in the vanguard of a sea change in Republican philosophy .

The father of a boy thought to have been carried away by a helium balloon before being found at home has repeated denials that the incident was a hoax .
Richard Heene told US TV networks that the disappearance of his son Falcon , six , was not staged .
Police say they intend to re-interview the family .
Falcon aroused suspicions by saying on air he had stayed hidden as his parents " said that we did this for a show " .
Richard Heene and his wife previously appeared on reality TV show Wife Swap .
TV network ABC described them as a " storm - chasing , science - obsessed family " .
Thursday 's balloon drama was itself played out on TV , with US networks devoting their airtime to live footage of the balloon over Colorado .
We intend to go back and further ask the family to co-operate with our investigation through answering more questions
Sheriff Jim Alderden
The balloon landed in fields and was surrounded by rescue vehicles after a two - hour flight , prompting a ground search for the missing boy and further fears for his safety .
But Larimer County sheriff Jim Alderden later announced that the boy had been found alive and well in a box in the roof - space of the garage at his family 's home .
He said on Friday that his officers had been convinced throughout Thursday that they had been dealing with a genuine situation .
However , he conceded , the boy 's comments while being interviewed on TV had " raised some questions " .
" We intend to go back and further ask the family to co-operate with our investigation through answering more questions and resolve this issue , " he told the Associated Press .
Boy ' confused '
The news that Falcon had been found safe and well delighted both the Heenes and the TV networks .
I 'm starting to get a little ticked off .
What have I got to gain out of this ?
Richard Heene
Father of ' balloon boy ' Falcon Heene
However , questions over the family 's motivation later emerged during a CNN interview .
Mr Heene was asked by an interviewer to ask his son why he had not emerged from his hiding place when he heard his parents calling out his name .
Speaking hesitantly at first , Falcon answered : " You had said that we did this for a show . "
In spite of quick denials from his father , speculation that the Heenes had faked the entire incident persisted into Friday , when the family appeared on more US TV talk shows .
HEENE FAMILY Father Richard , wife Mayumi , three sons - Brad , Ryo , Falcon Family appeared on reality TV show Wife Swap , described as science - obsessed Father is an amateur scientist and keen " storm chaser "
Home videos posted on YouTube , including three sons performing rap song
And in a bizarre twist , Falcon himself became ill while his father was asked direct questions about whether or not they had staged an elaborate hoax .
During one interview on NBC's Today show , Falcon vomited live on air as Mr Heene sought to explain his son 's comments .
He was also heard being ill off camera during an ABC interview while his father answered the same questions .
Mr Heene battled on while his son was being sick , telling his NBC interviewer there was " absolutely " no hoax .

" Now I 'm starting to get a little ticked off , " he said .
Insisting that he had nothing to sell and no motivation to force his son into the limelight , he asked : " What have I got to gain out of this ? "
Pressed on what his son might have meant , Mr Heene struggled for an answer on CNN on Thursday night , saying that his son must have been confused by the family 's previous appearance on Wife Swap .
In a later segment of the interview Mr Heene avoided a request to ask Falcon once again what he meant by his comment , and instead rounded on his questioner .
" I 'm kind of appalled after all the feelings that I went through , up and down , that you guys are trying to suggest something else , " he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - People newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes often resist taking insulin because they fear gaining weight , developing low blood sugar , and seeing their quality of life decline .
Doctors also may be reluctant to start insulin right off the bat .

But a new study suggests that those fears are largely unfounded .
Insulin “ should not be viewed as a treatment of last resort , ” Dr. Ildiko Lingvay and colleagues from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas wrote in the journal Diabetes Care .
In their experience , insulin can be safely and effectively used as a first - line treatment in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes , with high rates of patient satisfaction and compliance .
“ Our study busts the myths surrounding insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes , ” Lingvay noted in an email to Reuters Health .
More than 20 million Americans have type 2 diabetes .
Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk for the disease .
The standard initial treatment for type 2 diabetes is a single drug , often metformin , which helps regulate blood sugar levels , followed by the addition of more blood sugar - lowering agents as needed .
The UT Southwestern team studied the effectiveness of insulin - based therapy as an initial treatment option to newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics .
They compared rates of compliance , satisfaction , effectiveness , safety and quality of life among 58 patients , who were randomly allocated to standard triple drug therapy or insulin plus metformin .
After 3 years , the researchers report , patients taking insulin plus metformin had fewer low blood sugar , or “ hypoglycemic , ” events , gained less weight and reported high satisfaction levels with the insulin .
In fact , all of the patients in the insulin group said that they would be willing to continue this form of treatment after the study .
“ Insulin is the most effective ( blood sugar - lowering ) agent in our treatment armamentarium , ” the investigators note .
“ With the new devices that we ’re using , giving yourself an insulin shot is not much harder than taking pills , ” Lingvay added in a university - issued statement .
This study , Lingvay told Reuters Health , suggests that insulin is “ a safe , effective , well tolerated and well accepted alternative for long - term treatment of type 2 diabetes , even from the first day of diagnosis . ”

Okay so that is n’t really true .
I found the love of my life 10 years ago and then last Monday he scored a last minute dinner reservation where I meet the second love of my life , the Pork Fat English Muffin
A little after 6:00 Mr T came home .
Now I am an early eater and usually have dinner made by around 6:30 or so .
Since we had eaten lunch so late I was n’t feeling hungry just yet so we decided to hold off .
Then as I ’m taking dishes out of the dishwasher Mr. T suddenly says “ What do you think about eating dinner around 8:45 ? ”
I must have looked at him like he was crazy .
8:45 ?
Why would I want to eat that late ?
Does n’t he know I have to get up early for work ?
Was he just being obnoxious ?
Then he turned the computer screen around so I could see it and calmly said “ I just got us reservations for Ko . ”
Holy S**T !
I could n’t believe it !
Ko !!!
We had both been trying every ten minutes it seemed over the past 2 weeks with no luck .
But Monday night !!
Could this be possible .
I was so excited I felt like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory getting the Golden Ticket .
I was practically running down the street on the way there .
I had avoided reading reviews since it opened so I would be surprised .
I could n’t wait to see what was in store .
We got to Ko right at 8:45 and had to wait for about 10 minutes until our seats at the bar were available .
While we waited we stood at the front table and were given an excellent glass of Cleto Chirarli Rose and some snacks .
First they brought out a bowl of Nori chips and Ama Ebi heads .
The chips were okay but the Ebi heads were a little much for me .
I actually really liked the flavor but I could n’t get over the texture of the insides .
I ’ve never been big fan of eating heads :)
Then they brought over a bowl of Shishito Peppers covered in Toasted Almonds .
These were really good .
The peppers had a nice bite to them and the almonds were almost a little caramelized from being roasted which balanced the spice of the pepper .
We were just finishing our glass of wine when our seats became available .
We walked along the back of the bar all the way until the end .
I was happy to see we were seated last .
The stools were spaced quite far apart and there was actually a ton of room between myself and the wall .
Much more spacious than I would have expected .
Mr T and I had decided to go for the wine pairings with each dish , so we did n’t look through their drink list .
They did have some great beers though including two favorites of mine Hennepin and Allagash .
The chef behind the counter greeted us , confirmed our food allergies and we were ready to rock !
Within seconds they sent over our first amuse bouche which was basically 2 salty pork rinds .
These were good .
Definitely the best pork rinds I have ever had .
A nice start to the meal , but what came next blew me away .
The English Muffin with Chicharron .
These two muffins came out looking perfectly toasted on the edges and across the nooks .
Then I took a bite .
For the second time that day I could n’t speak .
I ca n’t even describe the flavor .
It was n’t overpowering just spectacular .
The little nooks and crannies were soaked in luscious pork fat that was n’t oily , just delicious .
There are no words in the dictionary to describe the bliss I had when eating this muffin .
I would call this transcendent .
All I can say is I love pork fat .
Then came our first dishes .
For Mr. T it was a Fluke Sashimi with chives and poppy seeds .
For me it was Ama Ebi with avocado and tonburi and horseradish oil .
This dish was nice .
I like the fact that it was a light first course .
After eating the fat laden English muffin I was a little scared I would n’t be able to handle 11 heavy courses !
This was served with a glass of Cantine del Taburno Campania .
It was a nice start although not a very memorable dish .
Our next two though were both huge winners .
Mine was Spring Pea Soup with lobster , black trumpets and yuba .
Paired with a glass of Dewazakura Dewasansan Nama Genshu , Yamagata Prefecture .
Wow !
The soup was so rich and velvety and the lobster was like butter .
And seriously , this dish was beautiful .
The green of the soup and the pink of the lobster reminded me of spring .
But honestly , I liked Mr. T ’s even better .
He had Oyster on the half shell with pork belly and kimchi consommé .
I have never been a big fan of kimchi but the consommé was very light .
It made me want to give kimchi another chance .
The oysters were both huge and come on …have you ever had a crispy pork belly that you did n’t like ?
After these dishes I really did n’t think it could get any better , but then came the dish of the night .
A Soft Cooked Hen Egg with caviar , onions and potatoes .
Oh my …
Once again my taste buds were in a different world .
A world they only thought as big enough for the muffin but now this .
This dish had every flavor going on in perfect harmony .
The onions were cooked down so they were soft and sweet , the creamy yolk oozed out of the egg in a rich cream with the caviar and the fingerling potato chips brought a salty crispy finish to the dish .
This is about as perfect as it gets for me .
Possibly the best dish I have ever had in my life .
The wine that accompanied this dish was pretty amazing as well .
I had a sip and tasted a strong fresh flavor of grapefruit .
It was a Scholium Project Sauvignon Blanc .
I liked this wine so much I looked it up once we got home .
The winemaker leaves the wine undisturbed in the barrel and allows it to ferment itself rather than using sulphur .
This wine is actually one of the most natural wines possible !
No wonder it was so fabulous !
The chopsticks at the restaurant actually rested on the cork from this wine .
Is n’t that neat !
Both of us also received the same following dish .
Sea Scallop with Bacon , almonds and myoga .
The scallops were slightly sweet and meaty .
They were seared and served with Bacon from Benton Farms .
The bacon and scallops were awsome , This was very good , solid dish .
It was served with Allagash White , which happens to be one of my favorite beers .
Is n’t that nice !
At this point we were really happy and feeling a little ambitious .
We decided to order a beer we had never seen before in addition to the wine tasting .
The Belfast Bay Lobster Ale .
The beer poured a reddish - amber color that was bubbly and fruity .
I would n’t go out of my way to find this but thought it was good .
I ’d almost classify it as an extremely drinkable summer beer .
Okay , back to the food .
The next course blew Mr. T away .
We had been watching the chef in front of us take a huge chunk of Foie Gras all night and shave it over a dish .
Well here is that dish !
The Foie Gras Torchon with pine nuts , lychee and reisling .
Once again , there were so many different flavors going on between the sweet lychee , salty pine nuts and rich foie gras .
This dish was a little too rich for me .
I enjoy a little foie gras here and there but this was a lot .
Mr T thought it was fantastic though .
I really enjoyed the sake this was paired with though the Kamoizumi Komekome .
It was crisp and refreshing .
An excellent contrast to the rich foie .
One of our final big dishes of the night was the Beef Short Rib with daikon , pickeled mustard seed and carrots .
The short rib was deep fried which really charred the outside of the meat so that it was hard .
What this did was compact all that beefy flavor inside the center of the meat .
I ca n’t really explain it , but it was the most powerful meat flavor I have ever had in one bite .
This was served with a glass of Iporus , Crianza Rioja .
The smooth Rioja stood up well to the strong beef flavor .
Our savory courses ended in traditional style with a bowl of Miso soup with rice and pickled vegetables .
This was a good way to ease into the last part of our meal but nothing really stood out for me .
The rice was grilled with a little pork fat and rolled into a tube .
I was honestly so full at this point I kind of used this as a little breather course before the dessert .
As a pre-dessert treat we were given a pineapple sorbet with dried pineapple on the bottom .
This was a great palate refresher .
The sorbet was a little tart , making my mouth pucker a little .
I honestly think my mouth was expecting more pork fat and was reacting in shock of something so sweet !
Then our desserts came .
I was served a Cereal Milk Panna Cotta with avocado , chocolate and corn flakes .
This really did n’t do it for me .
It was kind of boring .
The Panna Cotta was n’t very sweet and the avocado with the dish confused me a little .
I took a couple bites and then left the rest .
I was much more into Mr T ’s dessert .
He got Fried Apple Pie with Sour Cream ice cream and Miso sauce .
This was fabulous !
Once again Chang somehow combines all of the elements to utter delight .
Sweet fried pie , cool sour cream and salty miso .
This was served with Boeri , Ribota Moscato .
What a great end to a truly fantastic meal .
Some Final thoughts on our dinner .
I really liked the way the pairings changed from wine to sake to beer .
I thought the pours were a little on the small side but I enjoyed the ones they selected .
The service was fantastic .
Everyone was incredibly friendly and worked well together in such a small space .
When we first arrived , at least three groups of tourists came in the door looking for the noodle bar .
Each time , the waiter greeted them warmly and then politely steered them in the correct direction down the street .
I marveled at his calm and professional manner , when clearly this had to be frustrating to deal with so often .
One truly great thing about our meal was that David Chang showed up about halfway through and stood in front of us for a while , inspecting each dish and chatting with the chefs .
It ’s so infrequent that you see the executive chefs anymore !
That was really neat .
And by the way he is HUGE !!!
His arms were like tree trunks .
The man works out !
But seriously you could tell by the way he was talking with each person that he has a true passion for his food .
So if you ca n’t get a reservation here at Ko at least try out the Noodle Bar or Ssam .
Both are phenomenal .
But I do urge to try…try for your meal here at Ko .
You may have to hit the refresh button a million times and see that damn “ page can not be displayed ” a bunch of times , but in the end it will pay off .
It is worth every single second .

Turbine Inc. of Westwood , a leading maker of Internet - based , multiplayer video games , has been named in a patent infringement lawsuit that targets several of the world ’s largest online gaming firms .
The complaint was filed by Paltalk Holdings Inc. of Jericho , N.Y. , in the US District Court in Marshall , Texas , one of the nation ’s most popular venues for patent lawsuits .
“ The eastern district of Texas is considered a plaintiff - friendly jurisdiction , ’’ said Christopher Donnelly , a partner at Donnelly Conroy & Gelhaar LLP in Boston .
Turbine produces adventure games like Dungeons & Dragons Online and Lord of the Rings Online , which are designed to be played over the Internet simultaneously by thousands of players , who pay monthly subscription fees of about $ 15 .
One of the toughest challenges in designing online multiplayer games is making sure every player sees identical digital playing fields at all times .
When a building explodes or a monster appears , it must happen at the same time on thousands of computers scattered around the world .
In 2002 , Paltalk purchased two patents from a company called HearMe , covering technologies for sharing data among many connected computers so that all users see the same digital environment .
Paltalk claims that the data - sharing technologies used in games made by Turbine and the other companies violate those patents .
Paltalk has already defended these patents successfully against industry titan Microsoft Corp .
In 2006 , the company sued Microsoft , claiming that the multiplayer features of its popular Halo video games violated Paltalk ’s patent rights .
The case went to trial in Marshall , Texas , in March , but in mid-trial Microsoft settled the matter by paying an undisclosed sum to license the Paltalk patents .
Donnelly said that Paltalk ’s victory over the world ’s biggest software company “ certainly gives them crowing rights . ’’
It also means that Microsoft has conceded the validity of Paltalk ’s patents , making it tougher for Turbine and the other defendants in the current lawsuit to challenge them .
Apart from Turbine , the lawsuit targets Japan ’s Sony Corp. , maker of the online game Everquest ; Activision Blizzard Inc. , whose World of Warcraft is the world ’s most popular subscription - based online game ; NCSoft Corp. of South Korea , maker of the game Guild Wars ; and the British firm Jagex Ltd. , which produces the free online game Runescape .
Turbine officials would not comment about the case .

Within three pages of The Lost Symbol – published yesterday with a show - off midnight release date , only otherwise given to JK Rowling – Dan Brown manages to satisfy both his fans and detractors .
The 80 million readers who bought Brown 's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code , in which the Catholic church tries to suppress the information that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had kids , will warm to a new story of equally glorious corniness .
The premise of The Lost Symbol is that world - altering " ancient mysteries " were hidden beneath Washington DC by the Freemasons among America 's founding fathers .
However , anyone believing that the worldwide worship of the The Da Vinci Code marked a collapse in cultural standards will be equally reassured that nothing has changed .
After only a few paragraphs , a basic grammatical howler inadvertently gives the impression that the White House is a replica of a pre-Christian temple .
A few chapters in , a plural adjective is paired with a single noun .
The best - selling novelist in modern history , it is clear , remains the worst - writing .
The success of The Da Vinci Code meant Brown could have published anything he wanted at this point but he has resisted any temptation to compose a delicate novella about a Kentucky farmhand having an epiphany at the state fair .
An author whose plots specialise in almost insoluble codes seems himself to rely on an all too obvious formula .
As in The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons , a secretive sect – here , the Freemasons – believes that mystics in an earlier time hid clues to a discovery that would shatter man 's perceptions – in this case , the ultimate key to creativity – within historic monuments : the new book uses the Capitol building and Washington Monument in much the way that the Vatican and Westminster Abbey served in the early works .
Once again , the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is obstructed in his quest to crack this puzzle by a shaven - headed weirdo with a talent for disguise and a tendency to think apocalyptic thoughts in long paragraphs of italics .
Two aspects of this book , though , are new and psychologically fascinating .
Langdon frequently , as he flies between engagements in a private jet , reflects on the terrors of celebrity .
Thrilled fans harass him in airports .
As the books Langdon writes are academic treatises , it seems unlikely that he would be much bothered by his readers in the street and so we can assume that Brown is writing here about the burden of being the world 's most - famous fiction writer .
The Lost Symbol is also notable for its tone of appeasement towards religious believers .
The Da Vinci Code upset many Christians , and Catholics in particular : the Vatican refused permission for the books with priestly villains to be filmed there .
Tom Hanks , though , should be free to film the inevitable movie of The Last Symbol in any Washington landmarks he wants .
This book reads like a love - letter to the majority values – political and religious – of Brown 's fellow citizens .
The solution to the teaser Langdon faces is finally to be found in one of the few books that has sold more copies than the Da Vinci Code and the climax proclaims , as loudly as Thanksgiving fireworks , both the power of America and a higher power beyond America .
Even so , a Brown sceptic has to be impressed by the skill with which the puzzle is constructed .
Played out within a space of 12 hours in 134 chapters of roughly three pages each , The Lost Symbol is a rollicking piece of tosh which turns on the double meanings of several terms , including " atonement " , " apocalypse " and " hoodwink " .
Yet , though the plot is solved through close attention to words , powerful and meaningful sentences continue to elude Dan Brown .
For fans , his greatest achievement is to have sold so many copies of The Da Vinci Code .
For the rest of us , his miracle is to have made Jeffrey Archer read like Dostoevsky in comparison .
In a time of chimpanzees I was a monkey .
Cambridge historian Peter Martland , who discovered details of the deal struck with the future dictator , told the Guardian : " Britain 's least reliable ally in the war at the time was Italy after revolutionary Russia 's pull out from the conflict .
Mussolini was paid £ 100 a week from the autumn of 1917 for at least a year to keep up the pro-war campaigning – equivalent to about £ 6,000 a week today . "
Corrections Minister Judith Collins says she released information showing the number of prisoners in New Zealand was at the highest level ever because the public had a right to know .
Ms Collins announced there were 8509 people in prisons or police stations nationwide yesterday - 16 higher than the previous peak of 8493 prisoners on September 7 .
The high number underlined the " urgent need " for more beds in the form of container cell blocks and double bunking , she said .
Labour law and order spokesman Clayton Cosgrove said the timing of the announcement , while the union of corrections officers was taking the Corrections Department to court over double bunking , was no coincidence .
" She 's ( Ms Collins ' ) known about this before the election , she forecast that if all her election promises were fulfilled that it would require a doubling of the prison population . "
Ms Collins said she released the information when it became available .
" It 's a public safety issue and the public need to know , " Ms Collins told Radio New Zealand .
Containers and double bunking will deal with 60 prisoners but will not solve the problem , she said .
Extra beds were needed for medium to high security prisoners .
Currently , there were enough cells but forecasts showed the Corrections Department would run out by February next year .
" This was predicted a couple of years ago when Phil Goff was the minister , unfortunately I found out when I came in to government that this had been predicted for some time and nothing had been done . "
The prisons that had been built in that time were too small , Ms Collins said .
It was unlikely low - risk prisoners would be released to make space , she said .
" We do n't have the right to just release people because we feel like it .
" It 's not something that we want to be doing . "

RoFo Enterprise , Corporation 's ingenious and distinctive RoFo BevDisHeadgear creations are guided by a man with an unorthodox story to tell .
Randall Flann , could have been one of University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee 's more colorful known Actor alumni ( 1984 - 1987 ) with a passion for public performance and the vision of a great storyteller .
Better yet , he could have been its notable flamboyant Artist / Painter ( 1983 - 1988 ) with similar visual messages and mastery of the brush like the immortal Spanish Artiste Salvador Dali .
Or based upon impeccable skill , he could have been a present day Sculptor / Designer , matched and described with the likes of Russia 's Peter Carlpainting Fabergé , whose works would be visible in a museum or embassy ; where , visitors from around the world could have shared in his vision of humanity and undiscribed beauty .
Yes , Mr. R. Flann , the creator and patent holder of the SUBSTANCE DISPENSING HEADGEAR , a.k.a. , the RoFo BevDisHeadgear , was destined to be different , creative , " out there " , unconventional and resourceful ...
In a word Unique .
At some point in 1984 , underclass Randy Flann , wrote a fact based screen play about the true life of comic genius , John Belushi , called “ TIMING ” .
The funny thing was ; Randy was a dead ringer both physically and emotionally to the popular comedian , who died of a drug overdose in 1982 .
Clandestine to portray him with virtuoso actress Sean Young portraying Judy Belushi in a planned 1990 - 1992 movie of the same title .
Do to its turbulent theme and content , the property ( screen play ) was not produced .

IS IT IMMUTABLE HUMAN NATURE to prize personal gain — a bigger car , a higher investment return — over the collective bottom line , over even the very survival of the species ?
Evolution is understood as the result of random mutations ; those individuals whose mutations are well suited to their environment survive and pass on their traits , while the genetically unfortunate die out .
But what of a species that does not respond to the environment , but instead radically alters it ?
Given time enough , polar bears might adapt to a melting Arctic , eschew white coats for brown , trade in seals for berries and ground squirrels .
But the change humanity has unleashed on the planet ’s climate defies biological ( or , for that matter , technological ) adaptation .
It is simply moving too fast .
So fast that while news of the polar bear ’s plight has finally broken through the media noise — too late , probably , for the bear — Americans are still profoundly deluded about the threat that global warming poses to all of us .
Scientists have identified 12 interlocking climate tipping points , any one of which , as Julia Whitty writes in our cover story ( page 44 ) , could “ initiate sudden , catastrophic changes across the planet . ”
If that makes you want to throw the magazine against the wall , do n’t .
Whitty ’s story is not an encyclopedia of doom but a search for the 13th tipping point — the human one .
As she notes , dolphins , cockroaches , and vampire bats have learned to work together to survive ; so can humans , and game theorists and sociologists have begun to identify how our instincts can be channeled so as to “ balance the inevitable conflicts between cooperation and competition in ways that benefit all . ”
Perhaps the greatest antagonist of our better instincts is the obsession on Wall Street and in Washington with pursuing short - term gain at the expense of long - term sustainability .
Against this backdrop , the push of a few visionary CEOs toward corporate social responsibility has been met with much fanfare .
Marketers have been quick to capitalize on the buzz , and these days the appearance of doing good is seen as an invaluable brand extension ( “ beyond petroleum ” ) , a liability shield ( “ drink responsibly ” ) , or an opportunity to wring profit from misfortune ( “ shop for the cure ” ) .
Cynicism is an easy but incomplete response ; the next step is to leverage the facade of do - goodery into the real thing .
This means wielding both the carrot and the stick .
Companies that really clean up their act , such as carpet maker Interface , which overhauled one of the world ’s dirtiest businesses ( page 56 ) , should be supported ; those that respond to domestic pressure by offshoring dirty habits , such as lead producer Doe Run ( page 58 ) , should be called to account .
In the end , corporations can adapt , but only if consumers and governments push them to — if , as Bill McKibben points out ( page 52 ) , cooperation reins in competition ’s ruthlessness .
With this issue , we begin exploring cooperation in another way : Mother Jones now is being led by a pair of editors , who also happen to be women , making our leadership doubly different .
In deviating from the Great Man model , we invited some hoary clichés :
One columnist warned of a “ power vacuum ” ; another salivated at the prospect of “ catfights . ”
Actually there ’s plenty of precedent for successful editorial partnerships ; take The New York Review of Books , where Barbara Epstein served as coeditor with Robert Silvers until her death this year .
There ’s not much precedent , however , for women running what industry marketers inelegantly call “ thought leader ” magazines ; at the dozen - odd such publications , ranging from the Atlantic and The New Yorker to The Nation and the Weekly Standard , only four women have ever served in the top spot .
Here , too , it ’s time to evolve .

2 Pallas is not quite a sphere
The Hubble telescope has provided new insight on 2 Pallas , one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System .
The nearly 600 km - wide rock is an example of an object that started out on the process of becoming a planet but never grew up into the real thing .
Researchers have published a 3D model of the grapefruit - shaped mini- world in Science magazine .
Hubble 's data makes it possible to discern surface features , including what appears to be a big impact crater .
The new information is expected to help scientists better understand how planets evolve in their earliest phases .
" Pallas is a unique piece of the puzzle of how our Solar System formed , " said Britney Schmidt , of the University of California , Los Angeles , who led the observations .
Layering process Pallas resides some 400 million km from the Sun , in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter .
It was the second object discovered in the main asteroid belt ( hence the name , 2 Pallas ) , in 1802 .
Only Ceres is wider ( 950 km diameter ) .
Another asteroid , Vesta , has a narrower girth but is more massive than Pallas .
ASTEROID 2 PALLAS
An artist 's view of a Pallas impact Found by Heinrich Olbers in 1802 Initially thought to be a true planet Now classed as a B - type asteroid May have a major impact crater
All three can be considered " protoplanets " , an assessment reinforced in the case of Pallas by the latest Hubble observations .
Theory holds that planets grow from aggregations of the dust and rock found circling new - born stars .
Collisions between clumps of material produce progressively bigger objects .
Eventually , a few will become large enough , and hot enough , to start to undergo differentiation - a process of layering in which the densest materials move to the centre of the object to form a core .
In the case of Pallas , this process appears to have initiated , but its slightly irregular shape suggests it never quite moved to completion .
" Whether you could form a core is something we can't really determine with these observations , but Pallas is big enough and round enough that it 's very possible that its interior started to separate out , " Ms Schmidt told BBC News .
" Ceres is perfectly round and so there 's a really good chance that that happened .
For Pallas , it may be just that this process got started but never finished . "
Wet history Dark features in the Hubble pictures indicate the presence of hydrated minerals on the surface of the asteroid .
If Pallas formed early in the asteroid belt , it would probably have incorporated large quantities of water - ice .
As the rock heated up , this water would have melted .
Not only would this have aided differentiation but it also would have altered the silicate rock to produce the type of mineralogical signal obvious today .
It was highly unlikely , though , that Pallas got hot enough to melt silicate rock , said the California researcher .
The presence even now of a lot of water - ice in the asteroid might help to explain its relatively low density ( 2,400 - 2,800 kg per cubic metre ) , she added .
The Science paper describing the Hubble observations includes a 3D representation of Pallas .
This was built up from a series of snapshots of the asteroid 's outline as it rotated in the view of the telescope .
It reveals an intriguing depression in the southern hemisphere which Schmidt 's team interprets as a possible impact crater .
It is large - about 240 km across .
It is also near dark terrain which could be material ejected or altered by a collision .
In 3D : Scientists suspect the presence of an impact crater ( ringed )
Pallas is known to share orbital characteristics with a group of rocks that could have been blown off the asteroid .
The largest of this " family " is called Ioffe and has a diameter of 22 km .
It is entirely possible Ioffe originated in the assumed crater .
Nasa has sent a spacecraft to the asteroid belt to visit Ceres and Vesta .
The Dawn probe will arrive first at the smaller of the two objects in 2011 .
Pallas , unfortunately , is not on the itinerary .
But Britney Schmidt believes interest in the asteroids and what they represent can only grow and is hopeful that her protoplanet could one day become a target for a space mission .
" We are really changing our perspective on these objects .
When you say asteroid people do n't tend to think of big , dynamic , evolved bodies ; but that 's probably what we have in the case of [ Ceres , Vesta and Pallas ] .
" I 'm trying to evolve people 's thinking , taking them from ' big rocks to little planets ' .
" It 's also timely , with public discussion about Pluto and what makes - or does n't make - a planet .
The public are so interested in that . "
Ceres and Vesta will be visited by the Dawn mission in the next few years

This week 's Bill Moyers ' Journal takes a look at former Texas congressman Dick Armey 's FreedomWorks , its role in formenting the Tea Party movement , and Armey 's role in opposing just about anything that threatens big business .
( He led the opposition against the Clinton health care plan . )
He points out that FreedomWorks is the results of a man who proudly says , " Politics is 97 % fiction and 3 % imagination . "
Is n't this interesting ?
Armey ( who 's had government health care all along ) is suing to keep his Cadillac federal employees health care plan instead of Medicare .
" Dick Armey is the epitome of those people with power and privilege who are insured against the vicissitudes of life and want no government assistance for any suffering except their own , " Moyers says .
" Government out of health care " for thee , but not for me !
Republicans are consistent that way .
“ Our education failure is the largest contributing factor to the decline of the American worker ’s global competitiveness , particularly at the middle and bottom ranges , ” argued Martin , a former global executive with PepsiCo and Kraft Europe and now an international investor .
“ This loss of competitiveness has weakened the American worker ’s production of wealth , precisely when technology brought global competition much closer to home .
So over a decade , American workers have maintained their standard of living by borrowing and overconsuming vis -à - vis their real income .
When the Great Recession wiped out all the credit and asset bubbles that made that overconsumption possible , it left too many American workers not only deeper in debt than ever , but out of a job and lacking the skills to compete globally . ”
Image Thomas L. Friedman Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
This problem will be reversed only when the decline in worker competitiveness reverses  when we create enough new jobs and educated workers that are worth , say , $ 40 - an - hour compared with the global alternatives .
If we do n’t , there ’s no telling how “ jobless ” this recovery will be .
A Washington lawyer friend recently told me about layoffs at his firm .
I asked him who was getting axed .
He said it was interesting : lawyers who were used to just showing up and having work handed to them were the first to go because with the bursting of the credit bubble , that flow of work just is n’t there .
But those who have the ability to imagine new services , new opportunities and new ways to recruit work were being retained .
They are the new untouchables .
That is the key to understanding our full education challenge today .
Those who are waiting for this recession to end so someone can again hand them work could have a long wait .
Those with the imagination to make themselves untouchables  to invent smarter ways to do old jobs , energy - saving ways to provide new services , new ways to attract old customers or new ways to combine existing technologies  will thrive .
Therefore , we not only need a higher percentage of our kids graduating from high school and college  more education  but we need more of them with the right education .
Bush - Cheney and Kerry - Edwards signs littered the lawns of North Miami Beach as Imam Foad Farahi walked from a mosque to his apartment a few blocks away .
It was November 1 , 2004 , the day before George W. Bush would win a second term in office .
But the Muslim holy man had been too busy fasting and praying to pay much attention to the presidential election .
For Farahi , an Iranian citizen who had lived in the United States for more than a decade , it was simply another month of Ramadan in South Florida .
Then , around 5 p.m. , as he neared his apartment , he saw two men standing outside .
They were waiting for him .
" We 're from the FBI , " one of the men said .
Info Foad Farahi
" OK , " he responded .

They wanted to know about José Padilla and Adnan El Shukrijumah , two South Florida men linked to the Al - Qaeda terrorist network .
Padilla , the so - called Dirty Bomber , was arrested in May 2002 and initially given enemy combatant status .
He eventually stood trial in Miami , was convicted on terrorism charges , and sentenced to 17 years in prison .
Shukrijumah is a Saudi Arabian and an alleged Al - Qaeda member whose last known address was in Miramar .
The FBI is offering up to $ 5 million for information leading directly to his capture .
" I know José Padilla , but I do n't know Adnan , " Farahi told the agents .
Of course , Farahi knew of Shukrijumah .
As imam of the Shamsuddin Islamic Center in North Miami Beach , Farahi was in a unique position to know about local Muslims , including Padilla and Shukrijumah .
Padilla had prayed at Farahi 's mosque and was once among his Arabic students .
Shukrijumah was the son of a local Islamic religious leader .
" I have had no contact with Padilla since 1998 , when he left the country , " Farahi told the government agents .
He had once met Shukrijumah but had no contact with him after that .
" I do n't know anything about his activities . "
" We want you to work with us , " Farahi remembers the agents telling him .
And this is when the imam's five - year battle with the federal government began .
" I have no problem working with you guys or helping you out , " Farahi said .
He could keep them informed about the local Muslim community or translate Arabic .
But the relationship , he insisted , would need to be public ; others would have to know he was helping the government .
But that was n't what the FBI had in mind , Farahi says .
The agents wanted him to become a secret informant who would investigate specific people .
And they knew Farahi was in a vulnerable position .
His student visa had expired , and he had asked the government for a renewal .
He had also applied for political asylum , hoping one of those legal tracks would offer a way for him to stay in the United States indefinitely .
" We 'll give you residency , " the agents promised .
" We 'll give you money to go to school . "
Farahi considered the offer for a moment and then shook his head .
" I can 't , " he told them .
The slender , bearded 34 - year - old Farahi frowns as he recalls all of this while sitting on a white folding chair in the Shamsuddin Islamic Center on a recent afternoon .
" People trust you as a religious figure , and you 're trying to kind of deceive them , " he says , remembering the choice he faced .
" That 's where the problem is . "
Farahi soon discovered the FBI 's offer was n't optional .
The federal government used strong - arm tactics — including trying to have him deported and falsely claiming it had information linking him to terrorism — in an effort to force him to become an informant , he says .
The imam has resisted the government at every step , having most recently taken his political asylum case to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta .
" As long as you 're not a citizen , there are lots of things [ the government ] can do , " says Ira Kurzban , Farahi 's attorney .
" They can allege you 're a terrorist and try to bring terrorist charges against you , or they can get you deported . "
Terrorism , he explains , can even be defined as giving " money to a hospital in the West Bank that turns out to be run by Hamas . "
Farahi asserts unequivocally he is innocent of any terrorism charges the government could bring against him .
In fact , he says , he would report anyone in the Muslim community supporting terrorism .
" From the Islamic perspective , it 's your duty to respect the law , and if there 's anything going on , any crime about to be committed , or any kind of harm to be caused to people or property , it should be reported to the police , " he says .
The FBI 's intense efforts to pressure Farahi into becoming an informant reveal the bureau 's desperation to infiltrate local Muslim communities .
The hard - line tactics have become so widespread in the United States that the San Francisco - based civil rights group Muslim Advocates distributes a video advising how to respond if FBI agents approach .
In fact , relations between the FBI and U.S. Islamic communities are so strained that a coalition of Muslim - American groups in March accused the government of using " McCarthy - era tactics " and threatened to sever communication with the FBI unless it " reassessed its use of agent provocateurs in Muslim communities . "
Despite this public conflict , few specific cases of Muslims being recruited as informants have become public .
Farahi's battle with the government is not only daring but also unusual .
In findings that add to the prospects of regenerating insulin - producing cells in people with type 1 diabetes , researchers in Europe have shown that insulin - producing beta cells can be derived from non-insulin - producing cells in the pancreas .
In results of a study published today in the journal Cell the researchers , led by Patrick Collombat of the Max - Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany and Ahmed Mansouri of the University of Göttingen in Germany , in collaboration with researchers at the JDRF Center for Beta Cell Therapy in Diabetes in Brussels , discovered in mice that new insulin - producing beta cells can be generated from alpha cells in the islets of the pancreas by modifying the expression of a specific gene ( Pax4 ) in alpha cells .
Alpha cells generate the hormone glucagon in response to low blood sugar to restore normal blood sugar levels .
They also discovered that the alpha cells that give rise to new beta cells in the pancreas .
The newly formed beta cells result in better glucose control and prolonged survival of younger mice with diabetes .
In type 1 diabetes , the immune system attacks beta cells , stopping a person 's pancreas from producing insulin , the hormone that enables people to get energy from glucose .
One pathway towards a cure for type 1 diabetes may be to restore insulin production through regeneration of insulin - producing beta cells within a person 's body , an alternative to transplanting functional beta cells from a donor .
" This study suggests that regenerating beta cells may be a viable pathway towards restoring beta cell function in type 1 diabetes , " said Richard Insel , M.D. , Executive Vice President of Research of JDRF .
" It reinforces the concept that there are progenitor cells in the mouse pancreas that can generate new beta cells under special circumstances .
And it points to some potential cellular targets for beta cell regenerative therapeutics - both the pancreatic progenitor cells and the alpha cells .
Further , the research identifies a critical protein and pathways that can be used to screen for small molecule drugs for developing beta cell regenerative therapeutics that target these cells . "
By forcing expression in the pancreatic alpha cells of the protein Pax4 - a so - called transcription factor capable of modifying expression of multiple genes to regulate patterns of development or other key cellular functions - the researchers drove the conversion of alpha cells into insulin - producing beta cells in mice .
The resulting reduction of alpha cells triggered the activation and differentiation of progenitor cells to replace the alpha cells that had switched to beta cells .
The findings are important in advancing the prospects for beta cell regeneration - related therapeutics for type 1 diabetes .
In addition to funding the research described in the Cell paper , JDRF has focused resources on other research involving the regeneration of beta cells and the reprogramming of other cells within the body to function as beta cells .
Dr. Patricia Kilian , JDRF 's Regeneration Therapeutic Director , noted that beta cell regeneration research represented one of the two largest areas for new research funding for JDRF in the just - ended fiscal year ( June 30 , 2009 ) .
" From minimal funding just a few years ago , beta cell regeneration and reprogramming have become one of the top new research areas for JDRF , " she said .
" The research is very exciting but early stage ; more work will need to be done to demonstrate the potential of these findings for human beta cell function and diabetes . "
To accelerate development of this important research area , JDRF is funding multiple research projects in reprogramming and regeneration at several institutions , including the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation ( GNF ) , and the Burnham Institute .
Those projects are screening for small molecules that promote beta cell regeneration , including compounds that can substitute for transcription factors involved in determining cell fate .
In addition , the foundation is supporting a wide range of projects , with leading scientific investigators at top academic institutions , targeting ways to replicate beta cells , regenerate them , or reprogram other cells to become beta cells .
Underscoring the importance of this rapidly evolving field , JDRF recently announced that it has entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation ( GNF ) to create a diabetes drug discovery and development platform .
The four - year program , among the largest and most comprehensive collaborations in the 40 year history of JDRF , would establish a basic and translational research program in type 1 diabetes .
Filling a gap in translating basic research to drug discovery and development , the partnership will look to build a diabetes product pipeline initially focused on beta cell regeneration , aimed at delivering a succession of novel drugs to the clinic for evaluation in type 1 diabetes .

Ah the NES !
It 's old but still great .
And with a few mods and tweaks , it can get even better .

Remote reset button
I own a nintendo game cartridge named 260 in one , which is full of fun games .
The only drawback is that once you select a game , you must reset the nes to return to the main menu .
My NES console is near the TV , so when I want to change the game I have to get up and go to the other end of the room ...
To fix this little problem , I have added a connector to my NES where I can connect a long wire to reset the NES remotely .
As you will see , it is very easy to do : 1 ) Open your NES and remove the metal sheet isolating the mother board .
Also remove the motherboard .
This is necessary to gain access to the small PCB where the Power and Reset buttons are located .
2 ) You also need ot remove the reset / power PCB from the case , since you need to solder on the solder side of the PCB .
3 ) Solder your wires on the reset button .
4 ) Install the connector on the case , and solder the wires coming from the reset button on it .
As you can see , it is very simple .
I used a 1 / 4 jack , as for headphones .
The cable is so simple that I will not include pictures of it on this page .
I did not install a button at the other end , I just touch the wires together .
The result :

Stereo sound output
The NES has been designed to output mono sound .
This was acceptable back then , but nowadays we expect / need stereo outputs .
If you wish to connect your NES to a stereo amplifier , you need an Y cable .
You will hear the same sound in both speakers .
It is possible to do better by modding the NES to add " real " stereo sound .
The NES CPU ( 2A03 ) has 2 sound outputs .
One carries the 2 square wave channels and the other one carries the triangle wave channel , the noise channel and the sample channel .
By tapping directly on the CPU pins ( that is , before the mixing is done ) , it is possible to direct the 2 sound outputs to different speakers , thus obtaining stereo sound .
The knob on the picture is not a volume adjustment , it controls the stereo separation .
The games were not designed for stereo , and it can be heard .
Keeping a small amount ( adjustable ) of mono sound gives better results .
Here is a page containing detailed instructions ( that 's where I got the idea ) :
http://www.zyx.com/chrisc/nesstereo.html
Since the original website does not work anymore , here is my schematic ( different from the original ) :
About the value for the potentiometer :
This mod has been described elsewhere , and the value used for the potentiometer is not always 10k .
Using a higher value potentiometer means a higher maximum resistance value .
In theory , this means less mono sound and greater separation when the potentiometers are in the " maximum resistance " position .
That said , using a very high potentiometer ( eg : 100k ) would probably result in being able to hear mono sound for only a small area of the potentiometer range ( eg : 1/8 of a turn ) , and increased adjustment sensitivity and difficulty .
The best approach is probably to experiment , starting with the potentiometers you have on hand , and decide what works best for your ears .
Here are a few pictures :
Connection on CPU Mono pick - up
On the left :
The sound is taken right from the CPU pins .
I used a shielded cable , to prevent picking up noise .
On the right : I tapped on one of the pins connecting the [ power supply , RF modulator and RCA Mono audio / video output module ] to get mono sound .
Better be carful to use the right pin since there 's the 12 Volts AC from the AC adapter on the same connector .

Disabling the lockout chip
( Based on the text ' Disabling the NES " Lockout Chip " ' , by Mark Knibbs )
When nintendo designed the NES , they equipped it with a lockout chip .
The main reasons why they did this was ( 1 ) to prevent unlicensed companies to distribute their own software and ( 2 ) make it harder to copy games .
( Just imagine yourself buying a game and reading in the manual that you must mod your NES in order to be able to play !... ) .
The chip also makes it impossible to play imported games .
How does the chip works ?
The lockout chip is used in both the console and the cartridge .
Depending on the logic level on pin # 4 , the chip will run in lock mode ( console ) , or key mode ( cartridge ) .
When the NES is on , the chips normally try to communicate together using 3 signals .
As long as the communication is not working correcly ( no chip in cartridge or bad chip in cartridge ) , the lockout chip inside the NES will generate resets at 1 second intervals .
Why disable it ?
To be able to build your own NES cartridge without needing to remove the lockout chip from another cartridge .
To be able to solder roms ( or sockets ) directly on the NES motherboard .
( no cartridge and no lockout chip )
To be able to use imported games without special adaptors .
To be able to use unlicensed games which may have incompatible lockout chip immitations or even no chip at all How to disable it ?

All you need to do is put both chips in key mode .
When both lockout chips are in key mode , nothing happens ( so no resets ) .
To do this , you must disconnect lockout chip pin 4 from the motherboard and connect it to a ground ( lockout chip pin 11,12,13,14 or 15 ) .
It will also work if pin 4 is not connected at all , so dont worry if you accidentally rip it off .
Even though it works without connection pin 4 to ground , I beleive it is better to do it anyway .
I was a little worried that some cartridges would stop working due to this mod ( cartridge with smarter lockout chip ? ) so I added a switch to control the voltage on pin # 4 .
I have not encountered such cartridges yet , but the switch is there , just in case .
Blue power led
You simply unsolder the old led , and solder your blue led .
In my case , I had a surface mount led so I soldered it on the old led 's leads .
I bought the led from
Nowadays , Blue leds are very trendy and are used everywhere .
I tried to resist the temptation , but could n't .
So that 's right , I 've replaced the boring red power led by a blue led , because " It 's cool " !
You simply unsolder the old led , and solder your blue led .
In my case , I had a surface mount led so I soldered it on the old led 's leads .
I bought the led from digikey .
They have shipping and handling fees so if you only need one led , find a local electronic component store and buy the led from them .
Replacing the power supply
It is bulky , which is not very convenient when you 're carrying your NES in a pack sack .
It covers almost 3 sockets when you plug it in a power bar .
Mine is old and has started to fail ( you need to pull the plug in the right direction to make it work ! )
It has an AC output , which is rarer .
It is hard to find a perfect replacement .
By looking at the NES schematics , I saw that the power coming from the power supply is converted to DC and lowered to 5 volts using a simple lm7805 voltage regulator .
This means that giving 12 volts to the NES will not damage it ( however , please note that the regulator will generate a little more heat ) .
Since the NES expects AC , you can supply the NES with DC power without having to check the polarity .
The original power supply is of the linear type , which means it uses a bulky transformer .
This power supply has a few disadvantages :

Since the NES expects AC , you can supply the NES with DC power without having to check the polarity .
Switching power supplies are usually smaller than linear power supplies , so I have used the switching power supply that came with my old cable modem .
It gives 12 volts up to 0.6 amps .
So far , it has worked flawlessly with the NES .
Cartridge cleaning
I will now show you how I clean my NES cartridges .
1 : First , I open the catridge .
To complicate things , Nintendo used unusual screws .
Here are a few ways to remove them :
Buy the right tool .
nintendorepairshop.com sells it .
Take one or two small flathead screedrivers and try to use the notchs in the screw 's head to unscrew it .
I remember reading somewhere that you can heat the screws with a soldering iron and pull them out when the plastic starts melting .
You use slightly bigger screws to close the cartridge .
Use the force ( not recommended )
Build your own tool .
My favorite technique is to build my own tool .
Someone named Naisho told be about this technique by email after reading this page .
You take a small plastic rod ( or similar object ) and heat the tip with a lighter .
Once it 's squishy , quickly apply it to the screw .
Let it cool down .
Once removed , it will have the perfect shape to remove this type of screws , as on these pictures :
2 : Once the cartridge is open , I inspect the connector .
This one here is moderately dirty : ( click for a close view )
3 : Cleaning
I scrub the contacts with an eraser until they are clean .
Sometimes , they dont get perfectly clean , but there is always a great improvement .
On the following picture , I have cleaned only the right half .
We can clearly see the difference : ( although the picture is not as good as I wanted it to be ... ) :
While I have the cartridge open on my desk , I check the battery ( if there is one ) :
Finally , I close the cartridge with ordinary screws so it will be easy to open in the future .
For reference :
The tool to open the NES Power Pad is a gamebit 4.5 mm screwdriver .
So you have a game that does not start anymore ?
The screen repeatedly blinks ?
This could be caused by a dirty NES cartridge connector or dirty cartridge contacts .
Since it 's easier to clean the cartridge , it is better to try this first .
If it does not work , you might need to restore the cartridge connector inside the NES .

Restoring the cartridge connector
Idea from the text MAKE YOUR NES RUN BETTER THAN NEW ! , by XBJ - 9000 Blinking screen and non-working games ?
If cleaning your cartridge does not do it , you probaly need to restore or replace the internal cartridge connector .
The cartridge connector inside the nes it very bad .
The problem is that the metal contacts are applied to the cartridge PCB vertically instead of horizontally ( which would move the dust and oxyde out of the way ) .
Fortunately , there is a way to fix this problem .
You need to tweak the connector such that the contacts are closer together .
There will be more friction when a cartridge is inserted and the fact that the contacts are more tightly pressed on the cartridge pcb will result in a more relable cartridge connector .
If you would prefer to replace the connector , you can buy one from the
Step 1 :
Disassemble your nes and remove the cartridge connector .
Step 2 :
Find a cloth pin and bend the tip .
Step 3 :
Using the pin , try to pull the contacts closer to the center .
Do this for the upper row ( the one near the square holes ) and the bottom row .
Step 4 : ( optional )
A small flathead screwdriver can help to bend the upper contacts a little more :
Step 5 :
The contacts should now be nearer to each other than they were before .
Left picture : before .
Right picture : after .
You dont need to do anything to the part of the connector which connects to the NES motherboard .
Reassemble your nes , and enjoy !
The games should work pretty well now .
They will even work without pushing the cartridge down !

Permanent game
A few recommendations :
Look at the cartridge PCB carefully and save time by not wiring unused contacts .
Triple - check the orientation .
Making a mistake is easy .
Please do n't use a rare or otherwise precious game cartridge .
If the cartridge connector of your NES is not usable anymore but the system otherwise works , you can hardwire a game by soldering wires between a cartridge and the NES motherboard .
Say goodbye to flashing power LED problems , non-starging game , glitching games , but also to the ability to change game .

NES2 composite out mod
I modified a NES2 console to capture the video signal directly at the PPU output pin .
To reduce interference , I cut the pin so that it would not contact the PCB , but cutting the corresponding PCB track would also work .
I also used coaxial cable for wiring .
To amplify the video signal before sending it to the TV monitor , I used my

Using SNES controllers on a NES
Anyone who has looked at how SNES and NES controllers work knows that those are simple shift registers .
A button state snapshot is first taken using the LATCH signal .
The bits corresponding to each button are then transmitted serially on the DATA line , at a pace controlled by the CLOCK signal .
As SNES controllers have more buttons than NES controllers , an SNES console has to send 12 to 16 clock pulse to read all buttons while a NES console only sends 8 pulses .
Since the first 8 SNES button states are transmitted in an order compatible with the NES , using an SNES controller on a NES is a simple wiring matter .
The additional SNES buttons simply wo n't be read and therefore wo n't be usable .
( Though in theory , one could write a NES game with SNES controller support ) Clock cycle SNES Button NES Button 1 B A 2 Y B 3 Select Select 4 Start Start 5 D - pad up D - pad up 6 D - pad down D - pad down 7 D - pad left D - pad left 8 D - pad right D - pad right
SNES controller to NES wiring
Notice how the SNES B/Y maps to NES buttons A/B .
It might seem wrong at first that the B and A buttons be swapped , but it is in fact exactly what 's needed given the physical button layout .
For instance , in the NES Super Mario , B=run , A=jump .
In Super Mario World on the SNES , Y=run , B=jump .
So when playing Super Mario on the NES using an SNES controllers , Y=run , B=jump .
It feels perfectly natural .
Here a picture of an adapter I built using an SNES and NES extension .
The wires were soldered and then insulated using heat - shrink tubing .
Warning : Do NOT rely on the wire colors shown in the above pictures .
The relationship between pin numbers and wire color varies according to the cable manufacturer , and sometimes even between batches .
You must find out the color code used by your cables using a continuity tester .
Blindly following the colors seen here may damage your NES or SNES controller .
Note :
This adapter works on the NES , but also on the AV Famicom which has the same type of connector for controllers .
If you are looking for a ready - made adapter , you can buy one from my online store .
It has been known for a long time that using SNES controllers on a NES was possible and easy to do using simple wiring .
So this is nothing new , but since I recently ( 2014 ) built such an adapter , I just thought I 'd document it here .

It might seem wrong at first that the B and A buttons be swapped , but it is in fact exactly what 's needed given the physical button layout .
For instance , in the NES Super Mario , B=run , A=jump .
In Super Mario World on the SNES , Y=run , B=jump .
So when playing Super Mario on the NES using an SNES controllers , Y=run , B=jump .
It feels perfectly natural .
Here a picture of an adapter I built using an SNES and NES extension .
The wires were soldered and then insulated using heat - shrink tubing .
Warning : The relationship between pin numbers and wire color varies according to the cable manufacturer , and sometimes even between batches .
You must find out the color code used by your cables using a continuity tester .
Blindly following the colors seen here may damage your NES or SNES controller .
Note :
This adapter works on the NES , but also on the AV Famicom which has the same type of connector for controllers .

Controller turbo-button mod
A turbo button running at 30 hz could be done like this :
Add a CD4013 D type flip flop .
Clock it using the latch signal from the NES .
Route the inverted output to the data input so on each clock edge the output toggles between high and low .
The non-inverted output of this flip flop would then go to each of your turbo buttons , which , when pushed , would pull the non -gnd side for the button being turbo 'ified to GND through a transistor .
The CD4013 chip contains two flip flops so you could chain them to slow down the turbo to 15 Hz if 30 Hz is too high .
I did a quick research to find an example circuit which could somehow clarify what I wrote above , and this comes close .
Of course , you would use the 5v supply available in the NES controller , and no relay .
http://www.zen22142.zen.co.uk/ronj/tg1s.html
Another approach would be to use the famous 555 IC .
A variable resistor could then control the rate of the Turbo .
The 555 output would be distributed to the turbo buttons as explained above .
Note :
If you mod a controller using the technique outlined above , please let me know and send me pictures to add here !
I have been asked how one could add turbo buttons to a regular controller .
I do n't have the time to do it , but here is what I suggest if using a micro- controller must be avoided .
( Sincerely , it would be quicker for me just to grab one of my multiuse pcb2 boards and write a special firmware ) .

Ree Drummond likes to call herself an accidental country girl and she considers herself something of an accidental cook .
But there ’s nothing accidental about the success she ’s built combining those two .
Drummond writes the Pioneer Woman blog and gets about 13 million page views a month , enough to spin off a cookbook : “ The Pioneer Woman Cooks : Recipes From an Accidental Country Girl . ”
Although not due out until Oct. 27 , it is currently at No. 1 on Amazon ’s preorder list in the Cooking , Food & Wine category .
Technorati ranks the Pioneer Woman “ The Pioneer Woman Cooks : Recipes From an Accidental Country Girl . ” on its list of the 100 most powerful and influential blogs in the world .
Each month , roughly 2 million women -- and her readers are mostly women -- flock to the blog to live vicariously as Drummond unspools her “ how in the world did I end up here ? ” story of a would - be city girl who now finds herself a wife and mother of four living on a ranch in the middle of nowheresville .
It is by turns hilarious , romantic , poignant -- and always illustrated by a gasp - inducing number of photographs that verge on the erotic as she chronicles her kitchen ’s goings - on .
( A recent cake recipe used 53 photos -- 53 ! )
The heart of Pioneer Woman is its food corner , the Pioneer Woman Cooks .
There are canning instructions , and one perennially popular entry is a step - by - step “ how to ” on cooking a steak .
And there are hundreds of recipes .
Recipes , though , are almost beside the point .

This is one food blog that is as much about the lookin’ as the cookin’ .
“ I hear from readers , I know a lot of them love to look at the pictures .
I ’m not sure what that says about the rest of it , ” Drummond jokes .
She never intended to live on a cattle ranch .
Though Drummond was raised in Oklahoma , she fled just as soon as she could , heading for Los Angeles and the University of Southern California .
“ There was just something about Los Angeles .
It was the biggest city I could think of to go .
I could n’t wait to get there , ” she says .

Her time in L.A .
And she did n’t waste a single moment .
Within her first week here , she ’d hit all the major theme parks and hiked up to the Hollywood sign .
Once in L.A. , she discovered sushi .
And Thai .
And authentic Mexican food .
And had a stint as a vegetarian .
She was a journalism major at first , and then switched to gerontology , of all things .
After leaving college in 1991 , she worked for a while in L.A. before moving back home to Oklahoma .
It was supposed to be just a pit stop on the way to Chicago , where she hoped to attend law school .
“ It never , ever occurred to me that I would wind up back in Oklahoma , ” she says .
“ I was officially a city girl .
In my wildest , wildest dreams my stay in Oklahoma would n’t be beyond three months . ”
You see where this story is going , right ?

She was having drinks with some old friends from high school during said pit stop when she locked eyes across a crowded room with an honest - to - goodness cowboy .
It actually took a few more weeks before the two had their first date .
But within just 10 days , Drummond knew :
It was goodbye , Chicago , and helllllooooooo , Marlboro Man .
( That ’s Drummond ’s blog name for the man who would become her husband . )
Now , Drummond lives on a fourth - generation cattle ranch -- one of the biggest in the state -- that is about 40 miles from the very spot where she grew up .
And it seems that everywhere she turns , she sees another hungry mouth to feed , including four kids , her husband , ranch hands , more than 4,000 head of cattle , 2,000 wild horses and a clutch of cows that wander up on the back porch , leaving cow patties behind .
And audiences just gobble it all up , as smitten by the photos and recipes as they are with a glimpse into a much simpler life , and a fairy - tale love story that is tempered by the less romantic parts of ranch living -- castrating calves and the bottomless pit of dirty laundry .
Advertisement
It ’s not at all unusual for her blog postings to get hundreds of comments .
If she sends forth a call for reader recipes , she gets thousands of entries .
And no one is as surprised as Drummond that people are reading .
After all , the blog started in May 2006 like so many other blogs do -- as a place to post family photos and updates for far - flung relatives .
She also began writing about her transition to country life , her recollections of L.A. and the challenges of home - schooling her four children , ages 5 to 12 .
“ I had no idea that anyone would read it -- anyone except for my mother . ”
Then one day , she had a comment .
“ Any blogger knows that feeling , ‘ A comment !
Wow ! ’ ”
Advertisement
It was n’t until nearly a year later that Drummond posted her first recipe , and that step - by - step guide to cooking a steak , and that ’s when she realized she ’d struck a chord with readers .
The comments began pouring in , many from people who appreciated her unique step - by - step photography .
( Drummond , 40 , takes all her photos herself and says that it can add quite a bit of time to even the simplest of recipes . )
--
Reader - friendly
“ I think a lot of people look at a recipe and think , ‘ How do you do that ? ’ because not everyone knows how .
I try to show them how , ” she said .
“ Somewhere along the way cooking became something that was fancy , and it just left behind all those people who are n’t comfortable in the kitchen . ”
Advertisement
In addition to accessible recipes , Drummond uses readily available pantry ingredients -- due to the fact that the nearest major grocery store is about a 90 - minute round - trip drive away and that includes a five - mile stretch of gravel road .
A few times a year -- woo - hoo ! --
Drummond drives the two hours to Tulsa to shop at a Sam ’s Club .
She posts several times a week , and her style -- easy - going , self - effacing and filled with observational details -- makes readers feel like they just stopped by for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie .
The blog itself seems to echo country living .
The photo presentation illustrates it best .
Most blogs rely on photo galleries that practically challenge readers to Click !
Click !
Click ! , and race by captions like they are an afterthought .
On the Pioneer Woman , a blog posting typically starts with a topic du jour and is followed up with photos and brief observations and interjections that serve as captions .
The effect invites readers to sit back , and lazily scroll through the photos , devouring and savoring each morsel as they go .
Advertisement
This success aside , Drummond always comes across like regular folk , relatable to the masses .
She recently posted about cleaning out her closet of clothes , and took loving photos of what was clearly designer label fare .
But there could be no begrudging the woman who wrote openly about no longer being able to fit into said clothing , and how cap sleeves are not exactly her friend anymore .
Drummond would not discuss revenue from her site , except to say that her family makes its living from ranching , not blogging .
Fans might be interested to know that many of Drummond ’s contest giveaways -- like those big shiny KitchenAid mixers and food processors -- are purchased out of her own pocket .
“ I give a big chunk of my revenue back in prizes .
I do n’t give it all back , for sure , but I would n’t have an audience if they were n’t reading my site , and this is my way of showing them how much I appreciate them . ”
Her cookbook , which includes new recipes and old favorites , as well as her trademark step - by - step photography , is a natural extension of the blog .
Just as Drummond never thought she ’d end up back in the country , she also never imagined that she would be writing a cookbook .
“ I think that ’s really the moral of all this .
You can go ahead and feel free to make all the plans you want in life , but who knows where you ’ll really be in 15 or 20 years .
I look around and I do n’t recognize anything about my life . ”

Chicken - fried steak
Advertisement
Total time : About 1 hour
Servings : 6
Note : Adapted from “ The Pioneer Woman Cooks ” by Ree Drummond .
3 pounds cube steak
Advertisement
2 eggs
3 cups milk , divided , more as needed
2 1/3 cups flour , divided , more as needed
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
Advertisement
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper , more if you can handle it
1 teaspoon black pepper , plus extra for seasoning the steaks and gravy
Salt
Advertisement
Canola or vegetable oil for frying
1. Begin with an assembly line of dishes for the meat , egg and milk mixture , and flour mixture .
2 . Pound the cube steaks until extremely tender ( if already pounded , pound a little more to make sure they ’re sufficiently tender ) , and cut the steaks into smaller pieces if they are larger than 5 to 6 inches in diameter ( this will make them easier to bread and fry ) .
Place the prepared steaks in the first dish .
3 . Beat the eggs and 1 cup milk in the second dish with a fork .
Advertisement
4 . In the third dish , combine 2 cups flour with the seasoned salt , paprika , cayenne and black pepper .
5 . Lightly season a piece of meat with a pinch each of salt and pepper .
Then , dip the meat into the milk and egg mixture on each side to coat .
Place the meat on the seasoned flour , turning to evenly coat both sides .
Dip the meat in the milk and egg mixture once more to coat , then the flour mixture once more to coat completely .
Place the prepared steak onto a rack on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining steaks .
6 . In a large cast - iron or heavy - bottom skillet , heat one - third cup oil over medium - high heat .
When the oil is sufficiently heated ( I drop a few sprinkles of flour , if it sizzles , it ’s ready ! ) , fry 2 to 3 pieces of meat at a time ( be careful not to crowd ) .
Cook on one side until the edges start to look golden brown , about 2 1 / 2 minutes , then flip over and fry until the other side is golden , another 2 to 3 minutes , adjusting the heat as needed .
7 . Remove the steaks to a paper - towel - lined plate and keep warm .
Repeat until all of the meat is fried , adding a little extra oil if needed .
Set the steaks aside in a warm place while you make the gravy .
Advertisement
8 . To make the gravy , pour the grease from the skillet into a heat - proof bowl .
Without cleaning the pan , return it to the stove over medium - low heat .
Add one - fourth cup of the grease back to the pan , discarding any remaining grease .
9 . Sprinkle one - third cup flour evenly over the grease .
Using a whisk , mix the flour with the grease , creating a golden brown paste , or “ roux . ”
You want the roux to attain a deep , rich color .
If the paste seems more oily than pasty , sprinkle in additional flour , a tablespoon at a time , until the right consistency is achieved .
10 .
When the roux is golden - brown , whisk in 2 cups milk , then wait for the gravy to come to a slow boil .
The gravy will thicken gradually , but if it seems too thick at first , add a little milk as needed , whisking to combine .
The total cooking process should take 4 to 5 minutes .
Add additional salt and pepper as desired , tasting to ensure that it ’s seasoned adequately .
Under - seasoned gravy is one of life ’s great sacrileges .
11 . Place the warm meat on a plate and drizzle over the gravy as desired .
Serve this to a hungry cowboy and you ’ve earned an admirer for life .

Cheese grits
Total time : 55 minutes
Advertisement
Servings : 12
Note : Adapted from “ The Pioneer Woman Cooks ” by Ree Drummond .
Though the recipe suggests using sharp cheddar , she mentions you can “ use whatever variety of cheese you like : cheddar , Pepper Jack , Mexican cotija .
Even goat cheese ( chevre ) is sublime in grits . ”
9 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt , more if desired
Advertisement
2 cups uncooked quick or regular grits
4 eggs
3/4 cup ( 1 1/2 sticks ) butter , cut into tablespoons
3 cups grated cheese , preferably sharp cheddar , more if desired
Advertisement
2 garlic cloves , finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper , more if desired
1 . Heat the oven to 350 degrees .
In a large saucepan , combine the water and salt over medium heat .
As soon as the water comes to a boil , stir in the grits .
2 . Cover the pan and finish cooking according to the directions on the package .
Remove from heat when the grits are cooked .
Advertisement
3 . In a large bowl , whisk the eggs .
Stir a couple of spoonfuls of the grits into the eggs and quickly whisk together to temper the eggs .
Immediately stir in the rest of the grits until fully incorporated .
4 . Add the butter and stir until it is melted and incorporated , then stir in the cheese until melted and combined .
Stir in the garlic and cayenne .
Taste and adjust the seasonings , adding more salt or cayenne if necessary .
You could also add more cheese if you think that will bring happiness to your life , but keep in mind that cheese increases the salt and fat content , as well as the number of calories .
5 . Pour the grits into a well - buttered 13 - inch - by - 9 - inch baking dish .
Bake until the grits are hot and bubbly , about 30 to 35 minutes .
Remove from heat and set aside for 10 minutes before serving .
The grits will become firmer as they cool .

1 . In a large bowl , sprinkle the salt over the garlic .
Mash the garlic and salt together with a fork or pestle to form a paste .
The finer the better , as the garlic is very strong in the finished dressing .
2 . Whisk in the mayonnaise , sour cream , milk , parsley , chives , dill , vinegar , Worcestershire sauce , cayenne pepper , paprika , pepper and hot sauce if using .
Taste and adjust the seasonings and flavorings as desired .
Make the ranch dressing all yours -- add in more of what you like .
This makes about 2 cups dressing .
3 . Chill the dressing for at least 2 hours before serving .
Thin with milk if desired .
4 . Wash and dry the lettuce and cut into wedges .
Arrange the wedges on a platter and drizzle the ranch dressing over the top .
Be generous with the dressing since it needs to reach all the lettuce in the wedge .
Serve immediately .

" La Familia " , mucho más que un cartel
Pie de foto ,
Se cree que La Familia surgió en la década del 80 como una organización de autoprotección .
Decapitan , torturan y extorsionan .
Después rezan y hacen obras de caridad .
El cartel de La Familia es , quizás , el ejemplo más extremo del paradójico enemigo al que se enfrenta México al tratar de derrotar la delincuencia organizada .
Es una lucha que sería mucho más fácil si los carteles fueran bandas de delincuentes al margen de la sociedad .
Pero ellos son , en muchas zonas , parte de la sociedad .
“ La Familia fue originalmente una estructura social .
Y lo sigue siendo , de muchas maneras ” , dice el ex fiscal general adjunto de México y experto en crimen organizado , Samuel González Ruiz .
Se cree que el grupo se originó en la década del 80 como una organización de autoprotección entre productores de marihuana y opio en el estado de Michoacán .
En los años 90 los productores , que establecieron una alianza con los vecinos del cartel del Golfo , llevaban adelante el rentable negocio del contrabando .
Como otros carteles mexicanos de drogas , se beneficiaron de la masiva y exitosa restricción al narcotráfico liderada por Estados Unidos a lo largo del Caribe .
Esa estrategia empujó el flujo de drogas hacia el oeste , a territorio mexicano .
Cuasi religiosos
Pie de foto , El presidente Calderón envió miles de soldados para reforzar la seguridad en el estado de Michoacán .
La Familia se dedicaba al control de los puntos clave de entrada de la cocaína en la costa del Pacífico mexicano .
Los líderes de la organización no desperdiciaron la oportunidad y se embarcaron en una mayor expansión y diversificación .
Invirtieron en la producción de la droga sintética metanfetamina , se hicieron cargo del negocio local de los DVD piratas y establecieron un brutal servicio de cobro de deudas .
Investigaciones realizadas por el equipo de González señalan que el 85 % del negocio legítimo en Michoacán actualmente tiene algún vínculo con La Familia , o con su dinero .
Se entiende que con los ingresos del grupo se han financiado escuelas , proyectos de desagües e incluso iglesias .
Una característica curiosa de la organización es que , según documentos de inteligencia , desaconseja seriamente a sus miembros consumir alcohol o drogas y tiene una ideología cuasi religiosa .
Se cree que el presunto líder espiritual del grupo , Nazario Moreno González , también conocido como “ El más loco ” , ha publicado y distribuido su propia Biblia , basada en los escritos contemporáneos del predicador estadounidense John Eldredge .
“ Está claro que es una herramienta de organización ” , afirma el antropólogo y analista Elio Mansferrer .
“ No importa si los líderes creen en eso o no ” .
Notas firmadas por la familia son dejadas a menudo sobre los cuerpos mutilados de sus rivales , indicando que son víctimas de la “ divina justicia ” .
Poder político
Pie de foto , La Familia se caracteriza por los métodos brutales que emplea para intimidar a sus enemigos .
En los últimos tres años se ha visto un crecimiento de los audaces intentos del cartel para intimidar a sus enemigos .
En 2006 , cinco cabezas fueron arrojadas dentro de un club nocturno en el poblado de Urupan .
La carta que acompañaba las cabezas decía : “ Morirán sólo aquellos que merezcan morir ” .
En 2008 , una granada fue lanzada hacia una multitudinaria celebración del Día de la Independencia en la capital del estado de Morelia y a comienzos de este año , en una aparente revancha por el arresto de uno de sus líderes , doce policías federales fueron capturados , torturados y asesinados .
A raíz de esos hechos , el presidente mexicano Felipe Calderón envió miles de soldados y policías a Michoacán , que es su estado natal .
El gobierno también dice tener evidencias de que La Familia ha estado utilizando su poder económico para comprar poder político .
En mayo , las autoridades federales arrestaron a 10 alcaldes y otros 20 funcionarios locales en Michoacán , alegando que habían vendido favores a La Familia .
Los últimos arrestos en EE.UU .
confirman lo que México ha advertido durante mucho tiempo a las autoridades estadounidenses : que las drogas que cruzan la frontera todos los días lleva también la delincuencia organizada .
Pero algunos creen que la particular debilidad dentro de México la ha hecho vulnerable a los carteles .
El desempleo generalizado , la corrupción dentro de las fuerzas de seguridad y la amplia brecha entre ricos y pobres configuran un terreno perfecto donde grupos como La Familia pueden florecer .

( CNN ) --
A pint - sized version of the Tyrannosaurus rex , with similarly powerful legs , razor - sharp teeth and tiny arms , roamed China some 125 million years ago , said scientists who remain startled by the discovery .
An adult Raptorex was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 150 pounds , scientists say .
The predator , nicknamed Raptorex , lived about 60 million years before the T. rex and was slightly larger than the human male , scientists said .
The findings , to be released Friday in the journal Science , are based on fossilized remains discovered in lake beds in northeastern China .
They show a dinosaur with many of the specialized physical features of Tyrannosaurus rex at a fraction of its size .
" The most interesting and important thing about this new fossil is that It is completely unexpected , " said Stephen Brusatte , co-author of the article , in a conference call with reporters .
" It 's becoming harder and harder to find fossils like this that totally throw us for a curve , " added Brusatte , a paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History .
Scientists who have studied the fossilized animal , which was 5 to 6 years old when it died , believe it was an ancestor of the fearsome T. Rex .
" Raptorex really is a pivotal moment in the history of the group where most of the biological meaningful features about Tyrannosaurs came into being , " said lead author Paul Sereno , a paleontologist at the University of Chicago .
" And the surprising fact is that they came into being in such a small animal , " he added .
Based on estimates of other similar - sized theropods , or " beast - footed " dinosaurs , Sereno and his colleagues estimate an adult Raptorex was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 143 pounds .
By contrast , the Tyrannosaurus rex , which topped the prehistoric food chain until dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago , was believed to weigh at least five tons .
Scientists hypothesize that Raptorex ran its prey down , using its enlarged skull , powerful jaws and sharp teeth to dispatch animals much larger than itself .
Like the T. rex , the Raptorex also had tiny forelimbs , they said .
" We can say that these features did not evolve as a consequence of large body size but rather evolved as an efficient set of predatory weapons in an animal that was 1/100th the size of Tyrannosaurus rex and that lived 60 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex , " Brusatte said .
After the remains were discovered , they were smuggled out of China and into the United States , where they were eventually purchased by a Massachusetts collector , Henry Kriegstein , who donated them to science .
Sereno was later asked to identify the fossil .
" I hope that this is a pathway that other important specimens that do find their way out of the ground in the dark of night do not get lost to science , " Sereno said .
The Raptorex fossil will eventually be returned to China , where it will be put on display near the excavation site , scientists said .

The whale usually eats squid , which is likely to be scarce in the area Conservationists are telling people not to approach a 9 m ( 30 ft ) whale after it was spotted off the Dorset coast .
The northern bottlenose , which has been named Gilbert after an RNLI lifeguard who spotted him , has been seen swimming near Bournemouth Pier and in Poole Bay .
Rescuers fear if the mammal feeds only on small fish in the area , rather than its usual diet of squid , it may become dehydrated , as it gets water from food .
Experts headed out on a boat to check on the whale 's welfare earlier .
Jenny O'Connor , rescuer for British Divers Marine Life Rescue ( BDMLR ) , said : " It is very unusual to see a whale around here . "
' Very nervous '
She added : " Gilbert should have actually have gone over Scotland and down the west coast .
It is very strange to see him in Poole Bay .
" We are concerned about his welfare and are monitoring to see if he is feeding as he gets his water from his food and we are worried he may get dehydrated .
" We do not want too many boats going near him because it will make him very nervous and stressed and this could cause him medical problems . "
RNLI lifeguard Nick " Gilbert " Smith spotted the whale during a patrol a couple of days ago .
He said : " We were just out on a jet ski when we saw it .
" We did n't know what it was to start and took a photo of it and later found out it was a bottlenose whale .
" I do n't know much about them , and have never seen one off Dorset , but it seemed to look fine .
" It was diving down , coming up for air and looking OK . "
Rescuers will try to encourage Gilbert into the English Channel then off down to the Atlantic to join the rest of his pod .

( CNN ) -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States , prosecutors said Tuesday .
Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb .
Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws .
Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose - fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said .
Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals .
Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes .
Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration .
Lawson and Ogren had neither .
" These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , " said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt .

What you 're doing to save the planet and its endangered species
Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent .
" This particular animal tested negative , " he said .
Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , " but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . "
Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States .
The journal also described the pair 's " acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , " McDevitt 's office said .
Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose - fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant .
" The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , " the statement from McDevitt 's office said .
Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife .
He will be sentenced in January .
Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 .
The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release .
The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release .
Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane , Washington , to Bangkok on November 4 - 5 , 2007 , with stops in Seattle , Washington , and Inchon , South Korea .
They returned on a direct flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles , California , on November 28 , 2007 .

2 . It looks very official , so we guarantee it .
I am primarily a Ruby developer , Javascript , did some Cocoa , MacRuby - I played with , anything , as all programmers do .
I think historically I 've become a Ruby developer because it 's awesome , so what 's not to love ?
Rails ; I run a consultancy called Mocra doing Rails and iPhone development and are based at Brisbane , Australia , which is a lovely place .
You should come and visit .
It 's really hot around Christmas , but what 's not to love ?
3 . In the Ruby community you are known for the myriad of tools .
What are some of your favorite tools that you created ?
My pet project is NewGem , which is the one I created after I made a couple of gems - the composite keys and the magic models and then I realized that they are bit of a pain in the bum to write .
Just getting started is ... , Jay Fields has written this simple ' How to start a Ruby Project ' script .
I turned that into another gem that pretty is his script except it's what I thought I wanted and then that became what I 've evolved and because I use it all the time .
Then , I extracted out - a couple of years later - the Rails generator code from Rails that Jerry Kemper wrote into its own gem so that Merb and Adhearsion and many others can use .
4 . That 's the rubigen Project .
I know , it 's tragically named .
It looks great when you write it out , but you can't say it without saying Ruby Gem .
If I 'd maintained it , I might have renamed it , but who cares ?
It uses that name so now it has a really nice sweet definition of what gets generated and has internal generators , so you can generate a Cucumber , C extension starting points , support Test : : Unit , RSpec and everything .
It makes looking after gems a lot easier .
Internally , it uses
Hoe for all the rake tasks , etc .
That 's my pet project and everything else flows from that , and then the TextMate bundles .
6 . Why do people use TextMate ?
We use TextMate because David told us to .
When he launched the 15 minute ' How to use Rails ' video , he said you use TextMate and then Rails works .
After a while , you figure out that there is a level of independence between using TextMate and running Rails , but initially you do n't know that .
Even when I first started Rails - obviously that 's a joke - I did it on Windows machines , so , I used RadRails , back in the da .
But like for every Windows person and aspiring TextMate owner , TextMate is really expensive , because it 's like 3,000 $ or something .
You get a free Mac with your TextMate editor , but it 's relatively expensive to get started with TextMate , if you are not owning a Mac .
That was the first piece of software that I purchased when I bought a new Mac .
I know more that you can do with TextMate now that I actually own it .
But even before that I wanted to use it , so it 's something special about it .
It lets you configure nearly any aspect , invoke commands , invoke snippets .
Because in the background it 's either just static text snippet or a command and the command can be written in any script .
So we just write the commands in Ruby and therefore we can write tests for them and it's production code that we can share and have a good time .
A new editor is coming out - theoretically , one of the new editors might be TextMate 2 .
In the meantime , there are other editors , but they have so much to catch up to in order to get to what we expect from TextMate , I feel bad for them .
I do n't know how you communicate to you if you are not using TextMate .
It 's more like Twitter .
Who knows what Twitter is for ?
7 . It 's more like VI users - they also can't tell the users why they use VI .
VI and emacs - they are the same .
You can extend them .
I did try to use emacs on Windows - this was in 2006 - 2007 - but the 21.4 build , I think , no one has done a compilation of that for Windows and that had all the cool icon changes .
I remember this now , for 2 days I tried to move away from RadRails onto something that was more powerful and at that time that would have been emacs .
I could n't get it to work the way I wanted to and then I was a sad boy .
Then , as a tribute to that , I ported as many TextMate bundles , the Rails and HTML bundles and CSS and those 2 bundles I ported to RadRails , as much I could .
That was my little tribute to Rails , I got those .
8 . What do those bundles actually do ?
Can they run ' generate ' , or do they insert snippets ?
There are a couple of aspects - generators are one , it 's like in - line generators .
It might be a method snippet .
Instead of having to type - it's kind of a simple one - you can type def , press Tab and it will give you the starting point for the method .
def will give you the def self .
and type a method name in , and that 's just the starting point !
There are snippets for starting points , but then you can activate entire chunks of code that it could figure out the filename .
We now have to create a class .
You type cla , you press Tab , it figures out the name of the file and gives the default class name based on the name of the file .
So , you have the ability to really do anything .
In application structures like Rails , where it 's fixed , you got apps , folders , models , views , controllers , there is going to be test or spec , the upside of that static structure .
It means that the tool can then know about that .
So we have ways to go from a model to its unit test , from a controller to its unit test and from anywhere to anywhere , really , because we have that knowledge .
I do n't know what it does anymore , I just use it .
My fingers and the F key are binding so there is some snippets are activated , but later I am going to be press Tab and others are going to be key bindings and I lose track .
My fingers know stuff .
They know more than I do .
Top tip !
A lot of people still do n't know .
If you want to learn about TextMate , press command , control T , because it might be that way on the video .
Or going to the bundles menu as a top item and then you can start to figure out all the different things you 've got based on wherever your cursor is .
TextMate top tips for you , InfoQ !
9 . The TextMate bundles are just one of your many projects .
How does the average Australian handle tons of projects ?
Or how do you handle them ?
You do n't .
You can't .
It 's just mathematically not possible .
The talk we gave here was that I did some back , like of an envelope - I do n't know if we actually have any envelops nor pens with which to write on the back of an envelope - , but metaphorically I wrote on the back of an envelope that I think I figured out I do n't know how many real projects I have .
It might be somewhere between 50 and 100 and that 's three years .
Let 's just say 75 , because it divides nicely by 3 .
That 's 25 a year , and I plan , I try to live a life style whereby I can keep doing this for another 37 years .
I do n't know where it came from !
One day I just said someone " I 'm going to do this for another 40 years " .
I kept saying " 40 years " for several years , then I realized that otherwise I was never going to get to stop , so now I do subtract some time - so 37 to go .
That 's 40 years x 25 , that 's 1,000 projects that you potentially have and obviously that might just be Ruby , Javascript and Objective - C , that would be God knows what languages by the end .
You got to acknowledge that you are not going to support all of them , so I just progressively and proactively do n't support them very quickly .
Just because I wrote them , it does n't mean that I have to look after them .
I thought I 'd use them , then I 'm not touching them .
GitHub is a tremendous community tools for people being able to discover and take over maintainership , if they want .
I make too many projects and I have to not maintain them .
10 .
You try to stay sane by simply dropping projects or do you tell people to go away if they ask you for enhancements ?
What do you do ?
Do you separate projects into important projects or ones that could die ?
I 'm not a machine .
So ... ChocTop - I do n't know if you 've talked about ChocTop - but it's a tool for packaging and bundling Cocoa apps into those pretty DMGs , so all you need to provide the background picture , some icons and the positions and it does everything .
Wonderful tool !
I originally wrote it because of a project we were going to relate to called CommitChap
We never released CommitChap Technically , I do n't need a packaging and deployment tool , if I 've never packaged and deployed anything .
Therefore it does become hard to maintain because I do n't use it .
Nonetheless , there have been occasions when people have written to me and said " It does n't do this .
Can it ? " and I said " Here is the code , go for gold ! "
And there have been other times , when for no reason - I do n't know , perhaps the name look good - I just felt like adding their feature .
I 'm still human and I still maintained stuff mostly because at that point in time it seemed fun , but I do n't have a " to do " list .
The worst place anything can get is on my " to do " list .
I do n't know where the " to do " list is , I never look at it .
So , it either gets done straight away or it never gets done .
That 's why I end up with so many projects - because I have that perspective .
If I have an idea of what needs to be written - " Would n't it be new and shiny if we had this ? " - I typically do it right away , because it's no point in having that thought .
I would not come back to that thought , so it 's a linked process .
11 . Which projects do you actively maintain ?
Which are the top 5 projects that you still keep alive ?
There is no list .
I said that NewGem is my pet project - that 's probably it .
In terms of what I would say if I ever got to hang my hand on something to say I 'm proud of this .
There are probably others as well that I 'm proud of .
ChocTop
I 'm proud of , nobody uses it , I 'm very proud of it though .
If anyone ever finds it and uses it , the things that it saves you if you ever tried to figure out that custom DMG stuff , I 'm very happy that it exists now .
Everything else is not pet project , so therefore the only stuff I maintain is the stuff I come across on a daily basis .
I wo n't maintain any TextMate bundles until I decide " I need this " in which case I 'll add it and while I 'm adding it , I 'll then double check .
Now I 'm touching a project , so this is my implicit process .
When I 'm touching a project that 's using it inside the code base , I 'll go after GitHub and because there is a GitHub gem that can go gh home or gh network web .
I think the last one show up the commits that everyone 's had .
While I 'm actually in that code , that 's a good time .
There is no cost , there is no transition cost to go and doing maintenance .
I 'm there !
Now I 'll go and have a look to see what else needs to be done , see if there is anything interesting and then you can come back to the command line and go 'gh pull name -- merge ' and I 'll get their stuff .
That 's pretty much my low cost maintenance process .
That 's TextMate bundles , that 's libraries , that 's anything .
Every now and again , for laughs and giggles , I will maintain something .
I 'll say " Well , today I 'll go back to NewGem or rubigen or whatever " and I 'll give it a bit of love , but very rare because I have kids and they are actually shiny interesting now and it 's fun to play with them .
They can talk , they acknowledge that I 'm interesting , it 's nice to have a fan base at home .
My wife still does n't understand a thing I do , but that 's fine .
No , I do n't maintain anything officially , just as I touch it , it gets some love .
That 's my process - I make sure that if I touch , I do some love .
12 . With that experience , what tip would you give to new aspiring open source commiters ?
If someone wants to create an open source project , what first steps should they do ?
There is a lot to learn .
Obviously , every different thing is different .
Ruby Gem VS Javascript library VS Cocoa app , everything is very different .
I know which one you want to talk about .
Use NewGem or one of the other types of gem starting points and do what it tells you .
Like Rails , it 's a convention over configuration , so you do n't care .
You honestly do n't care whether it 's called lib , source , public , or whatever .
That 's where you put your code and it's probably a reason for it and until you have a good reason to change it , what do you care ?
Just do what they do and then you get the benefit of all the rake tasks to do packaging , bundling .
But look inside other libraries , other gems and feel free to ask questions .
It 's part of my zero maintenance .
That does n't mean I 'm zero help .
I answer questions all the time for anyone that cares .
I do n't call that maintenance , I call that community building and the more people are at it , knowing how to write gems , more people running actually writing unit tests for Java script , which I find a challenging concept because no one writes Java script unit tests .
I say no one , but there is perhaps a point percentage of people who have ever written Javascript and write unit tests for it , and even smaller than a part of point do TDD on Javascript .
That is production Javascript has to be written with tests , which I find challenging to comprehend .
I help anyone , because the more people I help , the more people can then help and it goes on that way .
Since no one reads blog posts any more , you got to go back to teaching people person by person .
13 . NewGem is based on Hoe and add some other features .
Could you go into that ?
NewGem pre-dated my knowledge of Hoe 's existence and I assume
Hoe did exist at the time , but that 's ok .
The primary purpose of Hoe is to create a scaffold , like Rails .
It 's the Rails command equivalent to creating a scaffold for gems .
Rails itself comes with all its rake tasks .
Most people would n't even know where to look for in the source of Rails .
It used to do that too when it came with some tasks , then I discovered Hoe , shortly after it .
" Somebody else has done work and it 's pretty good .
Fine , I 'm using this stuff " .
So , now what it does , it generates the Hoe DSL for specifying the spec , which is 3 lines long , versus - if you want to do the raw gemspec it 's like - 5,000 lines long , so it 's ridiculous .
It automatically , intuitively figures stuff out so you look inside your Read Me file for the description , it will look inside a file called History .
txt for the most recent history .
Then , there is a task , when it packages up the gem , there 's a task called ' rake release version ' .
It 's ' rake release version = 1.2.3 '
It pulls all this information implicitly from places , packages it up your gemspec and puts it on RubyForge , which is the only place to put your Gems .
Then you can do ' rake post news ' and it will do a similar thing pulling in the description from the Read me , the most recent history information from the history file and then push that to the RubyForge news our RSS feed , which is a really good feed to subscribe to .
A whole bunch of other tasks like ' rake multi ' for MultiRuby tests that runs all the tests against all the versions of Ruby that you have installed and it's being maintained by very intelligent people over in Seattle - Ryan David and Eric Hodel and all the guys that work with them .
In my perspective that 's a great cheat , using Hoe .
If you do n't use NewGem , do use Hoe !
Once you are inside the generated Gem , once you are working , then it 's like Rails has a script / generate command and now you can generate things that are helpful like installing Cucumber .
If you want to do a C extension there is extconf and it generates the starting point for the C library and the test harness , so you can do test driven C extensions and lots of little things like that , lots of little generators .
It has generators for creating generators .
If you are creating a framework like Merb or Adhearsion or Rails , you create a new project - whatever your project name is - let 's say Adhearsion .
You go ' newgem adhearsion ' and then you go into that adhesion directory and then you run the application generator .
You go to script generator / application generator / adhearsion .
That generates a command line app called Adhearsion or whatever you want to call it that will run a generator , like the Rails command .
Then you can specify all the things , all the files and all the folders that you want everyone to get by default .
So , it 's a simple way for your framework to come to life .
Then you can write generators for within that project .
All the things that will turn up under script / generate .
You create those with a component generator generator .
If you wanted to have a model generator , you create an Adhearsion project and inside there , and you want a model generator , then , back over in your code you 'll run " script / generate component generator model " and then it will give you the stub for that and it's all test driven .
I do n't know if it makes any sense .
If you want it , just ask me .
Actually I did talk about this - RubyConf 2007 has a big long video where there was more tutorial and less entertainment than I would normally like and that has a very cool A - Team theme .
If you just watch the RubyConf 2007 talk just to watch the A - Team intro , it 's pretty cool .
That 's on www.confreaks.com, so just go to confreaks website and say I can delegate the rest of this conversation on how it works to that video .
14 . We 'll outsource that to confreaks.com .
You say everybody should put their Gems on the RubyForge , why can't I put my Gem on GitHub ?
Understand the irony of what I 'm going to say .
I going to tell you in a second , I 'll repeat it that there is no need for your name to be prefixed to your Gem .
Why ?
You are just not that special .
The irony is , one of my first projects was called The Magic Models , it was actually called Dr Nic 's Magic Models .
I do n't know what sort of person feels the need to put their name at the front , I did it because it was funny , back in 2006 .
That was one of my first projects , so that introduced me and that sort of thing .
That was the irony - having previously actually explicitly put my name in the front , I 'm now here to say that there is no need for that .
Other than the simplicity aspect that we can talk about later , the only reason that you want to use the GitHub for releasing gems might be for patch level gems .
Cucumber uses it for 0.3.11.6 .
On RubyForge , the most recent one is 0.3.11 , on GitHub it 's 0.3.11.6 that gives someone access to that level of download .
The other reason might be if you were a forker and you want people to be able to access yours .
The rest should go on RubyForge .
Aslak , I love you , dude , I can not spell your name !
He pushes his gems to RubyForge .
There is an example of the problem .
I know the thing 's called Cucumber , what if gem install cucumber does n't work ?
What have I got to do ?
I got to go to GitHub search and look for all these 7 different people sharing the gem .
With things like
Hoe it 's just not that hard to push stuff to RubyForge .
There is no need .
But I 'm wrong !
I can say this , I can have my conservative stance on this issue .
GetHub announced they are serving more gems than RubyForge , so I guess RubyForge is losing rapidly , but I think that 's just because GitHub makes it so easy .
RubyForge is probably never going to compete with that , because it 's maintained by one guy and that 's hard .
15 . Finally , a question that every interviewee gets .
What about 1.9 ?
I love 1.9 .
My production level contact with 1.9 is actually through MacRuby .
I 've never written code that is 1.9 only , I still live and breathe 1.8.6 because that 's what I get in OSX , though in Snow Leopard 1.8.7 is bundled , so we have already started the coming in contact with some stuff .
One of my developers has got Snow Leopard installed , he added some code that did n't work on my machine because it was a variation that did n't work backward compatibly .
No one at Mocra has 1.9 installed as their primary Ruby .
Hampton Catlin just pinged me and said " Can you help me fix this one bug " I 'll have a better look at that .
I still follow the zero maintenance thing ; I can't fix things until I care about them .
I probably at some stage I need to move out of the 1.9 just so I start to care .
I probably need things start breaking on me and that 's probably anyway what 's going to happen .
A lot of the new stuff looks really good .
I 've seen it through MacRuby the new syntax for methods , wit the Javascript like Hash syntax and I love it .
Who does n't want the speed ?
I do need to take some responsibility and actually move to ahead of the curve and I might get round to that one day .
It 's looking good .
The community is moving forward and there are more and more articles lately about how to move to 1.9 .
1.9 is the precursor to 2 .
We can't get a 2 until everyone 's on 1.9 .
Look he 's hoping that we will move in by the end of the year and we can get a Christmas present at Christmas time and that 's when the Ruby release is coming out .
Who does n't want Ruby 2.0 ?
Never Gonna Give
You Up was selected as the new anthem for the New York Mets baseball team , and Astley was named best act ever at last year 's MTV Europe Music Awards after fans of the crooner hijacked online votes .
New carbon dioxide data confirm that formation of the Antarctic ice - cap some 33.5 million years ago was due to declining carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
New carbon dioxide data confirm that formation of the Antarctic ice - cap some 33.5 million years ago was due to declining carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
A team of scientists from Bristol , Cardiff and Texas A&M universities braved the lions and hyenas of a small East African village to extract microfossils from rocks which have revealed the level of CO 2 in the Earth ’s atmosphere at the time of the formation of the ice - cap .
Geologists have long speculated that the formation of the Antarctic ice - cap was caused by a gradually diminishing natural greenhouse effect .
The study ’s findings , published in Nature online , confirm that atmospheric CO 2 started to decline about 34 million years ago , during the period known to geologists as the Eocene - Oligocene climate transition , and that the ice sheet began to form about 33.5 million years ago when CO 2 in the atmosphere reached a tipping point of around 760 parts per million ( by volume ) .
The new findings will add to the debate around rising CO 2 levels in the Earth ’s atmosphere as the world ’s attention turns to the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen which opens later this year .
Dr Gavin Foster from the University of Bristol and a co-author on the paper said : “ By using a rather unique set of samples from Tanzania and a new analytical technique that I developed , we have , for the first time , been able to reconstruct the concentration of CO 2 across the Eocene - Oligocene boundary – the time period about 33.5 million years ago when ice sheets first started to grow on Eastern Antarctica . “
Professor Paul Pearson from Cardiff University ’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences , who led the mission to the remote East Africa village of Stakishari said : “ About 34 million years ago the Earth experienced a mysterious cooling trend .
Glaciers and small ice sheets developed in Antarctica , sea levels fell and temperate forests began to displace tropical - type vegetation in many areas .
“ The period culminated in the rapid development of a continental - scale ice sheet on Antarctica , which has been there ever since .
We therefore set out to establish whether there was a substantial decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels as the Antarctic ice sheet began to grow . ”
Co-author Dr Bridget Wade from Texas A&M University Department of Geology and Geophysics added : “ This was the biggest climate switch since the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
“ Our study is the first to provide a direct link between the establishment of an ice sheet on Antarctica and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and therefore confirms the relationship between carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and global climate . ”
The team mapped large expanses of bush and wilderness and pieced together the underlying local rock formations using occasional outcrops of rocks and stream beds .
Eventually they discovered sediments of the right age near a traditional African village called Stakishari .
By assembling a drilling rig and extracting hundreds of meters of samples from under the ground they were able to obtain exactly the piece of Earth 's history they had been searching for .
The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right
by David Neiwert
( PoliPoint Press , 2009 )
On Thursday , September 17 , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was moving through a typical press briefing when she was asked about the escalation of violent rhetoric in public discourse .
The California Democrat suddenly became uncharacteristically emotional , requesting that people tone it down , and recalling the 1978 assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk as an outgrowth of the hate - filled discourse of its time .
Warning that people might have to “ take responsibility for any incitement that [ the person ’s words ] may cause , ” Pelosi could scarcely have come up with a better example to illustrate a major theme of David Neiwert ’s latest book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right .
There has been much discussion of the culture of incivility lately , epitomized by the recent indecorous outbursts of Rep.
Joe “ You Lie ” Wilson ( R - SC ) during President Obama ’s speech to a joint session of Congress , tennis star Serena Williams toward a linesman at the US Open , and rapper Kayne West at the Video Music Awards .
But the rhetoric and the underlying attitudes that Neiwert is getting at are far more serious — and harder to come to grips with — than mere boorish behavior by public figures .
“ What motivates this kind of talk and behavior , ” Neiwert writes of the sometimes surprising viciousness from otherwise ordinary people , “ is called eliminationism : a politics and a culture that shuns dialogue and the democratic exchange of ideas in favor of the pursuit of outright elimination of the opposing side , either through suppression , exile and ejection , or extermination . ”
Neiwert is a veteran journalist who has covered some of the farthest reaches of the American Right in the Pacific Northwest , including the Aryan Nations and the Montana Freemen .
He was raised in Idaho , where the fervent factions of the far right ( most notably the John Birch Society ) were fashionable and intersected the lives of friends , family , and neighbors .
The ideas in this book were developed in an influential series of essays at his blog Orcinus ( Neiwert is also managing editor of Crooks & Liars where these issues are often discussed as well ) .
Neiwert stresses that eliminationist rhetoric “ always depicts its opposition as beyond the pale , the embodiment of evil itself , unfit for participation in their vision of society , and thus worthy of elimination .
It often further depicts its designated Enemy as vermin ( especially rats and cockroaches ) or diseases , and disease - like cancers on the body politic .
A close corollary — but not as nakedly eliminationist — is the claim that opponents are traitors or criminals and that they pose a threat to our national security . ”
“ The history of eliminationism in America and elsewhere , ” he writes , “ shows that rhetoric plays a significant role in the travesties that follow .
It creates permission for people to act out in ways they might not otherwise .
It allows them to abrogate their own humanity by denying the humanity of people deemed undesirable or a cultural contaminant . ”
Much of the book is devoted to outlining eliminationism in American history , from Native Americans and African Americans , through Chinese and Japanese immigrants and more .
He shows how eliminationist rhetoric was often followed by “ an actual campaign of violent eliminationism . ”
This history is presented with a note of urgency , because the eliminationist rhetoric as currently featured by elements of the conservative movement , “ is in many ways , ” he stresses , “ the signature feature of fascism . ”
An authentic , broad - based fascist movement is not here yet , he avers , though he warns that eliminationist rhetoric is not unlike “ the distinct odor of burning flesh .
And when it hits our nostrils , we dare not ignore the warning . ”
Neiwert guides us through some of the current thinking about the definition of fascism , and offers some useful ways to recognize it in a contemporary American context , showing how these elements are increasingly featured by the conservative movement on the airwaves and on the ground .
The Christian Patriot movement , which was largely synonymous with the militia movement of the 1990s , had three signature characteristics , according to scholar James Alfred Aho , as cited by Neiwert :
First , there ’s dualism , or the division of reality into a “ godly ” spiritual realm , in which lies the “ perfect , ” and a corrupt material world , which is “ profanity , unconsciousness and death . ”
Second , there ’s “ conspiratorialism ” or “ the psychologizing of historical events to the conscious intentions and omniscient and all - powerful Benefactors and Malefactors . ”
This mix reduces the causes of perceived social decline into a quest for scapegoats in need of elimination .
And third , there ’s the apocalyptic belief in the imminent end of the world as we know it .
Drawing on scholars of fascism Robert O. Paxton and Roger Griffin , he outlines the features of fascist movements and the environments in which they rise .
While elements of fascism are evident , he does not yet see the presence of a significant movement in the United States .
Notably absent is a “ crisis of democracy ” such that an ill - defined hypernationalism could rise in service of a national “ renewal . ”
Although Neiwert emphasizes that fascism emerges from the far right in the wake of the failure of democratic institutions — part of what makes it at once so hard to define , yet so explosive , is its lack of a “ core ideology . ”
Rather , it rallies around emotionalism .
Quoting Paxton , he writes that if fascism happens here , it will be distinctly American and devoid of the trappings of 20th - century European fascism :
Americans might support an enterprise of forcible national regeneration , unification and purification .
Its targets would be the First Amendment , separation of Church and State ( crèches on the lawns , prayers in the schools ) , efforts to place controls on gun ownership , desecrations of the flag , unassimilated minorities , artistic license , dissident and unusual behavior of all sorts that could be labeled antinational or decadent .
That said , Neiwert slams those who misuse the term for “ cheap political theater , ” writing that “ inappropriate comparisons tend to obscure the reality of what ’s taking place . ”
So what is the reality ?
Neiwert recently spoke with Religion Dispatches about violent rhetoric , imprecatory prayer , and eliminationism .
Religion Dispatches :
You begin the book talking primarily about the excesses of media personalities like Rush Limbaugh , Michael Savage , and Ann Coulter .
What do you say to the claim of Limbaugh and others that they are just entertainers ?
Neiwert : Sure , if political propaganda can pass as entertainment , and it certainly has in the past , I ’d go along with that .
But they are political propagandists first and foremost .
That they do it entertainingly just comes with the job , really .
There ’s nothing more ineffective than propagandists who bore people .
Maybe that ’s been the left ’s problem .
And being an entertainer has never been an excuse for indulging in hateful , dehumanizing rhetoric that reduces people to the status of disposable vermin fit only for elimination .
Which is what those three — and their legion of right - wing imitators — do on a regular basis .
That ’s the specially noxious quality to the rhetoric they deploy in the process of “ entertaining ” us .
We saw what happened to [ Seinfeld star ] Michael Richards , and there was indeed no excuse for what he said .
There ’s none for Savage , either , when he goes on the air and pronounces the 2004 tsunami disaster not a tragedy because most of the victims were Muslims who hated America .
Or Coulter for quipping that her “ only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building . ”
These are remarks that normally mark people as monstrous and inhuman , people who should be shunned by decent society .
And it frankly baffles me that they are not .
You assert that “ mainstream conservatives ” are a bulwark against fascism , but that too many “ seem to have developed an extraordinary boiled frog kind of tolerance for the increasing ugliness of their own movement . ”
Is the mainstream conservative bulwark holding , or is it about to rain frogs and hot water ?
Actually , it has n’t held for some time now .
That ’s part of my critique — namely , that the normative , non-movement conservatives have been standing by and watching and abetting while conservatism has been hijacked by power - hungry ideologues .
As I point out in the book , movement conservatives have made a travesty of conservatism , resembling nowadays something closer to the radical right - wing revolutionaries of the 1990s Patriot movement than anything you might actually describe as conservative in the traditional sense .
I do think that a number of conservatives are starting to wake up to this reality now .
David Brooks and Joe Scarborough and Lindsey Graham have just recently fired salvos across the decks of the right - wing talkers , criticizing them for where they ’re dragging the Republican Party .
But unfortunately , they ’re also in pretty deep denial about just how deeply entrenched the problem is .
You know , you have outfits like WorldNetDaily — whose most recent Jerome Corsi project is devoted to exploring Obama ’s plan to round up conservatives and put them in concentration camps — selling its mailing list to the Republican National Committee and doing all kinds of business with them .
And that ’s just scratching the surface .
There ’s a surfeit of these right - wing organizations who specialize in far - right wingnuttery that are closely enmeshed with the GOP ’s Beltway operations .
So trying to blame it all on a couple of prominent pundits does n’t come close to addressing the real problem .
You and the scholars you cite seem to agree with the observation , widely attributed to novelist Sinclair Lewis , that “ When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross . ”
How do you see that claim playing out today ?
Well , I do see a potential for fascism , but I do n’t see it manifesting itself in the predictable way ; as a takeover by an identifiably proto - fascist movement like the Patriots .
Rather , what ’s happened is that movement conservatives have enabled a whole panoply of fascist traits and set them into motion , creating what I call “ para - fascism , ” which is a sort of half - formed fascism , as opposed to “ proto - fascism , ” which is the real thing in its nascent state .
Fascism is not so much an actual political philosophy — it actively rejects puling intellectualism , after all , in favor of blood and iron and raw political will — as it is a political pathology .
In that sense it ’s perhaps best understood in psychological terms , because like a psychological pathology it arises less from a single identifiable cause as from a constellation of causes or traits .
Movement conservatives have been enabling these traits , particularly the fanatical religiosity and the transformation of “ conservatism ” into a kind of hyper- patriotic political religion bent on a phoenix - like national rebirth by purging the country of its undesirables ; all in the eager pursuit of political power .
So it ’s not a conspiracy or even a coup but rather a gradual transformation of existing political entities ; and not in a healthy way .
Rev. Steven L. Anderson of Tempe , Arizona , recently called on God to smite president Obama ( and all homosexuals ) bringing national attention to what appears to be a trend toward the use of “ imprecatory prayer ” on the farther reaches of the religious right .
Do you consider this a form of eliminationism ?
That ’s pretty unmistakably eliminationist behavior .
Praying for your enemies to be wiped from the face of the earth and their children destroyed as well is a prayer for outright extermination .
And equally disturbing is the fact that a member of Pastor Anderson ’s flock , the day after hearing him say he prays for Obama ’s death , actually showed up at an Obama health care forum openly brandishing an AR - 15 .
And equally disturbing is the fact that this created barely a ripple within the mainstream press .
Indeed , I ’d consider imprecatory prayers a special red flag for eliminationism , because this kind of rhetoric has a powerful and long established permission - creating effect .
It ’s essentially “ Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest ” with a religious patina .
As you know , one of the main arenas where we ’re seeing imprecatory prayers being invoked is in the dispute over the religious takeover of large portions of the nation ’s military - officer corps — a fight with really profound implications , particularly in an environment where you hear Rush Limbaugh “ joking ” that a Honduras - style military coup might be just the ticket for handling President Obama ( a notion recently seconded by a Newsmax writer ) .
Limbaugh ’s broadcasts , of course , can be heard daily on none other than Armed Forces Radio .
Tell us a bit more , if you will , about imprecatory prayer in the military , and in particular , your thoughts about how it has affected anyone ’s behavior , if we know .
And if we do n’t know … how do you think it might ?
Imprecatory prayer among members of the military takes on a much more threatening aspect if it occurs in combination with certain other potentially lethal trends .
One of these is the very real recruitment of members of the military , both active and former , into far - right belief systems .
For instance , we know for a fact that neo -Nazi and white - supremacist organizations have made an active effort not merely to recruit members of the military , but also to have their members join the military and obtain combat training and experience .
We know from FBI reports that they ’ve had at least some success in doing this .
Then there are paranoid , black - helicopter types from the Patriot movement who are recruiting from the military .
For instance , there ’s a group calling itself the “ Oath Keepers ” comprised of veterans who vow not to take part in the coming roundup of American citizens into concentration camps , arming themselves to aid in the “ resistance . ”
One can only imagine the effect of saying imprecatory prayers among paranoid types like this , but it would n’t be a good one .
Now , probably the most notorious case of imprecatory prayer was Pastor Wiley Drake ’s open plea for the death of President Obama , with Pastor Anderson ’s similar plea a close second .
And as far as we know no one has taken up their call to action yet , for which we can all be grateful .
That does n’t make the plea any less repugnant , especially on a moral and spiritual level .
At the same time , it seems almost certain that Scott Roeder — the man who walked into a church and shot abortion provider Dr. George Tiller in the head — indulged imprecatory prayers for Tiller before shooting him .
He was part of a so - called “ Prayer and Action Network , ” a radical ant - abortion outfit closely associated with the far - right Patriot movement where such prayers are standard features .
It should be obvious how such prayers could be really lethal in their toxicity .
They impart upon both the speaker and the hearer a kind of religious benediction and sanction for murdering and / or harming other people .
Moreover , it not only sanctions such acts , it almost impels them — a serious devotee will take such a task upon himself as a spiritual duty .
Which is a deeply disturbing prospect .
Playstation Portable owners will not be able to transfer the disc - based UMD games they own to a PSPgo when the sleek new digital - only system launches next week , Sony officials told Kotaku today .

" We were evaluating a UMD conversion program , but due to legal and technical reasons we will not be offering the program at this time , " a Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesman told Kotaku .
The $ 250 PSPgo has no UMD drive , instead relying fully on an Internet connection to purchase , download and install games onto the system 's harddrive or removable memory .

At this year 's E3 Expo in Los Angeles , Sony Computer Entertainment officials said that they hoped to have a plan in place to allow UMD games to be transferred over to the PSPgo by the launch of the system .
" We are looking into programs for owners who have previously purchased UMD titles and want to exchange them for digital versions , " Sony Computer Entertainment 's Brian Keltner told Kotaku at the time .
" It 's something we are still hammering out the details .
As soon as we have solid plans in place we will make an announcement . "

One of the rumored plans involved Sony installing kiosks in retail stores which would allow gamers to turn their UMD games into digital ones .
Recently a Dutch and Australian retailer said they would not be carrying the PSPgo .

While the ability to transfer already owned copies of UMD games to the PSPgo could likely have a large impact on whether current Playstation Portable owners would buy the system , it 's unlikely it would impact gamers new to Sony 's portable offerings .
During the Tokyo Game Show Sony unveiled new peripherals for the PSPgo , dropped the price of the Playstation Portable in Japan and announced the launch of a program that would free games to people in Europe who upgrade from the PSP to the PSPgo .

Now I can look back and say : “ I have been there .
I have witnessed the first joint conference of the two biggest players in open - source desktop software : KDE and Gnome . ”
And I can tell you : it was good .
I personally think it makes a lot of sense to have the conference together .
After all it helps a lot in creating inter-desktop relationships and projects .
A topic that is especially interesting to me since the Tracker project is also going towards the semantic desktop these days ( and dare I say it is as a result of our work ? ) and carries in its wake projects like Beagle or Zeitgeist .
Thus , the GCDS was an opportunity to meet with people from Tracker to discuss some of the many topics we deal with every day .
I also had the opportunity to meet some KDE newbies , eager youngsters wanting to work on KDE and also Nepomuk .
I was , of course , delighted .
One idea floting around at a party in the evening was the smarter caching of thumbnails using Nepomuk information .
Anyway , I am a technical blogger , a geek struggling to deliver the cold facts ( and failing later down this very page ) .
So let ’s look at the GCDS from a more technical point of view :
Shared / Desktop / Nepomuk Ontologies – In Agreement
I meantioned already that I met with a bunch of the Tracker guys and had some nice chats ( this is really not a cold hard fact now , is it ? ) .
We discussed a possible shared D - Bus API for metadata storage on the desktop which looks like a project for next year and we also discussed and agreed on the shared ontologies project .
Now , the ontologies have been a problem for a long time .
I already blogged about how the Nepomuk vs. Xesam discussion was settled .
We discussed the problem in length on the Xesam mailing list .
We created the OSCAF project on sourceforge and even moved over the Nepomuk ontologies from the Nepomuk dev server .
But there was no consensus so far .
No real development took place .
At the GCDS we fixed that .
We agreed on a layout for the subversion repository , on a packaging structure , on a file format , and even on a name for the package ( we will call it shared - ontologies to match the already existing shared - mimetypes package ) .
After we settle the last tidbits we can start tackling those problems we already have in the bug tracker and get the Nepomuk ontologies ready for shared usage in KDE and Gnome .
A Talk About Practical Nepomuk
At Monday evening I had my talk about Nepomuk .
I tried to give a more practical talk which followed a simple outline of three main points :
Why should I use Nepomuk ?
What should I use Nepomuk for ?
How should I use Nepomuk ?
I think this went quite well except for the fact that I am pretty sure that I was robbed of a couple of minutes .
I do n’t think that I spoke for half an hour .
So we did not have much time for questions in the end which was a pity .
I am pretty sure we could have had a nice discussion .
Well , there will be more possibilities for that soon ( see below ) .
Apart from my talk Laura Dragan gave two lightning talks about Konduit and Semnotes and a talk on her new project : semantic context menus in KDE .
The Place of Nepomuk in KDE ’s Future
Nepomuk was mentioned in quite a few talks .
It seems people are slowly adapting to the ideas and wanting to integrate Nepomuk features ( not only the almighty Akonadi - front ) .
This was also backed by Sebastian Kügler ’s keynote on The Momentum of KDE .
He talked about the achievements of the KDE project in the last year and what is targeted for the coming year .
He mentioned a survey Aaron made and which included that roughly half of the KDE projects he interviewed have plans to integrate Nepomuk in some form .
And then suddenly there was one slide which had only two things on it : 1 . the Nepomuk logo and 2 . the words “ Semantic Desktop ” .
And as if that was not already enough of a booster for my ego he asked me to stand up so everyone could see me .
Now this is the part where I derive from my righteous path of hard cold facts and wander into a realm of egomania : it felt good .
Well , come back down here brain .
Let us tell the nice readers the really good part : there is funding for one or two more Nepomuk workshops this year !
I am very excited about that and cannot wait to get started with the planning for the next one ( probably sometime in September taking place in Paris ) .
So if you missed the first workshop or thought it was not for you , maybe the second one is !
And finally : the social aspect
I told you I would fail .
I simply have to tell you how nice it has been to see so many familiar faces , to meet so many new people and to finally have a face connected to an irc nick or an email address .
I am sorry that I could not properly say goodbye to all I would have liked to .
So please know that I was happy I was to see you and hope to see you again soon .
Maybe at the next Nepomuk workshop .
Model - View - Controller , or MVC for short , is an software architecture pattern for user interfaces that creates a distinction between the display ( or view ) , the data ( or model ) , and the interaction ( or controller ) .
In this article , I ’m going to focus specifically on how MVC applies to the client side of web applications .
What I mean is that MVC in a web based ui translates to
This separation of concerns means that as long as the model stays consistent , you can
Create multiple views for the same model Develop the controller and views independently
For a great example of 1 checkout css Zen Garden .
Here , the same HTML ( the model ) can be seen with many different views .
Now checkout the jquery ui demos for a clear example of both 1 and 2 .
Again , the same HTML has many different views with the various CSS themes , and you can also see jquery ui controller code in action .
The Javascript manipulates the model , affecting what you see and how you see it , independently of which theme ( or view ) you choose .
What this all means is that you can create semantically correct HTML optimized for search engines , CSS so your page looks good for humans , and Javascript to make your page interactive .
In other words , content can be separated from presentation , which can be separated from the interaction behavior .
The CSS and Javascript can be developed ( mostly ) independently and only be loosely coupled to the HTML .
Taking this a step further , it ’s possible to create generic views and controllers using CSS and Javascript that work on a small generic model .
jquery ThickBox is an example of this , since it can be used on any page where you have < a class= ' thickbox ' ...>...</a> .
As long as your HTML supports the generic model , you can reuse the CSS and Javascript across multiple pages .

WASHINGTON  Congress is moving to require videotaping of interrogations of detainees held by the military , a step proponents say will prevent abuse and create a valuable intelligence record .
The provision , which the House passed on Thursday as part of the 2010 Defense Authorization
Act conference report , would apply to interrogations of anyone held at a Defense Department facility .
Because the Central Intelligence Agency ’s secret overseas prisons have been closed , it would most likely cover terrorism suspects whether they were questioned by a military or a C.I.A. officer .
The requirement would not apply to battlefield interrogations by troops engaged in combat .
Representative Rush D. Holt , Democrat of New Jersey , said he proposed the videotaping requirement to protect both prisoners and interrogators , who would be less likely to face false abuse allegations .
He said his amendment would “ continue the process of putting our detainee policies back on a sound legal footing while maintaining our ability to get actionable intelligence . ”
Some intelligence experts believe that recording interrogations could be valuable , since the tapes could be replayed for expert linguists , studied by psychologists or reassessed in light of new information .
They also could be used for training interrogators .
The town manager of Fort Myers Beach , Fla. , is out of a job after the mayor and council members found out he was married to a porn star .
The Fort Myers Beach town council voted 5 - 0 to fire Scott Janke " without cause . "
Mayor Larry Kiker says he learned that Janke 's wife is an adult film star , and the elected officials took the action a few hours later .
And these are Democratic Representatives in strongly Democratic districts .
They should n't be worried about taking the pledge to vote for real health care reform by refusing to support a bill without a strong , robust public option in it .
Yet , they are -- because the White House would rather twist their arms than the arms of the Blue Dog Democrats .
And here 's the list of questions that you can ask of our Democratic officials that the media wo n't even ask :
You 've been an outspoken supporter of the public option , it is becoming increasingly clear that a bill from the Senate will be stripped of almost any kind of recognizable public plan .
Do n't you think it 's time to draw a line in the sand , to make it clear that a bill without a public plan would be unacceptable ?
Would you support regional co-operatives since studies have shown that they 're ineffective , would n't help cut monthly premium costs of private insurers , and would have the potential to become privatized over time ?
Remember , Blue Cross Blue Shield was once a co-op , and look where that 's gotten us now .
I support the public option because the President campaigned on it , and I know that it would provide real competition against private insurers by forcing them to keep honest .
Would you commit to voting against any bill that does n't include a strong , robust public option in the final package ?
Would you , as a Member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , allow the White House to weaken health care reform for the Blue Dogs by getting rid of the public option for so - called co-operatives when you return back from the August recess ?
It 's time for us to hold our Democratic officials accountable on the public option !
It 's the line in the sand for me , and it should be the line in the sand for them as well !
Also , if you live in Arkansas , or knows someone who does , you can even attend Rep .
Mike Ross 's townhall , which is being held this Friday , and his tele - townhalls as well .
We should hold him accountable for blocking real health care reform by watering down the public option .
It 's time to ask him questions during these tele - townhalls that the media wo n't even ask , such as how big an effect the money from the private insurance industry has on his positions on health care reform , and whether the money was the reason why he blocked real health care reform in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Can you also please help nyceve , Jane Hamsher , me , and others in this fight for health reform by donating to our fight ?

* Original tweeties icon by Chris Wallace
With all the buzz lately about Twitter real - time search .
Why do n't you add a real - time tweets bar related to your posts from your twitter timeline or from anybody or even limit it by a geocode coordinates !
Each one links to the demo page where you can see HTML & CSS & JS you need to use ...
CSS code is important but it is almost the same across those different samples , so I 'm not going to focus on it here .
This sample will extract tags that already exists in the page and do a typical realtime related search ..
Use CSS in demo file then include jQuery and plugin JS and add a div with aclass and it will be auto - loaded with default options !
Few options were changed here : Limiting tweets by users like @TechCrunch and @mashable only .
Returning only tweets that have links .
Increasing entry transition time of each tweet to 500 ms .
Animating text font - size instead of the default opacity animation .
Div now has a new attribute ( options ) that contains comma delimited list of options .
( a trailing comma is fatal ) Returns tweets by users located within a given radius of the given latitude / longitude .
Just added a geocode on the from of " latitude , longitude , radius " .
To convert an address to a geocode try this and do n't forget to add the radius in mi( miles ) or km( kilometers ) !
By default , plugin will search twitter by OR - ing those tags to return tweets with any of the tags .
but you can force the search to return tweets that contain all tags .
you may also limit number of the used tags to avoid empty result set when twitter can't find tweets that have all tags on current page !
you can see that ( or_tags ) was set to 0 to disable .
and ( max_tags ) to 2 . also animation is done by the height !
This is a - not related not realtime - search , just your twitter feed .
and using a typical Javascript call .' status ' was set to 1 to ignore tags .' realtime ' was set to 0 to stop realtime search and perform search once .
and Increased ' n ' which is the number of tweets to return .
Since
It is just your tweets .
you might wanna hide avatar and author name by setting ' show_avatar ' and ' show_author ' to 0 !
Now ,
You 've seen most of the plugin features but let me summarize it ..

Word 2003 and 2007 are the most common versions on the market Microsoft has overturned a ban on it selling its flagship Word software , imposed after a patent dispute .
The block was imposed by a Texan court following a ruling that its use of formatting language XML in Word 2003 and 2007 infringed patents .
Under the ruling Microsoft was ordered to pay Canadian patent owner i4i $ 290 m ( £ 177 m ) damages and also told to stop sales of the relevant versions of Word .
The ban on sales was due to come in to force in mid-October .
The ruling was made on 12 August in a Texas court following a long - running dispute between i4i and Microsoft .
I4 i's patent was granted in 1998 and outlines ways for " manipulating the architecture and the content of a document separately from each other " and invokes XML as a way to let people format text documents .
XML , or Extensible Markup Language , is a formatting system that preserves the structure of information , such as that in a spreadsheet , as it is passed around and handled by different programs .
Following the 12 August ruling Microsoft filed a request to stay the injunction and also asked for the case to be put on a fast track so its appeal could be heard quickly .
The US court said Microsoft had met the conditions needed to grant the stay .
Arguments in Microsoft 's appeal against the earlier ruling are due to be heard on 23 September .
" We are happy with the result and look forward to presenting our arguments on the main issues on September 23 , " said Kevin Kutz , a Microsoft spokesman , in a statement .

Mobile carriers in the US have been telling the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) for months that they 're in a bad way — 450M Hz of total spectrum just is n't enough to keep up with consumer demand for wireless services .
As the companies explained in various FCC filings over the summer , the current strain on their networks is caused by a veritable data tsunami that has swept the country in the last few years , and they want the government to make more spectrum available to solve the problem .
The big driver of mobile data use has been smartphones .
Put an iPhone , Pre , BlackBerry , or Android handset in the hands of someone who previously made only voice calls and sent a few text messages , and data use skyrockets .
According to T - Mobile , users of its G1 Android - powered phone use 50 times the data of average T - Mobile customers .
The Wireless Communications Association International ( WCAI ) says that smartphone users consume 30 times the data of a " traditional " handheld device .
And AT&T told the FCC that its wireless network has seen a " 5,000 percent growth in data usage " over the last three years , thanks in large part to the iPhone .
AT&T says it is rolling out 2,000 additional cell towers in 2009 to meet demand .
WCAI also endorsed the following data projection from Cisco that shows the relative amount of data used in a month by the typical phone , smartphone , and laptop user on a wireless data network .
Two different approaches to the issue have been pitched to the FCC .
On one side are the carriers , who want more licensed spectrum and point out that many other countries are busy freeing up spectrum for use by mobile operators .
On the other side are public interest groups and think tanks like the New America Foundation , Public Knowledge , and the Media Access Project .
They argue that spectral efficiency can and should improve , saying that " less than 20 percent of the frequency bands below 3GHz were in use over the course of a business day . "
These groups have already supported more uses in these prime frequencies , including " white spaces broadband " which has already been approved by the FCC .
Given the overwhelming number of complaints about spectrum availability , the FCC has put out a special request for information ( PDF ) on what it might do to ease the crunch ; its answers will be incorporated into the National Broadband Plan currently being drawn up at the agency .
Nothing that happens at the FCC will bring more spectrum onto the market for at least a few years , but the agency last year did auction off prime chunks of the 700MHz spectrum opened up by the DTV transition ( the biggest national chunk was grabbed by Verizon ) .
In addition , it allowed white space devices to operate in the UHF part of the TV band , provided no channel or wireless mic is transmitting on that frequency .
A Microsoft - funded study recently concluded that this alone could generate $ 15 billion a year in value .

Astronauts are all smiles on spacewalk but budget cuts could end Nasa 's hope of returning to the Moon
Hanging on the edge of the International Space Station 250 miles above Earth , astronaut Nicole Stott does well to concentrate on her work despite the gloriously distracting view of our blue planet below .
She was snapped by fellow mission specialist Danny Olivas on the first spacewalk of their mission .
The pair successfully moved a cumbersome and thankfully empty ammonia tank , which will be returned to our planet .
A new fully loaded tank , which plays a crucial role in keeping the orbiter cool , will be installed on a second spacewalk .
Both astronauts clearly enjoyed their six and a half hour celestial walkabout , waving and posing for pictures , despite losing contact with ground control for half an hour .
Communications were knocked out due to a storm at a satellite relay station in Guam .
Astronaut Niclole Stott works in the Space Shuttle Discovery 's payload bay with the dizzying sight of Earth in the background
Out on a limb : Astronaut Nicole Stott was outside of the space station for six hours and 35 minutes
Back on Earth a gathering political storm could mean the days of such shuttle adventures are numbered as the U.S. government decides if it can afford a new space exploration programme .
Nasa is scheduled to retire their 30 - year - old space shuttles next year and rely on Russia to hitch rides to the Space Station until it is decommissioned in 2015 .
But the replacement Constellation mission that is due to take man back to the Moon by 2020 may fall at the first hurdle due to budget cuts .
Failure to launch
While the Orion capsule spacecraft has just passed an early design review , there is uncertainty whether the Ares 1 rocket slated to launch it into orbit will ever fly .
In August an independent committee reviewed Nasa 's human space exploration plans and came up with four options for President Obama 's consideration .
Only one option included the Ares 1 rocket , while the others replaced it with alternatives .
If Ares 1 is cancelled it would add years and huge expense to Orion 's development .
Just another day on the job : Danny Olivas perches on the European Space Agency 's Columbus module Back inside the station , Nicole Stott and European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne , both Expedition 20 flight engineers , work in the Kibo laboratory of the International Space Station
Manager of NASA 's Constellation program , Jeff Hanley , said : ' It 's important for folks to understand that the rocket and the spacecraft fly as an integrated system .
' So whatever we do with respect to the launcher , we would have to go back and redo , to some extent , work that is already done . '
President Obama faces the difficult decision of whether or not to plough billions more dollars into the programme as the country struggles with the world - wide recession .
So far Nasa has spent £ 1.9 billion developing Orion , which has been designed to deliver crew to the space station and the Moon .
The Constellation programme has cost £ 4.7 billion and Nasa will need at least another £ 21 billion for the mission to succeed .
Many experts including Buzz Aldrin , the second man to walk on the Moon , have wondered what America hopes to gain from a return visit to our natural satellite .
' Why do we want to go to go back to the Moon ? ' he asked a British audience recently to mark the Apollo anniversary .
' There 's no reason for us to go back .
We can look at the effects of long - term missions in space by flying around comets , rather than setting up a base on the Moon .
We 're not going to launch any missions from there . '

Away from politics the rest of the crew on board the International Space Station unpacked their new exercise machine - the Colbert treadmill .
Nasa named it after Stephen Colbert ( Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill ) known for his Comedy Central program ' The Colbert Report , ' as a consolation prize .
The comedian won an online vote earlier this year for naming rights to a new space station room but Nasa called it Tranquility instead .
Mr Colbert said : 'My treadmill will ... help trim down those famously fat astronauts .
Lay off the Tang , Chubby !'
The treadmill is in more than 100 pieces .
The bags containing all those parts will remain in a corner of the space station until September , when Nicole Stott has time to put together the running machine .
Stott , the space station 's newest resident , hitched a ride up aboard Discovery .
She will spend the next three months in orbit .
Meanwhile it has emerged that the International Space Station may fire its thrusters to avoid a piece of space junk that could pass within two miles of the orbiting complex .
The U.S. space agency is tracking debris from a portion of a European rocket , the Ariane 5 , that was launched more than three years ago .
The debris could pass close enough to require astronauts to fire thrusters to move the station and shuttle Discovery that is docked there out of the way , NASA officials said .
There are currently 13 astronauts living in space together .

During a recent meeting , the Antiplanner was extolling the virtues of Houston ‘s land - use policies , and a home builder at the meeting said , “ Of course , no one here wants our city to be like Houston , ” meaning no one wanted Houston ’s land - use regime .
Why not ?
I asked .
“ There is too much competition down there .
My company ca n’t make a profit , ” he said .
“ You have to have some barriers to entry to be able to make money . ”
Those who accuse free marketeers of being supporters of big business do n’t realize that big businesses ( and often smaller businesses ) do n’t want a free market .
In this home builder ’s case , he wanted enough restrictions on the market to keep out some of his competitors ( most likely smaller companies that ca n’t afford to hire lawyers and planners for every project ) but not enough regulation to keep his company out .
But the goal of government is not — or at least should not be — to make sure that his particular company makes a profit .
That ’s his job .
The goal of government should be to keep a level playing field .
If it represents anyone at all , it should represent consumers , not producers .
That means maximizing competition , not limiting it .
Of course , any time you give government power , you create an incentive for companies such as the one that employs this home builder to lobby government to use its power to benefit them .
Urban planners who like to imagine that they can fulfill some utopian vision fail to account for the power of such lobbying .
When they see it happen , they imagine they could fix it if only we gave them even more power — which in turn would simply stimulate more lobbying .
That ’s why we should n’t give government planners too much power in the first place .

By directly manipulating the activity of individual neurons , scientists have given flies memories of a bad experience they never really had , according to a report in the October 16th issue of the journal Cell .
" Flies have the ability to learn , but the circuits that instruct memory formation were unknown , " said Gero Miesenböck of the University of Oxford .
" We were able to pin the essential component down to 12 cells .
It 's really remarkable resolution . "
Those dozen cells are sufficient to manage what is a difficult cognitive problem : learning to associate a particular odor with something bad , like an electric shock .
In essence , these cells create memories that the fly then uses to avoid that odor .
To pinpoint the exact neurons responsible for this memory among thousands in the fly brain , the researchers used a clever technique they developed , called optogenetics , in which a simple flash of light is used to release caged - molecules present in selective neurons that then stimulate the activity of those neurons .
An analogous situation , says Miesenböck , is if you wanted to send a message only to certain inhabitants of a city , you would give those you wanted to reach a radio tuned to the right frequency and send the message publicly , over the airwaves .
Miesenböck said his team made some educated guesses about the parts of the brain that would be important for the flies ' learning task .
From there , they were able to narrow it down through experimentation to the 12 - neuron brain circuit .
Remarkably , stimulating just these neurons gives the flies a memory of an unpleasant event that never occurred .
" We like to take seemingly lofty psychological phenomena and reduce them to mechanics , to see for example how the intelligence needed to adapt to a changing environment can be reduced to physical interactions between cells and molecules , " he said .
" The question is : how do you get intelligence from parts that are unintelligent ? "
Using their approach to " write directly to memory , " scientists can now obtain a level of evidence about brain function that was impossible before , Miesenböck emphasized .
He notes that neuroscience for a long time depended primarily on recording neural activity and attempting to correlate it to perceptions , actions , and cognition .
" It 's more powerful to seize control of the relevant brain circuits and produce these states directly , " he says .
Miesenböck adds that the simple brain of a fly likely can tell us much about how more complex brains work .
" As a general rule , biology tends to be conservative , " he said .
" It 's rare that evolution ' invents ' the same process several times . "
And , he says , even simple organisms may turn out to have a " surprisingly rich mental life . "

The spec gap between the Magic and the Hero is mighty small -- other than the entirely revamped Sense UI , the Hero's 5 megapixel camera is about the only thing the newer model has over the original , physical design notwithstanding .
That gap is on the fast track to getting even smaller , too , now that HTC has issued a press release detailing a Sense upgrade for the Magic ( assuming you have n't already nabbed it off xda- developers , that is ) .
It looks like current owners will get hooked up some time in October for NT $ 1,500 , which works out to about $ 46 ; what we do n't know , though , is which Magics will be eligible for the upgrade .
Just like HTC's WinMo wares , we 're guessing that subsidized units are going to be at the mercy of their carriers , which means that T - Mobile , Rogers , and Vodafone customers ( among others ) should take a somewhat pessimistic view of this announcement until they 've heard otherwise .
Hey , we 're just looking out for your mental health here .
[ Thanks , Steve G. ]
Depending on how you interpret the press release , HTC could be saying that the upgrade is valued at NT $ 1,500 , but will actually be free .
We 're working to get a clarification .
Alright , we 've gotten the skinny on this straight from HTC .
The update will be free -- thing is , it 's only coming to Taiwan 's Chunghwa so far .
The fate of Magics on other carriers remains unknown , but we do know that so - called " with Google " versions will definitely be left out ( that includes you , myTouch 3G ) .

For several years ‘ internet addiction ’ has been promoted by the Chinese government as a serious mental illness affecting large numbers of young people , but in recent months it has started to pull back , seemingly due to the growth of a widespread , poorly regulated and abusive system of internet addiction ‘ treatment ’ centres .
Firstly , let me say that most of my sources on this issue are from China Daily , a state - run news service , but whether this reflects the reality or not , it is clear that the Chinese authorities are becoming worried about how the problem is being dealt with .
For example , the Chinese authorities recently shut down an unlicensed internet ‘ boot camp ’ style clinic and arrested 13 employees after a 15 - year - old boy was beaten to death by camp counsellors for apparently running too slowly .
This follows news that the Chinese Ministry of Health has recently banned electroshock therapy for ‘ internet addiction ’ .
The same state media source reported that in Linyi Psychiatric Hospital alone , 3,000 young people had been ‘ treated ’ in this way .
Both Chinese and Western media report that electroshock was also used as a punishment ( note that some reports portray it as mild electrical current while others specifically describe it as electroconvulsive therapy ) .
The clinics seems to be a mixture of private clinics , of which 400 or so are estimated to exist , and government run clinics of an indeterminate number .
The approach of one of the most prestigious state - run clinics is described in this article :
Co-founded by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China and Beijing Military Region General Hospital in 2004 , Tao ’s clinic in the suburbs of Beijing has treated nearly 5,000 Internet - addicted youths and says 75 percent have been cured .
At the clinic , young addicts receive “ comprehensive therapy ” including medication , psychological counseling and low - intensity military training .
They also take interactive courses with their parents to learn communication skills .
Tao also uses psychotropic drugs to treat patients suffering from mental illnesses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , anxiety and depression .
This clinic seems to be the only one to have admitted Western journalists and it has been featured in TV and radio news reports , which , at times , make for quite disturbing viewing .
The recent admission of abuses in ‘ internet addiction ’ treatment centres is a significant change in tack as previous reports have typically discussed the internet in rather alarming terms , variously claiming that it has caused schizophrenia , led to drug addiction , resulted in job loss and the like .
State media claims that about 10 % of young net users are addicts .
Reading all the stories on ‘ internet addiction ’ in China , both from Chinese and Western media , I was struck by how it consistently reflected the idea that the popularity of the ‘ treatment ’ is being driven by parents ’ anxieties about their children not conforming to the social pressures of family and academic achievement .
This is remarkably similar to what seems to drive the concept in the Western world and while our stereotype can often be that ‘ internet addiction ’ is simply a tool of Chinese state repression of free speech , it is worth bearing in mind that it may be closer to home than we like to believe .

If you ’re ready to show your skills creating digital music , we want your work .
UPDATED !
New contest entry page , new deadline ( 10/25 ) :
http://www.renoise.com/competitions/indamixx/
Plus tips , tracks , and more to give you additional inspiration :
More with Less : ” Efficient ” Renoise Music Tracks and Tips
Renoise , the " bottom - up " music production tool that makes brings modern comforts to the tracker interface , and Indamixx , the turnkey Linux - powered mobile music rig , are working with CDM on a contest to produce a new song .
You ’ll need Renoise to make your track , but the software now runs natively on Mac , Windows , and Linux , and you can even finish your production on the free demo version if you ’d like to give the software a taste before committing to it .
( Really – you can even save your file .
The demo wo n’t let you save a wav file , but we ’ll judge the xrns , and the only other restrictions are some nags – Renoise is a rare return to the old “ shareware ” model of development . )
Here on CDM , we ’ll also be featuring some tutorials on music production using Renoise , using Linux , and using free and open source software , as well as the commercial offerings .
So , this is a chance not only to compete , but to learn some new tools .
Rather than just feed off your work , I ’m really eager to make this competition a chance for us to work together and share knowledge , to give to you .
So I ’m pleased to have some of the experts in the Linux audio community and Renoise community helping us do just that .
The competition will also be fully Creative Commons - licensed , to make sure you ’re free to use our tips and tutorials , and that the track you make is free for others to remix – without abusing your work .
( This is not officially CC - affiliated ; we ’re just making use of their license . )
Aside from the prizes , I ’ll be thrilled to have the chance to promote your best work here on CDM , and the winner will become a demo song available via Renoise and on the Indamixx Linux - powered USB flash drive and pre-configured netbooks .
( The USB stick means that if you already have a netbook , you can get a stable , pre-configured Linux rig on your existing machine . )
Above :
The grand prize , the Indamixx Netbook .
I ’ve just gotten one in the mail from Indamixx to try , and I ’m already hooked on the thing .
Based on the MSI Wind , the rig is pre-configured with Linux software , set up in advance for you , with energy XT , Renoise , and ArdourXchange for converting sessions from software like Pro Tools – plus lots of free and open source software , of course .
Win the contest , and you get one of your own – and your track will ship as the Renoise demo on this laptop and on the Renoise site .
How to enter :
Here ’s how the competition will work :
1 . You ’ll make your track in Renoise , saving as an .xrns file .
( Do n’t want to start from scratch ?
Renoise imports MIDI files and many tracker formats , so you could , for instance , bang out some beats on your PSP using LittleGPTracker , then finish up in Renoise . )
You can use any samples you like , but make sure they ’re your own recordings or samples you ’ve cleared for this purpose , and that you properly attribute them .
2 . Make sure your track will play on a netbook – so go easy .
For reference , here ’s a file used for benchmarking systems .
Figure that your track should have a similar task on your CPU .
CPUBenchmark21.xrns ( nothing special musically – for testing only ! )
3 . Post your music somewhere ( audio + xrns ) – put it on your blog , use drop.io , sign up for CDM ’s own in - development blog platform createdigitalmusic.com , or whatever you like .
If you put the sound somewhere like SoundCloud , of course , you get an instantly - embeddable player .
4 . Be sure to apply a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license .
I ’ll be doing the same with CDM ’s tutorials and such .
This leaves others free to share your work and to remix it , while ensuring they can only do so if they attribute you properly and if their work is just as free to share .
( It does not preclude you from selling it later on , either . )
See the details of the license , then sign up .
About the license
License your work
Choose “ yes ” for commercial uses – because any commercial use must still share alike , which discourages commercial abuse .
Select “ yes , as long as others share alike ” for modifications .
Choose “ unported ” for jurisdiction .
And make use of the other fields to attach metadata to your work .
You should get a CC - BY - SA license as a result , which allows maximum flexibility for your work while protecting you from people exploiting your work without also sharing the results .
5 . Tell us about it !
Point CDM , Indamixx , Renoise , and the contest judges to your track by signing up here :
Contest entry form [ Google Docs ]
6 . Judging will evaluate whether tracks are relatively CPU efficient xrns files , but – most importantly – are original , terrific music .
There will be categories judged by producer / remix artist / DJ Ron Stewart of Indamixx and Peter Kirn of CDM , and a user ’s choice judged by you via public voting .
Prizes :
An Indamixx Netbook MK II SE , to the Indamixx choice
A registered version of Renoise , to the CDM choice
4 Indamixx USB stick versions , to the user choices
DEADLINE :
October 15
We ’ll have updates through the competition .
Stay tuned for more tips and tutorials on Renoise and Linux audio alike , plus a look at the Indamixx Linux - powered netbook rig ( I ’ve just gotten one for testing – it ’s deliciously compact ) .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
European researchers are creating new technology that could , ultimately , make accessible the sum of humankind 's knowledge .
Hundreds of organisations and millions of documents are already linked to this " United Nations of knowledge " .
The EU - funded DRIVER project ’s key result is a technological breakthrough that enables institutions to link repositories of knowledge together into one huge , networked online ‘ library of libraries ’ .
The researchers have created software , called D - NET , that can link information collected on diverse computer platforms , using legacy software which can still ‘ talk ’ or work with older systems in more than 25 European languages !
The technological breakthrough achieved in DRIVER was key , according to the project ’s coordinator , Professor Yannis Ioannidis , but another fundamental aim was to oversee the integration of various repositories scattered across the continent .
One million documents , and counting
So far , over 240 institutions from 27 European countries speaking 25 languages have been linked together , creating the DRIVER Search Portal , the door to European Open Access research .
It regularly harvests journal articles , books , dissertations , lectures and reports .
The portal is located at : search.driver.research-infrastructures.eu .
Today , there are about 1 million documents available to search .
This number looks set to grow , as more and more institutions realise how simple and fast it is to register their online repositories as well , suggests Ioannidis .
The search portal also acts as a powerful demonstration of the D - NET software , an open source application created so that anyone can access and work with it .
United Nations of knowledge ?
DRIVER ’s work could transform the way we manage or organise precious data not just across systems but also borders - something like a United Nations ( UN ) for keeping knowledge safe .
Unusual as this sounds , the foundations have already been laid for this potential scenario .
It began with an inventory of Europe ’s repositories , tracing those who make up Europe ’s ‘ Open Access ’ community .
A technology watch - to track the latest developments in information science and repository management - was created and has been very active in setting standards in this field .
One important output of DRIVER ’s towards this was the Guidelines for Repository Managers , a key document that establishes the rules for creating interoperability between different systems .
The DRIVER search portal , for instance , is something of a working demonstration of this vision , and the Guidelines are the major engine for realising that vision .
Then , over time , repositories across the world could develop and adapt their content format to be compatible with the DRIVER platform and guidelines .
It ’s a bit of a dream scenario , but DRIVER is taking it seriously , creating an online tool that can validate repositories according to the standards set by the project .
A further effort in this direction is the DRIVER confederation , a network of content providers and digital repository / library stakeholders , which , among others , aims to advance DRIVER from a testbed project to a fully functional international organisation .
Does a UN body for the sum of civilisation ’s knowledge still sound so far - fetched ?
Interest in the work
The project ’s work has received intense interest internationally , with repositories from China , India , South America and elsewhere making contact with the DRIVER partners and developing plans for their own deployment .
The Chinese Academy of Science is currently evaluating D - NET for its national repository .
The Academy is just one of many interested parties .
So far , there have been more than 800 downloads of the D - NET open source code .
In the medium to long term , too , there is scope for commercialisation of the D - NET platform .
“ D - NET is a powerful system [ like a content management system ] , so there is commercial potential for [ it ] , ” reveals Ioannidis .
But the current priorities for DRIVER are to get the system up and running , and get more institutions using the platform .
“ Our next task is to extend the system , so that it goes beyond text documents and can handle any type of media .
But certainly it is available to commercial enterprises , and anybody else , under the open source licence . ”
The DRIVER technology , which is rapidly becoming a standard in Europe and across the world , nonetheless offers enormous potential to private content providers , allowing them to easily link repositories together , or to link their data with other organisations .
In all , DRIVER represents a concerted and ongoing effort to bind together the wealth of knowledge and research in Europe , and indeed the world .
The DRIVER project received funding from the Research Infrastructure priority of the EU ’s Sixth Framework Programme for research .
This is the second of a two - part special feature on DRIVER .

Microsoft 's next operating system , Windows 7 , is available to the public Oct. 22 .
So why not host an awkward launch party for a perfectly diverse group of your friends ?
Microsoft made an unbearable video tutorial to get you going .
Clearly meant to have a lively , " fun " feel , the painful video is so over - the - top bad we thought it first it must be a hoax .
But Microsoft 's in - house blogger has been touting these events , which are being organized by an apparently well - established marketing company that specializes in getting people to shill products to their friends at sketchy " house parties . "
Said marketing company owns the YouTube channel where this video appeared .
Microsoft has a track record of tone deaf commercials , but this marketing video somehow hits a new low .
Maybe it 's the way there 's an undercurrent of tension and seething disdain even among the hired professional actors , as in this scene , about three minutes into the video :
Middle - aged white lady : I led an overview of some of my favorite Windows 7 features ...
It took , like , 10 minutes [ approving murmurs ] ...
It was totally , informal , like , everyone just kind of crowded around the computer in the kitchen [ hearty laughter ] .
... After my overview , I went straight to an activity .
Older white lady :
Oh , you went straight to the activity ?
I let everyone fool around with " Snap " [ a Windows 7 feature ] for a little while !
[ Uproarious laughter . ]
Young black man :
Me too !
I did the same !
Middle aged white lady : I love Snap !
Older white lady :
And then we started an activity maybe 30 minutes later .
Middle - aged white lady :
Well , either way works , right ?
You figure out what your guests want , and play it by ear .
In any event , we each did an activity , or two .
Angry party - pooper geek guy ( white ) : Uh I did three activities .
Ya.
Middle - aged white lady : Oooooh .
Young black man :
Well , excuse me .
[ Snickering laughter . ]
Middle - aged white lady :
That 's great !
[ Laughter ]
The activities each have you talk for a minute or so , and then ...
Angry party - pooper geek guy ( white ) : [ Frowns , angrily slams down drink , walks over to get more food and stew in silent rage . ]
Or maybe it 's the way the video undercuts the very product it purports to be touting , by emphasizing the you should actually install Microsoft 's operating system at least 48 hours before your ... uh , install party .
As in this scene :
Angry party - pooper geek guy ( white ) :
Of course the first thing you want to do is install Windows 7 , right ?
[ Boisterous , awkward laughter . ]
Now make sure you do that a couple of days in advance of the party .
[ Laughter silenced . ]
Call customer service if you have any questions .
[ Emphatically , this time , waving arms : ]
Got to play with Windows 7 before the party .
True .
Nothing scotches an awesome Windows 7 party like catastrophic data loss , the Blue Screen of Death and impotent cursing .
Person - to - person marketing might work for fun products like cosmetics , or cheap inoffensive gear like Tupperware .
But operating system installs ?
Not fun , not trivial , and not the sort of thing that 's going to liven up your kitchen .
Device drivers ?
Crashes ?
Partitioning ?
Pass the tequila .

UPDATE : And of course , the parodies have already begun :
A Georgian political activist and blogger was the target of a massive denial - of - service attack yesterday , according to a Facebook executive .
The attack took Twitter and LiveJournal offline and severely affected Facebook .
Google services were also attacked , but they suffered no down - time .
Max Kelly , chief security officer at Facebook is reported as stating :
It was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard , ” Kelly said .
“ We ’re actively investigating the source of the attacks , and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them , if we can .
Cyxymu is the nickname of the activist .
His LiveJournal account is still down , but his twitter page is back up and running again .
So , who is responsible for this attack ?
He claims it was the Russian KGB .
In a Tweet he sent hours ago in English he stated the “ hackers was from Russian KGB . ” 
What was so dangerous about the opinions of a single relatively obscure Georgian blogger ?
We ’re not yet sure , as his LiveJournal page is still down .
Update : Cyxymu just tweeted “ My twitter is online !
Thank you all for support after ciber attack from Russia ! ” 
We ’ll keep you updated throughout the day as we learn more .
For now , below is a list of tweets he has sent in the past hours , translated into English :
@ V_x hour is worth a couple bucks each .
but such an attack a few services , it is a very ambitious about 7 hours ago
@ Trollvsr yes , I DDoSili about 8 hours ago
@ Mashable this was hackers from Russian KGB about 9 hours ago
@ Kuyantus unfortunately I was the target of attack .
offer our apologies to all about 9 hours ago
One thing , however , is clear .
Whoever wanted to shut Cyxymu up made a serious mistake .
From obscure blogger to free speech celebrity all in 24 hours .
Not bad .
Not bad at all .
Update @ 11:40 : There no hard facts yet , but a commenter has suggested ( take it for what it ’s worth ) that the attacks did not come from the Russian Government per say , and that the attacks are in some way connected with the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia .
A central requirement for reproductive justice is not only for women to have the right not to have children , but to also exercise the right to have children .
Women have been denied this right through population control programs that care more about reducing birth rates than empowering women to have control over their reproductive health and rights .
The ideology that informed the programs has not gone away , and below are ten reasons why rethinking overpopulation is vital to creating the global understanding and solidarity needed to advance women 's reproductive and sexual rights .
1 . The population ' explosion ' is over .
Although world population is still growing and is expected to reach 9 billion by the year 2050 , the era of rapid growth is over .
With increasing education , urbanization , and women 's work outside the home , birth rates have fallen in almost every part of the world and now average 2.7 births per woman .
2 . The focus on population masks the complex causes of poverty and inequality .
A narrow focus on human numbers obscures the way different economic and political systems operate to perpetuate poverty and inequality .
It places the blame on the people with the least amount of resources and power rather than on corrupt governments and rich elites .
3 . Hunger is not the result of ' too many mouths ' to feed .
Global food production has consistently outpaced population growth .
People go hungry because they do not have the land on which to grow food or the money with which to buy it .
4 . Population growth is not the driving force behind environmental degradation .
Blaming environmental degradation on overpopulation lets the real culprits off the hook .
The richest fifth of the world 's people consume 66 times as many resources as the poorest fifth .
The U.S. , with a low fertility rate , is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming .
5 . Population pressure is not a root cause of political insecurity and conflict .
Especially since 9/11 , conflict in the Middle East has been linked to a ' youth bulge ' of too many young men whose numbers supposedly make them prone to violence .
Blaming population pressure for instability takes the onus off powerful actors and political choices .
6 . Population control targets women 's fertility and restricts reproductive rights .
All women should have access to high quality , voluntary reproductive health services , including safe birth control and abortion .
In contrast , population control programs try to drive down birth rates through coercive social policies and the aggressive promotion of sterilization or long - acting contraceptives that can threaten women 's health .
7 . Population control programs have a negative effect on basic health care .
Under pressure from international population agencies , many poor countries made population control a higher priority than primary health care from the 1970s on .
Reducing fertility was considered more important than preventing and treating debilitating diseases like malaria , improving maternal and child health , and addressing malnutrition .
8 . Population alarmism encourages apocalyptic thinking that legitimizes human rights abuses .
Dire predictions of population - induced mass famine and environmental collapse have long been popular in the U.S. Population funding appeals still play on such fears even though they have not been borne out in reality .
This sense of emergency leads to an elitist moral relativism , in which ' we ' know best and ' our ' rights are more worthy than ' theirs . '
9 . Threatening images of overpopulation reinforce racial and ethnic stereotypes and scapegoat immigrants and other vulnerable communities .
Negative media images of starving African babies , poor , pregnant women of color , and hordes of dangerous Third World men drive home the message that ' those people ' outnumber 'us . '
Fear of overpopulation in the Third World often translates into fear of increasing immigration to the West , and thereby people of color becoming the majority .
10 . Conventional views of overpopulation stand in the way of greater global understanding and solidarity .
Fears of overpopulation are deeply divisive and harmful .
In order to protect and advance reproductive rights in a hostile climate , we urgently need to work together across borders of gender , race , class and nationality .
Rethinking population helps open the way .

Activist pranksters
The Yes Men have created a fake version of The New York Post with the headline “ We ’re Screwed ” and an overall theme of climate change .
This morning over 2000 volunteers have been distributing copies of this “ special edition ” paper on the streets of New York City .
Early this morning , nearly a million New Yorkers were stunned by the appearance of a “ special edition ” New York Post blaring headlines that their city could face deadly heat waves , extreme flooding , and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades .
The most alarming thing about it : the news came from an official City report .
Distributed by over 2000 volunteers throughout New York City , the paper has been created by The Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake - up call to action on climate change .
It appears one day before a UN summit where Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon will push 100 world leaders to make serious commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the lead - up to the Copenhagen climate conference in December .
Ban has said that the world has “ less than 10 years to halt ( the ) global rise in greenhouse gas emissions if we are to avoid catastrophic consequences for people and the planet , ” adding that Copenhagen is a “ once- in-a- generation opportunity . ”
Although the 32 - page New York Post is a fake , everything in it is 100 % true , with all facts carefully checked by a team of editors and climate change experts .
Eklat in New York Gaddafi-Wutrede empört Uno-Delegierte
Bei seinem ersten Auftritt vor der Uno - Vollversammlung hat Libyens Staatschef Gaddafi den Sicherheitsrat der Staatengemeinschaft wütend beschimpft .

The " swine flu panic express " is picking up speed , said Yael T. Abouhalkah in the Kansas City Star .
A new White House report says up to 150 million Americans -- half the population -- could get the H1N1 virus .
The specter of such a huge outbreak is adding pressure for the quick release of a vaccine , but " no one knows for sure yet whether the vaccine will work . "
Everybody take a deep breath , said Laura Blue in Time .
Yes , the report , by the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology , said that 60 million to 120 million people could be hit hard enough to show swine flu symptoms , 1.8 million could end up in a hospital , and 30,000 to 90,000 could die .
But the report " notes prominently and often that , even though the up - to - 50 - percent - infected scenario is plausible , it is by no means certain . "
Maybe , but outbreaks of the H1N1 virus are becoming more frequent already , said Michael Roberts in Politics Daily .
Still , a massive vaccination effort — targeting highly susceptible young people — is on the way , and " basic hygiene measures like hand - washing , covering sneezes and coughs , and avoiding sick people " can be effective in preventing infection .

Random thought I had today : With the King of Pop ’s death in June , the price of superstar conceptual artist Jeff Koons ‘ famed 1988 sculpture , Michael Jackson and Bubbles , above , must be rocketing in value .
( Made in an edition of three , plus an artist ’s proof , one of the life - sized , 42 in . x 70 1/2 in. x 32 1/2 in. porcelain tchotchkes sold at auction for $ 5.6 million in 2001 . )
Indeed , legendary art dealer Larry Gagosian , who reps Koons , right , told The New York Times back in July that if one of the creations
was to come up for sale now , it could make more than $ 20 million .
“ And that ’s conservative , ” he added .
Of course , that ’s what someone who gets a piece of every sale is supposed to say , especially during the hype hurricane mere days after Jackson ’s demise .
But , in truth , the art market ’s not doing so well .
As Bloomberg.com noted in July , quoting London ’s ArtTactic , “ Contemporary - art values have tumbled in the last year , with average auction prices down 76.2 percent since May 2008 . ”
( In May , Sotheby ’s reported an 87 % drop in second - quarter profits compared to a year before , a plummet from which they ’ve only begun to recover . )
That same Bloomberg.com piece featured Koons , talking postmortem , during a new show , about the reason he ’d made MJ and Bubbles :
“ I wanted to show Michael as a contemporary Christ figure : I wanted to give the viewer a sense of a spiritual authority , ” says the soft - spoken Koons , wearing a gray summer suit and a serious expression in an interview at the gallery .
Koons intended the sculpture as a way of “ paying homage to the greatness , ” he says .
He had watched Jackson moonwalk , and “ everybody ’s jaw just dropped , seeing that . ”
“ The type of adulation , the type of support that ’s given to pop artists — this was the contemporary type of support that I thought that Christ would have received in his time , ” explains Koons , who says he executed the sculpture in a Renaissance style , its triangular shape reminiscent of Michelangelo ’s “ Pieta . ”
Yeah , his words have got the ring of Koons ’ typically doe- eyed , “ golly - gee ” fake wonderment and art blather that got him rich and famous .
( People with longer memories or lifespans may recall questions of racism the work sparked , when viewers noted a striking resemblence in it between Bubbles and his owner . )
Despite this provenance , though , or because of it , Jeff Koons is an art world money machine — a thriller , if you will — and the massive MJ and Bubbles has got to be the world ’s ultimate Michael Jackson collectible , especially in the recent shadow of his burial .
With these facts , even a monkey would agree .

October 7 , 2009
A senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) told CNSNews.com that it is “ likely ” that Reid will use H.R. 1586 — a bill passed by the House in March to impose a 90 - percent tax on bonuses paid to employees of certain bailed - out financial institutions — as a “ shell ” for enacting the final version of the Senate ’s health care bill , which Reid is responsible for crafting .
Under the procedure , the substance of House Resolution 1586 would be removed and replaced with the entire Senate health care package .
The maneuver would initially require the support of 60 senators to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1586 ( i.e. , end debate on the congressional procedure and move forward ) .
If Reid wins 60 votes , then debate begins on his health care package .
Reid could then decide to block all amendments and attempt to get a vote on the entire package .

In what few would consider a fair fight , Sirius XM host Mike Signorile took on National Organization for Marriage ( NOM ) executive director Brian Brown , making short work of Brown ’s feeble , empty - headed arguments .
It ’s truly amazing that characters like Maggie Gallagher and Brian Brown are able to keep NOM afloat considering how ineffective they are in defending positions which fail under the mildest of scrutiny .
Just take a look back at some of Brown ’s earlier work on Penn & Teller ’s Bullsh!t .

Stay up past midnight , grab a blanket and go stargazing tonight :
The year 's most spectacular meteor shower is expected to peak Wednesday morning around 1 a.m. ( your local time ) , and then again just before dawn .
The Perseid meteor shower happens every year in August , when the Earth travels through a cloud of debris left by the periodic comet Swift - Tuttle , which last approached the Earth in 1992 .
Under optimal conditions , up to 80 shooting stars can be seen every hour , although how many you 'll see tonight depends on cloud cover , the brightness of the moon and the proximity of city lights .
The Perseids get their name because meteors appear to shoot out from the arm of the Y - shaped constellation Perseus , named after the Greek hero famous for slaying Medusa .
Tuesday night , because of glare from the 55 percent gibbous moon , it may be easiest to spot shooting stars early in the night when the moon sits low in the sky .
Between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. ( local time wherever you are ) , meteors will be less frequent but may look brighter than during the shower 's peak .
NASA scientists say that 's also the best time to spot a stunning " Earthgrazer , " which is a meteor that skims close to the Earth 's atmosphere and generates a long , colorful tail .
The first Perseids have been visible since late July , and many Flickr photographers have already captured beautiful images of the meteors .
If you want to take your own photos , check out our how - to wiki on photographing the stars .
You can also submit your images to the wiki site — if we get enough good ones , we 'll compile them into a gallery on Wired Science .

Udinese Will Be Better Against Milan – Aleksandar Lukovic
The 26 - year - old has assured fans that the Zebrette are ready to up the level of their game in the coming weeks .
In the annals of the long , still - ongoing debate over nuclear power , the most infamous words are undoubtedly “ too cheap to meter . ”
The origin of this phrase is a speech given on September 16 , 1954 by Lewis L. Strauss , a former Navy officer who was appointed Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in 1953 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Ever since Strauss gave that speech , many anti-nuclear activists have assumed and claimed that he literally said electricity from nuclear plants would be too cheap to meter .
Of course , nuclear power did not turn out to be “ cheap ” from a cost - per - kilowatt - hour perspective .
At least , not compared to traditional energy sources like coal , oil and hydropower , which have been economically “ cheap ” but are arguably more “ costly ” in terms of their long term impacts on the environment ( barring incidents like the Fukushima meltdown ) .
Anyway , putting aside that debate , it has long been clear that electricity from fission - powered nuclear plants is not and never will be “ too cheap to meter . ”
Thus , for decades , the phrase has been ridiculed and held up as the prime iconic example of absurd claims made by supporters of nuclear power .
Except that Strauss did n’t actually say what opponents of nuclear power think he said .
The focus of his speech to the National Association of Science Writers in New York City on September 16th , 1954 dealt with how modern scientific research , in general , would lead to better lives for future generations .
And , his meter remark was about electric energy , in general , not nuclear power in particular .
As reported in the New York Times the next day , what Strauss really said was this :
“ Our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter ... will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds , and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours , as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age . ”
For an excellent in - depth look at the facts about Strauss ’ speech and his “ too cheap to meter ” remark , read the page about it on the Canadian Nuclear Society website .
And , regardless of which side of the nuclear power debate you ’re on , you might want to keep in mind an old saying that applies to any type of energy that is used to generate significant amounts of electricity —
“ There ’s no such thing as a free lunch . ”

One of the many things I like about Python is generators .
They allow for the creation of iterators without the boilerplate imposed by Java or PHP .
Furthermore , iterators can be thought of as streams , and many times we do n’t really want to default to eager behavior ( maybe eager behavior should be demanded ) .
For example , consider a class implementing a very simple binary tree :
class BinaryTree : def __init__ ( self , data , left =
None , right = None ) : self .
data = data self .
left = left self .
right = right def __unicode__ ( self ) : return ' %s ' % self .
data
More of a struct , this simple class has slots ( instance variables ) for the left sub -node , the right sub - node , and the data .
When we first encounter a structure like this in , say , a data structure course , our inclination is to traverse the thing .
Remember , we can do this any number of ways : depth - first , breadth - first , pre-order , post - order ( for the traversals in this article , I will only be concerned with node data , but all the algorithms can easily be modified to yield the nodes themselves ) .
If we want to write a very simple , eager , depth - first ( and also pre-order ) traversal of a tree like this , we can do something as follows :
def recursive_dfs ( tree ) : nodes = [ ] if ( tree !=
None ) : nodes .
append ( tree . data ) nodes .
extend ( recursive_dfs ( tree . left ) ) nodes .
extend ( recursive_dfs ( tree . right ) ) return nodes
This is a great first step , but , as already mentioned , it is eager .
By calling this function , we get a complete list of all the nodes in the tree whether we need them or not .
With a few simple modifications , however , we can pull nodes out of a tree on demand in the same pre-order fashion by using Python generators .
We simply start the traversal , yield the node data , yield all nodes in the left subtree , and then yield all nodes in the right subtree :
def basic_dfs ( tree ) : if ( tree !=
None ) : yield tree .
data for node_data in basic_dfs ( tree .
left ) : yield node_data for node_data in basic_dfs ( tree . right ) : yield node_data
If we wanted a ( not - quite ) - post - order traversal , we would yield the nodes in the right subtree first .
We could do this by simple rewriting the function above .
However , we can take this a step further , and leave the the decision of what nodes to yield first to another function entirely ( I will call this the ‘ chooser ’ function ) :
def left_then_right ( tree ) : if ( tree !=
None ) : yield tree .
left yield tree .
right def dfs ( tree , chooser = left_then_right ) : if ( tree !=
None ) : yield tree .
data for immediate_child in chooser ( tree ) : for node_data in dfs ( immediate_child , chooser ) : yield node_data
Thus dfs( sometree ) will call the left_then_right ( ) function by default , and perform a pre-order traversal .
For our ( not - quite ) - post - order traversal , we define the right_then_left ( ) function :
def right_then_left ( tree ) : if ( tree !=
None ) : yield tree .
right yield tree .
left
And passing this function with dfs( sometree , right_then_left ) , we have our new traversal .
To really see the benefit of our lazy traversals , though , we can go one step further , and implement a binary - search on top of our dfs ( ) function as a chooser function .
Instead of yielding the left subtree and the right subtree , the chooser function will yield the nodes in the left subtree if the value we ’re searching for is less than the node data , the nodes in the right if the value is greater than the node data , or the node data itself if it is equal to the value :
def binary_search_chooser ( value ) : def binary_search_chooser_inner ( tree ) : if ( tree !=
None and tree .
data !=
None ) : if ( value <= tree . data ) : yield tree .
left else : yield tree .
right return binary_search_chooser_inner
Do n’t let the closure fool you , this is still simple stuff .
A call to binary_search_chooer ( 5 ) , returns a chooser function that will decide whether to go left or right down the tree based on a node ’s value .
So to search a BST for 5 , we can just call bfs ( tree , binary_search_chooser ( 5 ) ) .
This will give us a list of nodes ( the path to a leaf ) , the last of which will be 5 if that value is found .
For sure there are more efficient ways to do these kinds of traversal with pointer manipulation , etc , but this serves as fun exercise for fans of generators .
The astute reader will also note that we ’ve implemented the strategy pattern in a functional - programming type of way with our use of first class functions .
A 58 - year - old town mayor has been accused of breaking into women ’s homes and trying on their undergarments .
Ian Stafford has been charged with three counts of burglary after three women reported missing underwear to police .
Footage from a hidden camera that one of the women installed in her bedroom revealed a semi- naked man removing and then trying on underwear from her drawers , then performing a sex act .
According to sources , police recovered a large amount of underwear in the course of their investigation , which culminated in the arrest of Stafford .
Following his arrest , he immediately resigned from his position as Mayor of Preesall and Knott End in Lancashire , England .

Paving the way for Tories
When the Harper Government announced an Infrastructure Stimulus Plan focused on construction - ready projects , Nova Scotia saw a golden opportunity to make headway on a huge problem : its crumbling highway system .
The province sought federal approval for 39 paving projects .
But Ottawa approved only 20 of the paving jobs .
Since the 19 rejected projects were all but identical to the 20 that received a federal go - ahead , it ’s hard to figure out what criteria Ottawa used for its decisions .
Until you look at a federal electoral map .
Projects in ridings held by Conservative MPs were almost four times as likely to receive federal approval as those in Liberal - held ridings .
Contrarian used the provincial Freedom of Information
Act to obtain a list of proposed projects for comparison with those approved .
The map above shows the ratio of Harper - approved projects in each Nova Scotia federal riding .
( Click here for a larger image . )
Projects proposed for the large Cumberland - Colchester - Musquodoboit Valley riding left vacant by the resignation of independent MP Bill Casey , where a byelection must take place by Fall , fared even better than those in Tory ridings .
Seven of eight paving projects proposed for the traditionally Tory seat met with the Harper government ’s approval , for a total of $ 5.2 million in federal funding .
Because they mainly encompass urban areas , the four Metro seats — two Liberal and two NDP — did n’t figure prominently in the calculations .
One of two projects submitted for the four ridings , a paving job near Stanfield International Airport in NDP - held Sackville - Eastern Shore , was approved .
In the Central Nova riding held by Minister of National Defense Peter MacKay , Ottawa approved six projects worth $ 6.1 million , and rejected a single project worth $ 942,300 .
By contrast , Liberal MP Scott Brison ‘s Kings - Hants riding received approval for only one of seven proposed projects .
It was worth $ 630,000 in federal aid , while the six rejected projects were worth a total of $ 4.2 million in federal funding .
In all , the province submitted paving projects worth $ 71.5 million , of which the feds would pay 45 percent or $ 32.2 million .
( The federal portion of infrastructure stimulus projects is billed at 50 percent , but some costs are not eligible , so the actual federal contribution works out to 45 percent . )
Approved projects total $ 40.1 million , of which Ottawa will pay $ 18.1 million .
Projects killed by the feds totalled $ 31.4 million , of which Ottawa would have paid $ 14.1 million .
The following table summarizes the outcome of the Harper Government ’s response to Nova Scotia ’s requests for approval of paving projects under the federal Infrastructure Stimulus Plan .
UPDATE : A spokesman for the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal referred questions on the federal approvals process to federal Infrastructure Minister John Baird .
A call to Chris Day , press secretary to Baird , was returned by a departmental communications officer , who promised to get back to contrarian shortly .
UPDATE II :
It appears that a section of the only project approved in Scott Brison ’s riding actually crosses the line into Tory Greg Kerr ’s turf .
So the tally should read :
( CNN ) -- Jared was forced to choose between a dying father and the love of his life .
Karin Bogliolo , left , and her partner , Judy Rickard , say as they approach their 70s , all they want is to live together .
Judy Rickard had to quit her job and lose her full pension to be with the one she loved .
Martha McDevitt - Pugh packed up and moved to another country to be with her future spouse .
" Nobody should be in that position .
Nobody should have to be an exile , " Rickard said .
But all three said their hands were forced by federal immigration laws that do n't allow Americans to sponsor their foreign - born same - sex partners for citizenship as a man may do for his wife or a woman for her husband .
" The problem is that I , as a woman , cannot sponsor my female partner for immigration .
If I was a man or [ my partner ]
Karin was a man , we would n't be having this discussion , " said Rickard , 61 .
She now travels outside the United States whenever she can to be with her partner , Karin Bogliolo , 68 , who had to go back to Britain when her visa expired last year , but it 's not the life together they dreamed of .
" I am finally with someone I really want to be with , " Bogliolo said .
" But we have n't got all the time in the world .
We 're both getting old . "

An estimated 36,000 bi-national couples face the same dilemma each year , according to an advocacy group , Immigration Equality .
The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill for the first time Wednesday , after 10 previous attempts to have hearings on the Uniting American Families Act .
The bill has 102 co-sponsors in the House and 17 co-sponsors in the Senate , including Judiciary Chairman Sen.
Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont .
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council which opposes same sex marriage , has condemned the bill as " yet another attack on marriage at the expense of U.S. taxpayers . "
Watch what 's at stake in the same - sex immigration fight »
" Although Leahy frames the policy as an anti-discrimination measure , the truth is , this weakens our federal law and chips away at the unique status of marriage , " Perkins wrote in a blog on the group 's Web site .
" For the federal government to recognize homosexual pairs in any way , shape , or form is a violation of the federal Defense of Marriage Act . "
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , who is openly gay , is a co-sponsor of the House version of the bill , but thinks it should be part of a larger immigration reform measure , according to his spokesman , Harry Gural .
Gural said Frank " doubts that it will be taken up in this Congress because of the overwhelming need to deal with other issues like financial regulation , climate change and health care . "
Gural said Frank supports the bill , but " he 's just a pragmatist . "
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from couples facing deportation and split because of the law .
Nineteen other countries , including much of western Europe and Canada , Brazil and Australia among others , allow nationals to sponsor same - sex partners for citizenship .
" We 're not asking for anything special , " Rickard said .
" This is a civil rights issue ; it 's about basic rights and right now , we are considered second - class citizens .
But this bill , if it passed , it would mean quite simply that we could be equal . "
The committee heard from opponents like Jessica M. Vaughan , director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies , a group that supports a restrictive immigration policy and the deportation of illegal immigrants .
She testified that immigration numbers in the United States are already staggering and the bill would put further stress on the system .
Vaughan said that because the bill would allow sponsoring of " permanent partnerships , " it would be difficult to accept applications because there was no documentation for those , the way there are for marriages .
" Without documents , how do you establish the relationship is bona fide ? " she said .
" And if we are going to make this change , it should be across all federal levels , not just immigration .
What about Social Security and Medicare ? "
For some same - sex couples , it is enough to start with immigration .
Jared , a Dutch national living in this country illegally who asked to be identified only by his English nickname , fell in love with Melvin Terry in 1978 while traveling in Europe .
He had been with Terry for 18 years when he was told by the U.S. government that he had to leave .
" The fact that the government has the right to tell you your relationship is invalid , it 's more than frustrating , it 's insulting , " Terry said .
Then , Jared 's dad became ill in the Netherlands .
He was forced to choose whether to go back home to see his father before he died and risk being denied entry back into the United States because he is HIV - positive or of staying with Terry and never seeing his father again .
His father made the choice for him , sending him a letter and underlining " do n't even think about coming here . "
And so for 13 years , Jared , 49 , has remained in the United States illegally to be with his 62 - year - old partner .

Canadian Chris Waddling , who came to the United States to study and work beginning in 1994 as a research scientist , is one of the lucky ones -- his employer at UCSF has agreed to sponsor him for a green card and permanent residency .
But Waddling says he sees inequality every day at work , in the shape of a female coworker who married a foreign man and could sponsor him .
" Every single time somebody gets a green card based on a spouse 's support , it 's one more person who has jumped ahead of me in a line I should be in , " Waddling said .
Martha McDevitt - Pugh , founder and chairwoman of the advocacy group Love Exiles , gave up waiting for things to change and moved to the Netherlands so she could be with her Dutch partner , Lin McDevitt - Pugh .
The two married in the Netherlands , but Martha McDevitt - Pugh has struggled to find work abroad .
" I realized that what I had in the U.S. I was never going to have that again , " she said .
" I wanted to have the same choice as everyone else and that was what made me so angry . "
The McDevitt - Pughs are hopeful this will be the year things will change , and they encourage all gay people to stand up for the rights they deserve .
" What we have on our side is love , " Lin McDevitt - Pugh said .
" I know that those in exile are in exile because they love somebody so much that they are willing to leave their country and their families . "

The World Economic Forum — otherwise known as the group that throws the fancy Davos shindig every year — has just released an over 400 - page report on the world economy ( PDF ) .
Global competitiveness was the key metric , and the US lost its number one spot this year to Switzerland .
So it goes .
But tucked back in the report 's list of data tables was a fascinating one about intellectual property , and it put the US in 19th place worldwide when it comes to protecting IP .
What happened next was entirely predictable in a world where many executives still think that " more IP protection " is always better : the US Chamber of Commerce called for ... more IP protection in the US .
Weak and timid ?
Nothing objective is being measured in the WEF survey question on intellectual property ( p. 347 ) except for the feelings of the executives who answered it .
That is , there 's no attempt to compare IP protection regimes around the world to see which are best or which are toughest ( not necessarily the same thing ) .
Instead , the data comes from surveys of business leaders in countries all over the globe ; leaders in each place are asked to rank their own country on a wide variety of metrics , from IP to government corruption to property rights .
What the 19th place US showing reveals , then , is whether executives in each country feel that IP protections are " strong " or " weak . "
Singapore execs thought their country had the strongest IP protections , followed by Sweden , Finland , Switzerland , and Austria .
Whatever the reality of US IP law , business executives in the US rated it weaker than did executives in 18 other countries .
But dealing with IP is n't simply a game in which amassing " tougher " weapons and better body armor is always better ( retroactive copyright term extensions , for instance , make IP laws " tougher " but are largely a giveaway to huge businesses and rich artists while locking up the tremendous innovation and business opportunities created by a healthy public domain ) .
Data source : Open Rights Group
You would n't know that from reading a US Chamber of Commerce blog post this week on the WEF report , which laments the fact that " American executives really feel that the United States is n’t doing enough to protect and strengthen IP rights " ( note : this is not in fact what the survey asked ) .
The question this raises , then , is " why and how do we do better ? " ( emphasis added ) .
" America should be setting the gold standard for IP rights and protections , " says the Chamber , and it has some ideas about how to " substantively move the ball forward to strengthen IP protections . "
Those include having the White House appoint its IP Enforcement Coordinator ( a position unwilling pushed on the executive branch by the recent PRO - IP Act ) , passing the so - far secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , and continuing to use the industry - guided Special 301 process for naming and shaming wicked countries like Canada for not being " tough enough " on IP .
( Irony alert : Canada scored one place higher than the US on the WEF report , a fact noted with glee by Canadians sick of being some kind of international bad boy on this issue . )
Oh — and did we mention that the US ought to be lecturing other countries " engaging our trading partners in meaningful dialogue on how to strengthen and improve their IP legal and regulatory regimes " ?
The end result of this whole way of thinking is obvious : a perpetual tightening of the thumbscrews .
Reports like this come out , trade groups argue that their countries all need to do a better job of " catching up " to the first - place finisher , laws are passed , IP systems are tightened up , and a new number one country emerges .
Everyone else then tries to reach this " new level . "
It 's a one - way system of ever - increasing control coupled with moral opprobrium for not agreeing that the only direction IP protection must go is up .
In this case , the Chamber calls out US courage , hoping that the " United States is not timid " about standing up for its IP .
Translation : Legislators , you 're a bunch of sissies if you do n't give us what we want .

Jeremy
Tyler completed his jump from high school underclassman to pro basketball player on Wednesday when he signed a one - year deal with Maccabi Haifa of the Israeli Premier League .
Tyler , 18 , is the first American - born player to leave high school early to play basketball professionally overseas .
The 6 - foot - 11 , 260 - pound Tyler announced in the spring that he was skipping his senior season at San Diego High because prep basketball had become boring .
Jeremy Tyler had committed to Rick Pitino and Louisville before deciding to take his game overseas .
Kelly Kline / Icon SMI
" I think I made the right decision , " Tyler told The Associated Press on Wednesday evening .
" I think this team is a good fit for me and it's the right country . "
The contract is worth $ 150,000 , a team spokesman told ESPN.com .
" I feel good .
I feel blessed , " he said .
" I got past the easy part .
Now the hard part is to perform and show the world I got a contract for a reason .
Now I can play against grown men . "
Tyler 's agent , former NBA point guard B.J. Armstrong , said several offers were carefully considered .
" It 's a huge step for him and his family and the things he 's about to get into , " Armstrong said .
" The basketball will be the easiest part in this equation .
Now he 's got to get things adjusted off the court to what a professional does , how he lives .
It 'll be a challenge .
The rest will take care of itself . "
Tyler is expected to return to the United States when he becomes eligible for the 2011 NBA draft .
Sonny Vaccaro , who has advised
Tyler and his family , said it will be up to the player to decide where he wants to play next season .
Vaccaro told ESPN of the deal : " He 's saying , ' I want to be a basketball player and do it without a detour . ' "
Vaccaro said Tyler had five other offers , including one from a team for more money , " but Jeremy , his family and I decided it was more important to have a chance of playing than making a couple extra dollars .
If Jeremy is who he 's supposed to be , he 'll earn a lot of money in his lifetime . "
Tyler averaged 28.7 points during his junior year at San Diego High , leading his team to the CIF - San Diego Section Division I quarterfinals .
In early May , Tyler told The Associated Press that he was tired of facing triple - teams , being hacked and being limited to playing the middle when he felt he had much more to his game .
" I was the best player in San Diego this year and it was boring .
Next year , it would be extremely boring , " Tyler said then .
" I 'd go into the game with no enthusiasm . "
Maccabi Haifa was promoted to the Premier League after a 10 - year absence and earned its first appearance in both the Israeli Premier League championship game as well as the State Cup Finals .
The team has re-signed forward Davon Jefferson of Southern Cal .
Maccabi Haifa opens its season on Oct. 25 .
" Tyler 's size and natural talent will present matchup problems in our favor against other teams in Israel , " Maccabi Haifa coach Avi Ashkenazi said .
" We know Tyler is hungry to prove himself on the court .
We look forward to him developing over the course of the season and improving our team . "

( CNN ) --
An autopsy report issued Friday by Hillsborough County , Florida , cites cocaine as a contributing factor in the death of TV pitchman Billy Mays , who died in June at age 50 .
The Hillsborough County medical examiner 's office said cocaine use contributed to Billy Mays ' heart disease .
" Mays died from a lethal arrhythmia of the heart caused by hypertensive and arteriosclerotic heart disease , " the county said in a statement attributed to Dr. Leszek Chrostowski , the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsy .
" He further concluded that cocaine use caused or contributed to the development of his heart disease , and therefore contributed to his death , " it added .
The fact that toxicology tests detected only breakdown products of cocaine , not the drug itself , led Chrostowski to conclude that Mays had used cocaine " in the few days prior to death but not immediately prior to death . "
Cocaine is a stimulant that can raise blood pressure and thicken the wall of the left ventricle of the heart , one of the organ 's four main pumping chambers .
The autopsy also found low concentrations of ethyl alcohol " consistent with social consumption of a few beverages " as well as the narcotic drugs hydrocodone , oxycodone and tramadol .
Mays had prescriptions for the drugs -- which were found in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations -- to ease hip pain .
In addition , the tests found evidence of two tranquilizers -- alprazolam ( Xanax ) and diazepam ( Valium ) -- which are commonly prescribed for a variety of ailments , including anxiety and insomnia .
Both drugs were determined to be in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations .
Mays was found dead at his home near Tampa on June 28 .
Mays , with his booming voice , was famous for fronting products such as OxiClean and Orange Glo in TV commercials .

Chancellor warns against rush to judgment on attack ordered by German commanders that killed up to 70 villagers
Angela Merkel said today that her government deeply regretted the death of Afghan civilians in a controversial air strike ordered by German commanders .
But the German chancellor told parliament she would not tolerate criticism " at home or abroad " until the full details of the incident were known , and said the German army 's presence in Afghanistan was " in the urgent interest of our country " .
Merkel 's comments came as Nato acknowledged for the first time that Afghan civilians were among those killed when German commanders called in US jets to attack two stolen oil tankers near Kunduz on Friday .
The death toll has not been established , but Afghan Rights Monitor , a national watchdog group , said that between 60 and 70 villagers had been killed .
A statement today from the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force said that commanders originally believed the tankers were surrounded only by Taliban insurgents , but a subsequent review showed " civilians also were killed and injured in the strike " .
The air strike – the deadliest military operation German troops have been involved in since the second world war – has caused a rift between German and US authorities over the conduct of the war , and prompted a fierce reaction from the Afghan government .
The new US commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , who had sought to distance himself from the incident , today appointed a Canadian general to investigate the incident .
Addressing a special sitting of parliament , Merkel acknowledged that civilians may have been harmed , but said that contradictory reports of the incident meant that the victims had still not been identified .
" We will not accept premature judgments , " she said .
" I say this very clearly after what I have experienced in the last few days : I will not tolerate that from whoever it may be , at home as well as abroad . "
Less than three weeks before a general election , the attack has also become a major political issue in Berlin .
Merkel resisted calls from the Left party for an immediate withdrawal of German troops , but she said Nato allies should define a " clear goal " by the end of the year regarding a " handover strategy " .
The government , which has referred to its Afghanistan policy as a " stabilisation effort " and has avoided using the word " war " , has come under pressure from all parties to talk with more honesty to the electorate about the conflict .
Jürgen Trittin , of the Green party , delivered a blistering attack on the government , calling the raid a " breaking point that clearly shows that Germany has shifted its strategy on Afghanistan and in my view , in the wrong direction " .
Addressing the embattled defence minister , Franz Josef Jung , who has faced calls for his resignation in the light of the incident , which he referred to yesterdayas " militarily necessary " , Trittin said : " You obviously work on the principle hush it up , deny it , and when there 's no alternative , I 'll eventually apologise . "
Germany 's foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier , of the Social Democrats , told the Bundestag it would be " irresponsible " for German troops simply to pull out of Afghanistan .
But he added : " The Bundeswehr is not an occupying force .
We 're not there for eternity . "
Time for a bit of fiction on distributed Python deployment .
As some of you know , py.execnet imperatively and elastically executes code in local or remote python processes , maintaining channels for exchanging data .
Execnet has the wonderful zero - install feature which means no software except a Python interpreter is required remotely .
The connection between Python interpreters is direct , i.e. the connecting side needs to know how to start the remote side .
And it ’s non-transitive meaning : given a A -> B and a B -> C connection there is no support for getting a A -> C connection mediated by B .
I ’d like to lift these restriction and introduce the concept of a deployment network through which execnet connections can be mediated .
I am pondering a command line tool that creates a network of Python intepreters on multiple hosts like this :
execnet start mynet ssh=linuxbox.org socket=windowsbox.com ssh=osx.com
This would create a " mynet " deployment network of four Python interpreters running on different hosts and platforms : one local process and three remote processes connected to it .
Let ’s add a remote Jython process to the " mynet " deployment network :
execnet addhost mynet ssh=remote//python=jython
We can generally use the ‘ mynet ’ handle to work with this newly instantiated deployment network .
For example , to get a fresh process on a certain platform from a Python program :
mynet = execnet.connect (' mynet ') gateway = mynet.makegateway( platform=" java " )
The first line connects to our local ‘ mynet ’ process .
The second line creates a gateway to a fresh Python interpreter , in this case a Jython process .
The bootstrapping of the Jython - side gateway object is determined by the initiating client side .
The two subprocesses communicate through an IO - connection that is mediated by the ‘ mynet ’ deployment network .
This is very exciting because the zero-installation feature is preserved on two levels : the deployment processes work on software coming from a single point , the command line above .
And our " on-top " gateways operate with software determined from the initiating side , from the python code above .
Interaction between the two worlds is limited to a connect operation and providing IO mediatiation .
This means the deployment network facilities can evolve independently from the " on-top " execnet - elastic programs .
Conceptually it ’s a very reliable and robust setting .
The mynet processes should be able to run as robustly as unix shells .
They are to provide a solid base for writing and deploying Python applications that span multiple interpreters .
They do n’t run applications in - process .
This is not all fiction .
The current development version of py.execnet already works across and between CPython2.4 through to CPython 3.1 , Jython and PyPy .
And i intend to release execnet as a separate package soon , providing the basis for implementing the above fiction and lots of other on - top fun 🙂
More than just relaxing , meditation helps improve self - image of anxiety sufferers
PHOTO COURTESY OF PHILIPPE GOLDIN
Before and after meditating , participants in the study went into an MRI scanner that observed their brain activity .
The findings suggest that mindfulness meditation might help people view themselves differently .
Philippe Goldin
The thought of public speaking gives most people butterflies in their stomach .
But for those suffering from social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , the idea of addressing a crowd or being evaluated in any other social situation often triggers more than just jittery nerves .
Headaches , sleep problems and persistent thoughts of failure and embarrassment are common problems for those with SAD .
Researchers at Stanford now have some advice for those prone to such anxiety :
Slow down and listen to the sights and sounds around you , including those of your own body .
In a study headed by psychology researcher Philippe Goldin , participants with SAD underwent Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction — a form of meditation that helped them direct their attention to the sensations of simple things like breathing , lying down or just walking around .
After the two - month meditation training , participants were less anxious and thought of themselves more positively .
Results of Goldin 's study were published in the Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy .
People with social anxiety disorder tend to be overly critical of themselves and often believe others are assuming the worst about them .
While many people beat themselves up once in a while , people with SAD get stuck on negative views of themselves , Goldin said .
" The idea is that if a person has the psychological flexibility to shift freely from one mode of thinking to another mode , then that is a sign of health , " said Goldin .
" It 's when we get stuck in certain thinking patterns that our beliefs become maladaptive . "
Helping people make even small changes to how they think about themselves is a difficult task , but one that has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people , Goldin said .
SAD is one of the most common psychological disorders , affecting up to 12 out of every 100 Americans .
It usually strikes early — at around 10 years of age .
But the disorder is often not diagnosed or treated and leads to other psychological problems later in life , Goldin said .
" Often people will subsequently show up in their 20s or 30s with depression or substance abuse and then if you dig below that you find that what preceded all of that was an internal anxiety about performing in social situations , " Goldin said .
Goldin — along with postdoctoral scholar Wiveka Ramel and psychology Professor James Gross — found that nine sessions of mindfulness meditation training made people with social anxiety disorder feel less anxious and less depressed and improved their self - views .
Goldin said the mindfulness meditation works because it teaches people how to focus on things other than their personal criticisms .
Before and after meditating , participants went into an MRI scanner that observed their brain activity and were told to decide if various positive and negative adjectives presented on a screen appropriately described them .
After meditation , participants were more likely to pick positive words like " admired " and " loved " and less likely to choose negative adjectives like " coward " and " afraid . "
Mindfulness meditation helped reduce people 's habit of grasping at negative attributes , Goldin said .
" Often , people who have either depression or anxiety have a poor or negative self - view , " he said .
The meditation also appeared to calm the brain circuitry associated with self - describing adjectives such as " weak " and " insecure " or " strong " and " able . "
The finding suggests that mindfulness meditation might make it easier for people to shift between ways of viewing themselves , Goldin said .
The mindfulness meditation also caused an increase in brain activity in areas that involve visual attention .
People with social anxiety often try to avoid things by diverting their gaze from people and things that might be threatening .
But this increase in visual attention " means that instead of running away they were staying with the stimulus , " Goldin said .
Goldin said the next step in his research is to compare the long - term effects of the mindfulness meditation training to aerobic exercise and cognitive - behavioral therapy .
This work is currently under way and the researchers are offering free training sessions to people interested in participating .

I hate to spoil it for you guys but this is the plot of the next Twilight movie .
- Alex
A government “ of the people , by the people , for the people ” can be a double - edged sword .
Of course , in theory , it means that we , through the democratic process , determine what the government should and should n’t do .
However …many people do n’t take the time to realize that it also means that we …are then responsible for what the government ultimately does .
That is , of course , unless the government was concealing its actions from our view , effectively removing our ability to consent / dissent .
It ’s a painful revelation , if one is encountering it for the first time .
It means , for example , that if the United States tortured detainees … that we are responsible for it .
That is why it is so very difficult for some to even admit that waterboarding IS , in fact , TORTURE .
Because if it is … then WE tortured people .
While it is should be obvious to even the most simple - minded of our citizenry that certain actions we engaged in were torture , were in violation of more than one international treaty , were in violation of the articles of war , and were in violation of our own federal statutes … some people simply cannot bring themselves to admit it .
It is simply too embarrassing … too painful … that a nation once so noble , could have sunk so low .
Even today , as I watched Fox News during lunch ( not my channel choice , but c’est la vie ) , I watched as a guest expert on their “ news ” program stated plainly that the actions detailed in the recently released Inspector General ’s findings were CLEARLY torture … only to have the host of the show quickly assert that “ many people ” would not call the actions in the report “ torture . ”
Perhaps … but those “ many people ” would be mistaken , and in the depths of profound self - deception .
In fact , despite the fact that the Inspector General ’s report describes in detail thoroughly disgusting practices , that may well have exceeded even the level of interrogation that was authorized … and even though the report noticeably does not show that torture was necessary to produce results …
Fox News ’ website already claims that the report may serve as proof of the torture ’s efficacy : “ Two new documents released by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques appear to declare a success efforts to gain intelligence on potential terror attacks , leading opponents of an investigation into CIA interrogators wondering about the Obama administration ’s motives . “
So , let ’s perform a quick examination of recent events , so that we can judge for ourselves :
The heavily - redacted Inspector General ’s report ( may be found here ) , seems to make clear the following : 1 - The measures were approved at a HIGH level 2 - They threatened to execute detainees , held mock executions 3 - They threatened to kill detainees ’ families , rape their mothers , their wives , and their children in front of them 4 - They applied pressure to detainees ’ carotid arteries , restricting bloodflow to the brain , causing unconsciousness 5 - Detainees were struck in the torso with rifle butts and knees 6 - Detainees were waterboarded in the style of Japanese prisoner torture 7 - Detainees were suspended by their arms to simulate shoulder dislocation 8 - Detainees were kept in soiled diapers for extended periods 9 - Detainees were stripped naked and doused with water on a bare floor to induce hypothermia 10 - Detainees died as the result of their treatment 11 -
The interrogators received only two weeks training in how to perform interrogations , based on flawed / exaggerated study data produced by the CIA 12 - Detainees were tortured despite the absence of any information indicating that they were guilty of anything , or even that they knew anything 13 - Detainees were tortured who were likely to have provided information , perhaps even more reliable information without torture .
Salon has a good write - up of the report , for those who do not wish to read ( or who cannot stomach ) the actual report .

Quick FYI : It is worth mentioning , related to the list of activities and revelations above , that both the torture measures AND the death threats …are violations of anti-torture laws .

Faced with the Inspector General ’s findings that the treatment of detainees was , at times , “ unauthorized , improvised , inhumane “ … Attorney General Holder was left with little choice but to appoint John Durham as a Special Investigator to look into the matter .
While Obama and Holder have both expressed that the wish for Durham to focus only on the interrogators , and only those that exceeded the Department of Justice authorization memos…it is worth mentioning that Durham will have the authority to pursue ANY relevant information WHEREVER it may lead .
The Wall Street Journal did an interesting short piece on Durham here .
A registered Republican … interesting choice .

Mr. Pot …Meet Mr. Kettle :
It is to be expected that the appointment of a Special Investigator would prompt statements from Republican leaders , accusing the administration of somehow “ making America less safe . ”
What was more than a little unexpected ( and deliciously ironic ) was former Vice President Cheney ’s accusation that the move was a sign of the administration attempting to “ politicize ” the Justice Department .
Yes …this , coming from the man who most hold ultimately responsible for the politically motivated hiring and firing of U.S. Attorneys …especially those thought to be “ lefties , ” or “ lesbians , ” or simply not in favor of pursuing unfounded , politically motivated investigations .
This claim is also interesting … coming from a man who many expect was the “ administration source ” of orders to use torture against detainees .

Plus … Cheney is simply dead wrong .
Obama and the administration have somewhat disappointingly sided with NOT investigating the torture that occurred during the Bush years … it was exclusively Attorney General Holder ’s call to appoint an Investigator .

Cheney …was not finished .
He also has stated that these interrogators … ” deserve our gratitude ” and do not deserve “ to be the targets of political investigations or prosecutions .
“ Humor me , by following the logic : if interrogators broke the laws ( even if ordered to do so …as being ordered to do so is NOT a legal defense ) , and committed despicable acts of torture and coercion against American prisoners , sometimes even resulting in the prisoners ’ deaths … then according to Cheney , they deserve our “ gratitude . ”
Is this how Americans are usually expected to treat members of our society that break the laws …even those committing murder ?

Ari Fleischer , press secretary under Bush , said , “ I think the decision is disgusting .
It ’s amazing to me that the people who kept us safe may now become the people our government prosecutes .
There are plenty of real criminals out there – it would be nice if the Justice Department went after them .
“ First of all , Mr. Fleischer … there is little proof these people “ kept us safe , ” and there is , indeed , an argument to be made that their actions made both us and our soldiers LESS safe and resulted in the swelling of ranks within terrorist organizations .
Secondly , if they broke the law … then they ARE “ real criminals , ” as you say … that ’s the definition of “ criminal ” we use here in the United States .

Meanwhile , some people … think the administration and the Justice Department have not gone far enough .
Representative Jerry Nadler , a senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , has pointed out the simple truth : the President and other government officials have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution and laws of this country .
By willingly ignoring the growing mountain of evidence that serious crimes were committed … they are in violation of that oath .
What is more , since under the anti-torture act of 1996 , the United States government is obligated to investigate accusations of torture … they are not only violating their oaths , but they are also violating the law which REQUIRES an investigation .
Until they do so …they are , in effect , criminals themselves .
to investigate accusations of torture … they are not only violating their oaths , but they are also violating the law which an investigation .
Until they do so …they are , in effect , criminals themselves .
It had long been speculated that the Bush Administration had “ manipulated ” terror alerts to their political advantage , following a simple formula : when something occurs that either hurts Republicans or helps Democrats … quickly distract the public with a new terrifying , unsubstantiated threat warning .
Now , Tom Ridge , former Secretary of Homeland Security …has verified that he was asked to change the alert level for political reasons : “ Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings ; was ‘ blindsided ’ by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him ; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored ; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush ’s re-election , something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over . “
Congratulations to Keith Olbermann , who first succinctly reported on this pattern way back in 2006 in a segment titled the “ Nexus of Politics and Terror . “
Here ’s the clip :
I ’ve said this before : it is worth the shame , to get to the truth and to reconcile with what WE CLAIM are our ideals .
If laws were broken , and there is certainly enough evidence to indicate that they were , then there MUST be an investigation .
If such an investigation reveals individuals who broke the law , along with any individuals who ordered them to break the law … those people should face judgment in a court of law .
Those who claim to value our Constitution have no choice but to call for this …or to reveal themselves to be liars who care little for the Constitution and for Due Process .
In the Nuremberg trials following World War II …we clearly said it is NOT a justification to perform crimes for the sake of one ’s country …we clearly said it is NOT a justification to commit crimes simply because you were ordered to do so…we prosecuted the torturers , the people who watched them torture and did nothing , the people who ordered them to torture , and the judges who said it was legal for them to torture .
If we now shirk our responsibilities under the law , and because this is a government “ of the people , by the people , for the people , “ then we are ALL hypocrites , we are ALL criminals , and we are ALL torturers .
HP - UX has been around for 25 years , and HP keeps on finding ways to improve and update its venerable flagship Unix operating system .
In HP's ( NYSE : HPQ ) latest update to HP - UX , the OS is getting enhanced security features and memory availability .
While Unix is often thought of as being secure and not as vulnerable as other operating system choices , the reality is that new threats are constantly emerging .
That 's one reason why HP - UX 11 i v.3 Update 5 , codenamed " Vantage , " is getting improved features to help admins better protect their environments against emerging threats .
" If you look at the number of threats out there that are emerging for Unix , there is a new threat identified roughly on average one out of every three days , " Brian Cox , director of software planning and marketing for Business Critical Systems at HP , told InternetNews.com .
" From a security perspective , how we 're making HP - UX better is by how easy it is to make it even more secure . "
In the newest update , one way HP is trying to make security easy is by way of scalability .
With previous HP - UX releases , administrators were only able to patch 10 systems at a time .
Now in Update 5 , Cox noted administrators can now patch one hundred systems at a time .
The large - scale approach is implemented via an HP - UX tool called Software Assistant that automates the patching specifically around security enhancements .
" It dramatically reduces the burden to make sure that systems are compliant with all the latest security protection , " Cox said .
Additionally , HP - UX now directly includes a security auditing tool called Bastille to ensure compliance with security standards .
" Bastille looks through your software stack and looks for unprotected and open access points , " Cox said .
" It will go through and analyze your stack and also over time will go back and re-analyze the stack for modifications . "
Cox added that Bastille is able to report on potential issues as well as automatically provide fixes .
HP - UX Bastille is based in part on the open source Bastille effort for Linux , for which HP has been a key contributor .
Better HP - UX performance
The new update also includes improved memory performance by way of technology called Locality - Optimized Resource Alignment ( LORA ) .
LORA uses local memory to optimize server performance .
" LORA allows us to significantly improve performance on a server by closely associating the data , the application and the resources assigned to it to be all together in one place on a server , " Cox said .
Cox explained that HP 's large servers can have multiple terabytes of RAM and up to 128 processor cores .
As a result , when a user loads up application data , those bits will get assigned where there is available space within the system .
The problem is that the bits can become separated across the system , analogous to the way that Windows PCs can have issues with disk file fragmentation .
LORA provides what Cox referred to as a measurable performance improvement on existing hardware .
" What we 've been concentrating on is there are things we can do in software that require no change in hardware , and this is just one example , " Cox said .
Latest update
Update 5 follows the " Vigilant " release , which came out in April of this year .
Update 4 had a core focus on new virtualization features for HP - UX .
HP updates HP - UX every six months , once in the spring and then again in the fall .
" We 're continuing to invest in HP - UX , " Cox said .
" There is a solid business out there .
Customers have mission - critical needs and we 're enhancing HP - UX on a regular basis to meet those needs . "
Sept. 11 , 2009 -- U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman 's first mission as an elite Army Ranger in Iraq was the rescue of Pvt. Jessica Lynch , a new book reveals .
And although Tillman played only a bit part in Lynch 's rescue , he quickly concluded that the mission had motives beyond military strategy .
" We leave tomorrow , '' Tillman wrote in a series of journal entries in Jon Krakauer 's ' Where Men Win Glory : The Odyssey of Pat Tillman , " a new book about the tragic friendly fire death of the former NFL star who left a lucrative football career behind after 9/11 to serve in the military .
" This mission will be a P.O.W. rescue , a woman named Jessica Lynch .
As awful as I feel for the fear she must face , and admire the courage I 'm sure she 's showing , I do believe this to be a big Public Relations stunt .
Do not mistake me , I wish everyone in trouble to be rescued , but sending this many folks for a single low ranking soldier screams of media blitz . "
Lynch had been falsely portrayed by Pentagon officials as a heroic soldier who went down firing her rifle at her Iraqi captors , when in truth she later testified that she never fired a shot and was captured after her vehicle crashed .
Watch the story tonight on " Nightline " at 11:35 p.m. ET and watch best - selling author Jon Krakauer 's first live interview about his new book " Where Men Win Glory : The Odyssey of Pat Tillman " Monday on " Good Morning America . "
Just over a year later , many of the same Bush administration officials and military commanders would scheme to transform Tillman 's own death by friendly fire in Afghanistan into a similarly disingenuous tale of battlefield valor .
Tillman was one of the most potent and misused symbols of post - 9/11 patriotism in America .
As the most famous American soldier in the newly - launched War on Terror , Tillman had received a personal note of congratulations from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld after he enlisted .
The former Arizona Cardinals hitman was highly - suspicious of being used by his superiors to market a war about which he was openly ambivalent , according to Krakauer 's book .
When the Army asked Tillman to do media interviews , he refused .
And soon after arriving in Iraq as an Army Ranger , he shared his wariness with a friend .
" When we were in Baghdad , our cots were next to each other , " Spc. Jade Lane told Krakauer .
" Pat and I used to talk at night before we 'd rack out .
I do n't know how the conversation got brought up , but one night he said that he was afraid that if something happened to him , they would parade him through the streets .
And those were his exact words : ' I do n't want them to parade me through the streets . '
It just burned into my brain , him saying that . "
Under the ' special instructions ' section of a standard Army form , Tillman had scrawled in block letters : " I do not want the military having any direct involvement in my funeral . "
Krakauer supplemented months of frontline reporting from Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and 2007 and scores of military documents with the exclusive access to Tillman 's personal journals and interviews with Tillman 's family , teammates and coaches , fellow soldiers and even neighbors on the block where his mother lived .
Woven through undulating tales of struggle , both global and personal , that crisscross lives and borders and history , is a sweet love story between a young athlete and his wife Marie , who he'd known since the age of four .
Six investigations and several congressional hearings would follow Tillman 's tragic death .
While some of the Rangers in the firefight were reprimanded and bumped back to the regular Army , no one was ultimately held responsible .
The official misrepresentations in both the Lynch rescue and the Tillman friendly fire death came to represent some of the worst aspects of a highly controversial war in Iraq .
It would be several years before both Lynch and Tillman 's families would find voice , together , at a hearing on Capitol Hill called ' Misleading Information From the Battlefield . "
Pat Tillman 's Brother and Fellow Ranger Not Told of Friendly Fire
" The handling of the situation after the [ Tillman ] firefight was described as ' missteps , inaccuracies and errors in judgment which created the perception of concealment , ' " Tillman 's brother and fellow Ranger Kevin Tillman testified before Congress in April 2007 , with Jessica Lynch sitting nearby .
" Writing a Silver Star award before a single eyewitness account is taken is not a misstep , '' Kevin Tillman said .
" Falsifying soldier witness statements for a Silver Star is not a misstep .
These are intentional falsehoods that meet the legal definition for fraud .
" Delivering false information at a nationally televised memorial service is not an error in judgement .
Discarding an investigation [ the first one ] that does not fit a preordained conclusion is not an error in judgement .
This is not the perception of concealment , '' Tillman 's brother said .
" This is concealment . ''
Late in the afternoon on April 22 , 2004 , the Tillman brothers were part of a convoy of Army Rangers in eastern Afghanistan 's Khost Province , one of the most dangerous regions in the fractious country .
The platoon had been stopped for six hours while the platoon 's lieutenant argued with superiors back at headquarters about a disabled Humvee .
Regulations prohibited the men from stripping the Humvee for parts and detonating it and no helicopter was available to airlift it out , they were told .
The platoon was ordered to tow the wreck to a paved road on the far side of a mountain summit .
But they were also under orders to have " boots on the ground " in a nearby town to complete the day 's mission , scouring the small village for arms and insurgents .
It was , Krakauer says , the most ordinary of missions , one of dozens of sweeps they do each week .
Despite vigorous objections from the Ranger commander on the ground , who argued that splitting the platoon would put both groups in danger , the platoon was divided .
The first half of the group , dubbed Serial One , headed through a narrow canyon toward the village of Mana .
Pat Tillman was in Serial One .
The other half of the platoon , Serial Two , took a different route toward a mountain pass .
Tillman 's brother , Kevin , was in Serial Two .
But Serial
Two 's route appeared impassable , Krakauer reports , so they retraced their steps and followed the same route Serial One had taken -- through a dangerously narrow canyon .
Jon Krakauer 's Book Describes Tillman 's Last Moments
Krakauer describes Pat Tillman and the first convoy 's journey through the canyon .
" For the next twenty minutes the convoy crept through the claustrophobic rift , forced by the severity of the terrain to move at an excrutiatingly slow pace , '' he writes .
" The slot was so tight that the Humvees ' fenders scraped against its sheer walls .
The Rangers remained twitchy and anxious , expecting to be attacked from the high ground at any moment . "
According to Pvt. Bryan O'Neal , " ' The canyon was very rough , there were large boulders everywhere , and the walls were at least 100 feet high on each side .
I actually had to lay on top of the vehicle to be able to pull security . '
The cliffs rose so precipitously that O'Neal had to lie on his back in order to scan the canyon 's ledges for Taliban through the scope of his M4 carbine . "
O'Neal and the other Serial One soldiers made it safely through the canyon , but drew enemy fire from across a ridge as they emerged from the canyon .
Then , from behind them , gunfire erupted inside the canyon .
The Rangers in Serial
One looked back to see red tracer bullets blasting out of the passage , and scrambled to position themselves to provide cover fire for their embattled fellow soldiers .
Pat Tillman was ordered up a hilltop .
" Pat was like a freight train , '' Pvt. Josey Boatwright told Krakauer .
Boatwright said Tillman sprinted past him .
" Whoosh .
A pit bull straining against his leash .
He took off toward the high ground yelling , ' O' Neal !
On me !
O'Neal !
Stay on me ! ' "
" Wherever he went , I went , '' O'Neal said .
Tillman reached the crest first with O'Neal and an Afghan militia fighter Krakauer identifies as Sayed Farhad .
They scrambled a few feet down the lip of the canyon behind some boulders .
But just then , two vehicles came speeding out of the canyon and stopped about 90 yards beneath the boulders .
They looked up to see gunfire from across the ridge and then more coming from just above their position .
The soldiers mistook Farhad , an Afghan with an AK47 , for the Taliban and turned their guns on the small crop of boulders behind which Tillman and his fellow Rangers were wildly waving their arms .
Farhad was gunned down .
Pinned down by friendly fire behind thigh - high boulders , Tillman and O'Neal began to wave frantically , seemingly to no avail .
Jon Krakauer 's Book Describes Tillman 's Last Moments
O'Neal said he noticed that Tillman 's voice suddenly took on a distinctly different tone --
Pat had a " cry in his call , " is how O'Neal described it -- and O'Neal assumed Tillman had been hit , according to the book .
Tillman , it turned out , had taken one or more shots to the chest plate of his body armor -- sharp blows that would have felt like a jackhammer hitting his sternum .
Astounded that his fellow Rangers would act so recklessly , he began hollering at the top of his lungs , " What are you shooting at ?!
I 'm Pat Tillman !
I 'm Pat ( expletive ) Tillman ! "
Moments later , Tillman 's voice was silenced as several rounds hit him in the face , killing him instantly .
None of the Rangers in the firefight that day conveyed the circumstances of Pat 's death to his brother Kevin , though many , and eventually all of them , would learn what happened .
Nor did any of the commanders on up the line to the Pentagon and the White House .
Soon after his death , Tillman 's Ranger superiors ordered that his clothes be burned , a clear violation of protocol , according to the book .
It was n't until days later , when Kevin Tillman , back in the U.S. for his brother 's funeral , was on the verge of finding out the truth that White House and Pentagon officials finally relented and acknowledged the strong probability of a friendly fire death .
News of their son's death hit Tillman 's divorced parents hard , a relative , Alex Garwood , told Krakauer .
" When Mr. Tillman walked in , he and [ ex - wife ] Dannie hugged across the table .
He kind of pulled her across into a desperate embrace , '' Garwood said .
" The [ notifying ] sergeant and I went outside to let them be alone .
As we stood there , we could hear them wailing -- these primal kinds of screams . "
The death by friendly fire of the nation 's most famous soldier came at a bad time for the White House and the Pentagon .
In the weeks prior to Tillman 's shooting , American civilian contractors were killed in Falujah , their bodies burned , dragged through the streets and hung from a bridge .
An offensive into the city ended in stalemate with 27 Americans killed and 90 wounded ..
The torture photos from the Abu Ghraib prison were circulating among official sources and about to burst into TV newscast and newspaper headllines .
The 2004 presidential election was less than six months away .
The result was a rapid deployment of the Pentagon 's public relations machine .
" The moment the White House learned of Tillman 's death , the president 's staff went into overdrive , " Krakauer reports .
" On April 23 , the day after Tillman perished , approximately 200 e-mails discussing the situations were transmitted or received by White House officials , including staffers from Bush 's re-election campaign , who suggested to the president that it would be advantageous for him to respond to Tillman 's death as quickly as possible , " he writes .
" Jeanie Mamo -- Bush 's director of media affairs -- sent an e-mail to Lawrence Di Rita , Rumsfeld 's press secretary , asking for details about the tragedy so she could use them in a White House press release .
" By 11:40 a.m , a statement about Tillman was drafted and forwarded to press secretary Scott McClellan and communications director Dan Bartlett , who immediately approved the statement on behalf of President Bush and then disseminated it to the public , even though doing so violated the ' Military Peace of Mind Act ' -- a policy signed by the president just five months earlier which was intended to give families of war casualties twenty - four hours to grieve privately before any public announcement was made about the victim . "
Bartlett later said he violated the law to sate the " overwhelming " interest from the media .
Pat Tillman Rejected Lucrative Chance to Leave Army Early
A Silver Star citation was initiated by the Second Ranger Battalion within hours of Tillman 's death .
The two witnesses were listed as O'Neal and Sgt. Mel Ward .
O'Neal , Krakauer writes , later " testified that he was put in front of a computer and told to type up a statement , which he did , but after he wrote it , his words were embellished so egregiously that he never signed it . "
On April 29 , a week after Tillman 's death , the acting secretary of the Army signed the commendation .
On April 30 , a press release was issued , heralding Tillman for " his selfless actions after his Ranger element was ambushed by anti-coalition insurgents . "
" Where Men Win Glory " chronicles Tillman 's remarkable rise through the NFL through the late 1990s , to perhaps the pinnacle -- when he was named to Sports Illustrated 's All Pro Team in 2000 .
It also shows Tillman 's sense of honor and loyalty .
Krakauer recounts an amusing conversation between Tillman and his agent , Frank Bauer , about a lucrative offer from the St. Louis Rams that came in at the end of the 2000 season .
" ' Listen to me , '' Bauer said he told Tillman .
" The Rams really want you and I do n't see Arizona matching their offer .
I 'm going to fax the Rams ' offer sheet to you .
You have to sign it . "
But Tillman refused , calling back a couple days later to tell his agent , " Look , Frank , the Cardinals drafted me in the seventh round .
They believed in me .
I love the coaches here .
I can't bring myself to take the offer from the Rams .
... I 've made my decision .
I 'm going to stay with the Cardinals . "
" In twenty - seven years , '' Bauer says in the book , " I 've never had a player turn down that big of a package in the National Football League .
I 've had players take twenty grand less per year to stay at clubs they really want to play for , but turning down nine - and - a - half million ?
That 's unheard of .
You just do n't see loyalty like that in sports today . "
After 9/11 , Tillman , whose family has a long history of military service , began soul - searching .
" We have a great life , '' he wrote of he and his wife Marie , " with nothing to look forward to but more of the same .
Sports embodied many of the qualities that I deem meaningful : courage , toughness , strength , etc , while at the same time , the attention I receive reinforces its seeming importance .
...
" However , in the last few years , and especially after recent events , I 'm no longer satisfied with the path I 've been following -- it 's no longer important . "
By the spring of 2002 , he 'd decided to join the Army with his brother Kevin .
That sense of loyalty and commitment surfaced again in December 2003 .
After Tillman had served a tour in Iraq , the general manager of the Seattle Seahawks contacted Tillman 's football agent and offered the young soldier another NFL contract .
The Seahawks had done some research and determined that Tillman could be released from the remainder of his Army contract because he had served in a war zone .
Again , Tillman refused .
" I enlisted for three years , '' he told Bauer , according to the book .
" I owe them three years .
I 'm not going back on my word .
I 'm going to stay in the Army . ''
Tillman 's sacrifice has been disheartening for many reasons , one of them militarily .
Late last year , Krakauer concluded , " In April 2004 , Pat Tillman was deployed to Afghanistan as part of a campaign to ... bring Khost Province under control of the elected government of President Hamid Karzai .
Villagers throughout the area defiantly fly the white flag of the Taliban from their homes .
Less than a mile from the eastern end of Tillman Pass ( the name U.S. soldiers spontaneously bestowed upon the canyon where Pat was killed ) , a loudspeaker at a bustling madrassa blares anti-American messages into the surrounding community while young boys are instructed in the principles of jihad within the school 's walls ... "
I bang on a bit about human over - population and how it drives biodiversity extinctions .
Yet , it is n’t always hordes of hungry humans descending on the hapless species of this planet – Australia is a big place , but has few people ( just over 20 million ) , yet it has one of the higher extinction rates in the world .
Yes , most of the country is covered in some fairly hard - core desert and most people live in or near the areas containing the most species , but we have an appalling extinction record all the same .
A paper that came out recently in Conservation Biology and was covered a little in the media last week gives some telling figures for the Oceania region , and more importantly , explains that we have more than enough information now to implement sound , evidence - based policy to right the wrongs of the past and the present .
Using IUCN Red List data , Michael Kingsford and colleagues ( paper entitled Major conservation policy issues for biodiversity in Oceania ) , showed that of the 370 assessed species in Australia , 80 % of the threatened ones are listed because of habitat loss , 40 % from invasive species and 30 % from pollution .
As we know well , it ’s mainly habitat loss we have to control if we want to change things around for the better ( see previous relevant posts here , here & here ) .
Kingsford and colleagues proceed to give a good set of policy recommendations for each of the drivers identified :
Habitat loss and degradation
Implement legislation , education , and community outreach to stop or reduce land clearing , mining , and unsustainable logging through education , incentives , and compensation for landowners that will encourage private conservation
Establish new protected areas for habitats that are absent or poorly represented
In threatened ecosystems ( e.g. , wetlands ) , establish large - scale restoration projects with local communities that incorporate conservation and connectivity
Establish transparent and evidence - based state of environment reporting on biodiversity and manage threats within and outside protected areas .
Protect free - flowing river systems ( largely unregulated by dams , levees , and diversions ) within the framework of the entire river basin and increase environmental flows on regulated rivers
Invasive species
Avoid deliberate introduction of exotic species , unless suitable analyses of benefits outweigh risk - weighted costs
Implement control of invasive species by assessing effectiveness of control programs and determining invasion potential
Establish regulations and enforcement for exchange or treatment of ocean ballast and regularly implement antifouling procedures
Climate change
Reduce global greenhouse gas emissions
Identify , assess , and protect important climate refugia
Ameliorate the impacts of climate change through strategic management of other threatening processes
Develop strategic plans for priority translocations and implement when needed
Overexploitation
Implement restrictions on harvest of overexploited species to maintain sustainability
Implement an ecosystem - based approach for fisheries , based on scientific data , that includes zoning the ocean ; banning destructive fishing ; adopting precautionary fishing principles that include size limits , quotas , and regulation with sufficient resources based on scientific assessments of stocks and ; reducing bycatch through regulation and education
Implement international mechanisms to increase sustainability of fisheries by supporting international treaties for fisheries protection in the high seas ; avoiding perverse subsidies and improve labelling of sustainable fisheries ; and licensing exports of aquarium fish
Control unsustainable illegal logging and wildlife harvesting through local incentives and cessation of international trade
Pollution
Decrease pollution through incentives and education ; reduce and improve treatment of domestic , industrial , and agriculture waste ; and rehabilitate polluted areas
Strengthen government regulations to stop generation of toxic material from mining efforts that affects freshwater and marine environments
Establish legislation and regulations and financial bonds ( international ) to reinforce polluter - pays principles
Establish regulations , education programs , clean ups , labelling , and use of biodegradable packaging to reduce discarded fishing gear and plastics
Disease
Establish early - detection programs for pathological diseases and biosecurity controls to reduce translocation
Identify causes , risk - assessment methods , and preventative methods for diseases
Establish remote communities of organisms ( captive ) not exposed to disease in severe outbreaks
Implementation
Establish regional population policies based on ecologically sustainable human population levels and consumption
Ensure that all developments affecting the environment are adequately analysed for impacts over the long term
Promote economic and societal benefits from conservation through education
Determine biodiversity status and trends with indicators that diagnose and manage declines
Invest in taxonomic understanding and provision of resources ( scientific and conservation ) to increase capacity for conservation
Increase the capacity of government conservation agencies
Focus efforts of nongovernmental organisations on small island states on building indigenous capacity for conservation
Base conservation on risk assessment and decision support
Establish the effectiveness of conservation instruments ( national and international ) and their implementation
A very good set of recommendations that I hope we can continue to develop within our governments .

[ view :float_right_thumb==1166 ]ST. LOUIS , Oct. 12 , 2009 -- Anna Zatonskih clinched her second consecutive U.S. Women 's Chess championship by defeating Sabina Foisor in round eight of the 2009 event at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis .
With one round remaining , she has acquired a near - perfect 7.5 out of 8 points and will win the record $ 15,000 first prize .
No other woman has more than 5.5 points so Tuesday 's final round will be for posterity , not place .
Zatonskih , of Long Island , N.Y. , said she will still try hard .
" It does n't feel right to win the championship and lose the last round , " she said .
Zatonskih also earned an automatic qualification to the 2010 U.S. Women 's Chess Championship .
She said she was nervous today for the first time all tournament , knowing that single bad move and " I could easily spoil everything . "
Zatonskih , who has won all of her games with the black pieces , entered a slightly better ending against Foisor .
The defending championship pressed ahead and found a stunning coup de grace -- a sacrifice of her bishop , her last major piece , that resembled a famous game played by Grandmaster Alexei Shirov .
Jettisoning the bishop created an unstoppable armada of pawns that Foisor , of Baltimore , Md. , could not slow down .
The victory comes combined with a loss by Zatonskih 's closest competitor .
For most of the tournament , Camilla Baginskaite trailed the leader by one point , but she suffered her first loss today at the hands of the resurgent Irina Krush .
Krush , of Brooklyn , N.Y. , who began with only one win and three draws in her first five games , has won three in a row to pull into a tie with Baginskaite for second place .
[ view:float_left_thumb==1171 ]
Baginskaite , of Sioux Falls , S.D. , and Krush have a lot to play for in the final round .
Not only is there a lot of prize money still at stake ( $ 12,000 is the second prize ) , but the top two finishers in the tournament will qualify for the next Women 's World Championship , to be held in Istanbul , Turkey .
Zatonskih has already qualified , but if two or more women are tied for second after tomorrow 's round nine , a fast - paced tiebreaker will be played to decide who is awarded the second spot in the championship .
One woman 's world championship qualification hopes all but ended in round eight when Alisa Melekhina , 18 , of Philadelphia , Pa. , lost her second game in three rounds .
She had been undefeated through the first five rounds , despite playing many players who are vastly more experienced .
Today she lost to Iryna Zenyuk , of Pittsburgh , Pa. , who said she received encouragement from friends in her native Ukraine .
They have been staying up until 5 a.m. local time to follow her matches online .
[ view : float_right_thumb==1173 ]
" Yesterday I was so down , " Zenyuk said .
" People I ( train ) with said , ' You have to come back , you have to fight . ' "
Zenyuk declined to say who her supporters were , leading some to believe she has some very strong chess players on her support team .
Also rebounding today was 19 - year - old Yun Fan , of Greencastle , Ind .
She played several sacrifices against third - seeded Rusudan Goletiani , including both of her knights and both of her rooks .
Still in college , Fan said she was proud of the game , but did not expect her non-chess playing professors to understand the beauty of her game .
After beginning the tournament will several losses , Fan has won two games out of her last three .
Goletiani , of Hartsdale , N.Y. , has underperformed all event and said she is just looking to get the tournament over with .
Tatev Abrahamyan , of Glendale , Calif. , also showed resiliency in round eight .
She won her second game in a row despite a rough beginning to the tournament .
Abrahamyan 's pieces were bottled up most of the game but she opened a lane and her queen , bishop and rook came flooding in to suddenly checkmate Battsetseg Tsagaan , of Ellicott City , Md .

This article was first published in August 2005 .
This is an apocryphal story .
During Bill Clinton 's first presidential campaign , he was doing an interview with supposed intellectual , Tabitha Soren of MTV .
Soren asked him if there was anything he dreamt of doing .
Clinton replied that he had always wanted to play sax with Thelonious Monk .
Soren screwed on her best smart - girl face and replied , " And who was the loneliest monk ?
" At the current rate of production , scientists believe that the current U.S. supply of morons will increase despite the proliferation of information technologies .
This is not including the number of dolts , dinks , dumbasses , gits , nitwits , and just plain fools out there .
Concurrently , the production of geniuses in this country has remained fairly stagnate since the introduction of MTV in the early eighties ( I was born in 1967 , before the proliferation of cable TV ) .
What does this mean to you , the Average American ?
It means that every day , the Moron Majority causes the greatest figures in jazz history like Thelonious Monk to become just a bit more obscure while elevating their own empty - headed ilk like pop stars and professional wrestlers to fleeting fifteen minute blocks of godlike status .
Did I sound a little harsh there ?
I apologize .
As I write this , Lent has only just ended and it will take a while for enough alcohol to get into my system to make me a decent human being again .
So let 's enjoy this moment while it lasts .
Thelonious Sphere Monk ( Sphere the monk , sphoil the thelonious , I always say* ) was born in Rocky Mount , North Carolina , on October 10 , 1917 .
Moving to New York at the age of five , and finding not many career opportunities for a five year - old named Thelonious , he decided to become an eccentric genius whose demanding and completely unique compositions remain to this day a standard by which the very best of jazz can be measured .
Kids had goals back then , in the days before Ritalin - soaked theories of progressive education .
Anyway .
Monk began taking piano lessons around the age of 12 , and within a couple of years was playing rent parties in Harlem and accompanying his mother 's singing at church .
At the age of 13 , Monk entered and won the weekly amateur show at the Apollo so often that he was eventually barred from competing .
By the age of 19 , he was the house pianist at Minton 's Playhouse ( and the house dressing was a roasted garlic vinaigrette .
This may or may not come into play later on , but I 'd rather err to the side of caution ) , along withand .
Together , working mostly at nights with bits of leftover stuff they found lying around , they invented a style of jazz known to this day as BeBop .
In the forties , New York was lousy with jazz , mostly of the big band variety .
Every streetcorner featured its own band , and anyone who could play an instrument was expected to play in a group much like today 's equivalent of every high school guitarist who can play Enter Sandman being expected to join a band .
This led not only to an excess of musicians , but an absolute glut of homogenous middle - of - the - road big band music .
Imagine a time where every single club features a high school metal band playing Crazy Train .
After hours at many clubs , musicians would gather for loose jam sessions .
Minton 's was no different .
But Gillespie , Parker and Monk grew frustrated with the mediocre talent dragging down the level of their get - togethers .
They began adding unusual chords and breakneck changes , weeding out all but the heartiest of the bunch .
At first just trying to leave their lesser brethren behind , they soon found their inventions gaining ground and becoming an entirely new form of jazz .
Gillespie and Parker are widely credited as the innovators of BeBop , with Monk ( remember him , the subject of the article ? ) considered " the midwife of BeBop ; " he was present at the birth , but the baby does n't look anything like him .
Such as that is .
In 1951 , Monk was falsely imprisoned ( it was a fake prison , made of Styrofoam bricks and licorice bars ) for narcotics possession , after being Busted while Hanging Out with a Brother who was Holding and refusing to Rat Out or Drop the Dime on the Dude .
And this abbreviated tribute to George Ade was made possible by the President 's Council on Obscure Humorists and the International Brotherhood of Wiseacres and Smartasses , Local 1264 .
Denied his cabaret card which deprived Monk of his ability to perform in New York nightclubs for six years , he dedicated himself to the perfection of his music .
It was during this time that his unique compositional style began to coalesce into the definitive sound that is today indelibly associated with him .
Emerging from his exile in 1957 to form a group with , Shadow Wilson , and ( whose brand of cookware , Wllburware , was sold at informal houseparties in the fifties , inspiring another burgeoning entrepreneur , Earl Tupper ) , Monk began the first of several stretches at the famed Five Spot Cafe© .
It was during the Sixties that Monk began to merit serious notice both here and abroad .
Tours of Europe and Asia merited him widespread critical notice and international acclaim , while a tour of Knott 's Berry Farm merited him a souvenir T - shirt and a corn dog .
Monk 's intricate arrangements and peculiar splay - fingered piano style , not to mention his eccentric personality and often puzzling behavior , attracted popular attention beyond strictly jazz - oriented circles .
Speaking of which .
Monk remains to this day perhaps the most unusual figure in the history of jazz , with the possible exception of myself .
He was introverted to the point of sometimes communicating only with semaphore flags , given to wearing odd hats and sometimes getting up in the middle of solos to dance as though in a state of ecstasy .
It has been said of Monk ( by me , just now ) that his stature among the recognized giants of jazz would have been even greater had he possessed a more accessible personality .
However .
It may also be said of Monk ( also by me , more recently ) that it was as much his extremely demanding compositions and unconventional musical ideas , which were as formidable to listen to as they were to play , as it was his personality that contributed to his strangely underrated status among his contemporaries .
Monk predated the Free School 's blissful disregard for the listener , not caring if his sometimes jangling , discordant notes and unpredictable chord changes did n't exactly lay easy on the ear .
Moreso than any artist before him , Monk did n't aim to accommodate popular sensibilities .
Nor was he merely a contrarian , doing the unexpected simply because it was unexpected .
Monk was at all times true to his internal voice , and expanded the acceptable in modern music as much as Debussy 's use of the dissonant seventh expanded the acceptable during the Romantic period .
And I 'll fight any man who says different .
By the early seventies Monk was among the elder statesmen of jazz , a role ill - suited to his increasingly reclusive personality .
Touring with the Giants of Jazz ( average height , 6 ' 7 " ) from 1971 - 72 , he continued infrequent appearances until the mid-seventies .
Finally falling into complete seclusion as a result of illness , both physical and mental , Monk finally passed away in 1982 at the home of jazz benefactress the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter ( which may well be one of the most fun - to - say names I have ever encountered in my extensive studies of jazz , and one that brings a swift end to even the most evenly - matched Scrabble contest ) .
Interestingly enough , Charlie Parker also passed away at the residence of Baroness de Koenigswarter .
In fact , a conspicuous number of the greats of jazz died before the Baroness passed away in 1990 .
Coincidence ?
I will leave that to posterity to decide .
And to the Weehawken , New Jersey , police , who are still actively investigating .
Ultimately , the legacy of Thelonious Monk is one of a genius incongruent with his age .
Like television pioneer Ernie Kovacs , who was 60 years ahead of his time 50 years ago , we may still not have fully come to appreciate the body of work Monk left behind .
In an age when our music is mostly either deliberately obtuse beyond reason or accessible to the point of pandering , coming to terms with music that will not compromise or explain itself and yet has no interest in hollow revolution for revolution 's sake is still just as challenging as it was in Monk 's day .
And so is the average redhead .
But listen to Bemsha Swing , then take a look at Nicole Kidman , and I think you 'll agree that they 're both worth the effort .
That pretty much does it for this month , kids .
Till next month , exit to your right and enjoy the rest of AAJ .
Google today announced that it has started to collect imagery in South Africa for the Street View feature in Google Maps .

Sarah Palin wanted to adopt her grandchild so people would not know her 17 - year - old daughter was pregnant , the father of the child has said .
In an interview with Vanity Fair , Levi Johnston said former Republican vice - presidential candidate Palin had a plan to deal with her daughter Bristol 's pregnancy .
( Clockwise from left ) Sarah Palin ; daughter Bristol and son Tripp ; Levi Johnston .
" Sarah kept mentioning this plan .
She was nagging — she would n't give it up .
She would say , ' So , are you gonna let me adopt him ? '
We both kept telling her we were definitely not going to let her adopt the baby .
I think Sarah wanted to make Bristol look good , and she did n't want people to know that her 17 - year - old daughter was going to have a kid , " Mr Johnston told the magazine for its October edition .
Excerpts of the interview were posted on the magazine 's website on Wednesday .
Meghan Stapleton , Mrs Palin 's spokeswoman , did not immediately respond to request for comment , but has previously discounted Mr Johnston 's allegations .
Mrs Palin has been keeping a low profile since she resigned on July 26 with more than a year left in her first term .

July 27 , 2009  --
It has been 72 years since famed aviator Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared while attempting to fly around the world .
But the mystery remains unsolved : Nobody knows exactly what happened to Earhart or her plane .
Now researchers at the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery , or Tighar , say they are on the verge of recovering DNA evidence that would demonstrate Earhart had been stranded on Nikumaroro Island ( formerly known as Gardner Island ) before finally perishing there .
During May and June of next year , Tighar will launch a new $ 500,000 expedition , continuing the archaeological work it has been doing on the island since 2001 .
" We think we will be able to come back with DNA , " said Tighar 's Executive Director Ric Gillespie , who is working with two DNA labs in Ontario , Canada , Genesis Genomics and Molecular World .
" We were out there in 2007 under the impression that in order to extract DNA we would need to find a piece of a human , and we did n't find anything like that .
But we did find what 's best described as personal effects of the castaway that died there . "
Check out this interactive to find out more about 's 2007 expedition .
During the 2007 trip , Gillespie and his crew uncovered early 20th - century makeup and two pieces of broken glass that match a 1930s compact mirror , among other artifacts .
DNA can be extracted from such remnants as long as those artifacts are n't contaminated during the collection process .
Unfortunately , in 2007 , they were .
Armed with a new collection protocol , Gillespie and his team will return to the site to seek out new items during their May 2010 excursion .
Earlier this year a woman directly related to Earhart , who wishes to remain anonymous , agreed to provide Gillespie 's group with a reference sample of mitochondrial DNA .
This type of genetic material differs from nuclear DNA in many ways , primarily because it 's passed down the female line .
Mitochondrial DNA , also referred to as mtDNA , is often used in forensics research .
Because mtDNA is found in the cell 's mitochondria , rather than the chromosomes of the cell 's fragile nucleus , it is n't as quick to break down even when subject to difficult environmental conditions .
How Did Amelia Earhart Die ?
Gillespie said Nikumaroro Island , located about 1,800 miles south of Hawaii , was uninhabited until 1938 -- one year after Earhart disappeared .
At that time the island was under British colonial rule , so the first inhabitants were an eight - man team instructed to start clearing land for a village and coconut plantation .
Then , two years later , in 1940 , the island 's administrator found bones , and a campsite .
" We do n't know what happened to those bones , " Gillespie said , explaining that the skeleton was sent to Fiji and the British lost track of it in the summer of 1941 .
The most recent analysis of the bone measurements indicates they were those of a white female of northern European descent .
Ever since a drought forced out the Nikumaroro settlers in 1963 , nobody else has lived on the 2.5 - mile - long island .
" We have only excavated 5 percent of the campsite .
There 's every reason to think there 's more stuff out there , " Gillespie said .
But not everyone shares Gillespie 's theory .
Elgen Long , 82 , author of " Amelia Earhart : The Mystery Solved , " adamantly believes that Earhart crashed in the Pacific Ocean after running out of fuel .
One of the best - known Earhart historians , Long served as a consultant for the upcoming movie " Amelia " starring Hilary Swank , scheduled for release in October .

Here to watch the movie trailer .
Differing Theories
" Ric Gillespie and the Tighar group have done a tremendous amount of research over many years , and have added much information to the knowledge of Earhart 's last flight , " Long wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
" However , when world - recognized experts in aircraft performance ( Dr. F.E.C. Culick , California Institute of Technology ) , and radio propagation experts ( Thomas Vinson , Rod Blocksome and radio engineers at Collins Radio , Cedar Rapids , Iowa ) analyzed the data they came to different conclusions than Tighar . "
Long believes Earhart ran out of fuel shortly after 2013 GMT , July 2 , 1937 .
" She was then forced to ditch her plane into the ocean somewhere near Howland Island , " he said .
" No message or signals of any kind were ever verified as having really come from Earhart 's plane after her last and only partly finished message to the Coast Guard Cutter Itasca at 2013 GMT . "
To that , Gillespie said :
That 's what I used to think .
" What Elgen needs to explain is , who sent all those radio distress calls in the days following Earhart 's disappearance ?
He 'll say that the Coast Guard later proclaimed them to all be hoaxes and misunderstandings .
That is true .
It is also true that the Coast Guard had no basis for saying that , " Gillespie said .
Was Earhart Trasmitting Calls from Land ?
Gillespie carefully studied the nearly 200 possible radio messages that could have been from Earhart .
Many of them were hoaxes , but Gillespie believes some of the calls , made days after she first disappeared , are credible .
" Either Earhart was on land somewhere south of Howard Island and North of Samoa or there was a hoaxer in that region who had the capability of sending signals on Earhart 's frequency and could mimic Earhart 's voice and information about Earhart that only Earhart and her closest associates could have known .
These calls go on for days .
They do n't occur randomly over time , they occur at night and also at times when tide is low at the island where we think she landed . "
So the debate continues , and so does the search for remnants of Earhart 's plane .
Ever since the U.S. government failed to find " Lady Lindy , " as Earhart was known , during its $ 4 million exhaustive air and sea search , researchers have tried to piece the puzzle together .
Gillespie and his crew have searched the waters of the Pacific many times before , but this time they 'll go much deeper , near a reef where they believe her plane crashed .
His team 's goal is to explore 1,000 feet beneath the ocean 's surface .
" This location is right where the Navy thought she was when they were doing the search " at the time of her disappearance , he said .
The Tighar crew will include several volunteers , many of whom have gone on previous expeditions , and who have advanced degrees in the sciences .
" The volunteers are really bright people who are just fascinated by this mystery , and we are all motivated by the same thing ... and it is not to honor the memory of Amelia Earhart , " said Gillespie , who has led nine expeditions searching for evidence of Earhart 's demise over the past 20 years .
" We are investigation junkies .
We love the thrill of the search and scientific process . "

Public Fascination With Earhart Continues
As Earhart fans well know , it is n't just her record - breaking flights that captured the world 's attention .
Earhart was also an editor for Cosmopolitan magazine and traveled and lectured frequently .
' Time Is on Our Side '
Long and his wife spent years documenting Earhart 's life .
" Her audiences were maybe 95 percent women , " said Long .
" Her message resonated with women at that time -- what she was trying to prove was that women could do anything men could do .
So she picked out the most manly things she could think of doing and did them as well as the men or sometimes better . "
According to the Amelia Earhart Foundation , young Earhart " climbed trees , ' belly - slammed ' her sled to start it downhill and hunted rats with a .22 rifle .
She also kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male - oriented fields , including film direction and production , law , advertising , management and mechanical engineering . "
Earhart tributes are peppered across the United States : streets , a mountain and even a forest are named after her .
And female pilots still look to her as a source of inspiration , especially those who enter the Air Race Classic every year .
Hope still remains that one day , her Lockheed A - 10E Electra will be recovered .
" The technology is allowing us to search much better , cheaper and more thoroughly underwater , " Long said .
" Time is one our side and technology is on our side .
It 'll be found . "
Throughout his life , Charles Darwin surrounded himself with flowers .
When he was 10 , he wrote down each time a peony bloomed in his father ’s garden .
When he bought a house to raise his own family , he turned the grounds into a botanical field station where he experimented on flowers until his death .
But despite his intimate familiarity with flowers , Darwin once wrote that their evolution was “ an abominable mystery . ”
Darwin could see for himself how successful flowering plants had become .
They make up the majority of living plant species , and they dominate many of the world ’s ecosystems , from rain forests to grasslands .
They also dominate our farms .
Out of flowers come most of the calories humans consume , in the form of foods like corn , rice and wheat .
Flowers are also impressive in their sheer diversity of forms and colors , from lush , full - bodied roses to spiderlike orchids to calla lilies shaped like urns .
The fossil record , however , offered Darwin little enlightenment about the early evolution of flowers .
At the time , the oldest fossils of flowering plants came from rocks that had formed from 100 million to 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous period .
Paleontologists found a diversity of forms , not a few primitive forerunners .
Long after Darwin ’s death in 1882 , the history of flowers continued to vex scientists .
But talk to experts today , and there is a note of guarded optimism .
“ There ’s an energy that I have n’t seen in my lifetime , ” said William Friedman , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
A Letter From M.I.T .
MIT certainly has a reputation to be proud of , but its admissions department went a little over - board , I think .
The first letter is an honest - to - goodness mailing from MIT , the second is one prospective student 's reply :
Joe " Girls Gone Wild Dirtbag " Francis has a new tactic for resolving the lawsuits against him : he pretends not to understand common English words while farting loudly and attempting to video - record female court officials .

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Barack Obama , in his weekly radio address Saturday , reinforced pressure on Iran to cooperate with the international community and come clean about its nuclear proliferation efforts .
Mr. Obama , ahead of a key meeting with the Middle Eastern country next week , said Iran " must now cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and take action to demonstrate its peaceful intentions . "

For more than three months , Mr. Baucus has been negotiating with three Republican senators , and some of their ideas are incorporated in his bill .
He predicted that some Republicans and most Democrats would eventually support a version of his bill .
Senator Olympia J. Snowe , Republican of Maine and one of the senators Mr. Baucus has been negotiating with , said she was not ready to endorse the plan , but would continue working with Mr. Baucus with the hope of getting a deal .
The need for action is urgent , Mr. Baucus said , declaring : “ Our health care system is simply unsustainable .
It ’s breaking the bank for everyone , from families to businesses to governments . ”
Mr. Baucus ’s bill is the least expensive of five major health care bills moving through Congress .
The Congressional Budget Office said the expansion of coverage would cost $ 774 billion over 10 years , compared with price tags of more than $ 1 trillion for the other measures .
The budget office said the cost of Mr. Baucus ’s bill would be fully offset by new taxes and fees , along with savings squeezed from Medicare , so it could reduce the cumulative total of federal budget deficits by $ 49 billion over the next 10 years .
At the end of that period , it said , new revenues and savings would be growing faster than costs , so the bill could also help reduce deficits in the decade after 2019 .
Image Senators Kent Conrad , second from left , and Evan Bayh , second from right , discussed what Senator Max Baucus referred to as a good balanced bill .

Like the other bills , Mr. Baucus ’s proposal would require most Americans to have health insurance , with financial penalties for those who flout the requirement .
But his plan differs from the others in significant ways :
¶ Instead of creating a new government health plan , Mr. Baucus would set up nonprofit insurance cooperatives in every state .
The Congressional Budget Office said the co-ops “ seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country . ”
This finding provides ammunition to liberals who say the co-ops could not compete effectively with big insurance companies .
Police have praised the quick actions by neighbours of a rural Waikato property which left four alleged burglars with nowhere to hide today .
Police said a Whatawhata resident noticed a suspicious vehicle parked at a neighbour 's property about 3.15 pm and responded by parking his ute across the driveway .
When he went and looked inside the offending vehicle he noticed a firearm inside , which he took and threw into long grass before returning to his home to call police .
'' He and other neighbours then observed from a safe distance , '' said acting Waikato police communications manager Tony Sasso .
When police were called about 10 staff from Hamilton and Huntly responded , setting up cordons visible from the house and contained the scene while the armed offenders squad ( AOS ) were mobilised .
Before the AOS arrived , the group of four voluntarily walked out of the house , followed instructions and gave themselves up .
Three men aged 18 , 20 and 21 will appear in Hamilton District Court over the incident tomorrow , while a 14 - year - old will appear in the Youth Court .
Police said the firearm in the offending vehicle was from the property being targeted .
Sergeant Vic Snedden praised the actions of the locals responding to the incident and said they '' did everything absolutely right ' ' .

It has a familiar ring : “ Investigators are looking for about a dozen more people in connection with a wide - ranging terror investigation that has already netted arrests in Colorado and New York City , a source familiar with the investigation said Tuesday . ”
That ’s the lead sentence of a CNN “ breaking news ” report filed Tuesday about a frantic search for alleged terrorism plotters within the United States .
But a closer inspection of the story — and that of others in the past week — reveals that despite the hoopla , federal authorities have yet to charge the men they ’re accusing of a terror - related crime .
ADVERTISEMENT
In fact , they ’re only actually charged with lying to federal agents .
But you would n’t know that from reading the headlines .
Problematic in this and other recent reports is the use of anonymous law enforcement sources , who repeatedly hype alleged ties to al Qaeda , identify “ persons of interest , ” and detail dramatic but unspecified plots .
These sources , notes CBS News ’ Chief Legal Analyst and Legal Editor Andrew Cohen , began “ clicking off all of the elements of their perennial song - and - dance number in terror - plot cases ; this time from New York to Denver to Washington and back .
The prejudicial leaks from law enforcement ; the prompt ( and promptly repeated ) links to al Qaeda ; the dramatic headlines , the identification of a “ person of interest ; ” the assurances that no particular target had been specified ; the intercession of an overwhelmed defense attorney ; the denials , the meetings , the breakdown in talks , and , finally , the arrest ( late at night , but with the tipped - off news cameras hovering above and about ) . ”
“ We ’ve seen various iterations of the perp - walk parade hundreds of times before , in cases that merited the attention or not , and certainly dozens of times since Sept. 11 , 2001 , ” Cohen continues .
“ Often , way too often , the government has in the end been able or willing to prove far less than the initial ( and often hysterical and hysterically received ) allegations — distributed ( typically without challenge ) via cable television and the Internet — suggested .
For example , off the top of my head , I give you : Zacarious Moussaoui , who was not the ’ 20th hijacker , ’ Jose Padilla , who was not the ‘ dirty bomber ’ and John Walker Lindh , who was not the ‘ American Taliban . ' ”
Federal agents arrested three individuals over the weekend in connection with what officials described as a plot to bomb targets in the United States .
The three men — who are from Afghanistan — are Najibullah Zazi , his father Mohammed Wali Zazi and cleric Ahmad Wais Afzali .
ADVERTISEMENT
They ’ve been charged with lying to federal agents ; a judge set their bail at $ 50,000 .
Cohen says the story has echoes of previous hyped terror cases where little actually pans out .
“ We see only the old , familiar story ; a prosecution for the alleged cover - up but not the alleged crime , ” the court reporter remarks .
“ But about the heart of the matter we still know very little .
Are the Zazis really dangerous ?
If so , how dangerous are they ?
How strong is the evidence against them ?
What did they allegedly lie about and what did n’t they allegedly lie about ?
And how long is it going to take for us to know the rest of the story . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If , for example , the feds believe that Zazi , the younger , really did attend an Al Qaeda terror training camp why is he only charged with “ lying ” ?
If the feds really did find incriminating bomb - making plans on a laptop taken from Zazi ’s rental car then why no “ material support ” or conspiracy charge ?
If his fingerprints were on a “ black scale ” and batteries ( two items which are legal to possess ) what other physical evidence suggests a crime ?
“ Maybe both sides were plotting to inform on each other and the feds decided they could simply charge all of them with lying since neither version offered could both be true ?
Maybe neither version is true …
Of all the starts to all the terror cases in all the world since 9/11 the start to this terror case cries out more than most for a little more patience . ”

Cohen concludes : “ As Churchill might have said , we are not remotely close to the end of the beginning . ”
( Editor ’s Note : Raw Story apologizes to Andrew Cohen for misaddressing him in an earlier version , as he Tweeted . )
Today , Senator Mary Landrieu took the opportunity to blast the public option .
It ’s particularly egregious given her long history of living off the taxpayers .
Back in June , I wrote a post about Landrieu and her long history of taxpayer funded health insurance .
The citizens of Louisiana and federal taxpayers have underwritten Landrieu ’s health insurance for most of her adult life and , most likely , a good chunk of her childhood .
She does n’t know what it ’s like to fight an insurance company or to be without insurance .
I rarely ever do this , but I ’m reposting the earlier post in full because she is such a hypocrite .
Here it is :
I ’m intrigued by Senator Mary Landrieu ’s opposition to the public health insurance option .
It got me wondering how long she ’s had health insurance paid by the government .
Now , I know the public option is n’t the same as private health care paid for by the government .
But , her opposition to making health care more affordable and more available seems inconsistent with a life that ’s had health insurance paid for by taxpayers .
From various sources , including her own Senate website , I ’ve put together the timeline of Mary Landrieu .
She was born in 1955 .
Her dad , Moon , was in the Louisiana State Legislature from 1960 to 1966 , served on the New Orleans City Council from 1966 to 1970 and then was Mayor of New Orleans from 1970 to 1978 .
Then , he was the HUD Secretary from 1979 to 1981 .
Landrieu herself entered the Louisiana State Legislature in 1980 and served there until 1988 .
From there , she became the State Treasurer from 1988 til 1996 when she became a U.S. Senator .
That ’s quite a history of public service .
And , it ’s also quite a history of being a beneficiary of government - sponsored benefits .
Now , I do n’t know that Moon Landrieu got health care benefits for his family while he served as state rep. , city councilor and mayor .
But , I do know that right now , the Louisiana legislature provides health care to its members and their families : Legislative members are eligible to participate in health insurance and life insurance plans provided by the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits ( OGB . )
The state pays approximately 75 percent of the member ’s portion of the premium and approximately 50 percent of the premium for the member ’s dependents .
Legislators are eligible to keep their benefits when they leave office only if they have retired or meet the definition of retirement as provided by the OGB Rules .
The legislative Office of Human Resources offers members additional health benefits such as vision and dental coverage , however , the members themselves are responsible for payment of those premiums .
Maybe it was different back when Mary was growing up .
She should let us know .
I do know that as a federal employee , Senator Landrieu has lots of options for health care .
The Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) handles this for Landrieu , her colleagues and their staffs .
Funny thing , how someone who grew up in government and has been taken care of by government health care is so averse to giving other people a public option .
Mary Landrieu has lived a life with good benefits , maybe she does n’t get what it ’s like for many people .
See , taxpayers pay the bulk of Landrieu ’s health insurance — and probably have for most of her adult life .
She ’s been well taken care of .
Now , she is taking care of the insurance companies , not the taxpayers .
If you ’re calling Landrieu ’s office , ( 202)224-5824 , see if you can find out for sure how long she ’s benefited from health insurance paid with tax dollars .
If you ’re from Louisiana , you ’ve been paying for her family ’s health insurance for a long time .
Landrieu could n’t be a bigger hypocrite on this one .
Landrieu better vote for cloture on the final bill , which better include the public option .

Empire of Illusion : The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle
By Chris Hedges
Hardcover : 232 pages
Publisher : Nation Books ( 2009 )
ISBN : 9781568584379
If you ’re looking for one of those treacly Oprah books —
The Secret , and its variants — avoid this one .
Those books nourish like potato chips and leave most people more confused , more desperate , more thirsty for fantasies than before .
No amount of wishing , earnest yearning , visualizing and New Age mysticism is going to get us out of the morass we ’re in .
In Empire of Illusion , Chris Hedges takes a sober look down our hall of distorting mirrors .
The son of a minister , with a degree in theology from Harvard , a columnist for Truthdigger.com , Hedges has worked as a foreign correspondent in Central America , the Middle East , Africa and the Balkans .
His books include War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning and American Fascists .
He was part of the New York Times team that won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for the paper ’s coverage of global terrorism .
Here are some of the pertinent facts he contemplates :
The top 1 % of Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 90 % combined .
World - wide porn revenues , including in - room movies at hotels , sex clubs , and the Internet , topped $ 97 billion in 2006 — more than that of Microsoft , Google , Amazon , eBay , Yahoo ! , Apple , Netflixs , and EarthLink combined .
The football coach is the University of California - Berkeley ’s highest paid “ employee ” ; he makes about $ 3 million a year .
Nationwide , full - time faculty positions have been disappearing , replaced by adjunct positions , with itinerant instructors barely making living wages .
Collapsing and overwhelmed sewage systems release more than 40,000 discharges of raw sewage into our drinking water , streams and homes each year .
One - third of our schools are in such a severe state of disrepair that it interferes with the delivery of instruction .
We spend $ 8.9 billion on ICBM missile defense systems that would be useless in stopping a shipping container concealing a dirty bomb .
A family of 4 now pays about $ 12,000 a year in premiums for healthcare — up about 90 percent from 2000 to 2006 .
About 50 million Americans are uninsured ; another 25 million are “ under- insured . ”
We have 2.3 million of our citizens behind bars .
With less than 5 % of the world ’s popultion , we have 25 % of the world ’s prisoners ( 1/2 for non-violent drug crimes ) .
Any wonder there ’s been a flight to fantasy ?
But , more profoundly , what ’s the connection between fantasy and our decaying culture ?
How did we get here ?
Digging beneath the statistics , we find an increasing number of warm - blooded humans suffering like they never have before : lost in a world of promises broken ; the American Dream of endless consumption and fulfillment –nightmarishly evinced .
“ A culture that cannot distinguish between reality and illusion dies , ” Hedges writes .
“ And we are dying now . …
Those who cling to fantasy in times of despair and turmoil inevitably turn to demagogues and charlatans to entertain and reassure them . … ”
As bad as things are now — the disconnectedness , fragmentation , loneliness , im– and a - morality –we can extrapolate , interpret the trend lines , read history , and find worse to come .
Hedges dissects “ our cultural embrace of illusion and the celebrity culture that has risen up around it ” in five comprehensive chapters :
The Illusion of Literacy
The Illusion of Love
The Illusion of Wisdom
The Illusion of Happiness
The Illusion of America
At his best , Hedges has a “ true ” journalist ’s ( i.e. , the careful observer ’s , the truth - digger ’s ) eye for detail , and a novelist ’s ear and sense of flow .
His book is a compilation of some of the best thinking on corporate power , the Corporate State , the decline of the American empire — deftly knitted together with wit and a lively writing style .
( His chapter on the “ Illusion of Love , ” focusing on pornography , is both funny and poignantly sad . )
Empire begins with spectacle .
We ’re in a wrestling ring with jeering fans chanting at the villainous “ tycoon ” actor - wrestler , John Bradshaw Layfield : “ You suck !
You suck !
You suck ! ” Layfield is pitted against the “ Heartbreak Kid , ” the crowd favorite , a working - class hero .
“ You lost your 401 ( k ) .
You lost your retirement . …
You lost your children ’s education fund , ” Layfield taunts the Kid and the audience .
Then , he offers the Kid a job — working for him !
All the Kid has to do is leave the ring .
Humiliated , that ’s just what the Kid does .
And in their identification with their fallen hero , in their vicarious humiliation , the anger and resentment of the audience is stoked against the tycoon .
They hunger for vengeance .
“ The bouts are stylized rituals , ” Hedges writes , “ public expressions of pain and a fervent longing for revenge .
The lurid and detailed sagas behind each bout , rather than the wrestling matches themselves , are what drive crowds to a frenzy . …
And the most potent story tonight , the most potent story across North America , is one of financial ruin … and enslavement of a frightened and abused working class . ”
This mirroring of the “ emotional wreckage of the fans ” is the “ appeal of much of popular culture , from Jerry Springer to ‘ reality television ’ to Oprah Winfrey . ”
It succeeds “ because we ask to be fooled . ”
Celebrities become our “ vicarious selves ” who provide us with release from anonymity and drudgery — “ ultimate fulfillment before death . ”
Given his background , its no small wonder that Hedges would spend much of his book wrestling with the angel .
“ Morality is the product of a civilization , ” he writes ; but , in “ a society that has less and less national cohesion , a society that has broken down into warlike and antagonistic tribes where ‘ winning is all that matters , ’ morality is seen as ‘ irrelevant . ’ ”
Ours is a culture of manipulation , one of “ inverted totalitaianism . ”
Hedges borrows the phrase from Sheldon S. Wolin ’s Democracy Incorporated .
“ Inverted totalitarianism , ” Hedges writes , “ unlike classical totalitarianism , does not revolve around a demagogue or charismatic leader .
It finds expression in the anonymity of the Corporate State .
It purports to cherish democracy , patriotism , and the Constitution while manipulating internal levers .
…
Political candidates are elected in popular votes by citizens , but candidates must raise staggering funds to compete .
They are beholden to armies of corporate lobbyists … who author the legislation .
…
Corporate media control nearly everything we read , or hear .
It imposes a bland uniformity of opinion .
It diverts us with trivia and celebrity gossip .
… In classical totalitarian regimes … economics was subordinate to politics . ”
In America , economics is dominant .
“ The fantasy of celebrity culture is not designed simply to entertain .
It is designed to keep us from fighting back . ”
We need not stretch ourselves , I imagine .
The hero of The Matrix will stretch for us .
So will Plastic Man or Batman or Superman .
In our culture of distractions and manipulations , Aldous Huxley “ feared that what we love will ruin us . ”
Citing Neil Postman , he reproduces a dialectic between the authors of 1984 and Brave New World :
What Orwell feared were those who would ban books .
What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book , for there would be no one who wanted to read one .
Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information .
Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism .
Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us .
Huxley feared that the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance .
I put it this way :
We need not worry that Big Brother is watching us ; we need worry about our dual fascinations with watching Big Brother — and with being watched !
In fact , we ’ve become a nation of double voyeurs : we watch people on “ reality shows ” who are being watched and monitored by the unblinking camera recording their humdrum lives .
We are what we eat and we ’ve been eating a lot of baloney .
It comes to us in various forms including the petrochemical - sprayed food we eat , the Big Pharma pills we take to keep us drugged , numb and complaisant .
We watch our celebs gulping it and pitching it back at us .
Our politicians sprinkle it with mustard and daub it with relish .
Conditioning . …
Both those geniuses — George and Aldous–were trying to deal with it : the whole spectrum of the Propaganda State grown up around the theories of Edward Bernays — Freud ’s nephew .
They both understood the necessary concomitants of fear , repetition , tribal identity and group conformity .
They gave it different expressions , but they grounded it in the imperative of psychological re-structuring and transformation .
Orwell with the gut - wrenching fear of our worst chimeras ; Huxley with mind - numbing lullabies to babies , easy , commitment - free sex from puberty onward , and lots of soma .
Hedges ’ chapter on the “ Illusion of Happiness ” addresses the issue of psychological conditioning .
It would be amusing if it were n’t so tragic .
It has the same tenor of pathos as his chapter on sex , in which one enthusiast waxes eloquent about his $ 7500 anatomically correct silicone dolls .
( He has eight , with removeable heads , and he exults over the simulated veins in the feet and the dorsal venous arch — “ really , really cool . ” )
The silicone pitch in academia is “ positive psychology , ” or what Professor Cooperrider at Case Western Reserve University calls , “ Transformational Positivity . ”
According to the professor , “ Institutions can be a vehicle for bringing more courage into the world , for amplifying love in the world … temperance and justice , and so on . ”
And so on it goes .
Just think positive .
( Remember that Indian guru who beguiled the Beetles ?
“ Just be happy ! ” )
All we need is “ appreciative inquiry ” in order to “ transform organizations into ‘ Positive Institutions ’ . ”
Cooperrider is hardly alone .
There are more than a hundred courses on positive psychology on college campuses .
The University of Pennsylvania offers a Masters of Applied Positive Psychology , and Claremont Graduate University offers Ph.D. and M.A. concentrations in “ The Science of Positive Psychology . ”
Such degree programs are also available in England , Italy and Mexico .
They focus on “ cultivating strengths , optimism , gratitude , and a positive perspective . ”
Think positively and positive things will happen .
Sound familiar ?
Perhaps we should call such programs , “ Becoming Oprah . ”
Hedges lifts his lens high enough to kindle fire here : “ The purpose and goals of the corporation are never questioned .
To question them , to engage in criticism of the goals of the collective , is to be obstructive and negative . …
If we are not happy , there is something wrong with us .
Debate and criticism , especially about the goals and structure of the corporation , are condemned as negative and ‘ counterproductive . ’ ”
And he ’s a good pitbull here :
“ Positive psychology is to the corporate state what eugenics was to the Nazis . ”
It ’s a “ quack science ” that “ throws a smokescreen over corporate domination , abuse , and greed . ”
So , if you ’re looking for treacle , look elsewhere .
My one cavil is with the ending of the book , the last part of the last chapter .
Hedges can be polemical and he does repeat himself .
The last chapter needs less polemicism and summary arguments .
And I ca n’t help but wonder :
What is the other side ?
Is there any way to avoid catastrophe ?
Perhaps an interview with one of those heroes whose names pepper this important book would have sharpened the quill : people like Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney , Father Roy Bourgeois , Kathy Kelly , Amy Goodman , Bill Moyers , Jim Hensen — what sustains them , keeps them going ?
Also missing in action is Marshall McLuhan , whose Understanding Media of some forty years ago established the scientific foundation of critiquing the media — the mesmeric effect of mentally connecting pixiles ; the alpha waves generated in a half - waking , half - sleeping state .
Morris Berman and Derrick Jensen have argued that we ’re already past the “ tipping point . ”
NASA scientist Jim Hensen says we should have started yesterday to bring down C02 levels or face global cataclysm .
In the last couple of pages , Hedges seems to pull his punches for a gentle caress : “ No tyranny in history has crushed the human capacity for love , ” he writes .
“ The mediocrities who mask their feelings of worthlessness and emptiness behind the façade of power and illusion , who seek to make us serve their perverse ideologies , fear most the power of love .
…
Love will endure , even if it appears darkness has swallowed us all , to triumph over the wreckage that remains . ”
I do n’t know .
I ’m not sure .
The power of love is cold comfort to the corpses and the wasted lives .
Love without wisdom , like freedom without wisdom , has caused as much mischief and grief as the genuinely malignant spirits and ideologies among us .
Perhaps the overriding question now is how best to organize collective action against the tyranny of corporatism , the relentless pulsations of conformity .
How do we return to a “ literate , print - based world , a world of complexity and nuance , a world of ideas ” ?
One book cannot do it all , of course .
Hedges has trained a brilliant light on our confused and murky , rather bizarre culture .
In the last couple of pages he leaves us with another powerful idea , probably as good as love .

( CNN ) -- Internet giant Google on Friday started translating Persian , also known as Farsi , in a move that could dramatically help spread information on the Iranian election crisis , but the service is far from perfect .
World news events of the past had few reporting electronically , but hundreds are in Iran .
Badi Badiozamani , who has been helping with translations at CNN , said it was good at translating short phrases like " Hi , how are you ? " but struggled with longer sentences and terminology .
He said when asked to translate " Mr. Khamenei , people will put you in your place " , the Google translator came up with : " Mr. Khamenei , people instead of your head you can ( and then an indecipherable word ) . "
Badiozamani added : " The machine can never replace the human mind .
The Persian language is very poetic , full of metaphors and poetry and expressions .
You give it to the poor machine , it 's not a person or a poet , it has not got a heart .
So the end result is disastrous . "
Peter Norvig , Google 's research director , admitted to CNN that the service was " not perfect yet . "
Norvig said the program " tried to do the best job possible . "

Norvig said Google had pushed out the service early because of the situation in Iran but it was not a political move .
" We are just offering access to information . "
Last week 's contested presidential election has led to widespread protests and turmoil in the country .
Tens of thousands of Iranians have demonstrated in daily protests since , and the government has restricted coverage by news media and social networking sites .
Google said it is working to add 40 more languages that Persian can be translated into .

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has released new rules for border agents searching travelers ' laptops and other electronic devices , but the revised guidelines wo n't quiet complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union .
The new guidelines , unveiled Thursday , continue to allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to search electronic devices during border crossings without suspicion of wrongdoing .
Both CBP and ICE are part of DHS .
The new rules were announced by DHS a day after the ACLU filed a lawsuit in an effort to get more information about border laptop searches .
The ACLU and other groups have complained that the laptop search policy violates the U.S. Constitution 's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure .
The new guidelines are intended to provide more " transparency and accountability " for the laptop searches , said Matt Chandler , DHS spokesman .
The guidelines require CBP to complete a search of an electronic device within five days and ICE to complete a search within 30 days .
In addition , agents must take additional steps to inform and educate travelers about the searches , and the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will conduct an assessment of the policy 's impact on civil rights within 120 days , Chandler said .
The new rules provide a good balance between U.S. security and civil liberties and privacy , Chandler said .
" Keeping Americans safe in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully screen materials entering the United States , " DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement .
" The new directives announced today strike the balance between respecting the civil liberties and privacy of all travelers while ensuring DHS can take the lawful actions necessary to secure our borders . "
But the new rules do n't go far enough , said Catherine Crump , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" DHS ' latest policy announcement on border searches is a disappointment and should not be mistaken for one that restores the constitutional rights of travelers at the border , " she said .
" Members of the public deserve fundamental privacy rights when traveling and the safety of knowing that federal agents cannot rifle through their laptops without some reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing . "
The ACLU does not oppose border searches , she added .
" But it does oppose a policy that leaves government officials free to exercise their power arbitrarily , " Crump said .
" Such a policy not only invades our privacy but can lead to racial and religious profiling . "
CBP has asserted that it can search all files , including financial documents and Web browsing history , on travelers ' laptops and electronic devices " absent individualized suspicion . "
The agency does need probable cause that a crime has been committed to seize a device .
In the past 10 months , CBP has dealt with more than 221 million travelers at U.S. ports of entry , according to DHS .
CBP did about 1,000 laptop searches during that time , and only 46 were in - depth searches , the agency said .
The Beatles faced the same pressures every teen sensation has since -- fatigue , frustration , being bounced into recording substandard material .
" It is n't a pot - boiling quick - sale any - old - thing - will - do - for - Christmas mixture , " claimed Derek Taylor on the Beatles For Sale sleeve .
This pre-emptive strike looks more than a little defensive , especially when the cover versions are back in force , and one of them is the notorious and oft - detested " Mr. Moonlight " .
The workrate expected of early - 1960s pop stars is one of the hardest things for modern listeners to get their heads around .
We 're used to bands making a record , touring in support , searching for inspiration , trying out new ideas , maybe two years later making another .
Because our experience of the early Beatles is structured around their albums , we tend to think of them as doing something similar , except at a much more rapid pace .
As Ian Macdonald 's superb Revolution in the Head makes clear , this was n't true : albums , singles , EPs , tours tumbled over one another with hardly a break -- a firehose of almost continuous activity .
There were two reasons for this workload .
Firstly the music industry simply had n't worked out yet how to extend a record 's shelf life -- singles were n't taken from albums after all .
Secondly the lifespan of acts was n't expected to be long , so it made sense to get the most work possible out of them .
The famous hotch - potch of their early American catalogue was one result .
The Beatles themselves were changing how the business worked , but Beatles For Sale , of all the British records , bears the stamp of these business realities .
It 's a mess .
But it 's a really good mess .
Taylor 's sleevenotes are also interesting because they go out of the way to reassure listeners that everything they 're hearing can be reproduced live .
Studio experimentation was becoming more important to the band and producer George Martin , but clearly someone viewed it with a little nervousness .
You can understand why : The Lennon - McCartney originals on Beatles For Sale are often full of curious arrangements , drones , jagged transitions , and lashings of aggression .
Blame pot , or the inspiration of Bob Dylan , or just the pressure - cooker environment the group was in , but the record hits a seam of angry creativity .
This is particularly true of Lennon 's amazing first three songs .
" No Reply " shatters itself with waves of jealous rage , taking the menace that had flecked Beatles music and bringing it up in the mix : his dangerously quiet " that 's a lie " is the most chilling moment in their catalogue .
" I'm a Loser " turns that anger inward with just as much brutality .
And " Baby's in Black " curdles a nursery rhyme , transforms the group 's crisp pop sound into an off - kilter clang , and uses John and Paul McCartney 's double vocal to thicken the soupy sound even further .
This run of tracks marries the direct attack of their earliest material and the boundary - pushing of their later albums , and stands with the best of both .
Even so it 's a relief when " Rock and Roll Music " breaks the tension , especially when you notice that the band are playing their best rock 'n ' roll since " Twist and Shout " .
Perhaps the workrate had pushed them back into the Hamburg hot zone , but the uptempo covers on Beatles For Sale are fiercely good -- as ragged , loud and immediate as the songs needed to be .
Even " Mr. Moonlight " fits the aggressive mood , the ugliness of its organ solo surely deliberate .
McCartney 's songs on Beatles For Sale are more thoughtful than moody , though on his splendid " Every Little Thing " -- given melodramatic thrust by Shangri - Las - style piano and bass drum -- he 's distinctly melancholy , his " yes , I know I 'm a lucky guy " sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that .
But Lennon 's anger and the band 's rediscovery of rock 'n ' roll mean For Sale 's reputation as the group 's meanest album is deserved , even if it has " Eight Days a Week " as its breezy centerpiece .
The lumpiest and least welcoming of their early records , it 's also one of the most rewarding .

Roy Langbord had guessed that someone in his family might have hidden away a great treasure decades before , but not until his mother had him check a long - neglected safe - deposit box did he realize just how great it was .
Inside the box , opened in 2003 , he found an incredibly rare coin , wrapped in a delicate paper sleeve .
It was a gold $ 20 piece with Lady Liberty on one side , a bald eagle flying across the other and , at Liberty ’s left , the four digits that made it so valuable : 1933 .
The famous “ double eagles ” from that year were never officially released by the government .
Only a few had ever made their way out of federal vaults , and only one had ever been sold publicly , in 2002 .
The price : $ 7.6 million .
And there were nine more of them in the safe - deposit box .
But after the Langbord family took the coins to the United States Mint to be authenticated in 2004 , they got a rude surprise .
The Mint said the coins were genuine and kept them .
Texas Instruments Signing Keys Broken
Texas Instruments ’ calculators use RSA digital signatures to authenticate any updates to their operating system .
Unfortunately , their signing keys are too short : 512 - bits .
Earlier this month , a collaborative effort factored the moduli and published the private keys .
Texas Instruments responded by threatening websites that published the keys with the DMCA , but it ’s too late .
So far , we have the operating - system signing keys for the TI - 92 + , TI - 73 , TI - 89 , TI - 83 +/ TI - 83 + Silver Edition , Voyage 200 , TI - 89 Titanium , and the TI - 84 +/ TI - 84 Silver Edition , and the date - stamp signing key for the TI - 73 , Explorer , TI - 83 Plus , TI - 83 Silver Edition , TI - 84 Plus , TI - 84 Silver Edition , TI - 89 , TI - 89 Titanium , TI - 92 Plus , and the Voyage 200 .
Moral :
Do n’t assume that if your application is obscure , or if there ’s no obvious financial incentive for doing so , that your cryptography wo n’t be broken if you use too - short keys .

Longhorn cowfish ( Lactoria cornuta ) are one of many species that live on seagrass meadows ( Image : Bruce Nyden )
This emerald leatherjacket also depends on seagrass meadows for its home ( Image : Bruce Nyden ) Horned sea stars ( Protoreaster nodosus ) like sheltered habitats , and often live in seagrass meadows ( Image : Bruce Nyden )

Seagrass meadows are disappearing at an accelerating pace , according to a new report , which is the first to look at the problem on a global scale .
Seagrass meadows , along with coral reefs , mangrove forests , and salt - marshes , provide valuable ecosystem services like nutrient cycling .
They also protect edible crustaceans , like shrimps and crabs , and juvenile fish such as salmon .
In addition , seagrass meadows provide habitats for endangered species like dugongs , manatees , and sea turtles .
While marine ecologists have been measuring localized seagrass loss for decades , they had never before pooled their information to get a global perspective .
So a team led by Michelle Waycott of James Cook University in Townsville , Queensland , Australia pooled data from 215 regional studies , from 1879 to 2006 .
They found that the total area of known seagrass meadow had decreased by 29 per cent over the 127 years .
They also found that the rate of loss had accelerated , from less than 1 per cent per year in the 1940s to 7 per cent per year since the 1990s .
Sediment dump
“ We put tremendous pressure on sea grass beds , but we get a lot of benefits from them , ” says Susan Williams of the Bodega Marine Laboratory , one of the report ’s co-authors .
The study points to sediment dumping from coastal development projects , pollution , and agricultural nutrient runoff as major causes of the decline .
All three can decrease water quality , starving the plants of the sunlight they need to grow .
Natural disruptions like hurricanes accounted for a small proportion of losses .
According to Williams , the numbers translate to losing a football pitch ’s worth of seagrass every thirty minutes .
Shocking loss
Overall , the rate of loss is comparable to that for tropical rainforests and coral reefs .
However , seagrass meadows exist in both tropical and temperate zones , and are more widespread than either rainforests or reefs .
Their loss has the potential to affect coastal communities all over the world .
“ Those numbers are pretty shocking , ” says Ben Halpern , a marine ecologist with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis .
Although not involved with this study , Halpern and colleagues released a map last year of human impacts on marine habitats .
“ Marine ecosystems have a lot more opportunity to bounce back than ecosystems on land , ” he says .
“ We do need to act quickly , but there is real hope that our actions can be effective . ”
Watershed moment
Not all areas of the globe decreased .
Of the 51 sites that showed increases , 11 were attributable to improved water quality and restored habitat , showing that human efforts can bring the grasses back .
The report notes that transplantation efforts have generally failed , but watershed management and habitat remediation are effective .
One notable example is Tampa Bay , Florida , US , where efforts to reduce nutrient runoff have resulted in 50 per cent clearer water , and a recovery of 27 square kilometres of seagrass beds in the last 25 years .

Bank of America , the nation ’s largest bank and the recipient of $ 45 billion of taxpayers ’ money through the TARP bailout , has suggested that the Obama administration are outlaws .
“ Since when does law apply to this administration ? ” asked BofA spokesman Bob Stickler , as quoted by CNN .
Stickler was discussing the issue of pay for the bank ’s outgoing CEO , Ken Lewis .
As the Wall Street Journal reported , Lewis , who announced his retirement from the bank last month , has agreed not to take any compensation for his work as CEO this year on the urging of President Barack Obama ’s new “ pay czar , ” Kenneth Feinberg .

Though Feinberg reportedly pressured Lewis not to take any compensation for 2009 , Lewis will still walk away with a total of $ 69 million in compensation , because that was negotiated before the position of pay czar was created , so Feinberg has no jurisdiction over those payments .
But , in the CNN report , the BofA expressed doubt as to whether the Obama administration would allow Lewis ’ $ 69 - million golden handshake to stand .
“ Since when does law apply to this administration ? ” Stickler asked , musing about the possibility Lewis would lose his compensation package .
“ This accusation should not go unanswered , especially when it comes from a taxpayer - bailed - out bank , ” opines blogger Teddy Partridge at FireDogLake .
“ Will House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank call Mr. Stickler up to Capitol Hill to ask him exactly what laws he thinks the Obama Administration has violated ? ”
Bank of America has been the target of consumer outrage over the past year , as it collected $ 45 billion in taxpayers ’ money , on top of more than $ 100 billion in loan guarantees it secured from the government .
In January of this year , consumer ’s rights advocates were dismayed to discover that BofA had used some 75 percent of a $ 20 - billion bailout installment to pay bonuses to executives at Merrill Lynch , the brokerage BofA purchased in 2008 .
Robin Li , CEO of Baidu.com at Nasdaq the day of the company 's IPO
Much has been said about Goldman Sachs by articles like Mr. Matt Taibbi July 2 , 2009 Rolling Stone article “ Inside the Great American Bubble Machine ” .
But most have not heard about Goldman Sachs involvement in the initial public offering ( IPO ) of Baidu ( BIDU ) and the subsequent BIDU share price movements back in 2005 and 2006 .
Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , Piper Jaffray ( PJC ) , along with Credit Suisse First Boston ( CS ) , underwrote Baidu ( BIDU ) IPO .
The IPO would be the first for a pure - play Chinese search engine company .
Baidu American depositary shares ( ADS ) started trading on August 5 , 2005 .
An initial 4.04 million ADSs were offered at $ 27 per ADS ; opened at $ 66 , more than double its $ 27 price , climbed , stabilized and then rallied anew before ending its historic opening day at $ 122.54 .
With a rise of 354 % , Baidu ’s first - day gain ranks 18th in history and ranks as the best performance ever by an overseas deal .
At its IPO price of $ 27 a share , the company raised $ 109 million .
Part of the big debut - day move from Baidu.com can be traced to the relatively small size of the deal .
With only 4.04 million shares in the IPO and strong indications of interest from both retail and institutional investors , demand had driven up the price throughout the process .
The widely circulated rumor at the time that Google had attempted to buy the firm fueled interest in the stock and gave investors confidence in it as well .
Typically , underwriters would only be overjoyed when a stock they took IPO shot up like this in its debut .
But the course of action Goldman and Piper Jaffrey took next was totally unprecedented and completely out of character for investment bankers .
Forty days after Baidu went public , the minimum period before an underwriting firm can release an analyst report , on Sep. 14 , 2005 , at 6:00 am before the market opened , Goldman Sachs and Piper Jaffray , two of Baidu ’s underwriters , issued a joint statement that rated the company stock as “ underperform ” .
Goldman even went so far as to say that the company is worth exactly $ 27 a share , which is the same as its IPO price .
Anthony Noto , the Goldman analyst , also said that “ at the most extreme ” , Baidu could be worth $ 45 a share .
At the Piper Jaffray camp , $ 45 was also cited as the price target on the stock -- a mark , Safa Rashtchy , the analyst at Piper Jaffray said , that includes “ an aggressive valuation premium ” .
Shares of Baidu closed at $ 113 the day before , and it had been as high as $ 153 .
At the time , media touted Goldman ’s unusual move as a welcoming sign that analysts and investment banks were moving away from rubber - stamping clients stocks .
Investment banks normally would n't have been so harsh on a recent IPO , fearing it might get left out of future lucrative banking deals .
In the 1999 and 2000 heyday , only 3 % of IPOs were initiated with a " hold " or lower rating after the IPO .
According to Taibbi , Goldman 's bankers used techniques called " laddering " and “ spinning ” .
In laddering , an investment bank would allot IPO shares to institutional investors who promised to buy more once trading in the new firm began .
There is also ‘ spinning ” where the investment bank would offer a chosen few the newly public company shares at extra- low prices , in exchange for future underwriting business .
Banks that engaged in spinning would then undervalue the initial offering price — ensuring that those " hot " opening - price shares it had handed out would be more likely to rise quickly , supplying bigger first day rewards for the “ insiders ” .
Now , do n't they sound eerily familiar in the case of Baidu ’s IPO ?
BIDU dropped 29 % to $ 81.05 by Oct 26 , 2005 .
Goldman then subsequently made five consecutive major downgrade calls from October 2005 through Nov 2006 .
However , Baidu only reached its lowest ever share price of around $ 51 in Feb. 2006 .
Despite four more Goldman downgrades from Feb. to Nov 2006 , Baidu shares went up to $ 117 by Dec. 15 , 2006 .
Up till May 2006 , Goldman was still saying Baidu shares at $ 65 were 10 % overvalued .
True to the old saying “ If you ca n’t beat them , join them . ” , in Dec. 2006 , Goldman raised Baidu target price to $ 128 , only about one year after the conspicuous joint press conference with Piper Jaffrey , where Goldman named an exact $ 27 as fair price on Baidu .
So , at this point , anyone would be highly suspicious of it ’s suddenly emerged “ objectivity ” of BIDU`s fair value .
One could only draw the conclusion : it was to Goldman ’s benefits to push down the share price of Baidu .
There are three possible scenarios :
(1) Goldman did not do its homework and seriously undervalued Baidu ; therefore , the 6:00 am press conference could be meant to save face and avoid potential law suits from Baidu .
Baidu and Goldman ( GS ) were reportedly far apart on valuation .
Baidu was looking for a market cap of $ 1 billion , and Goldman , suggested around a third of that .
(2) Between the laddering and spinning , Baidu shares probably went up too high , too quickly for Goldman and its insiders to profit .
So , at that point , the only way Goldman could have rectified the situation expeditiously was to issue a major downgrade immediately after the 40 - day lockout period .
(3) The growth momentum of the Internet run in China had and sill has room to expand , and is expected to accelerate on the heels of strong user base expansion and increased utilization .
Goldman , who spent all this time , energy and money doing road shows , knew the true value of Baidu , judging by the $ 128 target price about one year after the “ objective ” $ 27 valuation , could be trying to accumulate positions .
Among all the things in which Goldman has allegedly been involved or under investigations by regulatory authorities , this little anomaly has never caught any publicity or ethical scrutiny , mostly because Baidu just went about its business as usual without escalating it into a public fiasco , which has been Baidu ’s management style .
In addition , Baidu was an overseas start - up company , hence probably under most major media ’s radar screen .
To Baidu ’s credit , the company ’s sound performance and strong market fundamentals have propelled its shares from the low point of around $ 51 back in Feb. 2006 to a high of about $ 409 the week of Oct. 29 , 2007 .
BIDU closed at almost $ 327.40 on Tuesday 8/17/09 .
So , there you have it – another possible explanation of how Goldman could afford to pay out record bonuses every year – they seem to play by a different set of rules .
Goldman Sachs ’ powerful political and financial connections apparently have insulated it from regulators whose job is to maintain fair and balanced markets .
However , when Goldman Sachs is involved – fair and balanced appears to have taken on an entirely new connotation .
A recent essay in the New York Times by Dennis Overbye has managed to attract quite a bit of attention around the internets -- most of it not very positive .
It concerns a recent paper by Holger Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya ( and some earlier work ) discussing a seemingly crazy - sounding proposal -- that we should randomly choose a card from a million - card deck and , on the basis of which card we get , decide whether to go forward with the Large Hadron Collider .
Responses have ranged from eye - rolling and heavy sighs to cries of outrage , clutching at pearls , and grim warnings that the postmodernists have finally infiltrated the scientific / journalistic establishment , this could be the straw that breaks the back of the Enlightenment camel , and worse .
Since I am quoted ( in a rather non-committal way ) in the essay , it 's my responsibility to dig into the papers and report back .
And my message is : relax !
Western civilization will survive .
The theory is undeniably crazy -- but not crackpot , which is a distinction worth drawing .
And an occasional fun essay about speculative science in the Times is not going to send us back to the Dark Ages , or even rank among the top ten thousand dangers along those lines .
The standard Newtonian way of thinking about the laws of physics is in terms of an initial - value problem .
You specify the state of the system ( positions and velocities ) at one moment , then the laws of physics tell you how it will evolve into the future .
But there is a completely equivalent alternative , which casts the laws of physics in terms of an action principle .
In this formulation , we assign a number -- the action -- to every possible history of the system throughout time .
( The choice of what action to assign is simply the choice of what laws of physics are operative . )
Then the allowed histories , the ones that " obey the laws of physics , " are those for which the action is the smallest .
That 's the " principle of least action , " and it's a standard undergraduate exercise to show that it 's utterly equivalent to the initial - value formulation of dynamics .
In quantum mechanics , as you may have heard , things change a tiny bit .
Instead of only allowing histories that minimize the action , quantum mechanics ( as reformulated by Feynman ) tells us to add up the contributions from every possible history , but give larger weight to those with smaller actions .
In effect , we blur out the allowed trajectories around the one with absolutely smallest action .
Nielsen and Ninomiya ( NN ) pull an absolutely speculative idea out of their hats : they ask us to consider what would happen if the action were a complex number , rather than just a real number .
Then there would be an imaginary part of the action , in addition to the real part .
( This is the square - root - of - minus - one sense of " imaginary , " not the LSD - hallucination sense of " imaginary . " )
No real justification -- or if there is , it 's sufficiently lost in the mists that I can't discern it from the recent papers .
That 's okay ; it 's just the traditional hypothesis - testing that has served science well for a few centuries now .
Propose an idea , see where it leads , toss it out if it conflicts with the data , build on it if it seems promising .
We do n't know all the laws of physics , so there 's no reason to stand pat .
NN argue that the effect of the imaginary action is to highly suppress the probabilities associated with certain trajectories , even if those trajectories minimize the real action .
But it does so in a way that appears nonlocal in spacetime -- it 's really the entire trajectory through time that seems to matter , not just what is happening in our local neighborhood .
That 's a crucial difference between their version of quantum mechanics and the conventional formulation .
But it 's not completely bizarre or unprecedented .
Plenty of hints we have about quantum gravity indicate that it really is nonlocal .
More prosaically , in everyday statistical mechanics we do n't assign equal weight to every possible trajectory consistent with our current knowledge of the universe ; by hypothesis , we only allow those trajectories that have a low entropy in the past .
( As readers of this blog should well know by now ; and if you do n't , I have a book you should definitely read . )
To make progress with this idea , you have to make a choice for what the imaginary part of the action is supposed to be .
Here , in the eyes of this not - quite - expert , NN seem to cheat a little bit .
They basically want the imaginary action to look very similar to the real action , but it turns out that this choice is naively ruled out .
So they jump through some hoops until they get a more palatable choice of model , with the property that it is basically impotent except where the Higgs boson is concerned .
( The Higgs , as a fundamental scalar , interacts differently than other particles , so this is n't completely ad hoc -- just a little bit . )
Because they are not actually crackpots , they even admit what they 're doing -- in their own words , " Our model with an imaginary part of the action begins with a series of not completely convincing , but still suggestive , assumptions . "
Having invoked the tooth fairy twice -- contemplating an imaginary part of the action , then choosing its form so as to only be relevant where the Higgs is concerned -- they consider consequences .
Remember that the effect of the imaginary action is non-local in time -- it depends on what happens throughout the history of the universe , not just here and now .
In particular , given their assumptions , it provides a large suppression to any history in which large numbers of Higgs bosons are produced , even if they wo n't be produced until some time in the future .
So this model makes a strong prediction : we 're not going to be producing any Higgs bosons .
Not because the ordinary dynamical equations of physics prevent it ( e.g. , because the Higgs is just too massive ) , but because the specific trajectory on which the universe finds itself is one in which no Higgses are made .
That , of course , runs into the problem that we have every intention of making Higgs bosons , for example at the LHC .
Aha , say NN , but notice that we have n't yet !
The Superconducting Supercollider , which could have found the Higgs long ago , was canceled by Congress .
And in their December 2007 paper -- before the LHC tried to turn on -- they very explicitly say that a " natural " accident will come along and break the LHC if we try to turn it on .
Well , we know how that turned out .
But NN have an ingenious suggestion for saving us from future accidents at the LHC -- which , as they warn , could endanger lives .
They propose a card game with more than a million cards , almost all of which say " go ahead , no problem . "
But one card says " do n't turn on the LHC ! "
In their model , the nonlocal effect of the imaginary part of the action is to ensure that the realized history of the universe is one in which the LHC never turns on ; but it does n't matter why it does n't turn on .
If we randomly pick one out of a million cards , and honestly promise to follow through on the instructions on the card we pick , and we happen to pick the card that says not to turn it on , and we therefore do n't -- that 's a history of the universe that is completely unsuppressed by their mechanism .
And if we choose a card that says " go ahead , " well then their theory is falsified .
( Unless we try to go ahead and are continually foiled by a series of unfortunate accidents . )
Best of all , playing the card game costs almost nothing .
But for it to work , we have to be very sincere that we wo n't turn on the LHC if that 's what the card says .
It 's only a million - to - one chance , after all .
Note that all of this " nonlocal in time , " " receiving signals sent from the future " stuff is a bit of a red herring , at least at the classical level .
We often think that the past is set in stone , while the future is still to be determined .
But that 's not how the laws of physics operate .
If we knew the precise state of the universe , and the exact laws of physics , the future would be as utterly determined as the present ( Laplace 's Demon ) .
We only think otherwise because our knowledge of the present state is highly imperfect , consisting as it does as a few pieces of information about the coarse - grained state .
( We do n't know the position and velocity of every particle in the universe , or for that matter in any macroscopic object . )
So there 's no need to think of NN 's imaginary action as making reference to what happens in the future -- all the necessary data are in the present state .
What seems weird to us is that the NN mechanism makes crucial use of detailed , non-macroscopic information about the present state ; information to which we do n't have access .
( Such as , " does this subset of the universe evolve into the Large Hadron Collider ? " )
That 's not how the physics we know and love actually works , but the setup does n't actually rely on propagation of signals backwards in time .
At the end of the day : this theory is crazy .
There 's no real reason to believe in an imaginary component to the action with dramatic apparently - nonlocal effects , and even if there were , the specific choice of action contemplated by NN seems rather contrived .
But I 'm happy to argue that it 's the good kind of crazy .
The authors start with a speculative but well - defined idea , and carry it through to its logical conclusions .
That 's what scientists are supposed to do .
I think that the Bayesian prior probability on their model being right is less than one in a million , so I 'm not going to take its predictions very seriously .
But the process by which they work those predictions out has been perfectly scientific .
There is another reasonable question , which is whether an essay ( not a news story , note ) like this in a major media outlet contributes to the erosion of trust in scientists on the part of the general public .
I would love to see actual data one way or the other , which went beyond " remarkably , the view of the common man aligns precisely with the view I myself hold . "
My own anecdotal observations are pretty unambiguous -- the public loves far - out speculations like this , and happily eats them up .
( See previous mocking quote , now applied to myself . )
It 's always important to distinguish as clearly as possible between what is crazy - sounding but well - established as true -- quantum mechanics , relativity , natural selection -- and what is crazy - sounding and speculative , even if it 's respectable speculation -- inflation , string theory , exobiology .
But if that distinction is made , I 've always found it pretty paternalistic and condescending to claim that we should shield the public from speculative science until it 's been established one way or the other .
The public are grown - ups , and we should assume the best of them rather than the worst .
There 's nothing wrong with letting them in on the debates about crazy - sounding ideas that we professional scientists enjoy as our stock in trade .
The disappointing thing about the responses to the article is how non-intellectual they have been .
I have n't heard " the NN argument against contributions to the imaginary action that are homogeneous in field types is specious , " or even " I see no reason whatsoever to contemplate imaginary actions , so I 'm going to ignore this " ( which would be a perfectly defensible stance ) .
It 's been more like " this is completely counter to my everyday experience , therefore it must be crackpot ! "
That 's not a very sciencey attitude .
It certainly would have been incompatible with all sorts of important breakthroughs in physics through the years .
The Nielsen / Ninomiya scenario is n't going to be one of those breakthroughs , I feel pretty sure .
But it 's sensible enough that it merits disagreement on the basis of rational arguments , not just rolling of eyes .
Ships powered by algae and planes flying on weeds : that 's part of the future the U.S. Navy hopes to bring to fruition .
This week , the seagoing branch of the military purchased 40,000 gallons of jet fuel derived from camelina — a weedy relative of canola — and 20,055 gallons of algae - derived diesellike fuel for ships .
" The intent is for these fuels to be drop - in replacements , " although initially they will be blended with their conventional counterparts , says Jeanne Binder , research and development program manager at the Defense Energy Support Center ( DESC ) , the U.S. Department of Defense 's combat logistics support agency .
" The test results will bear that out . "
As the renewable fuels are delivered in increasing batches in coming months , the Navy will begin lab testing them .
The Navy hopes to put the biofuels in active planes and ships in 2010 and 2011 , respectively , according to Billy Ray Brown , spokesman for the U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division .
" The three goals are fuel security , something that is renewable , and that we can produce and provide for ourselves to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil .
It [ also ] has to be cost - effective .
Then , obviously , the environmental benefits that could potentially derive from that . "
The first green plane ?
An F / A - 18 Super Hornet , or " green " Hornet , which is tentatively scheduled to take to the skies with a blend of conventional and bio - based jet fuel in tests next summer .
The first biofueled ship has yet to be selected , Brown says .
As it stands , the Navy uses at least seven different types of petroleum - based fuel and burns nearly 35 million barrels per year .
The challenge will be finding biofuels that can work in the many different types of aircraft , ships , engines , boilers and turbines employed by the fighting force .
" We 're at the very beginning .
It 's going to be seven , 10 , 15 years " before this is in widespread use , Brown says .
" We have to be very meticulous in what we 're doing . "
Particularly , the Navy is trying to be meticulous about the sources of its alternative fuels , mandating those that do not compete with food , like ethanol from corn does .
Algae , although used in the nutraceutical industry , is not considered a food crop and camelina can be used as a rotation crop with wheat .
" What we 're doing is giving [ the farmer ] an economic alternative to having the ground sit fallow , " says Scott Johnson , president and general manager of Sustainable Oils , the camelina biofuel supplier .
Sustainable Oils , which also breeds the camelina seeds it then contracts with the farmer to grow , planted about 8,000 acres this year , the bulk in Montana , which should yield roughly 400,000 gallons of the unrefined oil , Johnson says .
That camelina oil was then trucked to a pilot refinery run by UOP , LLC , in Bayport , Tex. , which turned it into the jet biofuel or other petroleum - based product required .
The first jet biofuel will be delivered on September 15 and a UOP - sponsored assessment shows that camelina jet biofuel reduces carbon emissions by 80 percent compared with conventional kerosene .
The U.S. government will pay $ 2.7 million for the 40,000 gallons of jet biofuel from camelina , or $ 67.50 per gallon , although that price includes some research and development , DESC cautions .
" The Navy is asking for quantities that are not commercial quantities , " Johnson explains .
" So the process involved is a batch process and some of the costs that are involved are very expensive to set up . "
The company also sells the meal left over after crushing the camelina oil seeds as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration –approved feed for broiler chickens .
" We expect to grow close to 50,000 acres in Montana next year , " Johnson says , as well as add more approved uses of the leftover meal .
The algae - derived fuel for use in ships will be grown by Solazyme , a San Francisco–based start - up that grows its algae on sugar in the dark .
The company leases fermenters , such as those used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce insulin , along with other existing industrial infrastructure to create batches of its product , although it declined to specify where it would produce this particular bio-oil .
Nor will it reveal its refining partner .
If Solazyme succeeds , it will be the first biofuel company to actually produce algal oil from its own algae and deliver it .
Sapphire Energy , a competitor , had supplied jet biofuel to the first commercial flight powered in part by the tiny aquatic plants but had purchased the bio-oil from Cyanotech Corp. , which grows algae for the nutritional market .
The U.S. government will pay $ 8.5 million for the contracted 20,055 gallons of algal fuel from Solazyme , the bulk of which must be supplied within a year .
That would be nearly $ 424 per gallon but " applying price per gallon to that contract would not be a very fair assessment , " says DESC 's Binder , because of the much greater research and development investment needed to make algae - based fuel a reality .
Ultimately , the Navy is looking for as many fuels as possible , ranging from nuclear to biofuels — even seawater , which could be transformed into jet fuel by energy - intensive chemistry .
And the Navy is not alone .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has spent $ 35 million to sponsor research into oil from algae and the Air Force is also looking for cleaner ways to fly and fight .
Additional biofuel contracts pending with DESC should be awarded by mid-September .
That 's for " up to 400,000 gallons of renewable jet fuel " for the Air Force , says DESC 's Frank Pane , director of energy plans and programs .
This " is a start of our ability to support [ the U.S. military ] as they look at alternative fuels or renewables for their future energy needs . "
Pilot of Flight That Missed Destination : ' I Can Assure You None of Us Was Asleep '
As pilot speaks , FAA says " emergency suspension or revocation " is possible .
Oct. 23 , 2009  --
One of the two Northwest Airlines pilots who were out of contact with air traffic controllers for more than an hour Wednesday while they overshot their destination denies suggestions that they fell asleep .
" I can assure you none of us was asleep , " First Officer Richard I. Cole told ABC News .
He declined to comment further but said , " I am not doing very good . "
This evening , the Federal Aviation Administration released a brief statement suggesting the pilots on the San Diego - to - Minneapolis flight could face serious consequences as the agency investigates .
" The FAA has sent letters of investigation to the two pilots involved in the recent Northwest Airlines overflight of Minneapolis , " the statement said .
" Depending on the outcome of our investigation , this action could lead to emergency suspension or revocation " of their licenses .
Cole and fellow pilot Timothy B. Cheney told the FBI and airport police they lost track of time and got distracted because they were in a heated discussion over airline policy , the FAA has said .
The pilots told police " they had become involved in conversation and had not heard radio communications . "
The pilots of the Airbus A320 were out of contact with air traffic controllers who frantically tried to reach the plane for 1 hour and 18 minutes .
The pilots -- who stayed at 37,000 feet and overshot the airport by 150 miles -- were finally reached at 8:14 p.m. , but the jet with 147 passengers did not land at Minneapolis - Saint Paul International Airport until 9:05 p.m .
The cockpit voice recorder on the flight is only a 30 - minute recorder , resetting on a loop after that period , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .
That means that unless the pilots stopped the recorder , the only sounds captured from the flight would be the last half hour , when the pilots were back in communications with air traffic controllers .
Newer flight recorders tape two hours of sounds before resetting .

" From the point of course reversal to touchdown was about 50 minutes , " said Daniel Baker , founder and CEO of flight - tracking company FlightAware.com .
Since Delta and Northwest merged a year ago , many pilots have been angered over job seniority and the routes they fly , perhaps a factor in a cockpit discussion .
Airport police who met the plane at the plane at the gate asked the pilots to submit to a alcohol breath test .
Cheney and Cole both voluntarily agreed and the tests showed no traces of alcohol , according to the police report .
It appears that there were no bells or whistles or any other audible sound to alert the pilots that they had passed their last flight marker , so - called " way points . "
Instead , there would be a message on screens that sit on the pedestal between the two pilots .
That message would have said " flight plan discontinuity . "
Federal counterterrorism agencies treated the stray jetliner as a serious threat .
Fighter jets were placed on alert , though not put in the sky .
Authorities began to immediately look at the flight manifest and crew and checked to see if there were air marshals onboard .
The National Counterterrorism Center was notified and the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force was put on notice .
" As part of our procedures for events of this nature TSA protocol included checking possible screening anomalies from the departing airport , checking to see if Federal Air Marshals were onboard , notification to the airline , as well [ Transportation Security Administration ] and [ Department of Homeland Security ] leadership , " Sterling Payne , TSA deputy assistant administrator said in a statement .
" This is an extraordinary , unusual case , " William Voss of the Flight Safety Foundation told " Good Morning America . "
" I can think of very few times in recent history where we have seen this type of really extreme overflight . "
One of the many possibilities that investigators will look at is whether one or both pilots were sleeping .
" This is unprecedented ... in terms of being so unaware of where you are and what you 're doing , " former pilot and ABC News aviation consultant John Nance said .
" This is virtually off the charts .
The far more likely explanation is they fell asleep . "
Although Nance said it is common for pilots to fall asleep on long trips , the pilots ' story may hold truth , former National Transportation Safety Board investigator Greg Feith told " Good Morning America . "
It 's possible the pilots did not hear instructions to update their frequency and never heard the air traffic controllers ' repeated calls to them , he said .
" You have to tune your ear to the call sign , " Feith said .
" If you 're in a heated discussion , if you 're distracted , you can miss that call sign . "
As the event unfolded , concern rose among air traffic controllers who repeatedly attempted to establish contact , using multiple methods , the air traffic controllers union told ABC News .
Eventually , controllers asked other planes in the air to attempt to contact the Northwest plane , which proved successful , the union said .
" Regardless of what happened in that cockpit , this incident highlights some of the policy gaps that must be filled to create an air travel industry that is fair to pilots and as safe as possible for consumers , " said Anne Banas , executive editor of SmarterTravel.com .
" Current pilot fatigue rules are outdated and have no real relevance to the modern aviation industry -- they place an unfair burden on pilots and crew , and put passengers at unnecessary risk .
Plus , the simple fact that aircrafts are carrying older cockpit recorders is very surprising , and should be remedied . "
NTSB Plans to Interview Pilots Who Were Allegedly Asleep at the Controls
The NTSB plans to interview the crew and is reviewing the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the flight , Northwest 188 from San Diego to Minneapolis .
The NTSB will be investigating whether the pilots fell asleep , along with all other possibilities .
" There was n't any problem on board -- nothing , " Andrea Allmon of San Diego told ABC affiliate KSTP Thursday .
" We landed , everyone got ready to get off the plane and suddenly police were getting on the plane and telling us to sit down .
They went into the cockpit , looked around and then told everyone to get off the plane . "
Early in 2008 , the two pilots of a go !
Airlines flight from Honolulu to Hilo , Hawaii fell asleep for at least 18 minutes while in the air .
The plane flew past the airport and out to sea before air traffic controllers finally were able to reach the pilots , who turned the plane around .
The captain later was diagnosed with sleep apnea .
Delta Airlines , which now owns Northwest , said in a statement that the " safety of our passengers and crew is our top priority . "
" We are cooperating with the FAA and NTSB in their investigation , as well as conducting our own internal investigation , " Delta said in the statement .
" The pilots have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations . "
Asked how many years of service the pilots have and how many hours they were into their shift , a Delta spokesman said , " We are not sharing as that is all part of the investigation . "
This is the second instance in just days of a Delta flight crew having an apparent safety lapse .
Monday at 6:05 a.m. , Delta flight 60 from Rio de Janeiro to Atlanta landed on a taxiway instead of the parallel runway where it was supposed to touch down .
There were no injuries to any of the 182 passengers or 11 crew members on the flight .
ABC News ' Matt Hosford , Lisa Stark and Pierre Thomas contributed to this report .
That means NBC ’s second act in late night , Jimmy Fallon , is also getting a much weaker lead - in than Mr. O’Brien did in the same hour a year ago , and as a result is falling behind his CBS competitor , Craig Ferguson , in audience totals .
NBC rightly points out that both its late - night stars remain more popular with younger viewers who are more valuable in selling to advertisers , but in the past NBC ’s late - night hours were dominant across the board , not just with narrower audience segments .
And all of this is playing out against a backdrop of reports that General Electric is in talks with Comcast to sell NBC Universal .

Looked at in isolation , Mr. Leno has been doing everything NBC expected of him .
His ratings , after a big first week , have leveled off to about five million viewers a night ( though some nights have been much lower ) with a 1.5 to 2 rating in the category NBC identifies as all - important , viewers ages 18 to 49 , the group many advertisers want to reach .
Though most 10 p.m. shows with those kinds of numbers get canceled , NBC has said from the beginning that it could accept much lower ratings because of the enormous cost savings of Mr. Leno ’s show versus expensive hourlong scripted dramas .
The network guaranteed advertisers that it would average only a 1.5 rating .
The network ’s performance over all has not shown signs of a comeback .
While somewhat propped up so far by professional football on Sunday night , NBC has not added any standout new shows .
The new drama “ Trauma ” has already faltered , and a promising new comedy , “ Community , ” struggled last week when it was moved to a new 8 p.m. time period .

SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY --
Utah 's freshman congressman on Thursday defended a run-in with security at Salt Lake International Airport .
Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz admitted he got frustrated and even used an obscenity , but he thinks airport security was out of line , not him .
It all revolves around a machine that checks for concealed bombs or weapons under a passenger 's clothes .
Passengers who do n't want their whole body scanned can bypass the machine and go through a metal detector and full - body pat down instead .
But 99.6 percent willingly get scanned .
" The security is good , and it 's for my protection .
I feel that way about it , and so I do n't mind it at all , " said frequent flyer Dick Crossett .
Statistics show less than 1 in 200 try to avoid the revealing scans .
" I believe it 's invasive , and I think there are other methods we could use .
So , it 's not a line I choose to go through , " a flight attended named Monica told KSL News .
Airline passengers ready themselves to go through the full - body scanner
Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he was just trying to exercise that right when a security guard told him to change lines .
" They did not make it optional ; and when I told them I did n't want to do it , they started treating me as though I was some sort of criminal or something , giving me the third degree , " Chaffetz said .
The Transportation Security Administration issued a written statement that said : " This incident will be reviewed . "
It also reiterated that a body scan " is always 100 % optional " and it's " an important tool to mitigate known threats . "
Chaffetz said he flies roughly every four days and has never before been singled out for extra screenings .
He said he wonders if one reason could be retaliation -- either because of his legislative history with the screening process , or because just days before the disagreement on Monday he'd voted against a bill that would have given union status to the Transportation Security Administration .
After a pat down and full clearance , Chaffetz said things escalated when he asked to speak with a supervisor , identifying himself as a congressman .
" Then , trying to get the supervisor 's name and ID number , the supervisor said to me , " We know exactly who you are , ' " Chaffetz said .
" At that point , yeah , I said ‘ B.S. ' and kind of spelled it out .
And , uh , I was frustrated . "
But unnamed sources told the Deseret News Chaffetz was obnoxious and escalated the situation himself .
He allegedly threw his business card at a security worker and grabbed the supervisor 's ID badge .
" Hey , let 's roll the tape .
That absolutely , positively did not happen , " Chaffetz said .
Videotape of the incident does exist .
The TSA is studying it and has n't said yet whether they will release it .

This is infuriating .
If there was any doubt in your mind as to whose side the political establishment is on , this should settle it :
An amendment that would prevent the government from working with contractors who denied victims of assault the right to bring their case to court is in danger of being watered down or stripped entirely from a larger defense appropriations bill .
Multiple sources have told the Huffington Post that Sen .
Dan Inouye , a longtime Democrat from Hawaii , is considering removing or altering the provision , which was offered by Sen .
Al Franken ( D - Minn . ) and passed by the Senate several weeks ago .
Inouye 's office , sources say , has been lobbied by defense contractors adamant that the language of the Franken amendment would leave them overly exposed to lawsuits and at constant risk of having contracts dry up .
The Senate is considering taking out a provision known as the Title VII claim , which ( if removed ) would allow victims of assault or rape to bring suit against the individual perpetrator but not the contractor who employed him or her .
" The defense contractors have been storming his office , " said a source with knowledge of the situation .
" Inouye either will get the amendment taken out altogether , or water it down significantly .
If they water it down , they will take out the Title VII claims .
This means that in discrimination cases , they will still force you into a secret forced arbitration on KBR's ( or other contractors ' ) own terms -- with your chances of prevailing practically zero .
The House seems to be very supportive of the original Franken amendment and all in line , but their hands are tied since it originated in the Senate .
And since Inouye runs the show on this bill , he can easily take it out to get Republicans and the defense contractors off his back , which looks increasingly likely . "
A Democratic aide on the Hill , also with knowledge of the situation , confirmed the account , as did a source who works on defense contracting matters outside of Congress .
" The contractors are putting on a full - court press on this amendment ... they are all doing it , " said the latter source .
This evening , the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice filed yet another emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit , asking for a stay of the deadline to release telecom immunity lobbying documents , less than 24 hours before the documents are due to be released to the public .
Almost simultaneously , a report appeared on Politico.com , claiming that the government will be releasing some documents , while fighting in court to hide the remainder .
Despite this report , the government 's motion seeks to delay disclosure of all the documents , and no new documents have been released just yet .
For those following this saga , this is deja vu all over again .
Last week , when the documents were due to be turned over by Friday , October 9 , the government asked the Court of Appeals for a stay , a motion that was denied by the Ninth Circuit in short order .
Later that same afternoon , the government asked Federal District Court Judge Jeffrey
White for an additional delay , a request that Judge White ultimately denied , giving the government a new deadline of Friday , October 16 , by 4 p.m. Pacific time .
This has been a long fight -- since 2007 , EFF has been working towards the release of these records after media reports revealed an extensive lobbying campaign seeking immunity for telecoms that participated in the government 's unlawful surveillance program .
As we 've said before , we look forward to receiving the documents and making them public so that they can play a much - needed role in the active congressional debate over repealing telecom immunity .
UPDATED October 16 , 3:15 pm : Friday morning , EFF filed opposition to the government 's motion .
The government then filed a reply .
3:50 pm : In order to give itself more time to decide whether to grant the requested stay , the Ninth Circuit Court has extended the deadline for disclosure of documents another week , until 5 pm PT on Friday October 23 .

How To Crochet Flower Tutorial Flowers , no matter in what form , please everyone .
A joyous vision for eyes !!!
Refreshing and splendored .
Either they are real or artificial , in vases or in prints , in gardens or on walls ; in every form the colors and the aura they generate can lighten up their mood .
Flowers have always been inspiration to me .
Being obsessed with crocheting gives me enough chance to make such pretty flowers to adorn a dress , as brooches , in hat pins , or even in fashion jewelry which my daughter loves to wear .
Crochet flowers are easy to make if you know the ABC of crochet .
There are even online tutorial for simple crochet flower , which you can get at the listed websites .
But right now I ’m about to teach you how to make a very basic yet adorable crochet flower .
All you need is a simple crochet hook and two or three colors of wool .
Why wool ?
You can even make it with other threads as well but I love making it with wool .
But make sure that the width of the wool is appropriate to adjust with the hook size .
With the first color , chain 6 .
Go back into the first chain and work a dc and then chain 2 .
Repeat it for 7 times and all into the first chain .
You will get 8 spokes now .
Join up the circle with a sl st into the third chain on the left ( which is the third chain of the first spoke ) .
Now you have to make ( sc , ch 1 , 2 dc , ch 1 , sc ) all into one of the arches you have created .
This is how the petals are created .
Again repeat it in over all 8 arches and you have the first flower .
Join with a sl st to the first sc on the first petal .
Cut off .
Turn over the flower .
With the next color , whatever you choose , make a slip knot and put the crochet hook under a first color spoke and pull the second color wool through .
You now have 2 stitches on your hook , pull the hook through to make one .
Chain 6 and work a dc on the next spoke , chain 3 .
Repeat this dc , chain 3 on each spoke .
Then make a sl st into the third chain of the first row that you did .
Turn the whole thing over to the right side .
Pull the first color petals slightly forward and work ( sc , chain 1 , 3 dc , chain 1 , sc ) over each arch .
Join with a sl st into the first sc .
Cast off .
Now your flower is ready .
You can make two , three , four or even five whirls with different or even same color .
Every whirl will increase the size of the flower .
Make it as you like .

Last week 's EmTech 09 meeting played host to a panel discussion on the future of data storage .
All three of the panelists were from companies that have a poorly known product on the market , and each of them discussed improvements that are in the pipeline , which we 'll cover towards the end of this article .
But they also provided a more general overview of the challenges facing storage technology at a time when data production is beginning to outstrip our ability to cope with it .
Ed Doller , of memory maker Numonyx , put things into perspective by discussing the launch of the iPhone 3GS .
The hardware itself does n't store all that much , but its capabilities led to downstream issues : within a few weeks of its release , mobile uploads of videos to YouTube had shot up by roughly 400 percent , and it 's likely that other data - intensive activities will follow personal video before very long .
Managing the explosion of data brings its own challenges , not the least of which is maintaining the ability to read older data formats .
Peter Lorraine of GE's Global Research group said that about two - thirds of the data obtained by NASA 's Viking landers is now unreadable , and mentioned that many hospitals are on the verge of similar issues with patient medical records .
Doller set up the problem nicely : everyone wants more bandwidth and less latency .
They 're very different challenges , but each have a solution in the fact that a single interface , like SATA , can provide an abstraction to multiple pieces of hardware , often based on several different technologies .
All hard drives have fast RAM caches providing quick access to a data subset stored on the disk itself .
In the same way , huge working sets can be held in a large cache that 's backed by a massive drive array .
The relative amounts of high - speed volatile and slower , stable storage can be tailored according to the application , balancing the trade - offs among cost , reliability , power use , density , and performance .
In many cases , the abstraction provided by hardware interfaces can be essential for the function of the device .
Doller described NAND flash memory as a bit too noisy and error - prone to use directly , but noted that these issues could be masked by error correction algorithms run in the interface hardware itself .
The current generation of next - gen tech
With the set of five trade - offs laid out by Doller in mind , each of the panelists discussed where their technologies fit into the emerging storage picture .
Slow and stable : Optical disk media has perpetually lagged magnetic disks when it comes to speed , but it has two key advantages : given the right starting materials , it 's got a lifetime of decades or more , and it 's certainly faster than the current choice for long - term archiving , tape .
GE's Peter Lorraine said that 50 million terabytes of tape is sold every year , so there 's significant room on the market .
It also has the potential to reach very high densities , as the only physically limiting factor is the wavelength of the light used to read and write to the media .
His group sees optical 's challenge as increasing the density of the storage without sacrificing backwards compatibility , and the solution they 've arrived at is holographic storage .
Those of you who are thinking of 3D images can stop ; the individual points in these disks create very simple interference patterns , rather than a complex image .
But these patterns can easily be stacked on top of each other , as reading them out does n't require the same sort of reflective process used in current optical media .
The net result is a DVD - sized disk that can hold 500GB of data , with further refinements possible .
" 100 layers of Blu-ray - like storage is where things are headed , " Lorraine said .
The drive mechanism looks similar to current generations of optical storage , allowing the drives to maintain backwards compatibility .
Lorraine also said that it 's possible to create masters that can be replicated to disks in about 5 to 10 seconds , meaning that this may eventually make its way to consumer devices .
Big but fast : Saied Tehrani of Everspin gave a brief description of the company 's MRAM technology , which is a spin - off of intellectual property generated by Freescale .
It 's a mixture of standard silicon and magnetic materials ; as he described it , it is structured much like standard DRAM , but with a magnetic material replacing the capacitor .
Two magnetic layers flank a barrier to tunneling electrons .
When the orientation of both magnets is identical , it becomes easier for electrons to cross the barrier .
Everspin is currently producing 16MB MRAM modules , and Tehrani laid out some impressive figures for them : reads and writes occur with 35ns latencies , it can last for an essentially unlimited number of cycles , data is retained for at least 20 years even with the power off , and it can be radiation hardened for use in space .
With all that going for it , why are n't we using it ?
In a word , density .
MRAM has nothing that compares with the gigabytes that can be stored in the latest flash modules .
Still , Everspin is forging ahead with plans for next - generation technology based on the spin momentum of electrons .
He expects that chips based on this technology will offer 10ns access times and use one - fifth the power per bit of the equivalent flash technology .
Until the density problem gets sorted out , he suggested that MRAM will likely be limited to specialty cases , such as storing file system metadata in RAID controllers .
A change of phase : Numonyx appears to be in a similar position to Everspin , in that it 's shipping a form of RAM that promises very high speeds and long - term stability , but is currently doing so on an older process technology .
Right now , the company is making phase change memory with 90nm features .
Its bet on this technology apparently received a worrisome bit of validation later last week , when Samsung announced it was ready to start mass production of the material .
Phase change memory relies on a class of alloys called Chalcogenides , which can adopt crystalline or amorphous forms ; the crystalline form provides low resistance to currents .
Switching between the two states can be done simply by heating the alloy and carefully controlling the cooling process .
Fortunately , " carefully controlled " does n't mean " slow " — Doller said that his company has phase change devices with 17 times the access speeds of SSDs .
The bits themselves are comprised of a top electrode coated in an alloy called GST ( for its components , Ge - Sb - Te ) .
Below that is a combination electrode ( for reading the bit 's state ) and resistor , which can provide the focal heating needed to flip it .
As with Tehrani , Doller expects phase change will be relegated to specialty uses , but his company is positioning it for when NAND flash runs up against noise limits at smaller feature sizes .
A long haul for new tech
I asked the panelists what they thought about some of the potential memory technologies that had appeared in the research literature over the past couple of years , which involve things like carbon nanotubes or atomic force microscopes .
Everybody was uniformly excited about the potential that these demonstration projects held , but recognized that they 're just the latest in a long list of things that have been proposed for data storage .
To make it to market , it 's not enough to simply have fast , compact hardware .
It needs to be produced at scale , and the mass produced hardware has to be very , very reliable .
A lot of technologies have flunked this test , or waited decades for specific bottlenecks to be overcome .
Even in the best - case scenarios , it 's typically a decade between development in the lab and mass production , so you can usually expect about eight years after the first publications appear .
It 's a caution worth keeping in mind , as it seems a publication that describes something with the potential to revolutionize storage seems to show up in the scientific journals every few months .

Ezra Klein – as expected – has the best summary of what Obama accomplished last night .
After voicing a few critiques of the policies promoted by the speech and some of the rhetoric on wonkish grounds , Klein concludes :
But if Obama has n’t created the perfect plan , he ’s created something arguably more impressive : a plan that actually might pass .
That plan might not do enough to change the system , and it may not spend enough to protect everybody , but there is plenty in the proposal that will better the lives , health coverage , and financial security for millions of real people .
It will insure around 30 million Americans and protect tens of millions more from insurer discrimination , medical bankruptcy and rescission .
It will bring more evidence to medicine and more competition to the insurance market .
That may not be perfection , but it is improvement .
And it is achievable .
Klein also helpfully links to the plan posted by the White House and posted the transcript of the full speech ( though I ’ve included the New York Times link . )
For those who missed it , this interactive video from the Times is useful as well .
Andrew Sullivan meanwhile provided his useful reax ( and a part ii ) from notables around the blogosphere .
It is certainly too soon to declare victory – but last night ’s speech accomplished what Obama needed – to give the media a peg to turn around their coverage .
Through August the sizzle and dazzle came from the opponents of reform who finally were able to take on Obama and knock him down a few pegs .
They were the sexy new story after months of that post-election glow .
The White House fought back – but stayed largely above the fray .
They continued to push reform behind closed doors .
They searched for a deal that could pass .
And they took punches .
A lot of them .
Andrew Sullivan dubbed this Obama ’s rope - a - dope strategy ( and here ) back during the campaign – and it has emerged as a theme .
Bill Clinton was the “ Comeback Kid ” who would get himself into some awful jam , but them miraculously pull himself out – often with the help of the overreach of his enemies .
It was entertaining .
But Obama ’s approach is different .
He lets his opponents attack him for a long time – enough to bring down his numbers and to make his agenda unpopular – and they get to the point where they sense victory , all the while positioning himself for where he wants to be at the decisive moment .
And then he hits back .
This has happened before : during the scandal over Reverend Wright ; during the long summer of the 2008 campaign ; when Sarah Palin was nominated ; during the fight over the stimulus ; and now , on health care .
The game plan is the same – as I wrote earlier about the stimulus fight :
Sun-Tzu advised to “ accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle . ”
This seems to have been Obama ’s strategy – to allow his campaign to take hits and play defense , sticking to an overall strategy that would gain him a final decisive victory rather than exhausting his staff fighting every daily flair - up .
Sometimes , this led to awful weeks – such as the long lack of a complete response to the Rev. Wright fiasco .
But Obama ended up winning because , though he lost a thousand daily battles over Rev.
Wright , he took the long view and gave a subtle , personal speech about race .
He won that war not by fighting back charge after charge but by changing it from a war into a reflective national moment .
It ’s hard to describe how extraordinary that is – how rarely that has happened in history , and how difficult it was to imagine this was even possible , especially in the frenetic media environment that has existed since 1992 .
Clinton ’s strategy allowed him to survive personally , but was a disaster for the Democratic Party as a whole .
Obama ’s strategy seems to offer something better – a chance to win policy battles .
( Of course , the zeitgeist of the times also plays a role in the fate of Democratic policies under Clinton versus Obama as well . )
It ’s too soon to count the health care fight as won – but the administration is well - positioned to achieve what Teddy Roosevelt , Harry Truman , John F. Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , and Bill Clinton all set out to achieve ( and even what George W. Bush set out to achieve on tort reform . )
And it is so positioned because of Obama ’s clear strategic vision .

In March , American anti-gay activists traveled to Uganda for a conference that pledged to “ wipe out ” homosexuality .
Seven months later , a draconian bill has been introduced that pledges to make good on this threat .
The “ Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009 ” is so severe that it is designed to shred the spirit and suffocate the soul of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender Ugandans .
If it passes , Uganda will become a predator state that actively hunts down GLBT people to destroy them .
Uganda already punished gay intimacy with life in prison .
But , apparently that was not harsh enough , with this bill penalizing anyone who “ attempts to commit the offence ” with up to seven years in jail .
Additionally , a person charged will be forced to undergo an invasive medical examination to determine their HIV status .
If the detainees are found to be HIV + , they may be executed .
This barbaric legislation stifles free speech by threatening anyone who is accused of “ promoting ” homosexuality with five to seven year prison sentences .
Snitching on gay friends and family members is strongly encouraged because “ failure to disclose the “ offence ’ within 24 hours of knowledge makes somebody liable to a fine or imprisonment of up to three years . ”
Sadly , this witch - hunt has the blood stained fingerprints of leading American evangelicals .
The Fellowship , ( aka The Family ) one of America ’ most powerful and secretive fundamentalist organization ’ , converted Uganda ’ President Yoweri Museveni ( pictured top ) to its anti-gay brand of Christianity , which is the “ intellectual ” impetus behind the anti-gay crackdown .
The clandestine organization ’ leader , Doug Coe , calls Museveni The Fellowship ’ “ key man ” in Africa .
Jeff Sharlet , author of “ The Family ” , writes of the African strongman ’ conversion :
“ So , ” Doug Coe told us , “ my friend said to the president , “ why do n’t you come and pray with me in America ?
I have a good group of friends ‚Äîsenators , congressmen ‚ Äîwho I like to pray with , and they ’d like to pray with you . ’
And that president came to the Cedars ( a religious retreat ) , and he met Jesus .
And his name is Yoweri Museveni… And he is a good friend of the Family . ”
The Family , of course , recently made headlines because one of its key members , Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) had sex with his best friends wife , while they were working together .
Another member , Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , used one of the Family ’ Washington properties to try to broker a deal to buy off the furious husband , who has since gone public with the Ensign scandal .
It is important for people to understand that The Fellowship and other anti-gay groups have long viewed Uganda as a laboratory to experiment with Christian theocracy .
For example , fundamentalist organizations recently undermined successful HIV programs in Uganda by demanding abstinence only education , over condom use , which had been working to reduce infection rates .
This year ’ notorious Kampala conference was the opening salvo in a campaign to crush GLBT lives .
The seminar featured Scott Lively , author of The Pink Swastika , who blames the holocaust on gay people .
The hate forum also featured Don Schmierer , a board member of the “ ex - gay ” organization Exodus International , and Caleb Lee Brundidge , who works with discredited ex-gay “ reorientation coach ” Richard Cohen .
These American “ ex - gay ” activists clearly left their stamp on this evil legislation , giving Ugandan officials a way to justify the abuse because they can claim that “ sinful ” gays can choose to change .
“ This legislation further recognizes the fact that same sex attraction is not an innate and immutable characteristic and that people who experience this mental disorder can and have changed to a heterosexual orientation , ” the bill said .
“ It also recognizes that because homosexuals are not born that way , but develop this disorder based on experiences and environmental conditions , it is preventable , especially among young people who are most vulnerable to recruitment into the homosexual lifestyle . ”
Following the infamous conference , a Kampala newspaper named local gay people , placing their lives in immediate danger .
Now , the government may soon declare it open season on GLBT individuals .
In 1994 , I brought Rev. Mel White down to speak at an event in Fort Lauderdale .
In his address , the former Christian right ghostwriter proclaimed of his previous employers , “ They want you dead . ”
The comment was at once riveting and alarmist to some in the crowd .
Yet , the painful silence of anti-gay activists at home is making White appear downright prophetic .
These Christian Colonialists invaded Uganda ’ politics and culture , and the result is that they have ruined the lives of its GLBT citizens .
The Fellowship , Exodus and other American fundamentalist organizations , appear quite unbothered by the poisonous fruits of their labor .
Uganda is a proxy in their culture war and we are witnessing exactly what these fanatics might do if they did not have the United States Constitution blocking their pious path to power .
Let the record show that their “ key man ” controlled Uganda when a religious terror campaign was waged against an innocent minority — and these good Christians stood by and did not lift a finger to stop the horror .

Dell ’s Motherboard.tv visits Moby ’s Manhattan apartment studio , where he talks about his “ Noah ’s arc ” of rarified gadgets , bizarre synthesizers , and vintage drum machines .
If you did n’t hate Moby for having a better birthday than you , the multiple duplicate rare drum machines that line his studio walls may just push you over that edge .
Best line : “ A rock band cannot rehearse in the suburbs at 3 o’clock in the morning .
You can make electronic music at 3 o’clock in the morning , and your mom does n’t complain . “
Now the test begins .
Whenever the subject gives an incorrect answer , she is given a powerful jolt of electricity .
The witnesses watching on television see her writhe in pain and hear her scream .
They think she is being tortured .
One group of volunteers is now given a choice : they can transfer the shocked subject to a different learning paradigm , where she is given positive reinforcements instead of painful punishments .
Not surprisingly , the vast majority of people choose to end the torture .
They quickly act to rectify the injustice .
When asked what they thought of the " learner , " they described her as an innocent victim who did n't deserve to be shocked .
That 's why they saved her .
The other group of subjects , however , is n't allowed to rescue the volunteer undergoing the test .
Instead , they are told a variety of different stories about the victim .
Some were told that she would receive nothing in return for being tortured ; others were told that she would be paid for her participation .
And a final group was given the martyr scenario , in which the victim submits to a second round of torture so that the other volunteers might benefit from her pain .
She is literally sacrificing herself for the group .
How did these different narratives affect their view of the victim ?
All of the volunteers watched the exact same video of torture .
They saw the same poor woman get subjected to painful shocks .
And yet the stories powerfully influenced their conclusions about her character .
Here the most disturbing data point : the less money the volunteer received in compensation for her suffering the more the subjects disliked her .
The people explained the woeful injustice by assuming that it was her own fault : she was shocked because she was n't paying attention , or was incapable of learning , or that the pain would help her perform better .
The martyrs fared even worse .
Even though this victim was supposedly performing an act of altruism - she was suffering for the sake of others - the witnesses thought she was the most culpable of all .
Her pain was proof of her guilt .
Lerner 's conclusion was unsettling : " The sight of an innocent person suffering without possibility of reward or compensation motivated people to devalue the attractiveness of the victim in order to bring about a more appropriate fit between her fate and her character . "
The moral of the Just World Hypothesis is that people have a powerful intuition that the world is just and that people get what they deserve .
While I ’m sure this instinct makes all sorts of social contracts possible , it also leads to one very troubling tendency : we often rationalize injustices away , so that we can maintain our naive belief in a just world .
This , I believe , is what happens when we read about innocent people getting sent to Guantanamo , or the wrong immigrant getting waterboarded , or why it ’s so easy to brush aside calls for prison reform .
We might acknowledge the awfulness of the error , but then quip that he should n’t have been hanging around with the Taliban , or that the guy who got sent to prison for a crime he did n’t commit was still a creep , or that the Madoff victims should have known their money manager was a fraud .
In other words , we act like the subjects in the Lerner experiment blaming the innocent volunteer , as we search for reasons why the wrongfully treated deserved what they got .
Subsequent studies have found that people with " a strong tendency to believe in a just world " tend to exhibit certain characteristics : they 're much more likely to admire political leaders and existing social institutions , and have negative attitudes toward underprivileged groups .
Furthermore , they " feel less of a need to engage in activities to change society or to alleviate plight of social victims . "
Is there any way out of this cognitive trap ?
The only thing I can think of is education : people are shocked out of their complacence .
After all , if an honest man can get executed than maybe the world is n’t so just .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Mr Khadr was 15 when he was captured by US forces in Afghanistan Canada 's Federal Court of Appeal has upheld a lower court ruling ordering the government to seek the return a Canadian detainee at Guantanamo Bay .
The judges upheld the view of Omar Khadr 's lawyers that the government 's refusal to ask for his repatriation infringed his constitutional rights .
A foreign ministry spokeswoman said it would review the court 's decision .
Mr Khadr , who has been in detention for six years , is accused of killing a US soldier in Afghanistan when he was 15 .
Now 22 , he faces multiple terrorism - related charges , the most serious of which is murder .
He could be sentenced to life in jail if convicted .
' No option '
In April , a Canadian federal judge ruled that Ottawa had to help Mr Khadr , a Canadian citizen born in Toronto , on the grounds that his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been infringed .
Mr Khadr was entitled to such rights because Canadian officials had allegedly been complicit in his mistreatment , the judge said .
While Canada may have preferred to stand by and let the proceedings against Mr Khadr in the United States run their course , the violation of his Charter rights by Canadian officials has removed that option
Federal Court of Appeal
Canada given insight into Guantanamo
To mitigate the effect of the violations , Canada had to present a request for Mr Khadr 's repatriation as soon as practicable , he added .
The government subsequently appealed , saying it should have " unfettered discretion to decide whether and when to request the return of a Canadian citizen detained in a foreign country " .
It was " a matter within its exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs , " government lawyers said in court documents .
But the appeal court found there was no factual basis to conclude that the ruling represented a serious intrusion into the government 's responsibility for foreign affairs , or that requesting Mr Khadr 's return would risk damaging Canada 's relations with the US .
" While Canada may have preferred to stand by and let the proceedings against Mr Khadr in the United States run their course , the violation of his Charter rights by Canadian officials has removed that option , " Justice John Evans and Justice K Sharlow said .
A spokeswoman for Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said the government would review " carefully " the court of appeal 's decision .
It could still bring its case to the country 's Supreme Court .
After the ruling , Mr Khadr 's lawyer Dennis Edney said : " It 's about time for Mr. Harper to follow the rule of law and now make real efforts to bring Omar Khadr home and not delay the process any further . "
Mr Edney has said his client would be willing to be prosecuted in Canada and to undergo a period away from his family , who in the past have had ties to al - Qaida .

I 'm trying to finish reviewing the new CBS shows before I move onto ABC's The Forgotten and then to old shows , so please bear with me .
Imagine NCIS .
Transport it all the way to the West Coast .
Imagine bikinis and palm trees .
Replace the characters .
Now you have NCIS : Los Angeles .
This is n't necessarily a bad thing , NCIS is the best crime procedural on television right now , but do we need a copy ?
Or more pertinently , do we want a copy ?
That 's up for the viewers to decide , but I 'm here for the review .
If you have n't watched NCIS and do n't want to catch up on 6 season and want to watch something similar from the start , here 's your chance .
After a dead Navy intelligence officer is found after a shootout between the police and cartel members , Callan ( Chris O'Donnell ) comes in to the new headquarters which is much better than the grimy warehouse that was used in the 2 NCIS episodes .
It turns out that he was in some business with Mexicans .
After some digging around the team finds out that his daughter was kidnapped and the officer had to help them access satellite imagery before a joint US - Mexico operation along the border .
There is a twist that was n't particularly shocking .
It turns out that the daughter 's father , the officer 's wife 's ex-husband " kidnapped " her .
How 's that for apostrophes ?
I had a sneaking suspicion he was up to something after I heard his Spanish name .
Callan and Hanna ( LL Cool J ) walk into the house posing as people with access to satellites .
The father already knows NCIS is involved , so the situation quickly escalates into a fight .
The good guys win and the bad guys die .
Not particularly original but it was still good .
The thing I liked about NCIS being spun off of JAG is that the 2 shows were fairly different .
In the case of NCIS and NCIS : LA , they are pretty much the same .
LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell have great chemistry and we 'll probably be seeing them together for most of the episodes which is a plus .
The other characters took a back seat as Callen and Hanna did most of the legwork .
There was n't anything particularly interesting about them , but if anyone catches my attention in later episodes , I 'll be sure to bring it up .
Linda Hunt 's character Hetty was a new addition replacing Louise Lombard 's Macy .
I 'm not sure why everyone had so much problems with Macy .
I rewatched the 2 episodes featuring them , and found nothing wrong with the acting or the character .
Hetty is eccentric and really short .
If you 've seen the Disney movie The Incredibles , she looks almost exactly the same as Edna Mode , the gadget lady .
I thought the addition of Vance was useless since he 'll be on a little screen all the way in DC .
I do n't like Vance anyways and a double dosage of him is even worse .
Depending on how much time you have , it might be better spent watching NCIS .
I have lots of time , so count on me for another review next week .
Score : 8.6/10
“ The public option , whether we have it or we do n’t have it , is not the entirety of health care reform , ” the president said .
“ This is just one sliver of it , one aspect of it . ”
For Mr. Obama , giving up on the public plan would have risks and rewards .
The reward is that he could punch a hole in Republican arguments that he wants a “ government takeover ” of health care and possibly win some Republican votes .
The risk is that he could alienate liberal Democrats , whose support he will also need to pass a bill .
On Sunday , Senator John D. Rockefeller IV , Democrat of West Virginia , affirmed his support for the public option .
“ I believe the inclusion of a strong public plan option in health reform legislation is a must , ” Mr. Rockefeller said in a statement .
“ It is the only proven way to guarantee that all consumers have affordable , meaningful and accountable options available in the health insurance marketplace . ”
White House officials say the president has not abandoned the idea of a pure government plan , a central feature of the legislation moving through the House .
But Ms. Sebelius ’s comments did seem to open the door , and at least one Democrat close to the White House said the administration was well aware that , with moderate Senate Democrats opposed to the idea of a public plan , Mr. Obama might have to give up on the notion to get a bill through .
“ The president is going to continue to try to persuade everyone of the great value of having a true public plan , ” said this Democrat , who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid discussing strategy publicly .
” But at the end of the day , I believe he recognizes that there are other , arguably less effective , ways to achieve greater coverage , more choice , better quality and lower cost in our system . ”

On 23 September , 2009 , Joel Spolsky wrote a piece extolling the virtues of the duct tape programmer .
He contrasted the duct tape worldview to the astronaut architect .
While the astronaut architect would sit in analysis paralysis , the duct tape programmer would have some working product already out the door .
“ He is the guy you want on your team building go - carts , because he has two favorite tools : duct tape and WD - 40 .
And he will wield them elegantly even as your go - cart is careening down the hill at a mile a minute .
This will happen while other programmers are still at the starting line arguing over whether to use titanium or some kind of space - age composite material that Boeing is using in the 787 Dreamliner . ” – from http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html
While indulging in analysis paralysis is certainly the downfall of some , there are more alternatives than merely pulling out duct tape and throwing something together .
We also have to keep in mind how to apply advice and from where the advice is coming .
Matt Hinze put it nicely on twitter :
“ i’ve said it before , @jbogard : never take software advice from a bug tracking system salesman ” – from http://twitter.com/mhinze/status/4341230362
If you have small tasks , using the duct tape solution will probably serve you well .
Physical analogies are powerful , so I will stay with the duct tape metaphor .
Duct tape is strong .
It is sticky .
It is easy to apply .
On the other hand , it is not durable ( it deteriorates in water and direct sunlight ) .
It is not removed or reapplied easily , and God help you if you get it stuck to itself .
There are good uses for the duct tape approach , and there are times when it is professional negligence .
If I ’m developing an application or website for a political candidate , I ’m probably fine using duct tape , but I have two constraints :
I throw the whole thing away when my candidate loses .
My candidate succeeds , gets more funding , and I redo the whole thing .
The argument for quick and dirty solutions is always geared toward getting the first version out quickly .
Time to market !
Time to market !
For small products , it works fine , but for larger systems , the code base can collapse on itself after a life of taking shortcuts .
This effect is well documented in the book , Clean Code .
The third option , which Mr. Spolsky neglects to address , is the approach put forth by Kent Beck , in his book , Extreme Programming Explained .
I highly recommend the book , but I will quote extremeprogramming .org since it is freely accessible .
While getting stuck in analysis paralysis or complex solutions is certainly not a good way to go , XP stresses Simplicity as a key principle :
“ A simple design always takes less time to finish than a complex one .
So always do the simplest thing that could possibly work next .
If you find something that is complex replace it with something simple .
It ’s always faster and cheaper to replace complex code now , before you waste a lot more time on it . ” – from http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html ( emphasis mine )
One part of Mr. Spolsky ’s premise is supported by this XP principle .
That is , if you are creating a system where a throwaway solution is appropriate ( you throw away duct tape – you do n’t refactor it ) , then that is the simplest thing that will work as you need it to .
On the other hand , if you are creating critical business applications like my company does , you want to ensure you are :
Using durable materials Using malleable techniques so the 2nd , 3rd versions go well
The entire system is clean ( no broken windows )
The nasty truth about misapplying duct tape solutions in serious software development is that the duct tape solution ends up creating unnecessary additional complexity because it does n’t address the whole problem , just the symptoms .
This is n’t unique to software development , but if duct tape solutions are used to achieve short term gains , then future solutions are built on a foundation of duct tape instead of some sound organizational method .
All of us have used quick and dirty fixes , but the craftsmanship quotient applies if we quickly replace the naive fix with a more organized one .
The patch panel on the left has an organization method .
The patch panel on the right has responded over time to “ just one more cable ” without much effort to proper organization .
Conclusion
The choices presented between duct tape programming and analysis paralysis are not valid .
There are many choices , and quick and dirty fixes should not be standard operating procedure ( SOP ) .
Organized software engineering should prevail .
Approaches that apply rigorous discipline will always yield better product .
Both discipline about keeping scope under control so that you can ship quickly , and solid engineering techniques to ensure that what is shipped is maintainable for the next version .

Blue tits use medicinal plants to disinfect their nests , scientists have discovered .
The birds line their nests with aromatic plants such as mint or lavender , which kill bacteria .
That creates a more sterile environment for chicks , which in turn grow faster and have a better chance of survival .
However , individual blue tits are quite picky about which plants they use , and it is not clear how they pass their knowledge on to other birds .
A number of European bird species add aromatic plants to their nests .
Starlings , for instance , usually bring back aromatic plants as part of a courtship display designed to attract females .
But they stop doing so as soon as a female lays her eggs , suggesting the plants are for display only .
Lavender and achillea leaves line this egg - filled nest On Corsica , blue tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus ) also incorporate fresh fragments of aromatic plants including lavender , mint and curry plants into their nests .
" We hypothesised that aromatic plants used by blue tits had some anti-parasite properties , because most of these plants , or close species of the same genus , are traditional Mediterranean plants with well - known medicinal properties , " says Adele Mennerat , a biologist now at the University of Bergen in Norway .
Germ killer Mennerat and colleagues from France 's National Centre of Scientific Research , based in Montpellier , and the University of Toulouse initially tested whether these plants deterred blow fly larvae that commonly live in tit nests and feed on chicks ' blood , significantly damaging their health .
" Despite repeated attempts we could never find any effect of these plants on blow fly infestation , " Mennerat says .
" So we tested the effects of these plants on the bacteria living on birds . "
A clean , fragrant bed The researchers describe their results in the journal Oecologia .
They found that aromatic plants , including lavender ( Lavandula stoechas ) , apple mint ( Mentha suaveolens ) , the curry plant ( Helichrysum itlaicum ) and Achillea ligustica significantly change the composition of bacterial communities living on blue tit nestlings .
" They reduce the number of different bacterial species , and the total number of bacteria , especially on chicks that are most vulnerable because they are both highly infested by blow fly larvae and carry great amounts of bacteria on their skin , " says Mennarat .
It is unclear exactly how volatile compounds produced by the aromatic plants kill the bacteria .
But blue tit chicks living in nests adorned with aromatic plants grew faster and had a higher proportion of red blood cells , which is known to be a strong indicator of a chick 's future chances of survival after fledging .
Mennerat cannot yet be sure but she suspects that living in a disinfected nest enables the chicks to allocate less energy to their immune systems and more to growing physically .
Much remains to be explained , however .
Lavender is an effective antimicrobial
No other bird has yet been shown to use aromatherapy in the same way , while related species such as the great tit or coal tit do not even decorate their nests with such plants .
So it is unclear how the behaviour originated in blue tits .
Different birds also prefer different aromatics , regardless of their local availability , the researchers found .
" One of the most unexpected findings we got was that female blue tits display individual preferences in their use of aromatic plant species , " says Mennerat .
" For example , in a territory with big bushes of lavender , for some reason blue tits at this site still collect mint that can only be found far away from their nests .
We still do n't know why and how blue tits have such individual preferences . "
The researchers are also keen to discover how these personal aromatic preferences are passed on between birds .

Luc Montagnier is an interesting and strange character .
Last year he was a shared winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine .
A remarkable achievement .
However , his latest research can only really be described as quite bizarre and some of his statements , are desperately and deadly worrying .
So much so , that I think Montagnier ought to be the first recipient of both a Nobel and IgNobel prize .
Let me explain .
In the past few weeks we have seen the announcements for the winners of the 2009 Nobel Prizes for Science .
They are the highest accolade achievable by a scientist and are given to honour outstanding contributions to their field .
Last year , French scientist Luc Montagnier shared the award for medicine for his part in the discovery of the HIV virus – something that has undoubtedly resulted in many lives being saved .
A few days before , we also saw announcements for the winners of the 2009 IgNobel Prizes .
Lesser known , these prizes honour research that ‘ cannot or should not be replicated ’ .
The idea of the prizes is to ‘ make people laugh and then make people think ’ .
Previous winners have included decidedly odd but sensible papers on the side effects of sword swallowing and the the word " the " — and of the many ways it causes problems for anyone who tries to put things into alphabetical order , to the completely batty papers , such as for the ‘ discovery ’ that “ not only does water have memory , but that the information can be transmitted over telephone lines and the Internet ” , from homeopathic researcher Jacques Benveniste .
In January of this year , Montagnier published quite a remarkable paper entitled , “ Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences ” in the Journal of Interdisciplinary Sciences : Computational Life Sciences .
The headline makes a bold claim : that diluted DNA from pathogenic bacterial and viral species is able to emit specific radio waves .
Furthermore , there are claims that these radio waves might be associated with ‘ nanostructures ’ in the solution that might be able to recreate the pathogen .
These radio waves do not appear to be emitted by ‘ probiotic “ good ” bacteria ’ .
After diluting solutions to the point to where no DNA could remain , it is claimed these ‘ nanostructures ’ somehow emit radio waves and recreate the pathogens .
Luc Montagnier makes startling claims that ,
In patients infected with HIV , EMS can be detected mostly in patients treated by antiretroviral therapy and having a very low viral load in their plasma .
Such nanostructures persisting in the plasma may contribute to the viral reservoir which escapes the antiviral treatment , assuming that they carry genetic information of the virus .
The claims in the paper are simply unbelievable : that by serially diluting and agitating solutions of infectious agents , ‘ nano ’ structures can be set up in water that can emit specific radio frequencies and that even after filtration that should remove all traces of biological molecules , the pathogens can be cultured and detected , somehow by recreation .
At least , I think that is what is being claimed .
The paper , it is fair to comment , lacks any rigour .
It is a sequence of ad hoc assertions , hypotheses and post hoc rationalisations .
Important experimental steps are described dismissively in a sentence and little attempt is made to describe the detail of the work .
There are many problems with the paper , not least that it is pretty much self - published in a journal without rigorous peer - review ( it took two days from ‘ receipt ’ of the paper to publishing ) and the journal was set up and edited by Montagnier himself .
I am not sure where to begin .
But let me start with one massive problem that should have resulted in the paper ending up in the compost bin of science .
It appears to fly in the face of one the greatest traditions of post - enlightenment thinking in that it seeks to reintroduce an anthropocentric view of the universe .
The great early strides in scientific thought removed human beings from their special place in the universe .
Primitive views placed us at the centre of creation with all things placed around us for our care .
We were special .
Gradually , we learned that the Earth was not the centre of the universe , and neither even was the Sun .
We learned that we were not separate from creation , but part of a continuum of biological existence that joined all living things together .
Our minds did not make us different from the rocks as we could see that biological processes differed merely in complexity and scale from the more mundane chemical and physical processes around us .
So , Montagnier is proposing that these electromagnetic signals are only given off by pathogenic organisms .
This assertion cries out the question – pathogenic to whom ?
Are we to believe that these DNA signals are only given off by infectious agents to humans ?
That would be a most staggering claim .
What about infectious agents for other species ?
Do they not get handy radio signals too ?
And what if a particular human has specific immunity to a virus ?
Does the DNA sequence somehow know that it much switch off its broadcasts ?
Bonkers .
This is to leave aside how DNA could actually transmit radio waves .
The generation of such a signal would require an oscillating current at the right frequency .
How this could be achieved by a sequence of DNA is unanswered – probably because it is physically absurd .
The experimental apparatus itself looks decidedly amateurish with a the central detection mechanism appearing to be a coil of wire plugged into the soundcard of a PC via a device claimed to be invented by another infamous Frenchman , J Benveniste ( previous IgNobel winner ) .
Few details are given about this device .
It would appear , at first glance , to be a device designed to pick up background radio emissions .
Indeed , the signals appears to be strong around the frequencies emitted by mains equipment and the paper does indeed mention that these signals disappear when attempts are removed to reduce background noise ( such as by switching off other equipment ) .
However , rather than conclude that the device is merely picking up noise , the paper asserts that the background noise is required to induce ‘ resonance phenomena ’ .
Your chin should be beginning to itch here .
It does indeed look as if the experimental result are the result of digging around in the noise and finding signals at the limit of detection – a classical hallmark of pathological science where an unblinded researcher keeps probing noise until they convince themselves they are seeing signals .
( see N-rays for a parallel , ‘ discovered ’ by yet another Frenchman , the physicist René - Prosper Blondlot . )
The paper takes even stranger twists when we look at the background to the paper .
The Telegraph reported that Montagnier was in a legal battle with inventor Bruno Robert over the rights to the device that can detect the fantastical radio waves .
Both Montagnier and Robert submitted patent applications for the same device :
The Telegraph makes no mention that the device is clearly crackpot .
It is worth reading the patent examiner ’s scathing assessment of the application , who concludes ,
The invention is based on phenomena which contradict the fundamental principle of physics and of chemistry , i.e. the existence of biological or effect without an active molecule and no explanation or theoretical basis makes it impossible at the current time to explain the results obtained .
The story takes another breathtaking turn when it is realised that the device pictured above is identical to the one used by Jacques Benveniste to ‘ digitise ’ homeopathic signals and send them by email .
IgNobel prize winning stuff .
This research was replicated using the same device at the request of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and no signal was detected .
It would appear that neither Montagnier or Robert were the inventor , but instead , the late , great , discredited Benveniste – homeopathic apologist and experimenter into nonsense .
So , the French appear to fighting over the legacy of their greatest pseudo - scientist .
Montagnier is clearly dabbling in the black arts of homeopathy and the homeopaths are crowing about it .
My old friend Dana Ullman , whose academic thoroughness I took apart when he declared homeopathy had saved Charles Darwin , is jumping for joy over Montagnier ’s research .
He is not the most self critical thinker around .
Harriet Hall demolishes his claims .
So , no doubt Montagnier deserves an IgNobel prize .
His research makes us laugh .
His apparatus has already earned the prize when the prize is clearly for research that ‘ should not be repeated ’ .
The IgNobel committee need to ram the message home .
But the award should be also for research that then makes is think .
And what I see makes me think that Montagnier could lead to seriously bad consequences .
Not content with merely trying to perpetuate the discarded nonsense of previous homeopathic quacks , he appears to picks up the ideology of the homeopathic mindset .
Montagnier appears in the AIDS denialist film House of Numbers saying that HIV can be ‘ cleared naturally ’ by nutritional means .
All it requires is to have a ‘ good immune system ’ .
I see no evidence to support such claims .
Now , many scientists were misrepresented in this disingenuous film , but it looks hard to see how Montagnier was .
These views are not without terrible potential consequences .
Such views lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people who are dependent on governments to provide a decent level of care for people with HIV .
Montagnier ’s status as a Nobel Prize winner lends a level of credence to these views that they do not deserve .
His authority will be used by those who wish to exploit the vulnerable with quack cures .
This is life and death stuff .
Nobel prizes are the greatest scientific honour , but they also create false authorities and science , unique in human endeavours , does not need authorities .
It runs on evidence , reason and critical thinking .
And that is dangerously missing from Montagnier ’s work .
Nobel Prize winners often feel a sense that they are freed to dream thoughts that others cannot .
That is , on balance , a good thing .
Science can make huge strides when people are able to think the unthinkable .
But all Nobel unthinkable thoughts need not be true .
In fact , very few will be .
We need to be on our guard against those that exploit the false authority of the Nobel Laureate and examine all scientific claims with equal dispassion .
Police officers will have less paperwork to fill after conducting some searches Police officers will no longer have to fill out lengthy forms when they stop and search people in the street , the home secretary has announced .
But Alan Johnson in a speech to the Police Superintendents '
Association said that the " bureaucracy dragon has yet to be slain " .
He called on individual forces to take responsibility for cutting paperwork .
The stop and search forms have been criticised for being complicated and bureaucratic .
The form was introduced as a result of an inquiry in the aftermath of the murder of Stephen Lawrence .
As well as recording someone 's name and why they have been stopped , officers currently also have to answer in writing a series of questions including whether anything was found and if any damage or injury was caused .
Local requirements are often equally , if not more , burdensome and this needs to be addressed too
Alan Johnson , Home Secretary
But now Mr Johnson says the information officers record when they stop a suspect but do not arrest them could be reduced from more than 10 points to just two or three .
Those points would include ethnicity and reason for search .
It could save officers up to 200,000 hours every year .
Public confidence
The change is the latest in a series of moves aimed at increasing the amount of time officers can spend not doing paperwork .
But Mr Johnson stressed the onus was not just on the central government .
" Local requirements are often equally , if not more , burdensome and this needs to be addressed too .
" For example , while the stop and account form has been abolished I have heard of instances where neighbourhood police officers are still filling in forms even though it is no longer required , " he added .
Paperwork linked to stop and searches conducted under counter - terrorism legislation will remain unaltered .
Such searches have been criticised for being too intrusive and for undermining public confidence in police .

On July 4th 2007 , four women vowed to do something about our lack of activity and dissatisfaction with the state of the world .
We decided that we would not allow apathy to ruin our lives , and never to become desensitized or complacent .
A.L.I.E.N.S is created in response to the feelings we felt that day .
A.L.I.E.N.S firmly believes that no subject should / will be taboo .
We refuse to , either mentally or politically discourage ideas or agenda 's out of conformity and / or status quo preservation .
We are limitless because we are original .
We realize that fear drives 95 % of our behavior , and therefore things become impossible to change .
We will not be afraid to explore , discuss , analyze , or act upon any detail of our existence .
We are looking forward to becoming a group filled with intelligent individuals .
We do ALIENate individuals who will not be good for our group dynamic .
The only criteria is that we seek people who are in a constant state of learning for participation in group discussion .
School , textbooks , and the media did not make us this way .
We made the conscious effort .
We seek out other individuals who have taken it upon themselves to learn about the world we live in , out of selflessness and the desire to make it better .
We believe in order to support the unpopular notion that change is necessary to humanity , we must all change .
Some people are change resistant and this filters to every aspect of their lives ; including their personality and beliefs .
A.L.I.E.N.S does not want to be that way .
We always want to grow , change , develop and adapt .
How else will we learn as people and groups if we do not dare to challenge our existing ideas ?
A.L.I.E.N.S wants to be in a constant state of mental / political evolution .
From Science Fiction to Socialism , from every subject to every barrier , we are nerds .
We are nerds and in being so , we are already isolated from the status quo .
Many of our members self identify as nerds in addition to our proclaimed self - identities .
The personal is political .
We stand firmly and united on the issues that Sexism , Racism , Classism , Homophobia , etc. , are to be challenged .
They are not just wrong .
Because the statement that things are wrong is nothing more than an acknowledgement .
It does not change things , people , events or circumstances .
We believe that unlearning is as important as learning .
You can not do these things without unity .
In addition , we want to offer solidarity in action to those who need it .
A group cannot function if the members are not looking out for each other .
People may not agree on issues but that does not make us any less united .
One of the most important aspects of this Organization is to give other politically minded people a place to grow and build .
We like to refer to this solidarity as ALIENation : Separate from others , but united in ourselves .
We are the Action of Limitless Intelligent and Evolving Nerds in Solidarity .

The government is appealing to industry , academics and individuals to develop new technologies to fight terrorism .
One such gadget - a device to stop a speed boat - is already under development under its science and technology strategy .
The device is being tested at five locations around the UK
At the Defence Diving School near Portsmouth , a team of Home Office scientists and industry experts are developing a device that aims to achieve what some consider to be the near impossible .
Their mission ?
Stopping a speed boat - possibly laden with explosives - from reaching its target , without the use of lethal force .
Cyber terrorism
The device , known as the Air Launch Running Gear Entanglement System , looks like a futuristic bazooka out of the imagination of a Hollywood prop designer .
The US Coastguard has expressed a keen interest .
Compressed air is used on the shoulder - held device to propel a line from a pursuing boat which drags with it a high - tech , high tensile net to disable the target craft 's propulsion system .
Resources need to be drawn together to combat terrorism , says Lord West Watching repeated trials of the system is Admiral Lord West of Spithead - the Home Office 's counter terrorism minister .
Explaining how the system might be used in the future , he said : " Let 's say now we 're off Weymouth in 2012 and we 're doing the Olympic games , and we suddenly find a boat .
" What we want to be able to do is stop it without actually having to kill the people in the boat , or risk killing the people in the boat . "
The device is being tested at five locations around the UK while a decision is made over its future deployment .
Lord West says the " boat - stopping system " is only a small part of what science and technology can do to help counter the terrorist threat .
It extends from cyber terrorism to reducing risk in crowded places and investigating how to intercept new methods of telecommunications , he adds .
" To defeat this terrorist threat to our nation , we needed to draw on all our resources , and what we are very good at as a nation is science technology and academic research , and actually within our industries we can produce really good things . "
The science and technology strategy is , according to Lord West , designed to help keep " one step ahead of the terrorists " .
The Home Office is casting its own net as wide as possible to garner innovative ideas - and is encouraging industry and even private individuals to come forward .

Liberal glee over Barack Obama 's election was accompanied in some quarters by smart people who claim to know something about U.S. politics engaged in a smug , even triumphal dance of joy over the defeat of American conservatism .
Gary Kamiya , the executive editor of Salon.com , equated the voters to " dogs " and conservative policy proscriptions to " dog food " when he wrote in a post- election essay that " The painful truth for conservatives is that the dogs are n't eating their dog food — and every national trend indicates that they will never eat it again . "
Explaining that the ouster of conservatives from Washington " has been a long time coming , " Kamiya opined that the road ahead for the Republicans presented " a wrenching choice : remain true to its increasingly irrelevant and rejected ideology and fade into political insignificance , or remake itself as essentially a more moderate version of the Democratic Party . "
What a difference six months make .
The most recent Gallup poll on national ideological leanings , released August 14 , shows quite clearly that , while not a majority of the country , today " more Americans consider themselves conservative than liberal , " something that is a far cry from the collapse of conservatism analysis Kamiya and others advanced in the wake of the 2008 election .
In the new survey , conservatives outnumber liberals in all 50 states while liberals outnumber conservatives , and this is no great surprise , in the District of Columbia .
More to the point , the lead is statistically significant in 47 states while being inside the margin of error in only three : Hawaii , Vermont , and Massachusetts .
The map shown here breaks the data down by gradations , with states where the conservatives ' advantage over liberals is greater than 25 percentage points defined as " Most Conservative . "
Net conservatism registering 20 to 25 points is defined as " More Conservative " ; from 10 to 19 points as " Somewhat Conservative " ; and from 1 to 9 points as " Less Conservative . "
Ominously for President Obama , the states that are " Somewhat , " " More , " and " Most Conservative " resemble a map showing a victory in the Electoral College .

The sound of bat on ball on a summer 's evening .
Plenty of fast bowling , big hitting and safe hands in the field .
But this is n't cricket , it 's baseball .
British baseball - a game whose origins date back more than 100 years .
To the uninitiated it might look like a game of rounders , but it is far from it .
With bowlers throwing the ball down at what seems like the speed of a bullet , this is a long way from the gentle game played in school playgrounds up and down the country .
The rules too , are subtly different - a mix of cricket , softball and American baseball .
British Baseball has been a recognised sport since the end of the 19th Century - its stronghold was in port cities like Cardiff , Newport , Glasgow and Liverpool .
If you take your son to a cricket match , he might hardly get a bat ... or a bowl , whereas in baseball everyone is involved from the start
Mark Jones , Grange Albion chairman
It was a tough , basic game played on parkland by sailors and " their planks of wood " when they came home on shore leave .
I play a fair bit of cricket and fancied my chances with the chunky , flat - faced bat used in British Baseball .
But after a couple of deliveries whistled past my ear , I sensibly put the bat down and spoke to Tony Hicks , coach of one of oldest teams in Cardiff - Grange Albion .
" Yes , it is a tough working - class game where there 's a fair bit of banter , " he said .
" But we all know each other and there 's a great social side to the game . "
When I asked Tony if he feared for the future of the game he said : " It will never die out because there will always be a hardcore of clubs where they 'll always play baseball .
" We still have our Wales v England internationals and the buzz of pulling on that jersey is amazing but , yes , I 'd really love it to become a truly national game . "
Grange Albion celebrated their centenary in 2007 with a match against Wales British baseball is now only really played in Cardiff , in Newport and in Liverpool - but it has a loyal and vocal support .
Players and coaches watch , with some envy , at the money and status being lavished on other sports - sports they say are nowhere near as exciting or as inclusive as this .
Grange Albion are reigning Welsh league champions .
" If you take your son to a cricket match , he might hardly get a bat ( in the lower order ) or a bowl , whereas in baseball , everyone is involved from the start , " said Chairman Mark Jones as he watched Albion 's players warm up for one of their biggest game of the season on Sunday .
The 102 - year - old club last weekend narrowly lost to arch rivals Grange Catholics in the Welsh Baseball Union cup final - the first time the two teams had met in the Welsh game 's showpiece .
But there is a chance for almost instant revenge when the two teams meet again in the final of the Ted Peterson Cup on Sunday .
" We 'll get around 1,000 people here - can you believe that ? " beamed Jones .
British baseball is a tough , exciting game and players - men and women - love it .
As for me I 'll stick to cricket for the time being and a bit of vocal encouragement from the sidelines .
* Grange Albion beat Grange Catholics to win the Ted Peterson Cup by 14 runs .

Eh .
I had to give up halfway through , not because the puzzle was difficult , I knew exactly what to do , but just because I was always consistently one centimeter from the end goal .
At the end of the day , a puzzle is about giving you the satisfaction of victory from the 'ah ha' moment , not about frustrating someone to hell and back because they already KNOW what to do , but lack the skill or calculation to pull it off .
The world ’s coral reefs save us $ 172 billion every year , but they ’re on the brink of collapse ( PDF ) because of political inertia , an ecological economist has told the global Diversitas biodiversity conference in Cape Town , South Africa .
The claim was made by Pavan Sukhdev , an economist based at United Nations Environment Programme ’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge , UK .
Sukhdev is head of a European Commission study called The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) , an international project to raise awareness about the economic benefits of biodiversity .
Previously , it had been estimated that coral reefs “ earn ” nearly $ 30 billion a year ( PDF ) by attracting tourists , protecting commercial fish species and protecting coasts from storm surges .
To investigate the economic value of coral reefs further , Sukhdev and his colleagues reviewed 80 studies carried out between 1995 to 2009 .
Their work suggests that a single hectare of coral reef can be worth from $ 130,000 to $ 1.2 million a year .

Pretty bleak
However , discussing the economic value of coral reefs is like fiddling while Rome burns , says Sukhdev .
“ The entire ecosystem is on the point of collapse , ” he says .
“ Unless negotiators in Copenhagen [ in Denmark , at the UN climate talks in December ] agree to limit atmospheric carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million , they will sentence the world ’s coral reefs to death . ”
Politicians are currently hoping to limit CO 2 to 450 parts per million , he says .
“ Frankly , it does look pretty bleak . ”
“ The most cost - effective and easiest way to save our coral reefs is to reduce deforestation and boost reforestation , ” says Sukhdev .
“ I hope that politicians going to Copenhagen give the proposals to cut deforestation put forward by REDD - Plus the attention they deserve . ”
REDD - Plus is a scheme supported by the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries .
Stephen Mangi , an environmental economist based at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK , says that it ’s crucial that researchers start placing economic values on the ecosystem services they study .
“ In terms of policy implications , I think it is crucial for science to link directly into policy , and the provision of monetary values is one way to achieve this , ” says Mangi .
“ Money is universally understood by policy makers , economists , scientists and politicians , hence it would help policy makers make sensible and defendable decisions when weighing up alternative and competing management options for marine ecosystems . ”
If we do lose our coral reefs , we ’ll never be able to recreate the services they provide free of charge , says Sukhdev .
“ How could we afford to feed the 500 million people who depend on coral reefs for the fish they eat ? ” he asks .
“ And how do you recreate the joy of diving on a coral reef ? ”
Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch lost 155 men in combat .
122 might have lived , if only the U.S. had sent a bigger , badder , better - capable robot army in Iraq .
" 80 percent of those soldiers did n't have to die , " he told a recent trade conference .
To start with , Lynch would like to see some remote - controlled infantry - bots deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq .
Manufacturers started making the gun-toting machinesyears ago .
But there 's been a reluctance to send the things to war , because of safety and command and control concerns .
Lynch , the new chief of the Army 's Installation Management Command , lead the 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq and has a masters in robotics from MIT .
He told National Defense magazine that the robo - fears are unfounded .
" There ’s a resistance saying that armed ground robots are not ready for the battlefield .
I ’m not of that camp , " Lynch said .
The general first made the comments in August .
I missed them , because I was in Afghanistan myself .
Lynch would also like to see some of the trucks in a military convoy driven my machines , instead of by troops or contractors .
" Why in the world does every cab have to be occupied by a human being ? ” he asked .
“ Why ca n’t we just have the lead vehicle manned ?
I ’ve seen that technology demonstrated many times over the last 20 years , but it ’s still not fielded . "
The kind of technology could also give tanks " robotic wingmen , " multiplying the armored vehicles ' power , without putting more troops in dangerous positions .
Lastly , National Defense notes , Lynch would like to see robotic grunts keep watch over improvised explosive device ( IED ) hotspots .
He said seven soldiers under his command were killed and three were captured because they were out watching IED hotspots .
“ That did n’t have to happen . ” Robots can take the soldiers ’ places , he said .
They can continuously keep watch on an area , and if nefarious activity is spotted , “ We can take appropriate action . …
We can kill those bastards before they plant the IEDs , ” he added .

These sea squirts were created when two evolutionary lineages fused ( Image : Gary Bell / Taxi / Getty )
LOOK at the genome of a sea squirt and you ’ll get a nasty surprise .
Half of its genes have a straightforward evolutionary history .
In fairness , so does the other half .
Trouble is , the two histories are completely different .
It seems that sea squirts do not , as we had thought , sit among the chordates , on the same evolutionary line as humans and other vertebrates .
Instead , they are the result of what happens when you fuse an ancient chordate with the ancestor of a sea urchin .
The fusion of two distinct evolutionary lines is not supposed to work .
According to received biological wisdom , any chimeras that result are meant to be evolutionary dead ends .
Not for the first time , received wisdom appears to be wrong ( New Scientist , 16 June 2007 , p 48 ) .
“ There was a view that hybridisation was bad , and ‘ pure ’ species were good , ” says James Mallet of University College London .
The truth is , hybridisation is like mutation – mostly it ’s bad , but occasionally it throws out something that meets a need .
“ Natural selection can use whatever inherited variation comes its way , ” Mallet says .

Biologists are now coming round to the idea that much of nature is not a product of neat family lines , but a messy mass of cross links .
That may be how , for instance , genetic instructions can turn something like a caterpillar into something completely different : a butterfly .
Such metamorphosis is particularly prevalent in marine life , perhaps because fertilisation takes place in an environment where sperm can sometimes be carried to the “ wrong ” egg .
With so many different creatures leaving eggs lying around waiting to be fertilised , perhaps it is not surprising that an occasional misfertilisation takes hold and produces something totally unexpected .
The classic case is the starfish Luidia sarsi .
It starts out as a small larva with an even smaller starfish inside .
Eventually , the starfish moves to the outside of the larva .
Then they go their separate ways .
What started as one rather odd organism continues and ends life as two .
So , how widespread is this new biological mess ?
We know that probably at least 10 per cent of plant species were formed by some kind of hybridisation .
The jury is still out on how important the process is in “ higher ” species .
“ We are only beginning to scratch the surface , ” says Mallet .

NAIROBI , Kenya —
In a dank prison cell two men in striped convict uniforms play cards .
What makes this scene unusual on a Kenyan television station is that the felons are President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga .
The real leaders of the country are still at large but their puppet likenesses are banged - up in prison as part of a weekly television satire .
As the popular " XYZ Show " prepares for the premiere of its second season in October , its 40 - year - old creator Godfrey Mwampembwa told GlobalPost why Kenya ’s recent violent political turmoil meant the time was right for the satire .
“ After the 2007 elections we argued that it was the right time for a show like this ; that Kenya needed a show like this : we have one [ coalition ] government and no opposition so we needed to strengthen criticism , ” explained Mwampembwa .
The scene with Kibaki and Odinga in jail deployed pitch black humor to suggest that the country ’s top leaders should be held responsible and face justice for the murder and mayhem that marked the 2007 polls that brought them both to power .
It ’s a debate that few Kenyans dare enter into publicly .
“ We put the president and the prime minister in jail ! ” said Mwampembwa proudly .
“ Then people started to actually discuss the issues we were raising .
Others said we were being disrespectful but that ’s the point ! ”
The " XYZ Show " follows in the subversive footsteps of other puppet satires that ridicule pompous political elites around the world .
In Britain , " Spitting Image " ran for 12 years from the mid-1980s spawning a hit single and appearing occasionally on the U.S. channel NBC despite its parochial focus on British politics and culture .
And after more than two decades , " Les Guignols " remains one of France ’s most popular television shows with its daily seven - minute slot on station Canal Plus .
These puppet satires and their human counterparts such as " The Daily Show " or Britain ’s " The Day Today " are however a rarity in Africa where leaders tend to take a dim view of such mockery and frequently impose draconian media laws to curb unfettered freedom of expression .
But in his day job as a newspaper cartoonist Mwampembwa — better known by his pen name Gado — has made it his business to be a thorn in the side of Kenya ’s political establishment .
His lacerating political cartoons describe grotesque tableaus of greed , corruption and
arrogance lampooning Kenya ’s elites without mercy .
His black - and - white caricatures have appeared in the independently owned Daily Nation since 1992 and represent one of the country ’s sharpest political critiques .
Like his friend and fellow political cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro , or ‘ Zapiro ’ , in South Africa Gado ’s cartoons have gotten him into trouble and even elicited the occasional death threat alongside the more mundane lawyers ’ letters .
“ Some senior politicians have complained bitterly , they have attacked Citizen TV [ which airs the show ] , one called ' XYZ ' ‘ weird ’ and accused us of peddling lies , ” said Mwampembwa .
But at least the show was n’t cancelled as Zapiro ’s planned satirical puppet show was earlier this
year .
In addition to constantly lampooning Kenya ’s notoriously corrupt and self - serving politicians , skits have included Michael Jackson being told off by God for turning white and satires on Somalia ’s Islamists and pirate gangs .
For Mwampembwa the show has been a labor of love for seven years .
He first took the idea to broadcasters in 2002 but was turned away because of the sensitive subjects he wanted to tackle and because puppets are expensive : each life - like caricature with its expressive face and moving eyes costs about $ 4,000 .
Mwampembwa begged and borrowed to produce a 20 - minute pilot episode in 2007 but still his dream of bringing his satirical cartoons to life seemed impossible until funding was provided by international donors .
“ ' XYZ ' has given us an opportunity to create a new idiom and to exploit humor to get the message across , to ask fundamental questions about leadership in our country and about values , ” said Joyce Nyairo , program officer for media , arts and culture at Ford Foundation ’s
Nairobi office .
Nyairo explained that Mwampembwa ’s impressive skills in political satire were also key to Ford Foundation ’s decision to give $ 100,000 toward the development of " XYZ . "
A further $ 150,000 grant is being considered for future series .
In the " XYZ " workshop in Nairobi ’s industrial area , the legless bodies of Kenya ’s leaders huddle together on a table .
There are 16 puppets in total — including a white - skinned Barack Obama with ears like satellite dishes — and more on the way .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo , chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , had just been finished when GlobalPost visited and the un-dyed molded
head of Kofi Annan , the former United Nations secretary - general who helped broker Kenya 's peace after the 2007 polls , was resting on a potter ’s wheel .
“ When we started we were a bit timid but we slowly shifted to become harder .
There ’s no shortage of material so far !
Nothing is off - limits — we ’ve satirized the first family , religious leaders — we try not to run away from anything , ” declared Mwampembwa .
From the looks of the new puppets , season two is set to tackle some of Kenya ’s thorniest recent issues head - on : impunity , justice and tribalism .
It is comedy with a serious , and much - needed message , as Mwambembwa explained : “ What we ’d like to see is not just for people to laugh , but for them to think about the issues we raise , and to act . ”
It was a stunning political debate that would be hard to imagine in Britain .
But it was not so shocking in Norway , where a general election is taking place on Monday .
The topic was crime policy and – so far so normal – it featured a panel of politicians discussing the best ways to reduce crime .
But the live TV show was set inside a high security prison , the audience consisted exclusively of guards and prisoners , with one inmate , Bjørnar Dahl , taking part in the panel alongside the justice minister and the deputy leader of the main opposition party .
" It was high time the politicians came here to talk about crime policy , " explains Dahl , 43 , a few days after the event .
" This is about us , what happens in prisons and how we can return to society in a way that is beneficial to everyone . "
Dahl , who is serving a five - year sentence for complicity in smuggling amphetamines , stole the show .
When the representative from the populist Progress party , Per Sandberg , argued that there was an increase in criminality in Norway caused by gangs of Eastern Europeans organising beggars in the streets of Oslo , Dahl dismissed him as talking " crap " and asked him whether he had any knowledge of the situations the beggars were coming from .
When Sandberg tried to argue that the solution to reduce drug abuse in prisons was to increase the level of control on inmates , Dahl shot back : " We 're controlled from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep .
I get strip - searched every time I have a visit and all my phone calls are monitored .
You can't have more control than we have now . "
The primetime show , one of the top debate shows during the election campaign , has caused no outrage in Norway , as it would probably would in the UK .
There were no headlines expressing shock that inmates could voice their opinions in public debate .
Nor was there condemnation of NRK , the Norwegian public broadcaster , for hosting a political debate inside a prison .
If anything , the reactions have been upbeat .
In an online chat after the show , most of the posters wished Dahl good luck for the future and thanked him for giving them an insight into prison life .
Dahl even received flowers from the Red Cross .
This comes as no surprise to some .
" In Norway , there is more emphasis than in England and Wales on seeing prisons as part of normal society , " says Nils Christie , a professor of criminology from the University of Oslo .
" If you take the public services offered in prisons – for instance education , health or the library – they are the same for prisoners as for the rest of society .
There is not a distinct , prison - run system of public services , as there can be in other countries . "
He adds : " When you listen to the justice minister , he generally emphasises the need for reintegration into society rather than the need for punishment . "
That 's not to say that crime and punishment issues are uncontroversial here .
The Progress party , the largest party in opposition , has for years called for tougher , longer sentences for perpetrators of violent crimes – a view that has been adopted by the outgoing Labour - led government .
" That was a very surprising move for a Labour government supported by a socialist party , " says Frank Aarebrot , a professor of comparative politics at the University of Bergen .
" They were desperate to cut the grass from under the feet of the Progress party . "
Compared to Britain , however , Norway is still less repressive .
It has one of the lowest incarceration rates in Europe – less than half of those of England and Wales or Scotland .
And prisons are much easier to access for the general public .
" There is a greater tendency to keep prisons open [ to the public ] so that people can see inmates as human beings they can identify with , " says Christie .
Meeting Dahl was a case in point .
The prison 's press office had arranged an interview a day after I put in a request , after asking Dahl if he would like to receive a journalist .
When I asked whether I could visit Dahl 's cell , the press officer said it would not be possible today .
Not because it was against rules , but because the staff were exceptionally busy that day , as the inmates were voting for the general election and had to be escorted to the in - house voting office .
So how did Dahl vote ?
" I voted Labour , " he says .
" I feel they fight for the regular guy in the street , rather than the rich one .
And I would like Knut Storberget [ the current justice minister ] to have a chance to continue his policy to improve living conditions inside prisons . "

Historian on Islam in China
The violence in Xinjiang has not occurred completely out of the blue .
Despite economic development , life for some Uighurs is said to be harder Its root cause is ethnic tension between the Turkic Muslim Uighurs and the Han Chinese .
It can be traced back for decades , and even to the conquest of what is now called Xinjiang by the Manchu Qing dynasty in the 18th Century .
In the 1940s there was an independent Eastern Turkestan Republic in part of Xinjiang , and many Uighurs feel that this is their birthright .
Instead , they became part of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , and Xinjiang was declared one of China 's autonomous regions , in deference to the fact that the majority of the population at the time was Uighur .
This autonomy is not genuine , and - although Xinjiang today has a Uighur governor - the person who wields real power is the regional secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party , Wang Lequan , who is a Han Chinese .
Inward migration
Under the rule of the Communist Party , there has been considerable economic development , but life has been made more difficult for the Uighurs over the past 20 - 30 years by the migration of many young and technically - qualified Han Chinese from the eastern provinces .
These new migrants are far more proficient in the Chinese language than all but a few Uighurs , and tend to be appointed to the best jobs .
Not surprisingly , this has created deep - seated resentment among the Uighurs , who view the migration of Han into Xinjiang as a plot by the government to dilute them , undermine their culture and prevent any serious resistance to Beijing 's control .
More recently , young Uighurs have been encouraged to leave Xinjiang to find work in the rest of China , a process that had already been under way informally for some years .
There was particular concern at government pressure to encourage young Uighur women to move to other parts of China in search of employment - stoking fears they might end up working in bars or nightclubs or even in prostitution , without the protection of family or community .
Islam is an integral part of the life and the identity of the Uighurs of Xinjiang , and one of their major grievances against the Chinese government is the level of restriction imposed on their religious practices .
There are far fewer mosques in Xinjiang than there were before 1949 , and they are subject to severe restrictions .
Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to worship in the mosques , and neither are officials of the Communist Party or the government .
Madrasas - religious schools - are also strictly controlled .
UIGHURS AND XINJIANG
Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims
They make up about 45 % of the region 's population .
40 % are Han Chinese China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short - lived state of East Turkestan Since then , large - scale immigration of Han Chinese Uighurs fear erosion of traditional culture Sporadic violence since 1991 Attack on 4 Aug 2008 near Kashgar kills 16 Chinese policemen
In pictures : Xinjiang protests Q&A : China and the Uighurs China tells its own story Accounts of Xinjiang violence Other Islamic institutions that were once a central part of religious life in Xinjiang have been banned , including many of the Sufi brotherhoods , which are based at the tombs of their founders and provided many welfare and other services to their members .
All religions in China are subject to control by the State Administration for Religious Affairs , but the restrictions on Islam among the Uighurs are far harsher than against most other groups , including the Hui who are also Muslims but are Chinese speakers .
This severity is a result of the association between Muslim groups and the independence movement in Xinjiang , a movement that is absolute anathema to Beijing .
There are groups within Xinjiang that support the idea of independence , but they are not allowed to do so openly because " splitting the motherland " is viewed as treason .
During the 1990s - after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of independent Muslim states in Central Asia - there was an upsurge in open support for these " separatist " groups , culminating in huge demonstrations in the city of Ghulja in 1995 and 1997 .
Beijing suppressed those demonstrations with considerable force , and activists were either forced out of Xinjiang into Central Asia and as far away as Pakistan or were obliged to go underground .
' Climate of fear '
Severe repression since the launch of a " Strike Hard " campaign in 1996 has included harsher controls on religious activity , restrictions on movement , the denial of passports and the detention of individuals suspected of support for separatists and members of their families .
This has created a climate of fear and a great deal of resentment towards the authorities and the Han Chinese .
It is surprising that this resentment has not erupted into public anger and demonstrations before now , but that is a measure of the tightness of control that Beijing has been able to exercise over Xinjiang .
There are a number of emigre Uighur organisations in Europe and the United States ; in most cases they advocate genuine autonomy for the region .
In the past , Beijing has also blamed an Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement for causing unrest , although there is no evidence that this ever existed in Xinjiang .
The authorities in Beijing are unable to accept that their own policies in Xinjiang might be the cause of the conflict , and seek to blame outsiders for inciting the violence - as they do in the case of the Dalai Lama and Tibet .
Even if Uighur emigre organisations wished to provoke unrest , it would be difficult for them to do so and there are , in any case , sufficient local reasons for unrest without the need for external intervention .

CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc has suspended production at its Canadian oil sands mine after environmental activists blockaded a massive dump truck and mining shovel to protest the impact of oil sands development , the company said on Tuesday .
Greenpeace said 25 of its activists locked down the oil sands mining equipment at the Albian Sands Muskeg River mine in northern Alberta on Tuesday morning , a day before Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington .
Shell , which owns 60 percent of the 155,000 barrel a day operation , said it temporarily shut down mining to ensure that the activists and its staff do not get hurt .
“ Shell ’s No. 1 concern is their safety and our preference is for a negotiated end to this demonstration , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We have invited the group into our administrative building to sit down with management to discuss their concerns . ”
It said Greenpeace has not tried to contact Shell to discuss the environmental initiatives it is employing in the operation .
Greenpeace said it staged the protest to highlight what it said were “ the climate crimes of tar sands development -- rising energy intensity , greenhouse gas emissions , and boreal forest destruction ” .
The mine ’s other owners are Chevron Corp and Marathon Oil Corp , with 20 percent each .
Elsewhere , activists hung a 70 - foot ( 21 - meter ) banner above Niagara Falls on the Canada - United States border showing arrows that point forward to a “ clean energy future ” and backward to “ tar sands oil ” .
THEY called it a lesbian paradise , the pioneering women who made their way to St. Augustine , Fla. , in the 1970s to live together in cottages on the beach .
Finding one another in the fever of the gay rights and women ’s liberation movements , they built a matriarchal community , where no men were allowed , where even a male infant brought by visitors was cause for debate .
Emily Greene was one of those pioneers , and at 62 she still chooses to live in a separate lesbian world .
She and 19 other women have built homes on 300 rural acres in northeast Alabama , where the founders of the Florida community , the Pagoda , relocated in 1997 .
Behind a locked gate whose security code is changed frequently , the women pursue quiet lives in a community they call Alapine , largely unnoticed by their Bible Belt neighbors  a lost tribe from the early ’ 70s era of communes and radical feminism .
“ I came here because I wanted to be in nature , and I wanted to have lesbian neighbors , ” said Ms. Greene , a retired nurse .
She hopes the women , ages 50 to 75 , will be able to raise enough money to build assisted - living facilities on the land and set up hospice care .
She walks each day in the woods with her two dogs , Lily , a border collie mix , and Rita Mae , a Jack Russell terrier and beagle mix named for Rita Mae Brown , the feminist activist and author of the lesbian classic “ Rubyfruit Jungle . ”
Ms. Greene trims branches of oak , hickory and sassafras trees and stops by the grave of a deer she buried in the woods after it was hit by a car .
She named it Miracle .
“ I talk to Miracle every day , ” Ms. Greene said .
“ That is one of my joys of living here . ”
And recent letters to the secretary of the group , Pamela Dix - whose brother died at Lockerbie - from Baroness Symons , minister of state at the Foreign Office , and from the Crown Office in Edinburgh , have argued that any further questions to the Libyans about Lockerbie would not be helpful .
In short , ministers took the credit of the families ' support without asking a single question about Lockerbie to justify that support .
In a sense of deep outrage , the families are asking the prime minister for a meeting to discuss Lockerbie as a matter of urgency .
More people died at Lockerbie than in Madrid , and you would have thought that the government , if only as proof of its horror at terrorism , would be keen to question its new friends in Tripoli about the bombing .
Not so , apparently .
So the only hard information the families have is that Abdul Basset al - Megrahi , a Libyan official , apparently working in intelligence , was convicted in January 2001 of bombing the airliner .
How he accomplished this feat is still a mystery .
The details of the crime did not emerge at the trial , which was held by Scottish judges sitting without a jury in Holland .
It lasted 18 months and cost an estimated £ 50 m .
Megrahi's co-accused was acquitted , so the prosecution 's suggestion that the two men conspired to bomb the plane cannot be right .
Indeed , the crucial evidence that the bomb was put on a feeder flight at Malta and was transferred twice , at Frankfurt and at Heathrow , was so thin it was derisory .
No one knows whether anyone else took part in this sophisticated crime of terror .
One man has been convicted .
The Libyan government has forked out many millions in compensation .
And that , apparently , is the end of the matter .
Many of the bereaved relatives , including Dix , are increasingly disturbed at the behaviour of ministers who talk business and politics to the Gadafy regime , but are not remotely interested in pressing anyone in it to tell the whole story about Lockerbie .
There is , in my opinion ( not necessarily shared by the families ) , an explanation for all this , an explanation so shocking that no one in high places can contemplate it .
It is that the Lockerbie bombing was carried out not by Libyans at all but by terrorists based in Syria and hired by Iran to avenge the shooting down in the summer of 1988 of an Iranian civil airliner by a US warship .
This was the line followed by both British and US police and intelligence investigators after Lockerbie .
Through favoured newspapers like the Sunday Times , the investigators named the suspects - some of whom had been found with home - made bombs similar to the one used at Lockerbie .
This line of inquiry persisted until April 1989 , when a phone call from President Bush senior to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned her not to proceed with it .
A year later , British and US armed forces prepared for an attack on Saddam Hussein 's occupying forces in Kuwait .
Their coalition desperately needed troops from an Arab country .
These were supplied by Syria , which promptly dropped out of the frame of Lockerbie suspects .
Libya , not Syria or Iran , mysteriously became the suspect country , and in 1991 the US drew up an indictment against two Libyan suspects .
The indictment was based on the " evidence " of a Libyan " defector " , handsomely paid by the CIA .
His story was such a fantastic farrago of lies and fantasies that it was thrown out by the Scottish judges .
In Britain , meanwhile , Thatcher , John Major and Blair obstinately turned down the bereaved families ' requests for a full public inquiry into the worst mass murder in British history .
It follows from this explanation that Megrahi is innocent of the Lockerbie bombing and his conviction is the last in the long line of British judges ' miscarriages of criminal justice .
This explanation is also a terrible indictment of the cynicism , hypocrisy and deceit of the British and US governments and their intelligence services .
Which is probably why it has been so consistently and haughtily ignored .

Not Sexy Great post from Zack Whittaker about the young Ys abusing our gadgets .
( CNN ) --
More than 20 horses became ill when they were intentionally poisoned with toxic leaves in southern California this week , authorities said Friday .
These oleander bush leaves , toxic to horses , were found in a San Diego , California , stable .
The horses were given oleander bush leaves between Wednesday night and early Thursday morning at their ranch in San Diego , the county sheriff 's department said in a news release .
The leaves were found in the stalls in the morning by employees arriving to work , according to officials .
" We found bits and pieces of carrots and chopped up apples along with multiple leaves , " ranch owner Bill Tomin told CNN television affiliate KFMB .
" This is horrible , it 's scary why would someone do such a thing , " he said .
" If they were angry with me , burn my house down , slash my tires , confront me . "
An exact number of horses sickened was unclear , but officials believe they were more than 20 .
The animals , whose prognosis was not known , were under the care of veterinarians .
An investigation is under way .

We have seen this coming for many weeks , but the release of the Baucus plan in recent days by the Senate Finance Committee , without any Republican support within the Gang of Six , leaves no more doubt about Republican intentions or votes on health care reform .
House Republicans have already been clear in their total opposition to reform bills in the House .
Republicans want nothing to do with reform except to derail any plan put forward by the Democrats , and are salivating over making a defeat on health care reform a Waterloo event for the Obama Administation , carrying over into the elections of 2010 and 2012 .
Meaningful reform of the health care system , truth be told , was lost more than two years ago when the basic issues were framed up .
The Democratic frame was too centrist from the beginning .
It was a surrender - in - advance approach intended to gain moderate and some bipartisan support by saying that the system is basically sound and just needs incremental change .
“ If you like your insurance , you can keep it ” was the byword .
The real question should have been what kind of financing system should we have — multi-payer , keeping alive through generous subsidies a failing insurance industry , or single - payer public financing coupled with a private delivery system .
So the Democrats started from a weak frame , and through the many compromises along the way in the House and Senate have ended up with an expensive , defanged “ reform ” bill .
Compromises in the political center have not gained Republican votes , and have only lessened the chances of any reform bill being effective .
The right has demagogued and distorted the issues , but is correct on one count — any of the bills in Congress ( except H. R. 676 , the Conyers bill , still relegated to the closet ) will fail to contain health care costs , and will instead add at least some $ 800 billion or more to the federal government ’s costs over the next ten years .
We have already seen evidence that the pledged contributions toward the costs of health care reform made last spring by corporate stakeholders in our market - based system will be more than repaid to them through new revenue streams to their industries if any of the bills now being considered in Congress are enacted .
( links to “ Alliance ” blogs # 28 , 29 , 30 and 33 ) .
President Obama ’s convictions on health care reform are still unclear and contradictory .
They seem to be intended as centrist and negotiable , as if nothing is really worth fighting for .
He would have “ started with single - payer if I were starting from scratch ” .
Then , even while portraying the insurance companies as villains and obstacles to reform , he concludes that we should build on our private multi-payer system and “ hold them honest ” with a public option .
But weak as the public option has became ( link to Blog # 21 ) , he still wo n’t draw a line in the sand in its defense , calling it “ only a sliver of my reform plan . ”
There is no question that Obama is a pragmatist .
So if only on pragmatic grounds , it is time for him to change course ( now ! ) before his plan is gang - tackled in the middle of the field by opponents in both parties , including Blue Dog Democrats as well as progressives on the left who have given up on his plan .
So , Obama needs to pick up the single - payer ball ( H.R. 676 ) , pivot , roll out to the left , pick up his interference , and run around left end for pay dirt .
If he does so , he will have a majority of the public with him , and the number of co-sponsors of the bill will soar as timid members of Congress get political cover and discover stronger backbones .
That demonstration of unambiguous presidential leadership could unify the Democratic party in favor of health care reform , and gain further support among fiscal conservatives , whether Republicans or Independents .
Here is what Obama faces if he stays on his present course in the middle of the road .
The political discourse will get even uglier and more divided .
Amendments from both sides of the aisle will further gut bills pending in Congress .
If any bill gets out of committee to votes on the floor in the House and Senate , it will still face further revision by a Joint Conference committee .
A bill with bipartisan support appears to be out of the question , and Democrats are likely to become even more fragmented as time goes on .
So either a bill dies in Congress or any watered - down bill that may survive to be enacted will likely fail to contain surging costs of health care or make health care and insurance more affordable .
Either way , the Democrats lose on the issue , and because of that loss , the stage is set for a Republican counter - attack during the 2010 and 2012 elections .
Based upon what has already happened in Congress and likely political dynamics going forward , here is what any surviving health care bill would probably look like :
• Individual mandate , with minimal restraints on the insurance industry and large federal subsidies for many years to come
• No employer mandate or public option
• Health care exchanges and co-ops , despite lack of evidence for their effectiveness ( Link to Blog # 25 )
• No negotiation by the government of prescription drugs prices
• Major expansion of Medicaid , again with large federal subsidies and states pushing back against their share of payments
• Minimal or no savings from projected savings hoped for by cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid
• Continued escalation of health care costs and insurance premiums far above wages and cost - of - living , with little improvement in affordability for millions of Americans
• Record federal and state deficits calling for emergent action
If all that happens , President Obama will lose his credibility , his legacy will be tarnished and his political future clouded .
His failure will match that of the Clinton Health Plan in 1993 and 1994 , when many of the same mistakes were made .
More important , “ reform ” wo n’t work , costs will continue to spiral upward , access will further deteriorate , the numbers of uninsured and underinsured will rise further , and the 45,000 American lives lost each year will increase .
The only winners with health care “ reform ” will be corporate stakeholders who get to keep raising their prices without significant government oversight .
The insurance industry will join the list of industries bailed out by generous government subsidies even as they deplore “ big government ” .
If he were to acknowledge impending failure and change course to the left , this could be Obama ’s FDR moment .
In 1936 , confronted by the Great Depression and corporate self - interest such as we see today , this is what he said to an audience at Madison Square Garden :
“ We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace : business and financial monopoly , speculation , reckless banking , class antagonism , sectionalism , war profiteering .
They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs .
We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by an organized mob .
Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today .
They are unanimous in their hate for me and I welcome their hatred . ”
This is the kind of bold leadership and political courage called for in our turbulent times today .
Our democracy is being challenged , as are our values and character .
As usual , time will tell what kind of society we have become .

The world 's ocean surfaces had their warmest summer temperatures on record , the US national climatic data centre said today .
Climate change has been steadily raising the earth 's average temperature in recent decades , but climatologists expected additional warming this year and next due to the influence of El Niño .
Ocean surface temperatures were the warmest for any August since record keeping began in 1880 .
For the June to August summer months , average ocean surface temperatures rose to 16.9C ( 62.5 F ) , which is 1.04 F above the 20th century average , said the report from the climate centre , which is a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The world 's combined average land and ocean surface temperatures were the second warmest on record for August , and the third warmest for the summer months .
" During the season , warmer - than - average temperatures engulfed much of the planet 's surface , " the centre said .
Australia and New Zealand had their warmest August since records began .
However , central Canada and the United States were the exceptions , with unusually cool temperatures .
" In some areas , such as the western United States , temperatures were much cooler than average , " the report said .
The unusually warm summer temperatures for much of the world 's oceans were due to El Niño , the periodic warming of the Pacific .
If El Niño strengthens , global temperatures are likely to set new records , the report said .
So far , 2009 has been the fifth warmest year on record .
Some scientists have suggested that , the effects of El Niño , coupled with warming due to climate change could well make the coming decade the hottest in human history .
Nasa predicted at the start of this year that 2009 and 2010 could see the setting of new global temperature records .
The report also noted the continuing retreat in Arctic sea ice over the summer .
Sea ice covered an average of 6.3 m sq kilometres ( 2.42 m sq miles ) during August , according to the national snow and ice data centre .
That was 18.4 % the 1979 -2000 average .

And if a new study is right , it may have been responsible for killing the dinosaurs off 65 million years ago .
Sankar Chatterjee of Texas Tech University and a team of researchers took a close look at the massive Shiva basin , a submerged depression west of India that is intensely mined for its oil and gas resources .
Some complex craters are among the most productive hydrocarbon sites on the planet .
Chatterjee will present his research at this month 's Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in Portland , Oregon .
" If we are right , this is the largest crater known on our planet , " Chatterjee said .
" A bolide of this size , perhaps 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) in diameter creates its own tectonics . "
By contrast , the object that struck the Yucatan Peninsula , and is commonly thought to have killed the dinosaurs was between 8 and 10 kilometers ( 5 and 6.2 miles ) wide .
It 's hard to imagine such a cataclysm .
But if the team is right , the Shiva impact vaporized Earth 's crust at the point of collision , leaving nothing but ultra - hot mantle material to well up in its place .
It is likely that the impact enhanced the nearby Deccan Traps volcanic eruptions that covered much of western India .
What 's more , the impact broke the Seychelles islands off of the Indian tectonic plate , and sent them drifting toward Africa .
The geological evidence is dramatic .
Shiva 's outer rim forms a rough , faulted ring some 500 kilometers in diameter , encircling the central peak , known as the Bombay High , which would be 3 miles tall from the ocean floor ( about the height of Mount McKinley ) .
Most of the crater lies submerged on India 's continental shelf , but where it does come ashore it is marked by tall cliffs , active faults and hot springs .
The impact appears to have sheared or destroyed much of the 30 - mile - thick granite layer in the western coast of India .
The team hopes to go India later this year to examine rocks drill from the center of the putative crater for clues that would prove the strange basin was formed by a gigantic impact .
" Rocks from the bottom of the crater will tell us the telltale sign of the impact event from shattered and melted target rocks .
And we want to see if there are breccias , shocked quartz , and an iridium anomaly , " Chatterjee said .
Asteroids are rich in iridium , and such anomalies are thought of as the fingerprint of an impact .

Tags : Aborigines , Alienation , Australian politics , Capitalism
Australian capitalism is built on two pillars of racism .
They define Australia today .
The first is the ongoing genocide against Aboriginal people .
It began in 1788 with the arrival of the First Fleet .
It continues today , as evidenced by the Northern Territory invasion .
The second was Federation in 1901 which was based on a number of compromises between capital and labour , including protectionism , arbitration and a white Australia .
The changing nature of Australian capitalism , especially its integration into the global economy , has seen these three federation foundations collapse , at least in name .
Thus Whitlam abolished the last vestiges of the White Australia policy in 1973 .
And yet anti-foreigner and anti-aboriginal sentiment abound .
Governments of both persuasions have changed the nature of racism in Australia from virulent anti-black and anti-Asian restrictions and rhetoric to an inclusive ‘ Australianism ’ against the rest of the world , and sometimes against perceived unAustralians in ‘ our ’ midst .
Anti-Muslim hysteria comes to mind .
This does n’t mean overt racism no longer exists .
The Cronulla riots , the Tampa and the anti-refugee campaign , Hansonism , the Northern Territory invasion are all examples of the crimson thread of ‘ Australian kinship ’ that supposedly runs through us all .
The racism of the Northern Territory invasion is couched in terms of paternalism to make it saleable to the soft liberals , the sort who have illusions in Rudd and Obama .
The racism of the Cronulla riots and Tampa are more overt , reflecting the success of the ruling class in creating divisions among workers along racial lines .
This division aids and reinforces the exploitative process and reduces its cost .
Racism is essential to Australian capitalism ’s extraction of surplus value from Australian workers .
While attitudes to race might be changing , racism is institionalised .
Aborigines are jailed at more than 6 times the white rate .
They die 17 years earlier than whites .
They are the poorest group in society .
Similarly Muslims , the other target for racism , are overrepresented among the unemployed and poor .
While we are fighting among ourselves , we are less united and less capable of winning the battle for a better share of the surplus we create .
Racism is but one of the divisive tools the bourgeoisie use .
Homophobia and sexism are convenient tectonic plates they can set into action to help keep pay lower than it would otherwise be .
for example the fact that women ’s wages are on average 17 percent lower than men’s acts as a break on the class as a whole winning larger wage increases .
These divisive tools resonate with some sections of the the working class .
There is a seeming overcoming of institutionalised alienation ( arising from the social relations of capital and labour ) when race or nationalism become flags for superiority .
Those of us who threaten those flags or do not drape ourselves in them or are perceived through difference to not be part of Australian nationalism become ostracised and doubly oppressed – at work and in society .
As the overwhelming support in Australia for the overt racism of the Jackson Five skit on Hey Hey it ’s Saturday shows , racism is such an ingrained part of the exploitative process which rules us and determines our lives and livelihoods that we do n’t even recognise it .
Is there a solution ?
Education and laws are a furphy .
They do nothing to address the essence of racism under capitalism – an expression of our profound alienation from ourselves and others in the production and consumption process .
A combative working class , fighting for its interests , can give a real sense of hope and power to workers .
It can unite workers of all races and move the country from the racist backwater Australian capitalism has made it to one where relations between people are on a more equal footing .
True equality can only arrive when we abolish the source of inequality – the wages system and the classes that give rise to it .
The fight against racism is an integral part of the fight for a socialist world .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
In a decision as shocking as Friday 's surprise peace prize win , President Obama failed to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Monday .
While few observers think Obama has done anything for world peace in the nearly nine months he 's been in office , the same clearly can't be said for economics .

Foreign students rate Australia as the safest study destination but rank it third for education system prestige , according to a global survey .
Despite media coverage here and overseas of violent attacks on Indian students , nearly 40 per cent of respondents ticked Australia as the safest place when asked to choose from a list comprising Australia , the US , Britain , New Zealand and Canada .
The US ranked last for safety , with 4.3 per cent .
But students did not believe Australia offered the most prestigious education system .
On this measure , the US rated most highly ( 42 per cent ) , followed by Britain ( 28 per cent ) and Australia ( 15 per cent ) .
The quality of education at some private Australian colleges has been called into question recently with reports of unscrupulous college operators offering substandard courses .
Under new , stricter Federal Government rules , more than 1300 registered institutions will be forced to re-register .
Only one Australian university , the Australian National University , was placed in the top 30 of the recent Times Higher Education 's ranking of the world 's top 100 universities .
How many servers does Facebook have ?
For some time now , the stock answer has been " more than 10,000 servers , " a number the company began using in April 2008 .
Facebook has continued to use that number , even as it has soared past 300 million users and dramatically expanded its data center space .
We now have an update : Facebook has 30,000 servers supporting its operations .
That number comes from Jeff Rothschild , the vice president of technology at Facebook , who discussed the company 's infrastructure in a presentation last week at UC San Diego ( link via High Scalability ) .
" Today we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 30,000 servers , " Rothschild said during the Q&A session following his talk , adding that the number " will be different today than it was yesterday " because Facebook is adding capacity on a daily basis .
That places Facebook among the largest Internet companies that have publicly discussed their server counts , but still well behind hosting providers Rackspace , 1&1 Internet and OVH , which each house more than 50,000 servers in their data centers .
See Who Has The Most Web Servers for more date on the largest infrastructures .
20,000 Servers In 18 Months
It also suggests that Facebook has added about 20,000 servers since early 2008 , which explains why it borrowed $ 100 million in May 2008 to fund server purchases .
Rothschild also shared some huge numbers associated with Facebook 's photo storage operation , which now stores 80 billion images ( 20 billion images , each in four sizes ) .
Rothschild said the real challenge is n't storage , but delivery .
" We serve up 600,000 photos a second , " he said .
25 Terabytes of Log Data - Daily
The amount of log data amassed in Facebook 's operations is staggering .
Rothschild said Facebook manages more than 25 terabytes of data per day in logging data , which he said was the equivalent of about 1,000 times the volume of mail delivered daily by the U.S. Postal Service .
Rothschild also discussed the effectiveness of the company 's engineering operations .
Facebook currently has about 230 engineers on staff , who manage data for more than 300 million users .
Rothschild said that having one engineer for more than 1 million active users has been a consistent historic ratio at Facebook .
" We believe engineers at Facebook have a dramatic impact . "
The 1 - hour , 10 - minute presentation discusses the company 's commitment to open source technologies and the importance of memcached and Hadoop in their operations .
Here 's a look at some of our past coverage of the growth of Facebook 's infrastructure :
The gene causing the boy 's problem can be traced back to our invertebrate ancestors A critically ill Turkish boy has had his life saved after scientists were able to read his genome quickly and work out that he had a wrong diagnosis .
The scientists writing in the journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , say they completed the analysis of his blood in just 10 days .
They were able to see that he had a mutation on a gene that coded for a gut disease and tell his doctors .
Clinical tests proved that the boy had the disease and he is now recovering .
Simultaneous analysis Richard Lifton , of Yale University Medical School who co-ordinated the research with teams in Beirut and Turkey , said : " The boy 's physicians sent a blood sample - they only had a very broad diagnosis of what was happening to this five - month - old child and were suspicious that he had a genetic disorder affecting his kidneys .
This study shows how we 've arrived a turning point in the genetics of disease - previously , finding DNA changes was painstakingly slow
Chris Ponting , geneticist Medical Research Council " Rather than looking one gene at a time hoping to guess which was the right gene causing the problems , we used a new method were we could look at all the genes in the genome simultaneously .
" We identified a particular gene which had mutations on both copies and which causes a fundamental problem meaning that the child could not absorb water or electrolytes through his gastrointestinal tract .
" We went back to the physicians in Turkey and said we think this is the problem and they confirmed it and are now able to give him better treatment . "
The boy has congenital chloride diarrhoea which affects one in 50,000 people .
The main clinical symptom is continual watery diarrhoea which causes dehydration and other metabolic disorders .
If untreated , sufferers can go on to develop kidney disease , inflammatory bowel disease and may have fertility problems .
More patients
The scientists then looked at 39 patients who had the same condition the boy was originally thought to have and found that five them had the same genetic mutation .
All five patients were followed up and found to have clinical symptoms for congenital chloride diarrhoea .
Chris Ponting , Professor of Genomics at the Medical Research Council 's Functional Genomics Unit said : " This study shows how we 've arrived at a turning point in the genetics of disease .
" Previously , finding DNA changes was painstakingly slow .
" Now , with new DNA sequencing technologies , a trickle of newly identified disease genes will soon become a flood .
" This will be helped by knowing the genomes of many people who are not known to have particular diseases because then we can separate DNA changes that cause disease from those that do not . "
Professor Mike McCarthy , a geneticist at Oxford University , said : " This is an interesting study - lots of groups are now using the power of new methods for sequencing the human genome to find DNA changes that underlie rare diseases ( and increasingly for common diseases too ) .
" For practical reasons , many groups are concentrating at first on the 1 % of the genome which codes for proteins which is what they have done here . "

What should I do after a car accident ?
The first thing you should do after a car accident is see if anyone needs medical attention .
If you , your passengers or anyone else involved in the crash are injured , call 911 right away and tell them you need an ambulance .
Do n’t try to move anyone who ’s been injured unless they ’re in immediate danger or you ’re trained to do so .
If you can still drive your car , you may need to move it to make sure you are n't blocking traffic .
Otherwise , it ’s best to leave the crash scene as is until police arrive to fill out an accident report .
Get the names and contact information of everyone involved in the accident along with any witnesses .
Exchange insurance and contact information with others involved in the crash , but try not to talk about the accident .
Stick to the facts of what happened and never say anything that could be construed as admitting fault .
Determining fault for a car accident can be complex , and you 're not in a good position to make that call at the scene of the crash .
When the police arrive , ask them how you can obtain a copy of the official accident report .
If you have a smartphone or camera with you , take pictures of the accident scene , damage to the vehicles involved , and any visible injuries .
Be sure to also take pictures of tire marks , relevant street signs , and traffic signals .
Write down what details you can remember from the accident , including the approximate time it happened , where it happened , and if weather or road conditions were a factor in the crash .
See a medical professional as soon as possible and let them know that you were in a car accident .
Notify your insurance company of the accident promptly , but again , stick to the facts of what happened .
Do n't say anything regarding fault .
Finally , contact our legal team right away .
Retaining a car accident attorney from our Atlanta law firm early in the process will give you the best chance of resolving your case successfully .
What if the car accident was n’t my fault ?
Georgia is a “ fault ” car insurance state .
This means that the driver who caused your accident is generally responsible for paying damages .
What it means for you as a victim is that you have different options for seeking compensation .
In Georgia , all drivers are required to carry car insurance .
Drivers must carry minimum amounts of liability coverage , a legal term used to describe insurance coverage designed to pay for accident - related expenses in the event of a car accident .
All drivers in Georgia are required to have minimum amounts of liability coverage for injuries and property damage caused in a car accident .
The minimum coverage is :
$ 25,000 for the injury or death of one person
$ 50,000 for the injury or death of more than one person in a single accident
$ 25,000 for property damage
The cost of a car accident often exceeds these limits .
That ’s why it ’s a good idea to buy additional coverage on your insurance policy .
You can add several different types of optional coverage to your policy .
For example , med-pay ( also known as personal injury protection ) can help pay the cost of your medical expenses .
Collision coverage can help pay for the damage to your vehicle from the accident .
And UM / UIM coverage can help pay damages if you are hit by an uninsured or underinsured motorist .
What can I expect when I file a car accident claim ?
When you file a car accident claim with the insurance company , you can expect to deal with an insurance adjuster who will decide whether or not to make you an offer to settle the claim .
Often , that amount does n’t come close to covering the true cost of all your accident - related expenses .
The insurance adjuster may suggest that you are at least partially to blame for the accident .
That ’s why it ’s a good idea to hire an experienced car accident attorney to protect your rights and negotiate a better settlement offer that meets your needs .
If the insurance company tries to say the crash was your fault , a car accident lawyer can stand up for you and gather the evidence that proves you did n’t do anything wrong .
Sometimes , the insurance company wo n’t negotiate a fair settlement .
If that happens , our car accident attorneys are n’t afraid to take the fight to court to protect your rights and get you the compensation you ’re entitled to .
What is the statute of limitations on personal injury in Georgia ?
In Georgia , the statute of limitations for personal injury lawsuits is 2 years from the date of the accident , and 4 years to file a lawsuit for property damage .
Once those deadlines expire , you often cannot take legal action against the other driver ’s insurance company .
Is Georgia a comparative negligence state ?
Georgia is a modified comparative negligence state .
This means if you ’re found partially responsible for the accident , you wo n’t receive 100 percent of the compensation that ’s awarded .
For example , if you are found to be 20 percent at fault for your accident , your settlement will be reduced by that amount .
Let ’s say your settlement was $ 100,000 and you were found to be 20 percent at fault .
You would receive $ 80,000 under Georgia ’s modified comparative negligence law .
What is the average car accident settlement in Atlanta ?
The amount of compensation you receive for your car accident will depend on the specific details of your case .
If you were injured in a collision that was n’t your fault , you may be able to recover compensation for medical expenses , lost wages from missed time at work , pain and suffering , and more .
How much does an Atlanta car accident lawyer cost ?
Most car accident lawyers work on a contingency fee basis .
This means you do n’t pay any fees unless they win your case .
If you are awarded financial compensation , your attorney fees will then be deducted from that amount .

Epigraph
Dedication For Gregg Keizer who already knew how
First words
Since we are not yet fully comfortable with the idea that people from the next village are as human as ourselves , it is presumptuous in the extreme to suppose we could ever look at sociable , tool - making creatures who arose from other evolutionary paths and see not beasts but brothers , not rivals but fellow pilgrims journeying to the shrine of intelligence .
Quotations
Only one rabbi dared to expect of us such a perfect balance that we could preserve the law and still forgive the deviation .
So , of course , we killed him .
No human being , when you understand his desires , is worthless .
No one ’s life is nothing .
Even the most evil of men and women , if you understand their hearts , had some generous act that redeems them , at least a little , from their sins .
Order and disorder , they each have their beauty .
Last words
The sunlight on her back , the breeze against her wings , the water cool under her feet , her eggs warming and maturing in the flesh of the cabra : Life , so long waited for , and not until today could she be sure that she would be , not the last of her tribe , but the first .

Another argument the Fed has trotted out is that an audit would erode trust in the central bank and raise borrowing costs for the Treasury .
An audit could only erode trust if the Fed had in fact been up to no good .
If the Fed acts in good faith and with the interest of the American people in mind , it should have nothing to fear from enhanced transparency .
However , trust in the Fed from our foreign creditors has been waning for a while , and ongoing secrecy on the Fed ’s part continues to erode that trust .
For far too long our government has spent far too much and issued debt to fund its profligacy .
Our creditors understand this and are reluctant to invest any further until they can be assured that the Fed will stop pursuing policies that devalue the dollar .
A final argument that the Fed uses is that publicizing the names of firms that receive financial assistance could lead to investors selling those firms ’ stock and potentially cause the firms to collapse .
In fact , it has been shown that the stock prices of firms receiving bailout funds actually improve .
As misguided and wasteful as bailouts are , the firms that receive them are viewed by many investors as “ winners , ” at least temporarily .
Even if bailed - out firms eventually collapse , the bailouts signal that the government will not let them collapse in the near term , which allows investors to remain invested in the companies and continue to profit from movements in the stock price .
There really is no viable reason to continue to withhold from the American people the names of firms receiving Federal Reserve assistance and the amount of money they receive .
The Treasury Department has been relatively transparent in publicizing the disposition of bailout funds and the terms of agreement it signs , so why should the Federal Reserve be any different ?
The march toward financial services reform seems to be inevitable at this point .
Whatever legislation is passed in the next year will create a new financial system framework that will very likely remain in place largely unchanged for decades to come .
It is absolutely imperative that we get a detailed look at all of the Federal Reserve ’s past actions and ensure that any future government intervention into markets is fully and completely transparent .

If a boycott of Whole Foods plan spreads , even if it is targeted for , say , the rest of August , they will notice .
Similarly , a sell Whole Foods stock ( WFMI ) might also be effective .
2 . My impression is that the customers of Whole Foods are left - leaning .
If true , a boycott by even a quarter of Democratic customers would have a major impact .
3 . While Whole Foods used to be a regional operation , it has now spread to 39 states .
There are 3 locations in DC , 8 in Maryland and many more in Virginia .
Congress members know of it and probably shop there .
4 . If such a plan works , if the stock falls for example , the press will pick up on it and it will spread .
5 . If the plan works it will be another example to corporate America that people want change .
You would think nearly 70 million votes for Obama would have sent that message but I guess that 's yesterday 's news .
We need to send a reminder and this could be a really good one .
6 . It 's a good opportunity to seek out local alternative sources for the stuff you might normally buy at Whole Foods .
Farmers markets , etc .
If you go to Whole Foods and stock up on essentials in anticipation of the boycott , it 's not really going to hurt them is it ?
There are downsides .
For example , the people who work at Whole Foods could be negatively affected .
That may argue for a time - specific boycott , or , alternatively , a stock - selling plan .

As many as one in six people who took part in a study of older people who live at home were under - nourished and at risk of malnutrition , according to the May issue of the Journal of Clinical Nursing .
Researchers at Linkoping University , Sweden , found an overall malnutrition risk of 14.5 per cent when they studied 579 older people aged 75 and 80 as part of an ongoing study .
Fifty - two per cent of the people who took part in the study were male .
They found that women faced a higher overall risk and that men were more likely to be at risk if they were depressed .
At the first yearly follow - up ten per cent of the 436 people still in the study were under - nourished and faced a malnutrition risk .
By the second yearly follow - up the number studied had fallen to 371 but the malnutrition risk had risen to just over 16 per cent .
The researchers continued studying the 75 year - olds for another two years , reporting malnutrition risk rates of 11 per cent ( out of 157 people ) at the third annual follow - up and eight per cent ( out of 145 people ) at the fourth .
“ We carried out a wide range of physical and biochemical tests on the people who took part in the study and asked them lots of questions , including how they perceived their health and their health - related quality of life ” explains Yvonne Johansson from the Department of Medical and Health Sciences at the University .
“ Our aim was to discover how prevalent the problem was and identify key factors that can predict an increased risk of malnutrition among older people living at home .
“ We discovered that people were most likely to be at risk of malnutrition if they felt their health was poor .
The second factor was symptoms of depression – especially in men – and higher age . ”
Key findings of the study , which was carried out between 2001 and 2006 in southern Sweden , include :
Women were more likely to be at risk than men – for example , 19 per cent versus 10.5 per cent at baseline , 11 per cent versus nine per cent at the first follow - up and 17 per cent versus 15.5 per cent at the second follow - up .
Three - quarters of women in the at - risk group ( 75 per cent ) described themselves as unhealthy compared with 44 per cent of the women who were not at risk .
The figures for the men were 63 per cent and 38 per cent .
Men and women in the at - risk groups were more likely to be registered with a doctor .
Women in the at risk group were more likely to live alone than women in the no risk group ( 63.5 per cent versus 50 per cent ) but the difference in the men ’s group was less marked ( 19 per cent versus 17 per cent ) .
Women in the at - risk group were more likely to be unsatisfied with contact with others ( 42 per cent ) than women in the no risk group ( 16 per cent ) .
The difference between the two male groups was less marked ( 25 per cent and 28 per cent ) .
Men and women in the at - risk groups had lower handgrip strength than people in the no risk group .
The risk of malnutrition was also higher in people who showed symptoms of depression .
This was particularly apparent among men .
“ We hope that the findings of our study will be of use to health professionals working with older people ” concludes Yvonne Johansson .
“ They clearly show that people who feel their health is poor and show symptoms of depression face a higher risk of developing malnutrition and that the risk gets higher as people get older .
“ Our population is ageing and it is vital to ensure that health professionals are looking after their nutritional health as well as caring for any medical conditions they may have .
This study provides evidence of some of the key warning signs to look out for . ”

Inside out , a cross section of a barnacle
Barnacles are able to attach themselves to almost anything .
They are found clinging to the hulls of ships , the sides of rock pools and even to the skin of whales .
Just how they stick so steadfastly whilst underwater has remained a biochemical puzzle for scientists for many years .
Now researchers have solved this mystery , showing that barnacle glue binds together exactly the same way as human blood does when it clots .
Barnacles are crustaceans that live in shallow ocean environments .
We 've found homologous enzymes in barnacles and humans
Dr Gary Dickinson
Duke University , US
As larvae they affix to hard substrates , then remain stationary for the rest of their lives .
To attach themselves to a surface , the barnacles secrete an adhesive substance .
Scientist knew the chemical properties of this glue , but not how these chemicals interact to create a sticky effect .
Now researchers reveal all in The Journal of Experimental Biology .
Sticking point Actually obtaining some barnacle glue proved an initial hurdle .
" No one really knew how to work with barnacle glue before this study , " says Dr Gary Dickinson , a member of the research team from Duke University 's Marine Laboratory in Durham , North Carolina , US .
" Most people try to cut it off the bottom of a barnacle and then dissolve it , but we knew this does not work well , and this approach has limited potential , " he explains .
Sticking around So Dr Dickinson and his colleagues learnt how to gently remove glue from the barnacles ( Amphibalanus amphitrite ) as they secreted it .
They were then able to deconstruct the glue to find out exactly how it works .
The team initially compared the glue to another substance which clots in solution ; red blood cells .
They expected the mechanism by which glue particles bind , and red blood cells bind , to be different .
However , they found they are remarkably similar .
In blood , a number of enzymes work to create long protein fibres that bind red blood cells together into a clot and create a scab .
Using techniques including atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry , the team found that very similar enzymes , known as trypsin - like serine proteases , are at work in barnacle glue .
One of these glue enzymes is remarkably like Factor XIII , an essential blood clotting agent in human blood .
The enzymes are highly conserved because they are very effective at what they do
Dr Gary Dickinson
Duke University , US " We 've found homologous enzymes in barnacles and humans , which serve the same function of clotting proteins underwater , despite roughly a billion years of evolutionary separation , " says Dr Dickinson .
However , this surprising result does make evolutionary sense , says team member Professor Dan Rittschof , also from Duke University 's Marine Laboratory .
" Virtually no biochemical pathway is brand new .
Everything is related and really important pathways are used over and over , " he explains .
" Really key parts of those pathways can't change because if they do , the pathway fails and the animal dies . "
Glue potential Dr Dickinson believes other organisms might also use this glue .
" The enzymes are highly conserved because they are very effective at what they do . "
" There are bound to be a number of other organisms that use the same enzymes for the same purpose , " he says .
His team hopes that further research might lead to a solution to the problem of marine fouling , where barnacles stick to boat hulls creating drag .
Many anti-fouling compounds used to paint the undersides of boats are toxic , so Dr Dickinson 's team hopes to find a more environmentally - friendly solution .

Bill Clinton left North Korea this morning with two freed US journalists after talks with Kim Jong - il , who pardoned the women sentenced to hard labour for entering the country illegally .
Euna Lee and Laura Ling were heading back to the US with Clinton , said his spokesman , Matt McKenna , less than 24 hours after the former president landed in Pyongyang on what was described as a private , humanitarian trip to secure their release .
The women , dressed in short - sleeved shirts and jeans , appeared healthy as they climbed the steps to the plane and shook hands with Clinton before getting into the jet , APTN footage showed .
Clinton waved , put his hand over his heart and then saluted .
North Korean officials waved as the plane took off .
McKenna said the flight was bound for Los Angeles , where the journalists would be reunited with their families .
The White House had no comment .
US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she had spoken with her husband who told her the two journalists were " extremely excited " to be on their way back to the US .
Mrs Clinton , in Nairobi at the start of a tour of Africa , said she was " very happy and relieved " that the women were on their way home .
According to the New York Times , Mrs Clinton was deeply involved in the case .
The paper said she proposed sending various people to Pyongyang – including the former vice - president , Al Gore – to lobby for the release of the women , before her husband emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans .
The message from Pyongyang was relayed through the reporters families , who asked Clinton to travel to North Korea to seek their release .
They were joined in their request by Gore .
The newspaper quoted a senior official as saying the administration did " due diligence " to ensure that if Clinton went , he would return with the journalists .
An administration offical told the Associated Press that the former president 's mission did not include any discussions about issues beyond the release of Lee , 36 , and Ling , 32 , both journalists with Gore 's Current TV media venture .
The official rejected an official report by the North Korean news agency that Clinton had delivered an apology about the incident to Kim .
Their departure marked and end to a more than four - month ordeal for the women , who were arrested near the North Korean - Chinese border in March while on a reporting trip for Current TV .
They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labour for illegal entry and engaging in " hostile acts " .
North Korean media characterised the women 's release as proof of " humanitarian and peace - loving policy . "
The Lee and Ling families thanked the president , Barack Obama , the secretary of state and the state department .
" We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice - President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home , " it said .
" We are counting the seconds to hold Laura and Euna in our arms . "
Ezra Klein talks about what everyone on the Hill knows : that the health - care deal will now get done by making it unaffordable for the people it 's supposed to help .
Only in D.C. is that considered a " victory . "
Well , I say it 's spinach , and I say to hell with it !
The basic structure of the bill has three main planks working in conjunction with each other :
The individual mandate creates a mechanism for a universal , or near - universal , system .
A universal , or near - universal , system creates the conditions for insurance market reform .
The subsidies make the individual mandate affordable for people to follow .
There are a few ways to destabilize this system .
The most likely way is to reduce the subsidies so that the individual mandate is n't really affordable .
That seems to be happening even as we speak .
At that point , reformers have two options , both of them bad .
The first option is to reduce the value of the minimum insurance policy such that buying something the government considers insurance is n't very expensive .
This means policies with high deductibles and co-pays , or policies that do n't cover very much .
But asking someone with a relatively low income to purchase a policy with a $ 1,500 deductible and significant co-pays is asking them to purchase something they can't really afford to use .
So we 're making them spend $ 7,000 or $ 8,000 a year on something they do n't necessarily want and can't really take advantage of .
That 's a recipe for a huge backlash .
The second option is to drop the individual mandate altogether .
Obama , who did n't have a mandate in his campaign plan , might be amenable to this approach .
But here , too , there are problems .
The young , healthy risks will hang back from the system while the older , sicker risks will flood in to take advantage of subsidies and new regulations that stop insurers from discriminating against them .
The risk pool will reflect that , and health - care insurance will become even more unaffordable for the people who need it .
And because it 's less affordable because of the presence of the sick , it will become even less attractive to the healthy .
The happy news is that the difference between a plan with decent benefits that 's affordable for people and a plan that 's not affordable for people and does n't offer decent benefits is not that large .
Optimally , you 'd want to spend about $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years .
You could probably do it for $ 900 billion to $ 1 trillion .
But you can't do it for , say , $ 700 billion , which is a number I 'm hearing fairly frequently .
The difference between doing this right and doing this wrong is , in other words , about $ 30 billion a year , or $ 300 billion over 10 years .
To put that in perspective , many of the legislators who are balking at the cost of health - care reform voted for the Kyl - Lincoln bill to reform the estate tax at a cost of $ 75 billion a year , or $ 750 billion over 10 years .
You can make health - care reform work at a price tag that legislators are , in theory , willing to bear , at least when the tag is attached to tax cuts .

DNA from Suspected Milwaukee Serial Killer Lost in 2001
DNA recently helped identify the suspect in a string of serial killings in Milwaukee .
However , a sample of the suspect 's DNA should have been on file since 2001 .
Though Milwaukee corrections officials have records indicating that they sent the sample to Wisconsin 's Department of Justice for inclusion in the state 's database , there is no record of it ever being received .
As reported by the AP , Walter E. Ellis is now suspected of being Milwaukee 's " Northside Strangler " after his DNA has been connected to nine murders spanning two decades .
Police arrested him Saturday after matching DNA from his toothbrush to genetic material found on the nine murder victims , most of who worked as prostitutes in Milwaukee .
DNA samples from 20 other strangled prostitutes are still being analyzed for connections to Ellis .
If collection of DNA samples had worked as planned , after 2001 , authorities should have been able to connect Ellis to many of the murders .
At that point , the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that he was in jail on a reckless injury charge .
A sample of his DNA was taken under a Wisconsin law passed in 2000 mandating collection of DNA from all convicted felons .
Unfortunately , records show the DNA sample being taken at Oshkosh Correctional Center and sent to Wisconsin 's Department of Justice , but after that it appears lost .
No records show the sample was received .
In 2008 , Ellis ' file with the corrections department was destroyed because he had been out of the system for more than 5 years .
Though the case illustrates a DNA screw up from the past , it also exemplifies cross - border cooperation .
As the Times Online reports , Ellis was finally identified through a collaboration between the Milwaukee chief of police and Britain 's National Policing Improvement Agency , which runs Britain 's DNA database .
One of the British collaborators stated that " [ m ] y team certainly helped .
What they have done is to say , ' This is what we would do in the UK . '
There is no question that the UK DNA work is significantly ahead of the US in many respects . "
At least one of Ellis ' alleged victims was killed after 2001 -- Ouithreaun Stokes , whom Ellis has been charged with murdering in 2007 .
In addition to those whom Ellis may have killed after his DNA should have been linked to previous murder victims , Chaunte Ott paid a high price for the loss of Ellis ' DNA sample .
Mr. Ott was convicted and served 13 years for the murder of teenage runaway , Jessica Payne .
As reported by the Times , he was released last January after DNA evidence showed that someone other than Ott left genetic material on Jessica Payne .
Now authorities have connected DNA from Walter Ellis and another individual to what was found on Ms. Payne .
The Gadget : Ideative 's Socket Sense surge protector that expands in order to fit more bulky AC adapters all on one strip .
Advertisement
The Price : $ 29.99
The Verdict : One of the best expandable surge protectors we 've used yet .
It 's incredibly useful on road trips ( CES ) as well as at home , and beats even the Power Squid in our eyes in a general comparison .

G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250

The special thing about Socket Sense is that it can be expanded from 13 to 18 inches and has 6 angled outlets , allowing you to fit more adapters on one strip .
Because of this , the Socket Sense is significantly bigger than a lot of other power protectors — fully extended , it is the length of a 5 ' 4 '' female 's arm — and weighs a lot more too .
However , compared to squid outlets , the design and size of the Socket Sense gives it a heavy , flat bottom , which makes it easier to use without having to deal with bundled up cords and cables all over the place .
Moreover , surge protector allows you to individually extend each outlet when needed , allowing you to adjust how much space it takes up to some extent .
Also , there is enough tension on extender so that the strip does n't flimsily slide open or close , but it does n't give off so much resistance that a relatively weak girl can't extend it easily .
Advertisement
Overall , Socket Sense is a reliable piece of hardware for those who need a power strip that offers more space between each adapter .
It has 2160 joules of surge protection , compared to the 540 joules of the $ 30 power squid ( the $ 50 squid offers 1080 joules and the $ 70 squid offers 3240 joules ) .
For $ 30 , it 's hard to find a better overall surge protector with this amount of space per socket , although the EZSpace UFO is pretty good as well .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices have surged more than 50 % from the start of the year , but do n't expect a return to triple digits anytime soon -- worries about the pace of an economic recovery will continue to drive near - term volatility .
" The market is manic right now , " said Phil Flynn , analyst at PFG Best .
" This is more uncertainty than I 've seen in a very long time : big rallies followed by big breaks , and that 's reflective of feelings about the overall economy . "
Concerns about the recession -- and more recently the timing of recovery -- have translated into some big swings .
Worldwide consumption faltered as the global recession took hold , sending prices lower .
There have been signs of a recovery , but it wo n't be a straight line .
Just last month , prices swung from a 6 % decline one day to a 6 % gain the next .
While that 's not a daily occurrence , it does signal some trepidation .
On Wednesday , U.S. crude for September delivery rose $ 2.23 , or almost 5 % , to settle at $ 72.42 a barrel after a weekly government inventory report showed an unexpected drop in oil supplies .
Weekly inventory reports typically influence crude prices , but lately the effect is more muted as other factors gain prominence .
Mixed data stifle predictions .
If the oil market is looking to economic reports for signs of recovery , the optimism barometer changes almost daily .
Data in recent weeks have painted a mixed picture .
Two recent reports , for example , signaled opposite directions : Industrial production saw its first rise in 9 months , but a measure of consumer confidence showed a surprise decline .
" The data are confusing about the main question : Where are we at in the recession ? "
Flynn said .
" One day we 're jubilant about better housing data , and the next day stocks plunge on bad retail sales .
It 's all over the place . "
Even a statement from the Federal Reserve , which said the economy is " leveling out , " contained a major caveat that activity would remain weak in the near term .
Investors are left wondering whether the recovery is beginning , slowing , or even falling into a double - dip recession .
" If the data continue to be mixed , we 'll see sideways movement in energy , " said James Cordier , president of Liberty Trading Group .
" They 'll track the bounces . "
He predicted that oil will trade within about a $ 5 - $ 7 range for the short term .
" It 'll stick there until we 're clear on this recession , " Cordier said .
" And at this point , who knows when that will be ? "
Stocks offset dollar pressure .
Oil prices generally move in the opposite direction of the dollar , and in tandem with stocks .
Lower crude prices typically push the greenback higher because oil is priced in U.S. dollars around the world .
Conversely , crude investors look to the stock market to gauge when fuel demand will rebound .
The dollar has fallen about 10 % against a basket of currencies since stocks bottomed in early March , while the S&P 500 index has rebounded 45 % off its lows .
Both the foreign exchange market and global stocks have also seen day - to - day fluctuations based on data from around the world .
Those influences are overtaking traditional supply and demand numbers in the oil market , Flynn said .
Hurricane season looms .
Meanwhile , hurricane season is unpredictable and can easily wreak havoc on the oil market if refineries get taken out or severely damaged .
The National Hurricane Center has reported three storms -- Ana , Bill and Claudette -- that could affect oil production .
Production disruptions boost supply worries and subsequently crude prices .
Flynn said hurricane concerns may have driven up oil prices " a bit " as of late , but gains were limited because none of the three storms appear to pose an immediate threat .
However , hurricane season has just begun and Cordier said he expects more storms will spark a rally in oil prices within the next 30 - 45 days .
Meanwhile , the average price of gasoline slipped for the fifth consecutive day , to $ 2.628 a gallon from the previous day's $ 2.634 , according to motorist group AAA .
China 's influence .
News from the world 's third - largest economy has had a significant effect on markets around the globe in recent weeks , Cordier said .
For example , a 5 % drop in Chinese stocks on Wednesday pressured U.S. markets early in the session before Wall Street managed to recoup those losses .
In the bond market , many analysts are concerned that major buyers of U.S. debt like China and other Asian central banks are losing their appetite for Treasurys .
A Wednesday report from energy information provider Platts said Chinese oil demand rose 4.2 % over last year , though Cordier noted the country has said it planned to stockpile commodities .

Brawn's one - two at the Italian Grand Prix has made the title race a private battle between Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello at the same time as the momentum within the team is riding firmly with the Brazilian .
Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber are now effectively out of the reckoning .
With four races to go they are not realistically going to take an average of seven points per race out of Button 's lead .
The Englishman has a 14 - point lead over his team - mate but although the mathematics are very much in Button 's favour , and he now seems to have got over his tentative period , there can be no denying the Brazilian 's current form .
Button was very much the dominant one of the pairing in the first half of the season , winning six races in a period when his team - mate won none , but Barrichello has been quicker since .
Championship pressure has almost certainly played its part with Jenson as he has sought to strike the appropriate balance between aggression and circumspection in a car that had lost its competitive advantage , leaving him to protect a points lead when in the middle of the pack .
But the swing in Barrichello 's favour is about more than the differing psychological pressures of the hunter and the hunted .
There are technical reasons too .
Quite aside from the mental demands , race driving is a bewilderingly complex blend of technique and technology and how well the two match up .
Formula 1 cars are constantly developing through the season , changing the driving characteristics , meaning constant adaptation for the driver .
There are also underlying traits in a car that may only be evident in some circumstances and not others and there will usually be a difference in how readily the driving styles of two drivers cope with this .
Rubens has a fantastic understanding of what makes a car work , better than any other driver I 've seen , and quite often that has helped me
Jenson Button
We 've talked on this site this year already about the Brawn 's struggle to generate the necessary tyre temperature whenever the track surface is a little cool .
Barrichello's driving style copes with this better than Button's .
Rubens generally has a more adaptable , flexible approach than Button who needs very specific things from a car to perform to his best .
Button has a fantastic feel for how much momentum can be taken into a corner and this allows him to be minimal in his inputs - his steering and throttle movements in particular tend to be graceful and beautifully co-ordinated .
Barrichello is not quite as silky , tends to ' hustle ' the car a little more , improvise with the controls to find whatever rhythm works .
As such , he tends to induce more heat into the tyres .
On a cool day or on a track with a layout that does not ask too much from the tyres , that tends to put Barrichello in better shape than Button .
There was a period from Silverstone through Germany and Hungary when the car just could not generate the necessary tyre temperature - and suddenly Barrichello became the quicker Brawn driver .
There was a ghost of that problem at Spa a couple of weeks ago , and again Button was more adversely affected than Barrichello , but generally tyre temperatures have not been an issue for Brawn recently .
There are other technical factors affecting the drivers ' performance , too .
" I struggled a little bit at the beginning of the year with the brakes , " said Rubens , " but since we changed it at Silverstone I am a lot happier with it .
We had developments on the car since then and the car has become better and better .
I need to put it down to the braking that my performance has become a little bit better . "
The material of the brake discs was changed mid-season , giving the brake pedal a different feel .
Barrichello likes to quite decisively stand on the pedal immediately , Button prefers a more progressive building of pressure .
We 're talking only nano - seconds of difference here but the way it affects the car 's dynamics is significant .
The previous material could occasionally make the brakes a little ' snatchy ' when using Barrichello 's technique - and it was to do with how progressively the carbon - fibre disc heated up when the brakes were applied .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG Monza was a breakthrough race for Button - he must fancy his chances of being able to defend a 14 - point lead over a man in the same car over the next four grands prix
Button 's smoother technique meant he had no problem with them .
The material used since Silverstone reaches operating temperature more immediately , so allowing Barrichello 's more aggressive technique to work .
But it is more complex even than that because although Button is more progressive in his initial application of the brake , he also tends to then press ultimately harder on the pedal .
This has implications on the car 's set - up , as Button explained : " Because I 'm using the pedal harder , when I try to run with his ride height , my car just grounds out , so I can't run that set - up . "
A lower ride - height increases the car 's aerodynamic performance and engineers will always strive to run the car as low as possible .
" Rubens has a fantastic understanding of what makes a car work , better than any other driver I 've seen , " conceded Button , " and quite often that has helped me .
" But I can look at his set - up sheet and I know which bits of it would not work for me .
We each might pick and choose a little of what the other one is doing but basically I have to go my own way .
If I just copied his set - up , he would be quicker .
That 's just the way it is . "
At Monza there was virtually no difference between them .
Barrichello squeezed ahead of Button on the grid by the margin of one - and - a - half hundredths of a second .
But that one position starting difference is what translated to the one difference race position - and the difference between first and second .
Which brings us back on to psychological ground .
With such a big points deficit , all Barrichello can do is attack ; he has nothing to lose .
Button knows he can simply follow him home .
So long as he is still taking points , he will be the world champion .

This photo , taken with a scanning electron microscope , shows one an iron - oxide sphere of pollution produced by combustion , and collected with a double - sided tape collector .
Tiny particles of pollution that are harmful to human health stick to tree leaves and leave a trace magnetism , a new study finds .
More pollution is found stuck to leaves of trees near busy roadways than those in less trafficked areas .
The pollution - trapping leaves could serve as an easy , inexpensive way to monitor pollutant levels , researchers say .
Scientists in Europe first noticed that a type of pollution called particulate matter was sticking to leaves in industrial areas .
Particulate matter is created by the combustion of fuel and can include many different compounds .
The ones these scientists detected were metallic pollutants — such as iron oxides from diesel exhaust — that left a magnetic trace on the leaves ( though the leaves themselves do n't become magnets ) .
The bumpy , wavy surfaces on the leaves easily trap the floating particles of pollution , which either remain stuck to the leaves surface or can even grow right into the leaf .
The leaves are " pretty efficient particle collectors , " said geophysicist Bernie Housen , of Western Washington University in Bellingham , Wash .
Housen set out to see if this magnetic pollution could be detected on Bellingham 's leaves as well , and if there was a different between leaves of trees in busy city areas than in more rural ones .
Housen and his colleague Luigi Jovane collected several leaves from 15 Bigleaf Maple trees ( Acer macrophyllum ) in and around Bellingham in late June .
Five of the trees were next to roads with busy bus routes ; five sat on parallel , but quieter streets ; five were in a nearby rural area .
The leaves along the bus routes showed two to eight times more magnetism than those from the nearby quieter streets and four to 10 times more magnetism than leaves from rural areas .
The findings , presented last weekend at the meeting of the Geological Society of America , suggest that leaves could act as a simple , cost effective way to monitor pollution , Housen said .
Monitoring particulate matter is important because of the danger it poses to human health .
The tinier the particles are , the deeper they can penetrate into lungs , with consequences to health that include breathing and heart problems .
Housen told LiveScience that he hopes to expand his leaf study to look at different sources of pollution , a broader region and the potential effects to the leaf ( and the plant it grows from ) .
I started this calculation because I wanted to prove that public options save money :
In Nevada , compared to the current US average they do .
State of NV PEBP participants pay 76.5 % of the national average .
If it is possible to extrapolate national savings for a self - insured , single - payer public option , we could expect to reduce health insurance premium costs for employed participants by 23.5 % .
Lest you believe , dear reader , that plan participants receive " junk insurance " for such a reduced cost , let me introduce you to the private individual participants in the PEBP insurance plan .
These " non-State participants " are people who buy into Nevada ’s state - employee self - insurance plan .
In other words , the public employees ’ health benefits plan is sold as if it were private insurance to individuals seeking coverage in Nevada ’s state market for health insurance plans .
In the 2009 Plan Year , 697 such individuals made a free - market decision to purchase State of Nevada PEBP insurance because , despite its cost , it was a better value than other private , for profit plans available in this state .
These 697 people represent 4 % of the total participant pool .
What can we extrapolate from this ?
With hundreds of thousands of employed persons in Nevada , the State of Nevada PEPB health insurance plan represents no threat to the private health insurance market .
Further research will show who these " non-state participants " are and how the PEPB plan ’s rules are written , if they are , to control who may and may not buy into the plan ( presumably , from a private employer ) .
If such rules exist , we may infer that rules for a nationwide self - insured , single - payer public option could be written to restrict plan access so that a private , for - profit insurance market remains viable .
The real take - away from this exercise , IMHO , is that large - pool , self - insured , single - payer insurance dramatically cuts premium costs .
The State of NV PEBP plan averaged 17,477 active ( employed ) participants for the 2009 Plan Year .
This figure represents and exerts strong bargaining power to reduce health care costs in the form of plan payments to health care service provider participants ; the public option thus produces heavy downward pressure on the cost of medical fees for service , too .
The " actual " health care service costs and plan discounts reported by provider participants may make the situation look as if providers are barely scraping by , but the fact of the matter is that these statements of so - called actual costs are inflated to provide bargaining chips in future negotiations with the plan .
Clearly , if the plan ’s payments to providers were not economically viable for them , then providers would refuse to continue with the plan .
The fact that our preferred provider list remains robust , offering the choice of thousands of primary care doctors and specialists and a wide array of lab , testing , hospital , and other medical support services , shows the viability of NV ’s public option and implies the feasibility of a similarly constructed national public option .
Does comparable information from other states lend support to this argument ?
On September 10 , after seventy - three days of trying to formulate a government , Lebanon 's prime minister designate , Saad Hariri , resigned his mandate .
Although Hariri's pro-West March 14 coalition secured a parliamentary majority in June elections -- and with it the right to govern -- the Hizballah - led minority rejected the cabinet he submitted to President Michel Suleiman .
Now that March 14 has reelected Hariri as its candidate for premier , the stage is set for yet another showdown with Hizballah and its allies .
As the process drags on , both Hizballah and March 14 are hardening their positions .
Meanwhile , Syria , via the regime - controlled press , is hinting at a return to violence in Beirut .
Today , on the nineteenth anniversary of the Taif Accords , which ended the civil war , Lebanon again stands on the precipice .
After the March 14 coalition secured a majority -- 71 of 120 parliamentary seats -- in the June 7 elections , President Suleiman offered Saad Hariri the mandate to form a government .
Throughout the summer , Hariri met continuously with his coalition allies and opposition leaders from Hizballah , Amal , and Michel Aoun 's Free Patriotic Movement ( FPM ) , to work out an acceptable formula for a national unity cabinet .
Negotiations were extremely complicated .
Not only did Hariri want to placate his March 14 partners , he was committed to ensuring that Hizballah 's March 8 alliance did not realize its demand for a " blocking third " -- one third plus one of the cabinet seats -- which would provide the opposition with the ability to stymie major initiatives and bring down the government at will .
Hariri's efforts were further complicated by leading coalition partner , Druze leader Walid Jumblatt , who -- in an apparent shift -- opined during an August 3 speech that his political alliance with March 14 " cannot continue . "
In attempting to form his cabinet , Hariri adopted a formula -- fifteen seats for the majority , ten for the opposition , and five for the president -- which , on the face of it , would denude the opposition of the blocking third .
At the same time , Hariri indicated that he would not allow those who did not win parliament seats in the general elections to become ministers , a decision intended to preclude former telecommunications minister Jebran Bassil -- the son - in - law and political heir apparent to Michel Aoun -- from joining the cabinet .
Likewise , Hariri designated all the opposition ministers himself , instead of allocating the portfolios to opposition parties and allowing them to choose .
Hariri presented his cabinet to President Suleiman on September 7 .
The opposition declared Hariri 's proposed government dead on arrival , claiming , dubiously , that Hariri 's designation of opposition ministers was unconstitutional .
Seemingly more offensive to the March 8 coalition , however , was Hariri 's position that only members of parliament could serve as cabinet ministers .
Aoun -- who had demanded the reinstatement of Bassil as telecommunications minister -- was particularly incensed that his son - in - law was shut out , a sentiment echoed by Hizballah deputy secretary general Naim Qassem when he said on September 10 that ministries were not " prizes given out in accordance with the parliamentary elections results . "
Clearly the issue is personal for Aoun .
When the Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir suggested that the appointment of losing candidates as ministers would " go against the popular opinion , " Aoun accused the cardinal of having joined March 14's leading Christian party , the Lebanese Forces .
Syria , too , was quick to respond to Hariri 's resignation .
On September 10 , the regime daily al - Watan reported that Lebanon " had entered a period of instability " in which the " political vacuum " would be filled by " security tensions . "
The paper , which is owned by Syrian president Bashar al - Asad 's cousin , added that it was unlikely a new government would be formed until December .
Even before Hariri resigned , the Obama administration was sharply critical of Syrian efforts to undermine government formation in Beirut .
In an August interview with al - Nahar , a " high - ranking U.S. official " -- believed by many to have been Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman -- told the Lebanese daily that " The Syrians are mistaken if they think that their relations with us will not be affected as a result of what they are doing in Lebanon ....
President Obama wants to improve relations with Syria , but it would be impossible if Syria and its friends in Lebanon continue to cripple the democratic institutions . "
In this context , it came as little surprise that on September 11 -- the day after Hariri quit -- two Katyusha rockets were fired on Israel from Lebanon , allegedly by a heretofore unknown al - Qaeda affiliate .
More likely , some speculate , the attack was perpetrated by the Syrian - backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command .
That Hariri will have an easier time forming a government his second time around is doubtful .
As Naim Qassem told an audience convened for Iftar ( at the ironically named Fantasy World restaurant ) on September 12 , " the reasons that complicated this [ government ] formulation are the same ones that the new prime minister designate will face . "
Knowing that he would be given another chance , it now seems apparent that Hariri 's resignation represented calculated political theater , a tactic designed to pressure the opposition to make concessions .
Now , although Walid Jumblatt is openly opposing the idea , Hariri is upping the ante , suggesting that he might not establish the cabinet based on the previously agreed 15 - 10 - 5 seat allocation .
Still , Hizballah and its allies do not appear to be fazed .
March 8 has not yet veered from its demand for a " national unity government " that would provide the opposition with decisive influence in the decisionmaking process .
The opposition remains confident it can achieve this influence -- the blocking third -- through the 15 - 10 - 5 formula : all that is required is to co-opt one of the president 's five cabinet members , at least one of whom will be Shiite .
Given the dynamic , March 8 is currently focused on trying to lock Hariri into this formula .
Anything short , said Hizballah minister of labor Muhammad Fnaish in an ominous note , " means the state enters into a dark tunnel . "
Hariri and his coalition have held tough so far , refusing to provide concessions to the minority that essentially would reverse the results of the June elections .
Precedent suggests that the deadlock could last some time ; in 1969 , it took nine months for prime minister designate Rashid Karami to form a government .
But Hariri also knows that sooner or later , Hizballah and / or Syria will likely resort to violence to force concessions from the pro-West coalition .
And while Jumblatt clarified his August comments distancing himself from March 14 , he remains an unreliable ally and leaves the coalition weakened .
Prime minister designate Saad Hariri has indicated that he will resume coalition negotiations after Eid al - Fitr on September 20 .
Although the talks will take time , it should become clear in relatively short order whether the direction of these talks suggests a different outcome than the first round .
Ultimately , if March 14 wants to avoid another Hizballah invasion of Beirut , it may be forced to accept the 15 - 10 - 5 formula .
Yet March 14 need not accept all the opposition demands .
Indeed , the opposition is also playing with a somewhat weakened hand .
Although Hizballah won all the parliamentary seats for which it contended , its FPM allies performed poorly .
Likewise , developments in Tehran and the recent bankruptcy of Hizballah 's chief Lebanese financier have proved deeply embarrassing for the militia .
At a minimum , Hariri has an opportunity to weaken his FPM rivals by excluding Bassil and relegating Aoun 's ministers to peripheral portfolios .
While Lebanese government formulation should be an internal matter , Syria , Iran , Saudi Arabia , and Egypt are all playing a part , by advising their local allies .
Riyadh and Cairo continue to play a productive role in providing political support to March 14 , but this will probably not be sufficient .
If Washington wants to strengthen its Lebanese allies ' position in these negotiations , the Obama administration will have to bring some pressure to bear on Damascus .
As a first step , the administration should follow through on its August warning , perhaps by informing the Asad regime of the decision to postpone indefinitely the posting of a new ambassador to Syria .
Washington has a vested interest in seeing Hariri succeed in establishing a government not beholden to Hizballah and the FPM .
No doubt , it is an ambitious goal .
But given the June 7 election results , the Obama administration , like Hariri and March 14 , should be aiming higher than a return to the status quo in Beirut .
KABUL —
The United States Agency for International Development has opened an investigation into allegations that its funds for road and bridge construction in Afghanistan are ending up in the hands of the Taliban , through a protection racket for contractors .
And House Foreign Affairs Committee member , Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) vowed to hold hearings on the issue in the fall , saying : " The idea that American taxpayer dollars are ending up with the Taliban is a case for grave concern . "
U.S. officials confirmed that the preliminary investigation and the proposed hearings were sparked by a GlobalPost special report on the funding of the Taliban last month that uncovered a process that has been an open secret in Afghanistan for years among those in international aid organizations .
The report exposed that the Taliban takes a percentage of the billions of dollars in aid from U.S. and other international coalition members that goes to large organizations and their subcontractors for development projects , in exchange for protection in remote areas controlled by the insurgency .
“ We are looking into this .
We are always interested in fraud , waste and abuse , ” said Dona Dinkler , the chief of staff for congressional affairs at USAID ’s Office of Inspector General in Washington , D.C .
But , she added : “ It ’s a real hard thing to prove .
Who is going to survive to testify about that ?
That is our challenge .
But that does n’t mean we stop trying .
We want to get to the bottom of it . ”
The USAID probe is underway in tandem with an inquiry by the U.S. House of Representatives ' Foreign Affairs Committee , whose members have raised concerns in recent years about fraud and abuse in the $ 7.5 billion in funds marked for Afghanistan between 2002 and this year .
" It 's our intention this fall to hold public hearings on it .
We will pursue this with vigor , " said committee member Delahunt .
Delahunt said the allegations made in the story reveal a lack of oversight of U.S. government spending in Afghanistan that he described as a legacy of the previous administration in Washington .
He said more resources were needed to be brought to routing out this kind of corruption .
USAID ’s Inspector General has only one investigator in Afghanistan and two auditors tracking the billions of tax payers ’ dollars that go to NGOs in that troubled country .
“ They want to know what [ we are ] going to do about this , ” said an official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul , adding that the goal of the probe at this point is to determine how extensive the problem is , and how it can be tracked .
As part of a special report called " Life , Death and the Taliban , " GlobalPost traced a web of financial connections between major international contractors and the Taliban in which the insurgents provide protection — largely from themselves — in return for a healthy cut of the proceeds .
One source , with direct knowledge of such payments , estimated the Taliban can take upwards of 20 percent from many contracts awarded in unstable areas , which would include about half of the country .
When the money is not paid out , then bridges get blown up , engineers get kidnapped and projects tend to stall , according to sources quoted in the story .
“ It ’s organized crime , ” sighed the embassy official , who spoke on the condition that his name would not be used .
“ It ’s insidious . ”
It is also going to be very difficult to establish , let alone control .
Most of the monetary transactions take place at a sub- contractor level , invisible to balance sheets or oversight committees .
Any records that are kept are not likely to make their way into the U.S. government accounting system .
As GlobalPost reported , the Taliban allegedly receives kickbacks from almost every major contract that comes into the country .
The arrangements are at times highly formalized and , as GlobalPost spelled out , the Taliban actually keeps an office in Kabul to review major deals , determine percentages and conduct negotiations .
The arrangements are often more personal , as when a local supplier pays off a small - time Taliban commander to allow free passage of goods through his patch of insurgency - controlled terrain .
Precise amounts are almost impossible to pin down , but it is , according to those knowledgeable of the process , a conservative estimate that the amount going to the Taliban is in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
If the allegation that the Taliban takes 20 percent off big contracts is true , it is possible the Taliban is receiving as much money from the billions of dollars in assistance funds as it does from what traditionally has been its leading source of income : drugs .
With the poppy crop reported to be down this year in Afghanistan and the Afghan and U.S. government boasting of successful interdiction of the crop which fuels what the U.N. has estimated in the past to be a $ 4 billion a year heroin trade in Afghanistan , U.S. intelligence officials say the Taliban is seeking other sources of funding .
U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke has recently asked the Treasury Department to look into the matter of Taliban funding , and has stated publicly that opium and heroin most likely account for far less of the Taliban budget than had previously been thought .
In Afghanistan — the world ’s fifth most corrupt government on the Transparency International index — few would raise an eyebrow at graft .
Contracts in the relatively stable north of Afghanistan are subject to just as many kickbacks as in Helmand or Kandahar ; the difference , according to the embassy official , is the end recipient and the use to which they put the proceeds .
“ Warlords take the money ( in northern Afghanistan ) , ” the source said .
“ But they are not using it to buy guns to kill our soldiers . ”
As the largest international donor , the United States is the major source of such funding , but it is by no means the only one .
In an upcoming article , Time magazine outlines similar types of pay - offs to the Taliban in Kunduz , in northern Afghanistan , which is now experiencing a major increase in insurgent activity .
The contracts belonged to GTZ , a German aid organization , but the procedures were very much the same as with USAID - funded projects .
With the practice so widespread , it is a wonder to many , including USAID ’s own internal sources , how it has taken so long for it to come to light .
The problem , say longtime observers , is partially the fortress in which USAID , the U.S. embassy and other international aid organizations live and work .
“ [ These people ] really had very little idea of how Afghanistan operates , ” said a USAID contractor who spent several weeks in Helmand province .
“ [ They ] could have as easily been working in an office in Washington as Lashkar Gah .
Although some of them had been there for three years , they had had almost no contact with Afghans except for the cooks and cleaners .
So , they have no ears to the ground . ”

On the eve of the Senate Finance Committee vote on the Baucus Debacle , scheduled for tomorrow , AHIP ( the helpful folks that represent the private insurers ) released a memo and report yesterday to " Member Plan Presidents and CEOs " detailing just how much they 're going to have to raise rates if the Baucus bill passes .
Because they were n't going to raise rates regardless of reform passing ?
From the memo :
The report makes clear that several major provisions in the current legislative proposal will cause health care costs to increase far faster and higher than they would under the current system .
The report finds that the proposal " will increase premiums above what they would increase under the current system for both individual and family coverage in all four market segments for every year from 2010 - 2019 . "
For example , the analysis shows that the cost of the average family policy is approximately $ 12,300 today and will rise to : $ 15,500 in 2013 under current law and to $ 17,200 if these provisions are implemented .
$ 18,400 in 2016 under current law and to $ 21,300 if these provisions are implemented .
$ 21,900 in 2019 under current law and to $ 25,900 if these provisions are implemented .
In fact , between 2010 and 2019 the cumulative increases in the cost of a typical family policy under this reform proposal will be approximately $ 20,700 more than it would be under the current system .
( Just as a point of comparison , insurance rates under the status quo have risen 119 percent in the last decade , and are projected to double again in the next decade , if the status quo remains .
Under the status quo , by 2020 the Commonwealth Fund projects an average family policy to increase to $ 23,842 .
So when they pretend they 're looking out for you , do n't buy it . )
The report , produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers , ( as Ezra points out , the same group that the tobacco industry turned to in the 90s to create reports on the economic devastation which would result from taxing tobacco ) , is long on dire predictions , short on comprehensive analsyis .
Ezra highlights a few problems in it : the analysis " assumes no behavioral changes in response to new policies " in response to the increased taxes on high value plans , assuming or that individuals and employers wo n't demand cheaper plans that control their costs ; they also assume " full cost - shifting of cuts to public programs , " as if healthcare spending would remain constant and that " every dollar that a public program cuts from its payments to hospitals is a dollar the private health - care industry has to add to its reimbursements to hospitals , " which is insane -- this is about cutting costs , not keeping the level of money flowing throughout the system level because we 're spending way too much .
Jonathon Cohn has another glaring deficiency in the report : it does n't take into account the subsidies the bill creates to help people purchase insurance .
All of which has led White House and Senate Finance spokespeople to blast AHIP and their report as " self - serving " and " untrue , disingenuous and bought and paid for by the same health insurance companies that have been gouging too many consumers for too long . "
And here just several months ago they were all best of friends , hanging out together writing a bill .
If the White House and Baucus did n't see this coming , they were naive .
And just think , this is the one bill out of the five that the insurance companies actually did get to help write -- how much are they going to be willing to do to kill one that does n't provide as many gifts to industry as the Baucus version ?
How ironic is it that the insurance industry is in the same league as the tobacco industry ?
Just tells you how much they care about the health and well - being of their customers .
The bottom line for the industry is always going to be their bottom line -- they want nothing less than having all Americans mandated to buy their crappy insurance with no public option to compete , no taxes on their most expensive plans because that would increase demand for cheaper plans , and they still want to be able to cherry pick the healthiest , cheapest individuals .
They 'll fight to the bitter end .
Hopefully this little tantrum from AHIP will open up some eyes in the White House and among Senate Dems .
Enough is never going to be enough for AHIP , so maybe they should turn their focus now to what 's going to work to actually reform our healthcare system and work for the consumer .
There 's more discussion in TomP 's recommended diary .
Unfortunately , I wo n't be appearing on Bloggingheads . tv any more .
And it is unfortunate -- I had some great times there , and there 's an enormous amount to like about the site .
So I thought I should explain my reasons .
A few weeks ago we were a bit startled to find a " Science Saturday " episode of BH.tv featuring Paul Nelson , an honest - to - God young - Earth creationist .
Not really what most of us like to think of as " science . "
So there were emails back and forth trying to figure out what went on .
David Killoren , who is the person in charge of the Science Saturday dialogues , is an extremely reasonable guy ; we had slightly different perspectives on the matter , but in the end he appreciated the discomfort of the scientists , and we agreed to classify that dialogue as a " failed experiment , " not something that would be a regular feature .
So last week we were startled once again , this time by the sight of a dialogue between John McWhorter and Michael Behe .
Behe , some of you undoubtedly know , is a leading proponent of Intelligent Design , and chief promulgator of the idea of " irreducible complexity . "
The idea is that you can just look at something and know it was " designed , " because changing any bit of it would render the thing useless -- so it could n't have arisen via a series of incremental steps that were all individually beneficial to the purpose of the object .
The classic example was a mousetrap -- until someone shows how a mousetrap is , in fact , reducibly complex .
Then you change your choice of classic example .
Behe had his butt handed to him during his testimony at the Kitzmiller vs .
Dover trial over teaching intelligent design in schools ; but embarrassment is not an arrow in the ID quiver , and he has n't been keeping quiet since then .
John McWhorter is not a biologist -- he 's apparently a linguist , who writes a lot about race .
In any event , the dialogue was hardly a grilling -- McWhorter 's opening words are :
Michael Behe , I am so glad to meet you , and thank you for agreeing to do this .
This is one of the rare times that I have initiated a Bloggingheads pairing , and it's because I just read your book The Edge of Evolution from 2007 , and I found it absolutely shattering .
I mean , this is a very important book , and yet I sense , from the reputation or the reception of your book from ten - plus years ago , Darwin 's Black Box , that it may be hard to get a lot of people to understand why the book is so important .
I could n't listen to too much after that .
McWhorter goes on to explain that he does n't see how skunks could have evolved , and what more evidence do you need than that ?
( Another proof that belongs in the list , as Jeff Harvey points out : " A linguist does n't understand skunks .
Therefore , God exists . " )
Those of us who have participated in Bloggingheads dialogues before have come to expect a slightly more elevated brand of discourse than this .
Then , to make things more bizarre , the dialogue suddenly disappeared from the site .
I still have very little understanding why that happened .
The reason given was that it was removed at McWhorter 's behest , because he did n't think it represented him , Behe , or BH.tv very well .
I 'm sure that is the reason it was removed , although I have no idea what McWhorter was thinking -- either when he proposed the dialogue , or while he was doing it , or when he asked that it be taken down .
Certainly none of we scientists who were disturbed that the dialogue existed in the first place ever asked that it be removed .
That feeds right into the persecution complex of the creationists , who like nothing more than to complain about how they are oppressed by the system .
And , on cue , Behe popped up to compare Bloggingheads to Stalinist Russia .
But now the dialogue is back up again -- so I suppose old comrades can be rehabilitated , after all .
But , while none of the scientists involved with BH.tv was calling for the dialogue to be removed , we were a little perturbed at the appearance of an ID proponent so quickly after we thought we understood that the previous example had been judged a failed experiment .
So more emails went back and forth , and this morning we had a conference call with Bob Wright , founder of BH.tv .
To be honest , I went in expecting to exchange a few formalities and clear the air and we could all get on with our lives ; but by the time it was over we agreed that we were disagreeing , and personally I did n't want to be associated with the site any more .
I do n't want to speak for anyone else ; I know that Carl Zimmer was also very bothered by the whole thing , hopefully he will chime in .
It 's important to understand exactly what the objections are .
( Again , speaking only for myself ; others may object on different grounds . )
It 's too easy to guess at what someone else is thinking , then argue against that , rather than work to understand where they are coming from .
I tried to lay out my own thinking in the Grid of Disputation post .
Namely : if BH.tv has something unique and special going for it , it 's the idea that it 's not just a shouting match , or mindless entertainment .
It 's a place we can go to hear people with very different perspectives talk about issues about which they may strongly disagree , but with a presumption that both people are worth listening to .
If the issue at hand is one with which I 'm sufficiently familiar , I can judge for myself whether I think the speakers are respectable ; but if it 's not , I have to go by my experience with other dialogues on the site .
What I objected to about the creationists was that they were not worthy opponents with whom I disagree ; they 're just crackpots .
Go to a biology conference , read a biology journal , spend time in a biology department ; nobody is arguing about the possibility that an ill - specified supernatural " designer " is interfering at whim with the course of evolution .
It 's not a serious idea .
It may be out there in the public sphere as an idea that garners attention -- but , as we all know , that holds true for all sorts of non-serious ideas .
If I 'm going to spend an hour of my life listening to two people have a discussion with each other , I want some confidence that they 're both serious people .
Likewise , if I 'm going to spend my own time and lend my own credibility to such an enterprise , I want to believe that serious discussions between respectable interlocutors are what the site is all about .
Here 's the distinction I want to draw , which might admittedly be a very fine line .
If someone wants to talk about ID as a socio / religio / political phenomenon worth of study by anthropologists and sociologists , that 's fine .
( Presumably the right people to have that discussion are anthropologists or sociologists or historians / philosophers of science , not biochemists who have wandered into looney land . )
If someone wants to talk to someone who believes in ID about something that person has respectable thoughts about , that would also be fine with me .
If you want to talk to a theologian about theology , or a politician about politics , or an artist about art , the fact that such a person has ID sympathies does n't bother me in the least .
But if you present a discussion about the scientific merits of ID , with someone who actually believes that such merits exist -- then you are wasting my time and giving up on the goal of having a worthwhile intellectual discussion .
Which is fine , if that 's what you want to do .
But it 's not an endeavor with which I want to be associated .
At the end of our conversations , I understood that my opinions about these matters were very different from those of the powers that be at BH.tv .
I understand that there are considerations that go beyond high - falutin ' concerns of intellectual respectability .
There is a business model to consider , and one wants to maintain the viability of the enterprise while also having some sort of standards , and that can be a very difficult compromise to negotiate .
Bob suggested the analogy of a TV network -- would you refuse to be interviewed by a certain network until they would guarantee to never interview a creationist ?
( No . )
But to me , the case of BH.tv is much more analogous to a particular TV show than to an entire network -- it 's NOVA , not PBS , and the different dialogues are like different episodes .
There is a certain common identity to things that BH.tv does , in a way that simply is n't comparable to the wide portfolio of a TV network .
Appearing for an hour - long dialogue creates connection with a brand in a way that being interviewed for 30 seconds on a TV news spot simply does not .
If there were a TV show that wanted me on , but I had doubts about their seriousness , I would certainly decline ( and I have ) .
And heck , we all have a business model .
I 'd like to sell some books , and I was really looking forward to doing a BH.tv dialogue with George Johnson when my book came out -- it would have been a lot of fun , and perhaps even educational .
But at the end of the day , I 'm in charge of defending my own integrity ; life is short , and I have to focus on efforts I can get completely behind without feeling compromised .
Having said all that , I 'm very happy to admit that there 's nothing cut - and - dried about any of these issues , and I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone who feels differently and wants to continue contributing to BH.tv .
The site provides a lot of high - quality intellectual food for thought , and I wish it well into the future .
These decisions are necessarily personal .
A few years ago I declined an invitation to a conference sponsored by the Templeton foundation , because I did n't want to be seen as supporting ( even indirectly ) their attempts to blur the lines between science and religion .
But even at the time I admitted that it was n't an easy choice , and could n't blame anyone who decided to go .
Subsequently , I 've participated in a number of things -- the World Science Festival , the Foundational Questions Institute , and BH.tv itself -- that receive money from Templeton .
To me , there is a difference between taking the money directly , and having it " laundered " through an organization that I think is otherwise worthwhile .
Not everyone agrees ; Harry Kroto has expressed deep disappointment that I would sully myself in this manner .
And that 's understandable , too ; we all have to look at ourselves in the mirror each morning .
So , on we go , weaving our own uncertain ways through the briars of temptation and the unclear paths of right and wrong .
Or something like that .
I have no doubt that BH.tv will continue to put up a lot of good stuff , and that they 'll find plenty of good scientists to take my place ; meanwhile , I 'll continue to argue for increasing the emphasis on good - faith discourse between respectable opponents , and mourn the prevalence of crackpots and food fights .
Keep hope alive !
Update : Bob Wright has left a comment here .
( See also a comment by David Killoren here . )
And at some point soon , a more official BH.tv editorial policy will appear here .
Bob is unhappy that I left out some of the points he made in our conversation , which is somewhat reflective of the fact that we were talking past each other .
I was not looking for a " pledge " of anything at all .
Rather , I was hoping -- and completely expecting -- to hear a statement somewhat along these lines : " Of course we all agree that when someone listens to a dialogue on BH.tv , they have a reasonable expectation that both speakers are non-crackpots . "
But I do n't think we do agree on that .
I am personally not interested in interrogating crackpots to understand their motives ; they get more than enough attention as it is , and I 'm more interested in discussions between reasonable people .
That 's why , unlike some of the commenters , I would n't feel especially different if it had been an expert biologist interrogating a creationist .
Different folks have different feelings about this , and that 's why it 's good that we have a big internet .
Utah is the most depressed state !
( Or perhaps it ’s the happiest state . )
Utah has the highest bankruptcy rate of any state !
Utah uses the most porn per capita of any state !
Why are we interested in these rankings ?
This is probably obvious , but I think it ’s because we read them as revealing what the effects of being Mormon are .
I see two problems , though , with looking at state rankings and drawing inferences about Mormons .
First and most obviously , living in Utah is not a terribly good proxy for being Mormon .
Not all Utahns are Mormons–far from it .
To complicate the matter , a fair number of non-Utahns are Mormon .
Although the Mormon population in states other than Utah is generally negligible in percentage terms , the presence of Mormons does highlight the fact that the populations of other states are quite religiously heterogeneous , what with all the Catholics and Muslims and Baptists and Buddhists and atheists and agnostics .
So it ’s kind of an odd comparison in the first place to look at Mormons versus the vast and varied set of people we would classify as “ non-Mormons ” : differences among non-Mormon religious groups are in many cases likely to be larger than differences between Mormons and the average of all non-Mormons .
The second problem , although it is less obvious , may be an even larger issue .
Consider which categories of state rankings we focus on .
Do we look at all of them ?
Do we care about how Utah ’s state anti-cockfighting laws stack up against those of other states , for example ?
( They ’re 44th in severity , in case you ’re curious . )
Of course not !
The rankings we talk about are the ones where ( 1 ) Utah is extremely high or low , and ( 2 ) we imagine we can draw a causal arrow between Mormonism and Utah ’s ranking .
The problem with our selective attention to only the dramatic rankings that seem connectible to Mormonism is that it leads us to overestimate both how different Utah is ( and therefore Mormons are ) and how clear the causal link is between Mormonism and the things being measured in the rankings .
But given lots of measures that states get ranked on , Utah is going to score really high or really low on some of them , even if only by chance .
And some subset of those measures will surely seem obviously related to having lots of Mormons .
But that does n’t necessarily mean that they actually are all related .
Just to be clear , I definitely concede that some of Utah ’s extreme rankings are almost certainly related to Mormonism .
For example , I suspect that Utah ’s low rankings in diseases like lung cancer can likely be directly linked to observance of the Word of Wisdom .
I ’m not saying there are no such links .
I ’m just saying I think we overstate how many of them there are and how sure we can be of them .
Recall for example the discussion of Utah ’s high bankruptcy rate .
Perhaps it was the strain of paying tithing , some of us thought .
Maybe it was the high average household size , others suggested .
But it turned out to be easily accounted for by differences between states in bankruptcy laws rather than by any peculiar Mormon predilection for declaring bankruptcy .
It ’s one thing for me to make this argument , but it might be more convincing to show it .
If I ’m right , then we ’ll generally be worse at predicting how Utah will rank on a particular measure than we are at coming up with explanations after the fact that connect Utah ’s ranking to Mormonism .
So let me give you a little exercise to try , if you ’re so inclined , to see how well you can predict how Utah ranks on a bunch of measures .
Of course , you may be concerned that I ’ll be selective and pick measures on which Utah does not have an extreme ranking just to make my point .
This is a valid concern .
To avoid it , I ’ve tried to search for state rankings in an unbiased way .
I did a Google search of the words “ rankings states ” ( just the words , not as a phrase ) and took ranks from the first 20 usable matches .
A few more notes on my method :
For sites that had multiple rankings , like the Census Bureau ’s Statistical Abstract of the United States , I just used the first one listed that was based on per capita values ( rather than totals , which would generally be heavily influenced by Utah ’s rank in terms of population ) .
If data were given for multiple years , I used the most recent year available .
I threw out a few sites that ( 1 ) did n’t have any U.S. state rankings or ( 2 ) did n’t list ranks for all states , or ( 3 ) did n’t give numerical ranks at all ( for example , the Animal Legal Defense Fund ) , ( 4 ) belonged to individual states , or ( 5 ) ranked states on measures that duplicated previous matches .
I ’ve put the answers in white text so that they ’ll initially be hidden , but you can easily click and drag across them to reveal them .
Each answer is between # signs so you ’ll know where to drag .
( Sorry this is such a kludge ; I could n’t come up with a better way to do it . )
For example , here ’s the cockfighting law ranking :
How severe are Utah ’s cockfighting laws ?
## 44 ## ( Source : Humane Society )
If you click and drag between the # signs , you should see the answer : ## 44 ## .
For each of these new ones , before looking at the answer , try to predict where Utah will generally rank and relate its ranking to Mormonism if you think there ’s a connection .

Utah actually had more extreme ranks than I had anticipated .
But I do think there are a few rankings that really make my point .
For example , what about the cigarette excise tax ?
Before looking at it , did you suspect that Utah would be among the highest , since Mormons do n’t like smoking , and might want to penalize those who do ?
Or did you suspect that Utah would be among the lowest , since Mormons tend to not like taxes ?
Neither explanation seems unreasonable , but in fact , neither is needed , since Utah scores pretty much in the middle .
Or how about jobs in clean energy ?
My impression is that Mormons tend to be interested in new technology , so maybe Utah would rank high .
But then , Mormons also tend to be unenthusiastic about environmentalism , so maybe Utah would rank low .
But again , Utah ranked in the middle .
So were there any ranks that surprised you ?
A woman from Coffs Harbour has been convicted under new laws which make it an offence to smoke with a child in a car , but has escaped a fine .
The 31 - year - old was caught by police in August smoking in a car in which her three - year - old child was also a passenger .
She is one of the first people to be charged under the state 's tough new anti-smoking laws , which are aimed at protecting children from second - hand smoke .
The penalty for anyone caught smoking in a car with children is an - on - the spot fine of $ 250 .
Yesterday magistrate Judith Fleming convicted the woman of the offence but did not fine her .
The new anti-smoking laws came into force in New South Wales on July 1 .

WASHINGTON : An angry , humiliated , and wounded A.Q. Khan has finally made public and official what has long been suspected : his nuclear proliferation activities that included exchanging and passing blue - prints and equipment to China , Iran , North Korea , and Libya was done at the behest of the Pakistani government and military , and he was forced to take the rap for it .
( Watch Video )
'' The bastards first used us and are now playing dirty games with us , '' Khan writes about the Pakistani leadership in a December 2003 letter to his wife Henny that has finally been made public by an interlocutor .
'' Darling , if the government plays any mischief with me take a tough stand , '' he tells his wife , adding , '' They might try to get rid of me to cover up all the things they got done by me . ''
But Henny was unable to play hardball because Khan had also sent copies of that letter to his daughter Dina in London , and to his niece Kausar Khan in Amsterdam through his brother , a Pakistan Airlines executive .
Pakistani intelligence agencies got wind of it and threatened the well - being of the family , forcing him to recant and publicly take the blame for the proliferation activities in a humiliating television spectacle engineered by then military ruler Pervez Musharraf .
However , a copy of the four - page letter reached Khan���s long - time journalistic contact Simon Henderson in 2007 .
In fact , in the letter , Khan tells his wife , '' Get in touch with Simon Henderson and give him all the details . ''
Henderson says when he acquired the copy of the letter , he was shocked .
His acquaintance with Khan goes back to the late 1970s , but it was never intimate , and consisted of an occasional interviews and conversations , and seasonal greetings .
Describing the four - page letter as ' ' extraordinary , '' Henderson says in numbered paragraphs , it outlines Pakistan���s nuclear co-operation with China , Iran and North Korea , and also mentions Libya .
Some of the disclosures are stunning , and in one para that is bound to embarrass Beijing , besides implicating it , Khan writes about how Pakistan helped China in enrichment technology in return for bomb blueprints .
'' We put up a centrifuge plant at Hanzhong ( 250 km southwest of Xian ) , ��� Khan writes .
���The Chinese gave us drawings of the nuclear weapon , gave us 50kg of enriched uranium , gave us 10 tons of UF6 ( natural ) and 5 tons of UF6 ( 3 % ) . ''
UF6 is uranium hexafluoride , the gaseous feedstock for an enrichment plan .
On Iran , the letter says : '' Probably with the blessings of BB [ Benazir Bhutto ] ... General Imtiaz [ Benazir���s defence adviser , now dead ] asked me to give a set of drawings and some components to the Iranians .
The names and addresses of suppliers were also given to the Iranians . ''
On North Korea : '' [ A now - retired general ] took $ 3 million through me from the N. Koreans and asked me to give some drawings and machines . ''
Henderson does not explain why he waited nearly two years since he got hold of the letter to make it public .
But he writes sympathetically about Khan���s travails in Pakistan , where he is held largely incommunicado under house arrest .
The Pakistani government and the military have repeatedly rejected and challenged court orders to free him , and an episode last month , where Khan was freed just for a day on court orders before Islamabad locked him up again under pressure from Washington , appears to have precipitated the leak of the explosive letter .
Henderson���s Sunday
Times expose also implicates the U.S and other western powers , who he says , basically shoved Islamabad���s rampant proliferation ( while blaming it solely on Khan ) under the carpet in order to get Pakistan���s cooperation in the war on terror .
The move also saved Washington from huge embarrassment since it was basically asleep on the watch when Pakistan began its nuclear proliferation and then winked at it when it was discovered , all the while lavishing billions in military supplies on its unstable client state .
PAK GOVT RESCUED BROKE A.Q.KHAN WITH $ 2500 PER MONTH PENSION
Henderson also implicitly defends
Khan from charges that he profited from proliferation activities , as alleged by deposed military ruler Pervez Musharraf .
Khan , he says , is adamant that he never sold nuclear secrets for personal gain .
So what about the millions of dollars he reportedly made ?
'' Nothing was confiscated from him and no reported investigation turned up hidden accounts .
Having planted rumours about Khan���s greed , Pakistani officials were curiously indifferent to following them through , '' Henderson writes .
According to Henderson , much was made of a ' ' hotel ' ' , named after Khan���s wife , Henny , built by a local tour guide with the help of money from Khan and a group of friends in Timbuktu .
But it is a modest structure at best , more of a guesthouse , he says .
A weekend home at Bani Gala , outside Islamabad , where Khan went to relax , is hardly the palace that some reports have made it .
In fact , says Henderson , Khan was close to being broke by the summer 2007 , when he was finding it difficult to make ends meet on his pension of 12,200 ( Pakistani ) rupees per month .
After pleading with General Khalid Kidwai , the officer supervising both Pakistan���s nuclear weapons and Khan , the pension was increased to $ 2,500 per month and there was a one - off lump - sum payment of the equivalent of $ 50,000 .
Hendersen says he has copies of the agreement and cheques .
Henderson���s 3000 - word expose also reveals a couple of intriguing tid-bits that should interest the world���s strategic community , including New Delhi .
Besides details of the Pakistan - China nexus , he says Pakistan tested only two devices in its 1998 tit - for - tat nuclear tests that followed India .
While Pakistan claims it conducted six tests to be one - up on India���s five tests , Western experts and seismologists have long said they recorded only two signals for devices that measured between two and four kilotons .
Khan also states clearly that China gave Pakistan designs for the nuclear bombs .
In fact , in one colorful passage in his article , Henderson describes how Khan was warned by a Chinese counterpart about the Pakistani Army .
On a visit to Kahuta , Li Chew , the senior minister who ran China���s nuclear - weapons programme , tells Khan , '' As long as they need the bomb , they will lick your balls .
As soon as you have delivered the bomb , they will kick your balls . ''
Henderson himself seems deeply conscious of any perception that he is close to Khan or that he is a cat���s paw for any country .
'' Any relationship with a source is fraught with potential difficulties .
One doesn���t want to be blind to the chance of being used .
Government officials and politicians in any country are seldom interested in the simple truth .
They all have their particular story to tell .
In this context , I am frankly amazed that Khan has chosen me to be his interlocutor with the world , '' he writes .
But Pakistani authorities were clearly aware that he and Khan had been in touch and Khan may have managed to smuggle a copy of the letter implicating Islamabad to him .
Henderson says in a court document that Khan was asked to sign when he was promised freedom , there is a line that read �� �That in case Mr Simon Henderson or anyone else proceeds with the publication of any information or material anywhere in the world , I affirm that it would not be based on any input from me and I disown it .���
That line was eventually deleted and replaced with a more general prohibition about unnamed '' specific media personnel . ''
In other words , stand by for a flurry of denials .
Is India being too patient in dealing with Pakistan ?
“ I think sheets dangling in the wind are beautiful if they ’re helping the environment , ” said Mary Lou Sayer , 88 , who was told firmly by fellow residents at her condominium in Concord , N.H. , that she could not hang her laundry outdoors after her daughter recently suggested she do so to save energy .
Richard Jacques , 63 , president of the condominium ’s board , said he moved to the community specifically for its strict regulations .
“ Those rules are why when I look out my window I now see birds , trees and flowers , not laundry , ” he said .
Driven in part by the same nostalgia that has restored the popularity of canning and private vegetable gardens , the right - to - dry movement has spawned an eclectic coalition .
“ The issue has brought together younger folks who are more pro-environment and very older folks who remember a time before clotheslines became synonymous with being too poor to afford a dryer , ” said a Democratic lawmaker from Virginia , State Senator Linda T. Puller , who introduced a bill last session that would prohibit community associations in the state from restricting the use of “ wind energy drying devices ”  i.e. , clotheslines .
At least eight states already limit the ability of homeowners associations to restrict the installation of solar - energy systems , and legal experts are debating whether clotheslines might qualify .
“ It seems like such a mundane thing , hanging laundry , and yet it draws in all these questions about individual rights , private property , class , aesthetics , the environment , ” said Steven Lake , a British filmmaker who is releasing a documentary next May called “ Drying for Freedom , ” about the clothesline debate in the United States .
By comparing clear mountain lakes with brown forest lakes the scientists have been able to show that what controls production in lakes is light .
This runs counter to conventional truths in lake research that says that productivity is determined by access to nutrients , such as phosphorus .
“ In the brownest lakes sunlight ca n’t penetrate more than about two meters .
In clear mountain lakes , the light can reach down to depths of 15 - 20 meters and lead to high production of algae on lake bottoms , ” says Jan Karlsson , associate professor at Climate Impacts Research Center ( CIRC ) .
The majority of the world ’s lakes are small and poor in nutrients , and they contain organic material that was washed into the water from the surrounding land .
This organic material colors lakes brown , which makes it difficult for light to reach the bottom .
The problem is that the algae that live on the lake bottom need sunlight for their photosynthesis .
The algae provide food for various bottom - dwelling animals , which in turn are eaten by fish .
Limited light penetration thus has negative consequences for all living beings in a lake .
These findings mean that we can expect climate change to disrupt production in lakes .
Higher temperatures and thawing of permafrost , along with shifts in precipitation , can lead to relatively rapid changes in the transport of organic material to lakes .
In the long term higher temperatures also entail that vegetation will climb higher up mountainsides .
This would lead to greater production and transporting of organic material to lakes .
“ The climate impacts lakes , and in the long run we can expect more brown lakes with reduced productivity , ” says Jan Karlsson .
The study is a result of collaborative work done by Jan Karlsson at the Climate Impacts Research Center ( CIRC ) and Pär Byström , Jenny Ask , Per Ask , Lennart Persson , and Mats Jansson at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Sciences , Umeå University , in the robust research environment “ Lake Ecosystem Response to Environmental Change ( LEREC ) , ” which is funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas .
Seriously , I ca n’t do it this time .
I ca n’t get the glass globe off to get to the light bulb .
Here ’s the best picture I could find on the web of the fixture we ’re dealing with :
http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://dangerousintersection.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/breast%20light%20fixture.jpg&imgrefurl=http://dangerousintersection.org/2007/08/21/on-light-fixtures-that-look-like-breasts/&usg=__HbytgYC6jQbkhgeIaVvuMFXtmSg=&h=2112&w=2816&sz=318&hl=en&start=31&sig2=VPUXbxwWGY826VpTvl512A&um=1&tbnid=FtWL7-ok7EiaVM:&tbnh=113&tbnw=150&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dlight%2Bfixtures%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26start%3D20%26um%3D1&ei=VHPBSp_lF47aNr7z9b4E
Except there ’s no screw to loosen .
Not in the glass part and not in the metal ring above it .
I ’ve tried turning both the ring and the globe in both directions .
But I ’ve mainly tried turning the globe counter - clockwise .
And my teenage son , who lifts weights , has also given it a try a few times but he ca n’t make it budge .
My best guess is that the last person to change a bulb , probably one of the handymen who has been in and out of the house this year , just got a little carried away in screwing it in , and it just got stuck .
Oh , also , I visited the local hardware store and they sold me a suction cup which they promised would hold the globe while I turned it .
It did n’t work out .
We have n’t tried a lubricant .
Is that worth a shot ?
Any other ideas ?
Thanks .

The Giants Causeway , one of Ireland 's most important heritage landscapes , is at risk of being swallowed up by the sea .
Experts say that sea levels at the Irish coast could rise by one meter ( 3.3 feet ) by the end of this century .
“ While things may look near - perfect here in Ireland , a report published by the UK National Trust in 2008 predicted that the sea level around Northern Ireland will rise by up to one meter by the end of the century , threatening the Giant ’s Causeway , ” said Simon Molesworth , chairman of the International National Trusts Organization .
Molesworth has urged that December ’s UN conference on climate change , which takes place in Denmark , should make protection of the world ’s most important landscapes a top priority .
“ Iconic buildings and landscapes all around the world are at risk because of climate change , " he said ,
" Time is against us , and it is critical that world leaders listen and put solid measures in place at Copenhagen to protect our heritage so that it can be enjoyed by future generations . "
Molesworth was speaking at An Taisce ’s 13th International Conference of National Trusts which is being held in Dublin this week .
A list of recommendations , called the “ Dublin Declaration , ” is being put together to show how national governments can protect their landscapes and iconic structures .
Former Irish president Mary Robinson also spoke at the conference and urged governments to enforce policies to protect the climate .
“ We must hold governments accountable for putting into practice well - established principles , such as the requirement that ‘ polluters pay ’ for the environmental damage they cause , ” she said .
If there ’s one thing South Park is well known for it ’s how true to current events the themes tend to be .
In fact , a lot of people were amazed at how the show was able to get an episode out the day after the 2008 elections , featuring Obama in the seat of presidency .
They ’ve also taken on topics like Guitar Hero , Scientology , the economy , High School Musical , Kanye West , and Somalian pirates with timely precision .
So , what ’s the world been up to lately that South Park should take on when it returns next week ( October 7 ) ?
Here are a few that come to mind :
Twitter and Facebook —
My mind ’s a bit foggy over whether or not South Park ever featured Facebook , though I ’m near certain Twitter has never made an appearance before .
The popularity of the service skyrockets every month , so it ’s only a matter of time before Cartman ’s Tweeting it up .
Oh wait a minute : he already does .
Picture the kids fighting over how many followers they have , for example , or how you ca n’t recall Tweets once you send them — it ’s there , forever , for the world to see .
In fact , would n’t it be brilliant if Comedy Central somehow featured the follower count of their Twitter accounts as they actually happened , live on TV , as viewers added them ?
Alright , maybe not .
The iPhone — … or at least cellphones in general .
Alright , maybe I ’m knocking on the techie door a bit much when it comes to this , but it seems the iPhone and its companion app store are seemingly everywhere these days .
I could imagine a character on the show coming up with a Terrence & Philip iPhone app that does nothing but farts ( I know , already done ) , costs $ 0.99 , and they stand to make millions of dollars … until Steve Jobs yanks it out of the app store for no apparent reason .
Cue the boys making a pilgrimage to Cupertino to confront the manatees or whatever they are that control the app approval process .
The Jaycee Lee Dugard kidnapping —
What , you think Parker and Stone would stay away from a sensitive subject like this ?
No freakin’ way !
This story is ripe with South Park possibilities .
Imagine one of the boys being kidnapped , then we flash to South Park 18 years in the future when he returns and has to be re-established into society .
Or how about Kenny finding out that all this time his parents are n’t his true parents , and he was kidnapped years ago before he can remember .
Alright , so I do n’t have the greatest ideas when it comes to this , but I wo n’t be surprised to see an episode around it .
Fantasy sports – I ’m surprised we have n’t seen any of this on South Park yet .
This could be a storyline for the kids or the adults , though I immediately picture Stan ’s father being obsessed with playing fantasy sports .
So much so , in fact , that he plays fifteen different leagues at once and does that absurd thing when fantasy players feel kinship with the players on their fantasy team , as if they ’re a real coach .
Swine Flu —
This is a no-brainer .
The premise is simple .
Swine
Flu runs rampant in the school , and the hunt is out for the one person — Patient Zero — who started the epidemic , with Cartman leading the way .
Wrap the whole thing around any current zombie movie premise and you ’ve got yourself an episode .
In the end , it turns out Cartman is to blame and he knew it all along .
Michael Jackson ’s death —
I ’m not really sure how this would work into an episode , but I ’m sure the writers would think of something .
Heck , he ’s been featured before as “ Mr. Jefferson ” with his son , Blanket , on the show before .
Maybe due to “ Mr. Jefferson ’s ” death , Blanket moves permanently to South Park in order to get out of the spotlight .
It turns out Jefferson never gave away the money he said he would , so Blanket ’s on the run with it .
You could also substitute Jackson ’s death with a number of other notable ones this year , including Billy Mays and Farrah Fawcett .
Any other topics from 2009 that you could imagine seeing covered on South Park ?

I am standing in a Scout hut on a rainy Wednesday night in a leafy suburb of York , preparing to be initiated in to the ways of morris .
Few would imagine that danger is at hand .
Morris dancing – with its tinkling bells , clink of pewter tankards and brightly - clad participants – evokes the timeless , gentle charm of an English village .
It may be atavistic and some may even find it a little unsettling .
But ultimately it is plainly harmless and above all , safe .
Yet I am now learning that what I believed to be a risk - free if rather unfashionable activity is in fact fraught with peril – a contact sport in the finest traditions of bone - crunching Sumo and tooth - spitting Aussie Rules .
I had assumed that the greatest menace – apart from the occasional derisory comment – might be a nasty case of hanky burn brought on by a too - vigorously brandished snot rag ; or perhaps a poke in the eye with a flailing pig 's bladder – even a mild bout of tinnitus courtesy of those chimes .
But that was before I witnessed the spectacle of the Skirmish .
The good ladies of the Acorn Morris , York 's first all - female team ( who have been strutting their stuff since 1977 ) , have already nurse - maided me through a gentle Shepherd 's
Hey – really a dance for children but deemed suitable for a beginner such as myself – before progressing to the slightly more vigorous Brighton Camp , which involves some enjoyable knee - slapping and culminates in a satisfying gurn .
I am also allowed to backswagger and caper ( these are technical terms ) along to a ( for me ) rather demanding Jenny Lind Polka , named in honour of the celebrated Victorian opera singer known as the Swedish Nightingale and still widely venerated in morris circles .

But the Skirmish , with its crashing wooden staves and double - speed chorus , is strictly off - limits for novices .
The Skirmish sees teams hit their staves together fore and aft – punctuating key points in the music and filling the room with the earsplitting sound of clashing wood .
Far from the broom handles of popular mockery these are serious clubs capable of doing damage which must be wielded with surprising speed and above all accuracy .
Even the most experienced dancers can occasionally lose concentration in a Skirmish and bring their stick crashing down on an unsuspecting finger or worse , resulting in a smashed bone or dislocated joint .
And it is clear that , though the dancers ' smiles are broad , this is no laughing matter .
To see the Acorn team dance the Skirmish is to forget the tedious old instruction of Sir Thomas Beecham about morris dancing and incest being two of life 's more optional leisure interests and instead seek out the stirring description of Philip Stubbs , the 16th - century pamphleteer .
Writing in his The Anatomie of Abuses ( 1583 ) , a sort of Elizabethan version of the Daily Mail which excoriated the declining state of England and the degenerate behaviour of its people , Stubbs turns the full force of his censorious quill on the morris men : " They strike up the Devil 's Dance withall : then march this heathen company towards the church and churchyards , their pypers pyping , the drummers thundering , their stumpes dancing , their belles jyngling , their hankercheefes fluttering about their heads like madde men . "
More than four centuries later , they are still doing so ; in fact , the pastime appears to gaining popularity .
Later this month in cinemas across Britain a new film exploring the strange and deeply - held passions that continue to be evoked by morris is to enjoy its national premiere in our cinemas .
Morris : A life With Bells
On cost just £ 500,000 to make but is already looking like becoming – thanks to a series of little - publicised screenings at morris societies countrywise – the word - of - mouth hit of the year .
Starring Sir Derek Jacobi as the sinister head of the fictional governing body the Morris Ring and Dominique Pinon of Amélie and Delicatessen fame playing a mystic Gallic dancer inspired by hallucinogenic cider , it tells the story of Derecq Twist , an earnest and passionate devotee of the morris ways whose avant - garde tendencies earn him powerful enemies within the deeply - conservative establishment .
Shot in mockumentary style that evokes The Office and This is Spinal Tap , A Life With Bells
On is an affectionate if uncompromisingly comic examination of this most peculiar of English traditions .
The forthcoming national screenings have not only excited the judges of the Seattle Film Festival who gave it a runner 's - up prize earlier this year but have also girded the loins of Britain 's 14,000 morris men and women .
Those who have seen the early showings , if not exactly dancing with joy at the depiction of their hobby , have given a broad hey nonny yes to the film – glad that for once the outside world is sitting up and taking notice .
The screenplay is written by former lawyer , banker and entrepreneur turned actor and voiceover artist Charles Thomas Oldham who also plays the central character Derecq Twist .
It was inspired by the death of Oldham 's " surrogate father " Donald McGregor Campbell , a former morris man who showed the then - 16 - year - old from the Surrey stockbroker belt the ways of the bells when he took him in after his parents moved to Australia .
" I did not want this to be nasty or sneery , " says Oldham , who admits to finding the dancing scenes " strangely enjoyable " .
" I just did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did , " he confesses .
Oldham recalls how his adopted parent regularly used to enliven family gatherings by knocking out a Sweet Jenny Jones or Constant Billy with morris - loving friends .
" Even as a 16 - year - old I could spot the humour in it , " says Oldham .
" But I was worried his family might see the film and think it was nasty so it was a great relief when I saw them chuckling at it .
In the end it is a nice film about good people . "

But convincing the distributors there was a market for it was another matter .
" They said it was too niche and on some level there is a perception that anything to do with the folk world is small scale .
But there are thousands of morris dancers out there , " says Oldham .
One champion of morris who rode to the rescue was Cat Moore of Bicester , Oxfordshire .
Having seen an internet trailer and heard favourable reports from friends who had been to some of the sold - out village hall screenings in the South West she was so disappointed at the prospect of it not going nationwide that she set up a petition .
Within a few weeks some 8,000 people had signed up , demanding A Life With Bells
On be given a wider airing with the result that the Picturehouse chain agreed to put it on 50 screens later this month .
" I know people who 've seen it and I do n't expect it to be a documentary about morris dancing where you 'll learn something about it , but I 've heard it is just a very good and very funny British film , " 28 - year - old Ms Moore said .
Life With Bells
On is indeed funny .
But it is also touching .
Take the opening scene – shot with reckless expense for a low - budget film from the air above the rolling hills of Dorset – revealing the isolated figure of Twist dancing beside a chalk man , concentration fiercely etched across his face .
We know that morris dancing , in some parts of the country at least , is facing a protracted death .
There is a shortage of new recruits who , reared on the airbrushed sirens of music TV , are too embarrassed to join in , whilst the increasingly - aged profile of existing dancers prompted the real - life Morris Ring ( no relation to the fictional Morris Circle ) , which represents 200 all - male troupes , to warn earlier this year that in a mere two decades there could be no one left to keep the traditions alive .
But it is not the first time that morris has teetered on the verge of extinction .
As Victorian Britain enjoyed the pinnacle of its imperial and industrial greatness , the customs of an earlier agrarian age were being all but forgotten .
Many dances and their accompanying tunes existed only in the folk memory of a few elders .
A working - class population on the cusp of modernity derided such retrogressive practices with their half - remembered allusions to bountiful harvests and fertility rites and their antler - clad predilection for animistic ritual and pre-Christian folklore .
The upper classes and the Church , needless to say deplored the morris men's penchant for what today we would call " binge drinking " on the feast days of May Day and Whitsun .
Indeed one celebrated team 's philosophy was summarised as " dance until the sweat comes down and then drink until the water comes down " – repeating the process over and over again .
An unlikely saviour of morris appeared in the guise of Cecil Sharp , an Oxbridge - educated professional musician who on Boxing Day 1899 came across a performance of the Headington Quarry morris team .
This was the time of the Arts and Crafts movement , and the middle classes were responding to the machine age by looking backwards towards a period of greater " authenticity " .
Not that morris was always popular .
The first dances are thought to have arrived in England around the time of the Tudors – an adaptation of the Spanish pageant known as the Moresca , which celebrated the defeat of Islam in the Iberian Peninsula .
Shakespearean actor William Kempe morris danced all the way from London to Norwich chronicling his achievement in the book Nine Days Wonder , published in 1600 while John Milton introduced the dancers to a wider audience in his celebrated masque Comus .
But the Puritans had little love for the morris men or their traditions – as attested to by the observations of Stubbs – and the " ungodly " sound of jingling bells in the village greens and market squares of Cromwell 's Commonwealth was systematically repressed along with most other forms of public enjoyment .
Morris dancing then was subversive , dangerous , and threatened the status quo .
The Restoration signalled not only the return of the king but the resumption of popular events such as the Whitsun Ales and in the years that followed so there was a flowering of the art of morris : Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire became the hanky - waving stronghold of the Cotswolders ; clog dancing ruled the mill towns of the 19th century North West .
On the Borders , dancers donned blackface and turned their clothes inside out to go " raggy " while Yorkshire resounded to the dances of longsworders and out - of - work ploughboys entertained East Anglian crowds ( sometimes with more than a hint of menace ) with their molly dances .
Yet by the early years of the 20th century this rich tapestry of local tradition was unravelling .
Sharp was enthralled by his encounter with Headington team and the musician set out on an odyssey that was to see him scour the country excavating the memories of those that could still recall the old dances and painstakingly recording the steps and noting down the tunes for posterity .
His establishment of the English Folk Dance Society helped ensure that the centuries - old ways were not lost in the slaughter of the Western Front just three years later .
Interest grew during the inter - war years but it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that yet another revival was to occur .
The explosion in interest of traditional dance was fuelled by the resurgent appeal of folk music – a phenomenon that had been building steadily in the post war years on both sides of the Atlantic .
In Britain it evolved from a search for the music of the ordinary people in keeping with communist sympathies of pioneering writer / musician / activists such as Ewan MacColl and AL Lloyd .
In the United States it gave birth to the protest song movement of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez .
But though recruits spilled out of the folk clubs into the church halls and scout huts where the morris practiced , dancing remained an all together less doctrinaire activity – the pursuit of left - leaning teachers and other professionals seeking fun , exercise and convivial company .
The Ring 's current Squire is Brian Tasker .
Though the head of the largest – and some might say most conservative – of the three morris organisations , the 62 - year - old former chartered accountant from Tunbridge Wells bears little resemblance to the unyielding and ruthless Quentin Neely , played by Sir Derek Jacobi in the film .
Although the Ring still only represents male teams , Tasker says his organisation is a broad church incorporating a wide range of opinions on the thorny issue of women dancers .
Change could come one day but is not imminent .
" It is really just a matter of tradition .
In the future we may open up but at the moment the situation is fine , " he says .
More worrying he says is the failure to recruit new and younger members and so he welcomes the film and was consulted by the producers .
" We need all the publicity we can get , " he admits .
" So if the film can trigger interest that will be good . "
Tasker believes there are three areas in which morris can become more relevant .
The first is by updating the costumes – many of the more traditional ones he concedes can be off - putting to younger people .
Then there is the question of the music .
" These were popular songs of the 19th century and they are very beautiful but many people cannot relate to them today .
We should be very traditional and use popular songs of the present day , " he adds .
The final issue is the dancing itself .
While ceilidhs and – God forbid – line - dancing continue to attract followers , morris in some parts of the country struggling .
" The dances have always been evolving and changing with the years but it has n't done so very much in the last 30 years .
We have to think about what dances would be interesting to young people , " he says .
Three days after my lesson with the Acorn Morris , I find myself in the centre of York .
The city is ringing with the sound of the bells for the highlight of the local morris dancing calendar , the city 's festival of traditional dance .
In the medieval surroundings of Parliament Street , Saturday lunchtime shoppers are sheltering from the drizzle as teams from across the country mill about in colourful contrast to the wet flagstones .
I suddenly realise that it is one thing to dance before fellow believers in the anonymity of a late - night scout hut , but quite another to perform in front of hundreds of strangers in the crowded centre of your home city .
Yet as the Acorn 's squire Chris Bishop calls for volunteers to join them in a Brighton Camp I resolutely step forward and prepare to dance formally in public for the first time in 30 years .
Yellow hankies clutched in moistening hands , I listen as the whistle and accordion strike up .
" Some people think it is a bit odd and you get ribbed a bit and we can take a bit of stick , " Acorn member Norna Scott , 34 , had told me .
" But it is a wonderful thing and you really can't do it without smiling . "
She is right .
As the music stops and the ragged sound of applause drifts across the damp square I feel great .
" Morris : A Life With Bells On " opens in cinemas nationwide on 27 September

By Traci Scott , Oregon Faith Report .
One in thirty - three female congregation members are the subject of clergy sexual misconduct at some point in their lives , according to a new study on clergy sexual misconduct ( CSM ) .
The research study , “ The Prevalence of clergy Sexual Misconduct with Adults ” , was conducted at Baylor University .
The study involved two separate but related projects , the first being a national random survey to determine the prevalence of CSM , and the second being a qualitative study of three separate groups of men and women , which included those who were survivors of CSM , family or friends of survivors and offenders who committed CSM .
The study found that 67 percent of the offenders were married to someone else at the time of the misconduct and 92 percent of the sexual advances were made in secret , not in a dating relationship .
The study also demonstrated the widespread nature of CSM , with survivors coming from 17 different Christian and Jewish affiliations , including Catholic , Baptist , Methodist , Lutheran , Seventh Day Adventist , Disciples of Christ , Latter Day Saints , Apostolic , Calvary Chapel , Christian Science , Church of Christ , Episcopal , Friends ( Quaker ) , Mennonite , Evangelical , Nondenominational ( Christian ) , and Reformed Judaism .
In the average American congregation of 400 members the study found that there are on average 32 people who have experienced CSM in their place of worship .
The study identified six common themes that describe the social characteristics of the congregations where CSM occurs :
1 ) Victims , family members and friends all ignored warning signs due to the fact that the offender was considered a trusted leader .
2 ) People choose to avoid confrontation , prefer to give others the benefit of the doubt and are willing to overlook some social indiscretions with those they know and respect .
3 ) The ease of private communication due to modern technology , such as email and cell phones , has made it easier to conduct indiscretions transparently .
4 ) There is little or no oversight of religious leaders .
5 ) Religious leaders obtain intimate knowledge about their congregants ’ personal lives through the various hats they wear , including that of counselor and confidante , which makes congregants vulnerable .
6 ) Congregations are considered safe sanctuaries , so congregants are more likely to let down their guard with religious leaders than they would with others .
The study also recommended prevention strategies including educating the public about CSM and the fact that it should be considered an abuse of power — not a consensual affair between two people of equal power .
The study also recommends providing scripture - based education on the role of power and providing clear role expectations and oversight for religious leaders .
Last , legislation should be enacted that defines sexual contact with congregants as illegal , not just immoral .

Okay , first of all , I have to say " sorry for insulting a whole genre in this way " but to be clear I do n't like black metal and I was harsh toward it by saying the F*** word ....
I am not just shitting and have nothing to do except entering threads about black metal and fuck up around , I have listened to BM albums like " Death Cult Armageddon " by Dimmu Borgir , " Nymphetamine " and " Midian " by CoF , and I enjoyed some songs , but in general I can't stand black metal .
And by the way I am not a fan of Power Metal as much as Symphonic metal , and Nightwish is true music not commercial stuff .
Who by the hell can do an album like Oceanborn in 1998 ?
ain't it creativity to create such " Genre " with that album ?
Another point : Tuomas from Nightwish has put music for some BM songs done by " Darkwoods my Betrothed " and he 's a fan of black metal .
for the one who said all of my favorites bands are shit : do you think that Megadeth is a shitty band ?
they have the main influence on 90's death metal bands .
And Epica ?
the first band to have an extended use of orchestra and choir mixed with growls ?
and have you listened to Nu.Clear .
Dawn to judge them baby , have you listened to the Syrian Dream Theater , I guess you have to check Nu.Clear .
Dawn before judging them ?
and i wanna know where is the commercial elements in Saturnus songs ?
please read well before saying that my favorite bands are commercial and crap .
I do n't think that commercial bands would do such things ...
Night Wisher , think about what you are saying .
It is not universally understood that " Oceanborn " is a fantastic album .
This is your opinion .
A lot of people do not like it as much as you do n't like " Death Cult Armageddon " .
Granted , Nightwish was the first " metal " band to have an operatic front - woman .
But symphonic elements were being utilized far before bands like Nightwish .
Guess what genre was doing that well before Nightwish .
Thats right , Nightwisher , black metal .
Celtic Frost , Emperor , Arcturus , Limbonic Art , Korova , Troll , and Obtained Enslavement were all black metal bands using symphonies in their music .
Hell , even Dimmu Borgir and Cradle of Filth had symphonic elements before Nightwish .
Toumas , being a black metal fan , probably took the symphony idea from Emperor !
He then thought it could make money by applying the symphonic elements to power metal with a female vocalist .
And Epica ?
First to combine choirs , orchestras and death growls ?
Yeah right , dude !
Epica reared its ugly head in 2003 for crying out loud !
What about Therion , or Haggard who have been doing that since the early ninties ?
Get your damned facts straight , kid !
Well , Epica or you can say After Forever created a style that combines a lot of genres with symphonic elements while Therion and Haggard used to be pure death metal bands in 1990 ( I can't remember ) and I have the Demo of haggard which is pure death and yeah I 've seen a song by Therion which has pure death metal playing , while Epica and After Forever ( with Mark ) combines a lot of genres ( Gothic , Power , Progressive ) with symphonic elements and growls .... And you did n't answer me about Nu.Clear .
Dawn and Saturnus which you considered commercial ...
Night Wisher , I must agree with you on Saturnus .
I listened to their myspace songs and discovered that they are a very good death doom metal band .
Personally , I can't see how someone with your tastes could like something like that .
I can not find a way to hear Nu.Clear .
Dawn due to the fact that they do not have a myspace .
I 'll take your word for it .
Therefore , two of your favorite bands are not commercial .
And Therion released
Theli in 1996 which combined choirs , orchestras , and death growls in metal way before Epica and After Forever .
Haggard 's first symphonic album came out in 1997 .

Se vengan por la reciente aprehensión de 25 plagiarios
CHIHUAHUA , Chih . —
El activista Benjamín Franklin Le Barón Ray , cabeza de un movimiento social contra el secuestro , fue asesinado la madrugada de ayer en represalia por la captura de una banda de plagiarios que presuntamente denunció .
El hecho provocó indignación en la comunidad mormona de Le Barón y la advertencia de que tomarán justicia por propia mano .
Durante la madrugada , unos 20 hombres armados y presumiblemente vestidos de militar levantaron a Benjamín Le Barón de su casa , en el municipio de Galeana , 350 kilómetros al noroeste de la capital de Chihuahua .
El grupo armado entró al domicilio tirando puertas y ventanas , para torturar al activista frente a su esposa e hijos , y luego secuestrarlo .
Con él fue levantado su cuñado Luis Carlos Widman Stubss , de 30 años , quien había acudido a auxiliar a sus familiares al oír el alboroto .
Benjamín , de 36 años , encabezó protestas este año contra la inseguridad , las extorsiones y los secuestros de miembros de su comunidad , incluido su hermano Érick , liberado hace mes y medio sin pago de rescate , ya que la comunidad mormona acordó no pagar el millón de dólares que exigían los delincuentes .
Dejan mensaje con represalia
El grupo de sicarios ingresó por las ventanas a la vivienda cerca de la 1:30 horas , según relataron familiares .
Benjamín , dijeron , se percató de la presencia de varios hombres vestidos a la usanza militar y pensó que se trataba de soldados .
Alcanzó a decir : “ Que bueno que son ustedes ” .
Acto seguido comenzaron a golpearlo .
Después de la tortura , lo sujetaron y obligaron a ver , frente a sus cinco hijos , los abusos sexuales que cometieron a su esposa .
Unos 15 minutos después llegó Luis Carlos .
Ambos fueron sacados y asesinados en una brecha que conduce de la cabecera municipal de Galena al poblado de Flores Magón , a 50 kilómetros de su hogar .
Frente a su domicilio , los captores dejaron una lona firmada por El General , en la que se lee : “ Para los de Le Barón , que no creen , para que ahora sí crean , va como venganza por los 25 jóvenes levantados y detenidos en Nicolás Bravo ” .
También se amenaza de muerte a Romney Jones , otro de los líderes del movimiento y hermano del subsecretario de Fomento de la Sagarpa , Jeffrey Jones .
Se cree que el ataque es respuesta a la supuesta contratación de un grupo de inteligencia por parte de la comunidad que busca dar con el paradero de los secuestradores y asesinos , pero ello no ha sido confirmado por las autoridades .
Captura que terminó en venganza
El 12 de junio , elementos del Ejército mexicano arrestaron a 25 delincuentes en el poblado de Nicolás Bravo , municipio de Madera .
Dicha banda se dedicaba al secuestro y extorsión en toda la zona noroeste del estado , que comprende los municipios de Casas Grandes , Janos , Namiquipa y el propio Galena .
Algunos de sus miembros reconocieron que su líder era José García El General .
Se presume que varios de ellos participaron en el plagio de Érick , hermano de Benjamín , y que propició el nacimiento del movimiento social de protesta .
El portavoz del Operativo Conjunto Chihuahua , Enrique Torres , informó en su momento que la detención de los 25 sujetos se había logrado tras denuncias anónimas de habitantes de la zona , lo que al parecer ocasionó que los delincuentes buscaran venganza en los dirigentes de los Le Barón .
Tomarán las armas Habitantes de la colonia Le Barón revelaron que el crimen , aunado a la ola de secuestros previos , causó tal malestar que han decidido tomar las armas e iniciar por cuenta propia un operativo tanto de defensa de sus familias , como de búsqueda de los responsables .
Para lo anterior , desde la mañana del martes un contingente partió a Estados Unidos , la mayoría de los Le Barón tienen doble nacionalidad , para adquirir rifles y equipo de campaña .
Tras conocer del crimen , el gobernador José Reyes Baeza conminó a “ estar juntos , para hacerle la vida imposible a quienes se decidan a atentar contra los derechos y garantías de las personas en el estado ” .
Afirmaciones que de inmediato fueron calificadas como tibias por habitantes de la zona noroeste .
El mandatario agregó que ningún acto de barbarie debe amedrentar o intimidar a la autoridad ni a la sociedad .
La procuradora de Justicia , Patricia Rodríguez , visitó el municipio de Galena para coordinar las tareas de investigación , al tiempo que el Ejército , la Policía Federal y la Ministerial Investigadora , además del Sistema de Inteligencia Policial ( Cipol ) , montaron un operativo de rastreo para ubicar a los sicarios .
El gobernador informó que dos helicópteros apoyan en el megaoperativo para dar con los responsables .
Legisladores federales , además de organizaciones como México Unido Contra la Delincuencia , condenaron el asesinato .
Demandaron al gobierno federal envíe elementos de seguridad para resguardar a la comunidad mormona .

PORT ANGELES , WA — Voters have already received their mail ballots across the Evergreen State and the two hottest issues in the Nov. 3 election are I -1033 , a rightwing measure to impose deep spending cuts , and another ballot question , R - 71 to ratify the state legislature ’s Domestic Partnership law .
Members of unions and community organizations are standing at street corners across the state holding up placards that read , “ Save Our Schools … Vote No on Eyman 1033 . ” R - 71 backers are standing on the same corners with placards that read , “ Vote Yes on R - 71 . ” Activist Susan Shaffer was on a street corner in Sequim with a “ Vote No in Eyman - 1033 ” in one hand and “ Vote Yes on R - 71 ” in the other .
Full and half page newspaper ads have sprouted warning that I -1033 , like California ’s Prop - 13 , will inflict ruin on public education , health , the environment , roads and bridges .
Washington Families Standing together blasted the rightwing homophobes for putting R - 71 on the ballot , branding it “ Washington State ’s version of Prop - 8 ” that outlawed same - sex marriages in California .
The group urged a “ yes ” vote on R - 71 to uphold the state ’s Domestic Partnership Law .
The Port Angeles City Council voted unanimously Oct. 20 to oppose I -1033 after four witnesses warned that it will inflict deep cuts to schools , public safety , and the Olympic Medical Center ( OMC ) , the only hospital on the north Olympic Peninsula .
Bill Kildall , coordinator of Reform Health Care NOW told the council , I - 1033 “ will cripple government ’s ability to help thousands who have lost their jobs , homes , and health care due to the current recession .
It will lock in cuts , force layoffs and even school closures . ”
OMC , a public non-profit hospital , has $ 7 million in uncompensated care , according to CEO Eric Lewis , who attributed the debt to emergency room treatment of the 9,000 people on the north Olympic Peninsula who lack health insurance .
Kildall told a news conference at the public library here Oct. 19 , “ Tim Eyman ’s I - 1033 is soft terrorism .
He wants to take the government down , weaken government to the point that only the privileged can enjoy public services .
They are not interested in promoting good government or the welfare of the people . ”
Eyman is a notorious anti-government fanatic who repeatedly has placed Prop - 13 style anti-tax measures on the Washington State ballot .
Kildall compared Eyman ’s anti-government initiative to the “ insurance lobby ” in the nation ’s capital , “ parasites making profits ” from their sabotage of health care reform .
I -1033 would freeze state and local spending at this year ’s level plus the rate of inflation and population growth .
Any surplus funds above the current spending must be returned in reduced property taxes in the following year .
State and local governments in Washington State are already grappling with huge deficits and have been forced to impose sweeping cuts and layoffs to all public services including schools , public health , and public works maintenance and construction .
John Borah , a retired city planner told the news conference , “ Revenge toward the government is the motive of Eyman ’s I -1033 .
But the vengeance assaults not the government but 632,000 children on Medicaid , women , the sick , the poor … ”
He pointed out that many programs including Medicaid and the SCHIP children ’s health program require state matching funds to qualify for federal funding .
“ It means our state will lose ten federal dollars for every ten dollar reduction in state funding , ” he said .
Carol Mahr , representing the League of Women Voters said I - 1033 “ will make the recession worse and undermine the ability of government to respond to the economic crisis at all levels . ”
Washington State ’s jobless rate surged last month to 9.2 percent and is expected to exceed 10 percent in months to come .
John Marrs , Chairman of the Clallam County Democratic Central Committee said , “ Clearly , I - 1033 threatens good governance . ”
He cited the so - called TABOR law in Colorado , approved in a voter referendum but suspended two years later after the law inflicted enormous damage to Colorado ’s schools , public infrastructure , public health and safety and the environment .
John Hennessey , a leader of Veterans for Peace , said vets “ are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and many are not covered by veterans health benefits .
They are subject to mortgage foreclosures and job loss in this deep recession .
I - 1033 should go down to defeat . ”
Dr. Ben Chambers , a retired family physician , chairman of the Clallam County Democratic Club , said I - 1033 will slash programs that enable senior citizens to remain in their homes .
“ Seniors will be forced into nursing homes at great expense , ” he said .
Green Party leader Nelson Cone said the rightwing teabaggers have been “ vocal ” adding , “ Our hope is that those who are more quiet will step forward and vote this down . ”

Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner faces a major public - relations problem .
His phone records and broader calendar , obtained by the Associated Press , indicate that most of his contacts with the financial sector in the first seven months of this year were in fact with just three mega- banks : Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , and J.P. Morgan Chase .
While such skewed access to a top policymaker would raise eyebrows at any time , this disclosure is particularly difficult for Geithner .
He is known to have deep contacts with a small number of banks , partly from his time at the New York Fed ( as reported by The New York Times in April ) and partly from his mentor , Robert Rubin , formerly of Goldman and Citi .
Geithner himself has confronted this issue directly before , and always insists that his policies are intended to help the entire financial system and thus the whole economy .
“ I 've been in public service all my life … ” he told PBS in May .
“ And I would never do anything and be part of any policy that 's designed to benefit some piece of our financial system .
The only thing that we care about and the only obligation I have is try to make sure this financial system is doing a better job of meeting the needs of businesses and families across the country . "
Such statements are hard to square with the fact that , in the height of the crisis , he actually talked primarily with only three big banks — not even representative of the entire field of large banks ( e.g. , Wells Fargo and Bank of America ) , let alone the small and medium - size banking sector that is now getting hammered .
In addition , while there are ordinarily many safeguards around officials ’ private sector contacts , none of these function effectively during a financial crisis .
For example , Henry Paulson , Jr. , the previous Treasury secretary , was initially scrupulous about keeping his distance from Goldman Sachs , but as soon as the crisis broke in September 2008 , he immediately obtained a waiver allowing him to talk early and often with his former employer .
In any crisis , policymakers need to get information direct from the markets and to understand fast - moving developments .
But precisely because the exact issues are hard to comprehend and even basic facts are open to many interpretations , it ’s an incredible advantage for any banker to have near exclusive access to a top official decision maker — they can shape world view at the very top ( including in the Oval Office ) and skew any rescue efforts massively in their own favor .
Presumably , there will now be a great deal of scrutiny — including congressional subpoenas — regarding actions of the Big Three that had the inside track to Secretary Geithner .
Investigators will likely focus on follow - on phone calls and emails from the respective CEOs to managers of their trading desks and other people responsible for moving money around .
Did any of these banks or individuals benefit in any measurable way ( e.g. , in terms of their stock price or the perceived risk of bankruptcy ) from specific pieces of information gleaned or general tone inferred in exchanges with the secretary ?
If a diligent prosecutor brings to bear the latest statistical tools of financial pathology ( which now allow more accurate determination of who did and did not benefit in this kind of situation ) , what he or she will uncover ?
More to the point , there will presumably now be a mini-industry muckraking through this material and putting pressure on Secretary Geithner for further disclosures , testimony , and the like .
If Geithner can argue that his contacts with Wall Street were part of a diversified portfolio of interactions on the part of the president ’s inner circle , this would take the edge off his current predicament .
There will also be strong pressure on Geithner ’s colleagues to come to his rescue , specifically by providing records of their own private - sector conversations .
If those calendars show , for example , that Larry Summers — head of the White House National Economic Council — was in regular contact with a broader or at least different set of bankers , this would help Geithner to no end .
Summers is close to the financial sector , but his network of strongest connections does not overlap exactly with that of Geithner — for example , Summers is closer to hedge funds , where he used to work .
If Geithner can argue that his contacts with Wall Street were part of a diversified portfolio of interactions on the part of the president ’s inner circle , this would take the edge off his current predicament .
But Summers ’ records have a greater degree of protection from Freedom of Information Act requests or from congressional inquiry .
As Karl Rove ’s lawyers are happy to explain , existing interpretations of “ executive privilege ” include anyone close to the president in the White House , e.g. , Summers — but not the secretary of the Treasury .
Summers can still voluntarily release his calendar and presumably will do so if that would help — after all , Geithner is a protégé , they work closely together , and the administration ’s banking policy is really their joint effort .
And Summers must reckon , correctly :
If he refuses to release his records , that would imply their content is actually very damaging .

In a setback for supporters of gun rights , a federal appeals court in San Francisco has set aside a major ruling by three of its own judges that made it easier to challenge local gun restrictions .
Without explanation , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , on Wednesday ordered a hearing before 11 judges on an earlier decision by a three - judge panel that applied the Second Amendment right to own guns to state and local laws .
In extending the Second Amendment to the states , the Ninth Circuit stood alone among the federal circuit courts of appeals that have taken on the issue .
Two circuits declined to apply the amendment to the states .
That conflict between the circuits was widely seen as inviting quick review by the Supreme Court , a possibility that could be reduced by the Ninth Circuit ’s reversal .
The California case , Nordyke v. King , involves an ordinance banning firearms at a public fairground .
In a unanimous opinion in April , the three - judge panel upheld the ordinance but said Second Amendment protections applied , citing a landmark 2008 decision by the Supreme Court .
In that case , District of Columbia v. Heller , the justices found for the first time that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to keep and bear arms for personal use .
That decision did not apply the Second Amendment to state and local laws .
Classical Music and MP3 Players July 6 , 2009
Roscoe , N.Y .
For quite some time , I believed that it was impossible to use an MP3 player with classical music .
I based this belief on the following evidence :
1 . In all the iPod commercials I 've seen , not one features some hipster dancing entrancified to , say , Beethoven 's 7th Symphony .
2 . The capacity of MP3 players is often measured in terms of how many " songs " the device can store .
Although the song is clearly the dominant ( virtually exclusive ) musical form in commercial pop , the song is only one of many different forms in classical music .
In the MP3 - player world , however , everything is a song .
( I know some people like that , too :
They refer to almost every piece of music — no matter if it's a symphony or a string quartet — as a " song . "
Oddly enough , these same people , upon hearing a piece of music from the classical repertoire that could legitimately be classified as a song , will invariably refer to it as " opera . "
Very strange . )
3 . The one time I downloaded something from iTunes ( I needed a Mahler symphony in a hurry and I was away from my CDs ) the bit rate was clearly inadequate to render the music with acceptable fidelity .
But I kept an open mind about the matter .
About two years ago , I bought an 8 - gig Zune , and on my last birthday , I replaced it with a 120 - gig Zune .
Much to my surpise I have discovered that it is indeed possible to get classical music into the Zune , and to play it back .
Technically , it seems to work .
Otherwise , it 's a constant struggle , and my original presumption was correct :
You really can't use MP3 players with classical music .
The big problem is that MP3 players are structured around a paradigm — let 's call it the Artist - Album - Song paradigm — that apparently works just dandy for commercial pop albums , but it pretty much a disaster for classical music .
For example , here 's the hierarchy used to store and present music on MP3 players :
Artist : The Rolling Stones Album : Exile on Main Street Song : Rocks Off Song : Rip this Joint etc .
The Artist - Album hierarchy parallels the way in which CDs are shelved in a store , and songs are stored on the CD .
But as you can easily confirm with a stroll through the Classical department of your local Tower Records your local Virgin Megastore J&R Music World in New York City , the rest of us do n't shop that way .
( Or check out ArkivMusic.com , which more than any other site knows how to present classical music to the consumer . )
We prefer a hierarchy that looks more like this ( and throughout this analysis I will use the term " Artist " to encompass individual performers , ensembles , and conductors with orchestras ) :
Composer : Franz Schubert Composition : String Quintet in C Major Artist : Cleveland Quartet plus Yo - Yo Ma Movement : 1 . Allegro ma non troppo Movement : 2 . Adagio Movement : 3 . Scherzo . Presto – Trio .
Andante sostenuto Movement : 4 . Allegretto
Notice the presence of the Composer , which is probably the major difference between classical music and commercial pop .
In pop music , the composer is still extremely important — somebody always needs to write the music ! — but is pretty much ignored by the music 's consumers .
( What infinitesimal percentage of Michael Jackson fans can actually name the songwriter behind " Thriller " ? )
Notice the Artist is listed after the Composition but before the Movements .
This hierarchy allows accessing the same Composition performed by different Artists .
And notice there 's no Album in this hierarchy .
The Album is a structural element in pop music , but an artifical construct in classical music .
As artificial constructs go , however , the Album has become one that 's familiar and comfortable , so it would also be nice to access an Album that has been used to group related pieces by a single Composer played by a single Artist .
Here 's a recent example :
Composer : Johann Sebastian Bach Artist : Hélène Grimaud Album : Bach / Hélène Grimaud Composition : Well - Tempered Clavier , Book 1 : No. 2 in C minor Movement : Prelude Movement : Fugue Composition : Well - Tempered Clavier , Book 1 : No. 4 in C sharp minor Movement : Prelude Movement : Fugue Composition : Concerto for Harpsichord in D minor Movement : Allegro Movement : Adagio Movement : Allegro Composition : Well - Tempered Clavier , Book 1 : No. 6 in D minor etc .
Notice how multiple Movements ( corresponding to tracks on the album ) are grouped into Compositions .
Suppose you want to navigate to this Album on your MP3 player and play only the Concerto .
There 's no way to do it .
There 's no concept in either CDs or MP3 players that indicates that multiple tracks are bound together in a single Composition .
This is why the Shuffle or Random feature so popular on MP3 players is totally brain - dead for classical music listeners .
Of course we would love to have a Random feature — but we want one that knows how to play entire compositions , not one that serves up one movement from one piece , another from another , and so forth .
The listing of Song titles by MP3 players is undoubtedly useful for listeners of pop music .
The feature allows accessing a song independent of the Artist who recorded it or the Album that it appears on .
For classical music , it 's another brain - dead feature .
Even having a list of Compositions in alphabetical order independent of Composer does n't make much sense .
Of course , there are some classical albums — particularly those that fall under the category of recital albums — where the hierarchy used for pop music works OK .
Here 's one :
Artist : Susan Graham Album : Un Frisson Français - A Century Of French Song Song : Camille Saint - Saëns : " Danse macabre " Song : Georges Bizet : Chanson d'avril Song : César Franck : Nocturne , M 85 etc
Such albums are often shelved in a store by Artist in much the same way as pop music , and we tend to listen to them as a whole because the Artist has put together a coherent recital of a selection of different music .
But these are really the exceptions rather than the rule .
In ripping my CDs and getting them onto my Zune , I have yet to find a reasonable solution .
At first I thought that I should edit the Artist field to indicate the Composer instead .
( Some CDs rip like that anyway . )
But then I realized that I would need to include the Artist in the Album information .
Otherwise I would run the risk of having duplicate Artist and Album names , which can make the ripping and organizational software think they 're actually the same .
Instead , I decided to integrate the Composer name in the Album field so it reads something like " Schubert : String Quintet in C Major . "
( Many CDs rip like that . )
But this means I find myself scrolling through a bunch of albums of music from the same composer .
( My Zune includes the 37 Hyperion CDs of Schubert lieder , for example . )
The list should be a hierarchy .
It is also possible to use external software to group individual movements into single composition files .
This also helps eliminate those little moments of silence helpfully inserted to pad tracks in MP3 files that become horrifying interruptions in long orchestral movements or opera .
But the last thing I need is to devote a lot of additional fritter when ripping CDs ; it 's bad enough battling the often missing or incorrect textual information — mistakes that are often compounded in multi-CD sets .
Of course , in the wider scheme of things , the big question is : Who cares ?
We all know that people who listen to classical music constitute about one - one thousandth of 0.001 % of the population , so the number of people trying to get classical music on their MP3 players totals out to about four — apparently me and three other losers .
( And worse , we also get branded as " elitist " in some circles — in these days about as deadly a label as " communist " or " sodomite " had for earlier generations . )
Corporations like Apple and Microsoft surely are n't going to worry about such a miniscule part of their market .
That 's not where the money is , and the Ayn Randish philosophy that pervades the computer industry actually mandates that nothing special be done for classical music if it does n't result in more bucks .
But the promotion of technology that is actually hostile to classical music will only make the situation worse .
Suppose the Kindle let you read James Paterson with ease but not Jane Austen .
Would n't people consider that a severe deficiency ?
Why is it any different with music ?
So unless somebody wants to make the argument that a 400 - year music tradition should be bulldozed over and forgotten , the very least we should expect is a technology that conforms to the way we actually listen to this music .
Syrian student ban on KAUST ’s new supercomputer 8 , October 2009
Posted by thegulfblog.com in American ME Relations Tags : IBM supercomputer
Saudi King Abdullah ’s latest pet project , the much hyped , well funded and so far independent and autonomous King Abdullah University for Science and Technology ( KAUST ) has been grabbing headlines throughout the world .
One of their boasts was that the University would be equipped with one of the world ’s fastest supercomputers , nicknamed Peregrine .
Scholars from distinguished Universities such as Stanford , Oxford and Cornell , to name a few , would have access to Peregrine as partners in this endeavour .
In an odd but somehow unsurprising turn of events it transpires that , according to Arabian Business 15 Syrian students at KAUST will be denied access to Peregrine at America ’s behest because of their ongoing Syrian embargo .
Such a clause was apparently inserted into the IBM - KAUST memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) taking the decision out of the hands of the University .
However , with the recent visit of King Abdullah to Syria and gently mooted notions of some kind of Syrian - US rapprochement , lifting such a ban could be used as a simple and relatively cheap American sign of support and good will in the near future .
Indeed , it is hardly as if it is a particularly effective ban that impinges in any way , shape or from on the powers that be in Damascus .
Overall , this situation is , however , only a small blip in KAUST ’s otherwise impressive start .
One must hope , therefore , that KAUST can , overall , resist such changes and maintain ( or rather build up ) its international reputation and not be dragged down by niggly but nevertheless pertinent issues restricting access , freedoms and the independence of the institution as a whole .
Apple has opened the source code of Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) , a powerful , system - wide concurrency framework that was introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 .
The userspace library component of GCD , which is called libdispatch , is now available for download under the terms of the Apache Software License .
This will potentially make it possible , though not necessarily easy , for the feature to be adapted for use on other platforms .
The source code of Apple 's kernel - level GCD optimizations is also available as part of the XNU source tree , but the documentation indicates that kernel changes may not necessarily be required .
Our own John Siracusa 's epic Snow Leopard review describes GCD in exhaustive depth so I 'll spare you all of the details here .
It provides an efficient system - wide threadpool and some high - level programming constructs that vastly simplify parallelization for application developers .
Although GCD is now open for widespread adoption , there are technical and licensing barriers that could prevent it from being used pervasively on alternate platforms .
The high - level GCD API makes extensive use of blocks , a C language extension developed by Apple .
This feature has not yet been accepted into the upstream GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) mainline , which means that it can't be used on Linux without using Clang and LLVM .
There appear to be ways to use GCD without blocks , but would n't be pretty or particularly practical .
Apple has supplied its source code for several implementations of blocks , including one for the Low - Level Virtual Machine ( LLVM )
Clang compiler and for the company 's own fork of GCC .
Apple 's blocks are basically an approximation of closures , anonymous functions that have access to local variables .
This concept is adored by Ruby programmers and is also found in a number of functional programming languages .
It 's an enormously valuable language feature that can be used to simplify code in a wide range of scenarios , not just concurrency .
For example , using blocks for event callbacks would lead to cleaner and more maintainable code in many cases , particularly in user interface programming .
Blocks would also allow C programmers to use graceful functional programming patterns for manipulating collections .
Making GCD more portable is obviously just one of many advantages that would come if the GCC developers were to embrace blocks and endorse Apple 's effort to make the feature an official part of the C language standard .
GCD aside , if you look at the really elegant high - level frameworks for application - level threading that we have today on Linux , it 's breathtakingly obvious that they could be made better by adding support for blocks .
The QtConcurrent library , for example , is built almost entirely around the map / reduce paradigm , where Apple 's syntactically slick closures would be a perfect fit .
Now that I 've outed myself as a functional programming enthusiast , I 'll get back to the topic of GCD on Linux .
The blocks implementation is under the MIT license , which is GPL - compatible .
This means that there are n't any licensing impediments preventing it from coming to upstream GCC .
The libdispatch code , however , is distributed under the Apache license , which is unfortunately not compatible with GPL v2 for a handful of truly inane and exasperating reasons .
This compatibility issue was resolved in version 3 of the GPL .
The implication for GCD adoption is ( unless I'm overlooking something ) that libdispatch can't be used in GPL v2 applications .
Most Linux applications are v2 " or later " which means that they can be used under the terms of either v2 or v3 .
But some applications are v2 - only and cannot be mingled with Apache - licensed code .
This is probably going to be problematic and could contribute to skepticism about GCD among Linux developers .
Despite the impediments to Linux adoption , Apple 's move to open GCD is still an extremely positive and valuable contribution to the open source software community .

( CNN ) -- Starting Tuesday , many " robocalls " from telemarketers will be illegal .
A new ban on automated telemarketing calls goes into effect Tuesday .
Businesses that try to push products on consumers with automated and unsolicited calls will face fines of up to $ 16,000 per call , according to the Federal Trade Commission .
" American consumers have made it crystal clear that few things annoy them more than the billions of commercial telemarketing robocalls they receive every year , " FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in a news release .
Calls from politicians , public service announcements and " informational " calls will be exempt from the new rule .
A call alerting a traveler that his or her flight has been delayed would still be allowed , for example .
Banks , telephone carriers and most charitable organizations are also excluded from the ban , the FTC says .
The FTC asks people to report questionable robocalls by visiting its complaint Web site or by calling 1- 877 - FTC - HELP .
" If consumers think they 're being harassed by robocallers , they need to let us know , and we will go after them , " Leibowitz said .

The ban on many pre-recorded calls was approved by the FTC in August of 2008 and is the last of a series of amendments to go into effect , said Lois Greisman , the FTC 's associate director of marketing practices .
She said the ban applies only to pre-recorded calls and encouraged consumers to sign up for the federal " do not call " registry for additional protections .
Robocalls to mobile phones already are illegal , she said .
People still will be able to receive telemarketer calls if they give companies written permission to contact them .
Nate Anderson , a blogger at Ars Technica , a technology site , cheered the amendments but said many calls are illegal even without the new amendments .
" Most of the robocalls received by people in the office here are already illegal to do begin with -- pitches for time shares and bogus car warranties top the list of such calls , " he wrote .

For the third and fourth seasons of Star Trek : The Next Generation ( hereafter referred to as ST : TNG ) , I was its Scientific Technical Advisor .
As I usually explain this to people , my job was to read all scripts and stories purchased by the series ' writing staff and then point out things that were either scientifically impossible , or inconsistent with the scientifically - impossible things already established in Star Trek .
The job also included suggesting plausible " technobabble " for the impossible things the writers wanted to leave in .
Most of my work was done at home -- the stories and scripts were delivered by motorcycle messenger , and my remarks were sent in to the Star Trek offices by fax .
Getting In
How did I end up in this situation , you ask ?
I studied Geophysics and Space Physics my first year in grad school at UCLA ( 1987 - 88 ) .
I left the field after one year ( under something of a cloud ) to pursue something more applied , but remained on good terms with my advisor , Dr. David Paige .
Some time in 1988 , Gene Roddenberry asked Louis Friedman , the executive director of the Planetary Society , to recommend an L.A. - area scientist who might be interested in the job , and was directed to Dave Paige , who said yes .
A year later , Dave decided he preferred to devote his time to his research , and recommended me as his replacement , because I had knowledge of both science and science fiction , and because I had shown an interest in the work he was doing for the show .
Actually , it was a bit sneakier than that .
Dave went out of town for three weeks and had me fill in , impersonating him .
Since the scripts and stories were delivered by messenger , and the comments on their technical content were sent in by fax , this was easy .
This helped to grease the bitter pill of Dave 's resignation by allowing him to say , in effect , " See , this guy can do the job so well you did n't even notice it was n't me . "
Whether this logic was accepted by the ST : TNG writing staff or not , I was hired ( at $ 450 per episode ) under the title Scientific Technical Advisor .
The Work
During this time I was pursuing a Master 's Degree in Information Science full - time at UCLA .
The technical - advisor position involved perhaps eight hours of work per week -- not a bad hourly rate of pay for a starving graduate student .
My bachelor 's degree in physics and math was more than adequate for the show 's needs .
I only botched once ( on whether one circularizes an orbit by thrusting at apogee or perigee ; I was in a hurry and did n't double - check my answer ) .
In the course of two years , the writers at ST : TNG ( under the direction of co-Executive Producer Michael Piller ) ignored probably a good 60 % of everything I had to say , and that was just in the technical realm .
I did my best to restrain the growth of the Star Trek particle zoo , but the writing staff , particularly during Season Four ( 1990 - 91 ) seemed addicted to the " Particle of the Week " syndrome .
Though I did n't receive a screen credit , I did put my fingerprints on the show in a number of ways that did reach the screen ... mostly by preventing egregious stupidities .
" Evolution " , an episode in which self - replicating nanomachines or " nanites " nearly take over the ship , was originally about a takeover by common dust mites -- the tiny arachnids that live in your furniture and eat your shed skin cells .
In early drafts of the script , these little chaps had somehow evolved not only individual sentience , but language skills and a machine culture ( zipping around the interior of the Enterprise in tiny airships ! ) , in the three years since the ship was commissioned .
" Evolution " was the first ST : TNG script I worked on .
I laughed out loud when I read it , at the notion of cramming into something as small as a dust mite enough biological neurons to support an intelligence capable of conversation .
The story could not be abandoned -- at the time I was brought in , it was days from shooting ... sets were being built , guest stars had been hired .
This was going to be another " Home Soil " ( the worst of the show 's first - season episodes ) .
The only way I could think of to even plausibly cram a self - aware intellect into something as small as a dust mite was by conglomerating a bunch of nanocomputers .
In a last - minute fix by the ST : TNG writing staff , the dust mites became artificial organisms that had evolved from laboratory cell - repair machines ( helped by Wesley 's Frankensteinian curiosity , of course ) .
The writers called these " nanites " ( to facilitate , I 'm sure , the use of a global search - and - replace to fix the script ) and the episode was shot .
( " Evolution " eventually brought me to the attention of the Foresight Institute , a Silicon Valley - based think - tank focused on helping society prepare for nanotechnology and other disruptive new technologies -- but the folks at Foresight have now forgiven me . )
Catching The Wave
The third - season episode " A Matter Of Perspective " emerged from the writers ' desire to rip off pay homage to the Kurosawa film Rashomon .
In order to present free - lance writer Ed Zuckerman 's idea of using the holodeck to dramatize the wildly divergent testimony of multiple witnesses in a murder investigation , a thorny technical problem had to be solved .
One of the fundamental rules of the series ( violated left and right , of course ) was that the holodeck " ca n't create anything dangerous " .
( If you do n't know what a holodeck is , what are you doing reading this far ? )
Yet , to add the required " threat - to - the - ship " subplot to the episode , it was necessary for the Enterprise to be affected by the same phenomenon that killed the alleged murder victim .
The writers wanted this threat to be the result of " re-creating " the destroyed space station in the holodeck .
This was one of the few instances when I actually visited the Paramount lot to participate in a story conference .
At the whiteboard in Michael Piller 's office , I explained my idea of making the holodeck construct act merely as a reflector / concentrator for an outside radiation source .
The reconstruction of the dead scientist 's laboratory was not itself inherently " dangerous " ( as per the series bible ) , but in combination with an external radiation source , its geometry made it as effective as the real concentrator in creating the destructive phenomenon the scientist had been studying .
This was good enough for the writers to go with .
They said , " Okay , we 've got this radiation field -- let 's call it ' Krieger waves ' for now , " and they went on with planning how to make the episode work dramatically .
I was surprised that the resulting draft of the script still used the phrase " Krieger waves " and somewhat tickled that that name stayed on the phenomenon throughout the rest of production .
( I had even provided a suitable pseudo - scientific explanation for what " Krieger waves " actually were -- a field that suppressed the strong nuclear force , making any matter exposed to it fissionable .
This was inspired by a disintegrator used in Larry Niven 's " Known Space " series of stories that suppressed the charge of the electron .
The dead scientist , Dr. Apgar , was supposed to be working on a power generator exploiting this phenomenon .
However , the line that explained this ended up on the cutting room floor , and in the final version of the episode " Krieger waves " are an unexplained macguffin . )
When the episode aired , I threw a party for my friends , and as we watched the episode we drank a toast every time a character uttered the family name .
( Remember " Hi , Bob " parties based on the Bob Newhart Show ?
It was like that . )
It 's too bad it 's such a bad episode .
The Rashomon idea was clever ( at least , it had n't been done on Star Trek before ) ; but the technical contortions they brought me in for , and the resulting technobabble , brought it to a screaming halt in the final act .
Meanwhile , the guest stars were wooden as hell and abominably made up in that patented " prosthetic forehead " style .
Epilogue : I Am Killed
In 1990 I finished my master 's degree at UCLA .
At the beginning of the fifth season of ST : TNG , when I was working at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica , I phoned Michael Piller to ask for a screen credit , and was instead told that they " would n't be renewing the position . "
( However , another science advisor , Naren Shankar was hired , with screen credit , a while afterward . )
I was not surprised .
Melinda Snodgrass , Hans Beimler , and Richard Manning were the only writers I worked with at ST : TNG who seemed to know or care at all about science , technology , and science fiction , and they all left the show at the end of the third season .
( Later on , however , Beimler and Manning would return to work on Deep Space Nine , IMNSHO the best of the latter - day Trek series . )
I was somewhat ungentle with the Hollywood egos of the rest of the writing staff .
I had already stopped watching the finished product around the middle of the fourth season .
It had gone from being an adventure to just a job , and I did n't miss it when it was over .
This is a site I plan on using to rant about and marvel at the engineering work of myself and others .

Every interaction I have with Planned Parenthood makes me proud to be an American , odd though that might be .
You folks are fighting the good fight , and it's a sad testimony that there 's only the one window in the building .

Implementing data structures in a way that uses efficiently memory should always be on your mind .
I do not mean going overboard and micro-optimizing memory allocation right down to the bit .
I mean organize data structures in memory so that you can avoid pointers , so that you can use contiguous memory segments , etc .
Normally , minimizing storage by avoiding extra pointers when possible will benefit your program in at least two ways .
First , the reduced memory requirement will make your data structure fit in cache more easily .
Remember that if pointers are 4 bytes long in 32 bits programming , they are 8 bytes long in 64 bits environments .
This yields better run time performance because you maximize your chances of having the data you need in cache .
Second , contiguous memory layouts also allow for efficient scans of data structures .
For example , if you have a classical binary tree , implemented using nodes having each two pointers , you will have to use a tree traversal algorithm , possibly recursive , to enumerate the tree ’s content .
If you do n’t really care about the order in which the nodes are visited , what ’s quite cumbersome .
It turns out that for special classes of trees , complete trees , there is a contiguous , and quite simple , layout .
Consider the following figure :
You notice that each node is numbered , and that you have the following relations holding between the nodes :
For a node , you have …
that its parent is given by ,
, that its left child is given by ,
, that its right child is given by ,
Assuming that the root is numbered .
This suggests the layout :
where the arrows corresponds to parent / child links .
The proof that this mapping works correctly is somewhat self - evident .
What is less evident , is that such mappings exist for trees with higher branching factors .
In general , if you have a tree with a branching factor of , you will have that , for a node ,…
the parent is given by ,
, the children are given by , , … .
So , plugging in the previous equations leads us to the binary tree case .
The case corresponds to higher - order three .
Letting gives us a layout for quad - trees , which are extensively used in computer graphics .
yields octrees which are also used in computer graphics applications , such as collision detection , ray tracing and volume rendering .
Note that if you put , you get a list , that the parent is given correctly by and the ( only ) child by .
The addresses of the first node in a row , for :
, is given by 0,1,3,7,15 , … or , is Sloane ’s A000225 .
, is given by 0,1,3,7,15 , … or , is Sloane ’s A000225 . , is given by 0,1,4,13,40,121 , … or , and is Sloane ’s A003462 .
, is given by 0,1,4,13,40,121 , … or , and is Sloane ’s A003462 . , is given by 0,1,5,31,85,341 , … or , and is Sloane ’s A002450 .
The general formula is .

The cases with , and can be implemented very efficiently depending on the type of processor you are using .
Of course , multiplies by powers of two can be replaced by left shifts .
On Intel processors , the following two functions :
inline int left_child ( int x ) { return 2 * x+1 ; } inline int right_child ( int x ) { return 2*x+2 ; }
Can each be replaced by a single lea instruction .
Assuming the parameter value is passed through eax , left_child should compile to lea eax , 2* eax + 1 .
Since the normal calling convention for Intel is to return integer types through eax , we ’re done .

If you think this addressing scheme is way cool , you ’ll find even more interesting that the scheme dates from way back [ 1 ] .
Although Williams considers it only in terms of a binary heap ( for heap sort ) and that expresses the addressing relations only in terms of the address of the parent ; one can understand through that very terse paper ( a page and a few lines ) that the addressing can be generalized .
Williams ’ paper is the earliest reference I could find on the addressing scheme .
However , I am not sure that it is the original paper ; surely the 1964 C.ACM report is based on earlier work ?

Then after budget cuts imposed in 1997 drove many private plans to drop out of the program , Congress steadily raised their payments .
Today Medicare pays the private plans , on average , 14 percent more than the same services would cost in traditional Medicare .
The bill being considered by the Senate Finance Committee is projected to cut the subsidies to Medicare Advantage companies by more than $ 100 billion over 10 years .
Although Republican rhetoric has triggered fears that Medicare Advantage enrollees might lose their coverage entirely if private plans drop out of the system , the real effect of the bill would likely be modest on average .
The value of an enrollee ’s added benefits would shrink by more than half from current levels but would not disappear ; they would still be worth about $ 500 a year in 2019 .
Douglas Elmendorf , the director of the Congressional Budget Office , told the committee that , under the bill as proposed by the committee chairman , he expected that almost all Medicare Advantage plans would continue to operate and almost all of their current enrollees would stay enrolled .
Total enrollment in Medicare Advantage would creep up by 200,000 over the next decade  that is , about 2.7 million fewer new enrollees than expected under current trends , a real chance for savings .
What the Republicans are n’t saying  and what the Democrats clearly are n’t saying enough  is that in important ways , coverage for a vast majority of Medicare recipients , those in traditional Medicare , should actually improve under health care reform .
The House legislation , the only bills in near - final form , would reduce and ultimately eliminate a gap  the so - called doughnut hole  in Medicare drug coverage that currently forces more than three million beneficiaries to pay for drugs entirely out of their own pockets once they hit specified spending levels .
That would also benefit many other beneficiaries who pay high premiums for coverage in the gap that they never end up using .
The House bills would also waive deductibles and co-insurance for preventive care that can head off serious illness , expand eligibility for programs that assist low - income beneficiaries and provide incentives for doctors and hospitals to coordinate care , improve quality , and lower costs .
All that should benefit many if not most Medicare beneficiaries .
And delivery system reforms should benefit the private plans as well .
In einer Berliner Szene - Bar stellt die Piratenpartei ihr Wahlkampfkonzept vor .
Die Partei kämpft für freien Zugang zu Wissen und Kultur sowie für " Bürgerrechte online und offline " : Der Staat , der seine Bürger zunehmend überwache , solle sich aus der Privatsphäre heraushalten .
Es geht um den Wahlkampf , doch es sieht aus wie eine Strandparty mitten in Berlin :
In die Bar 25 hat die Piratenpartei geladen , eine Holzhütte an der Spree .
An der Holzdecke hängen Disco - Kugeln , über die Wände sind bunte Tücher gespannt und im Hintergrund dudelt eine Ulk - Version von " Old McDonald Had a Farm " .
Hier stellt die junge Partei ihr Wahlkampfkonzept vor .
" Wir sind keine Spaßpartei , aber wir wollen trotzdem unseren Spaß haben " , heißt es bei der Präsentation .
Weiter hinten im Raum hängt eine Rolle mit Klopapier von der Decke .
" Klarmachen zum Ändern " lautet das Motto der Piratenpartei , die im September 2006 in Berlin gegründet wurde .
Sie ist das deutsche Pendant zur schwedischen Piratpartiet , die im Januar desselben Jahres das Licht der Welt erblickte .
Sie wollen wie die Piraten der Meere sein : Menschen , die sich " von den Repressalien der Obrigkeit befreiten und in kleinen Gruppen Demokratie und Gleichheit lebten " , schreiben sie über sich .
Gegen den " transparenten Bürger "
Die " Repressalien der Obrigkeit " - das sind für die Piraten vor allem eine Reihe von Gesetzen , die von der Großen Koalition auf den Weg gebracht wurden .
Dazu gehören das Gesetz zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung , das Gesetz für Internetsperren gegen Kinderpornografie und die Änderung des BKA - Gesetzes .
Gegen den " transparenten Bürger " setzt die Partei den " transparenten Staat " , dessen Entscheidungsprozesse für die Bürger einsehbar sein sollen .
Das jüngste Gesetz gegen Kinderpornografie sei ein " Dammbruch " , erklärt Tim Schmidt , der bei der Bundestagswahl auf Platz fünf der Berliner Landesliste antritt .
" Wenn sich der Bürger erst einmal daran gewöhnt hat , dass bestimmte Seiten im Internet zensiert werden , dann wird es später leichter , andere Seiten , auf denen vielleicht eine politisch unbequeme Meinung publiziert wurde , ebenfalls zu zensieren " , meint er. Ohnehin könnten die Sperren leicht umgangen werden .
Gegen die Verbreitung von Kinderpornografie helfen seiner Meinung nach nur mehr Fahnder und eine bessere internationale Zusammenarbeit .
Auch für den Kampf gegen den Terrorismus würden immer mehr Grundrechte eingeschränkt , sagt Aaron Koenig , Mitglied im Bundesvorstand der Piratenpartei .
Mit der Vorratsdatenspeicherung , die am 1 .
Januar 2008 in Kraft trat , wird mindestens sechs Monate gespeichert , wer wann wen angerufen oder wem eine E - Mail geschrieben hat .
Der Staat könne sich in private Computer einschleusen und Passwörter einsehen - damit nähere man sich China und dem Iran an , findet Koenig .
Tim Schmidt ist evangelischer
Theologe und sieht sich persönlich betroffen : Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung höhle das Seelsorgergeheimnis aus und mache das vertrauliche Gespräch mit dem Pfarrer unmöglich .
" Was privat ist , und was öffentlich - das sollte jeder selbst entscheiden können " , sagt er .
" Offline - Politiker "
Das Internet und der Wandel hin zu einer modernen Informationsgesellschaft , in der jeder freien Zugang zu Wissen und Kultur haben sollte , sind die Schwerpunkte der Piratenpartei .
Die regierenden " Offline - Politiker " , die " einen Browser nicht von einer Maus unterscheiden können " , so Koenig , seien mit dem Internet überfordert .
Die Hauptklientel der Piratenpartei ist denn auch der männliche Nerd - ein Computerfreak , der schon zu Schulzeiten an seinem Atari herumschraubte und seine Freizeit mit dem Programmieren verbrachte .
Mehrere Männer mit Dreitagebart und Trainingsjacke lümmeln auf den ausrangierten Ledersofas herum und spielen an ihren Laptops - dem ständigen Utensil der Piraten .
Heide Hagen von der Berliner Landesliste ist denn auch die einzige Frau , die das Wahlkampfkonzept mit vorstellt .
Auf der Website der Berliner Piratenpartei nennt sie sich " Künstler " und " überzeugter Neuköllner " .
Der Ton während der Präsentation ist locker und freundschaftlich : Jeder wird geduzt , und über die Entscheidung , welche Werbespots man im Fernsehen zeigen will , wurde basisdemokratisch abgestimmt .
Erklärtes Ziel der Piraten ist es , die Bürger stärker an Entscheidungsprozessen zu beteiligen .
Mit ihren drei Jahren ist die Partei noch jung , und so mag man es ihr nachsehen , wenn ihr zu anderen wichtigen Themen wie Klimaschutz , Wirtschaftskrise und Sozialpolitik ausführliche Konzepte noch fehlen .
Den Afghanistan - Einsatz findet Tim Schmidt jedenfalls " sehr schwierig " und die Einführung eines bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens sollte man " ernsthaft diskutieren " .
Dass sie sich auf ihre Stärken konzentriert , bringt der Partei Erfolg .
Bis zum Frühling dieses Jahres hatte die Partei weniger als 1000 Mitglieder .
Inzwischen sind es fast 6000 .
Mit diesem enormen Zuspruch hofft die Partei auch auf Mitglieder , die jenseits der Piraten - Schwerpunkte kompetent sind .
Mit anderen
Themen wolle man sich bewusst Zeit lassen und erst mit Experten beraten , erklärt Aaron Koenig .
" Aber je mehr Leute wir sind , desto kompetenter werden wir auch . "
Erfolgreich ist die Partei vor allem bei jüngeren Menschen , die sich selbstverständlich im Internet bewegen : Beim Mikroblogging - Dienst Twitter haben 13.000 User die Nachrichten der Piratenpartei abonniert , den Grünen folgen als zweitstärkster Partei etwa 6800 Interessierte .
Zwar sei das Knacken der Fünf - Prozent - Hürde durchaus ein " sportliches Ziel " , gibt Koenig zu .
Doch er ist sicher , dass viele Bürger am 27 .
September ihren " Änderhaken " bei der Piratenpartei setzen : " Wir werden es schaffen . "

Posted by John , September 15th , 2009 - under Poverty .
Tags : Classes
Never before has the goal of abolishing poverty been within our reach : there are no longer any insurmountable technical , resource or logistical obstacles to achieving it .
Yet … 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water and , every hour , 1,200 children die from preventable diseases ” .
– United Nations Development Program Annual Report , 2006
There is something seriously wrong with the way our economy operates .
A world of abundance which produces enough to provide two kilograms of food to every person every day instead leaves over a billion people in chronic hunger and poverty .
At the turn of the century global capitalism was still claiming there was now indisputable proof that it is the best of all possible worlds .
Yet the richest 1 per cent of adults on earth owned 40 per cent of global assets and the richest 10 per cent accounted for 85 per cent of the world total .
In contrast , the bottom half of the world ’s population owned just 1 per cent of the wealth .
Today in the United States – the richest country on earth – 46 million people do not have health insurance .
Over 10 million struggle to get by on the minimum wage of just $ 290 per week .
Over 37 million live in poverty .
In Australia , inequality is also the norm .
According to the Reserve Bank , the richest 20 per cent of Australian households own 63 per cent of all wealth in the country , while the bottom 20 per cent own just 0.2 per cent .
Between 1990 and 2005 , the average annual pay of a sample of CEOs rose by 564 per cent to $ 3.4 million .
In the face of this , last month the federal minimum wage was frozen at just $ 14.31 per hour .
Why , when , as the UN notes , “ there are no longer any insurmountable technical , resource or logistical obstacles ” to eradicating poverty , does such inequality persist the world over ?
The answer is not “ human nature ” :
There is nothing natural about going hungry , nor is there anything natural about hoarding resources and denying them to those in need .
Nor is the answer a lack of education :
The majority of people do n’t need to learn about the fact that we are poor .
We ’re not that stupid that we did n’t notice .
So what is it ?
Warren Buffett ( the second richest person on the planet with a personal fortune of $ 37 billion ) , when questioned about the economy , related to an interviewer the following :
I do n’t have a problem with guilt about money …
It ’s like I have these little pieces of paper that I can turn into consumption .
If I wanted to , I could hire 10,000 people to do nothing but paint my picture every day for the rest of my life .
What he illustrated in this response is something fundamental to understanding the persistence of inequality .
Those who control the wealth are not simply rich ; they are powerful because they can decide what other human beings will do with their time and energy .
Owning and controlling the world ’s resources – the offices , the factories , the aeroplanes , the computers , the telecommunications networks , the financial institutions etc – gives the ruling class the capacity to decide what gets produced , who produces it , where it gets produced and where the benefits of production go .
So while millions around the world are in need of shelter , clean water , medical treatment etc , Buffett and his ilk are busy bragging about how many paintings they might own .
The ruling class is callously indifferent to the trauma that capitalism causes the majority of people .
But this is not simply a defect of their humanity .
Because capitalism is driven by competition for profit these decisions that the rich and powerful make are not , and cannot be , directed to fulfilling human needs .
The profitability of business is completely counterposed to the interests of the majority of the planet .
The rich benefit from the fact that the majority of people in the world live a precarious existence .
They act to keep it that way because they need people who will have to work for them to create profit – whether staffing one of their shops or driving one of their trucks or producing munitions for one of their wars .
The more people live hand to mouth , the less money they will accept to get a job .
This is the economic law that the rich constantly evoke in the inverse – too much employment will threaten a “ wages push ” .
For business higher wages are a bad thing .
Understanding why inequality persists , then , is really about understanding that class is not just a question of the haves and the have nots .
It ’s a question about the decisions that get made which determine what happens in society at large .
The working class – those who do n’t own or control society ’s productive resources and do n’t direct other people ’s labour – has little or no control over the direction society takes because they are excluded from the decision - making processes regarding the world ’s resources .
So class is defined by material inequality and economic power .
The basis of that power is the production of profit through control of resources .
Everything else is secondary to that .
However , class society is also about much more than this .
The ruling class has a massive apparatus which enables them to organise the extraction of profits from the working class on a national basis .
The police force , the education system , the military , the parliament , the legal system and the media are all institutions whose importance lies in their role in maintaining class rule through protecting and legitimising the economic power of the ruling class .
A key confusion among people who would like to see a better world is that these institutions can seem like they are the source of power in our society , rather than instruments used to protect existing power .
While the control of institutions is obviously important and some can be sites of struggle ( parliament for example ) , understanding their role in sustaining capitalism helps to explain why the world never really seems to change .
We can and do , for example , elect different people to the parliament , get our news from alternative media sources and educate ourselves about the way the world really is , but the economic power of the ruling class remains unchallenged by any of this .
The solution to the world ’s inequality , then – to the fact that the majority of us are excluded from participating in decisions which fundamentally affect our society and our own lives , to the fact that the working class creates all of the wealth but has no say or control over it – is to build a political alternative which demands that human need be put ahead of profit .
More than that , though , it means building an alternative which understands that a world where the needs of humanity are placed above all other considerations can only come about through a direct challenge to the power of the ruling class , rather than accommodation to its wishes .
So the fundamental reason for understanding class is precisely so we can aim to rid the world of it .
This article , by Ben Hillier , first appeared in Socialist Alternative .
Spousal support is otherwise known as “ alimony ” is a payment made by one spouse to his former partner .
It is available to both persons in a marriage or in a common - law relationship .
However , unmarried persons can only seek an order for the payment of spousal support in certain circumstances .
The purpose of spousal support is multi-fold : it recognizes economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouse resulting from the marriage or its breakdown , it apportions between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of any child of the marriage over and above the obligation apportioned between the spouses , it relieves any economic hardship of the spouse arising from the breakdown of the marriage and promotes the economic self - sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time .
Unlike child support , there is no automatic right to spousal support .
Whether it is paid , and if so , how much support will be paid , depends upon the circumstances .
Usually , a party who is self - sufficient or is capable of becoming self - sufficient at the end of a relationship will not usually be entitled to receive spousal support .
In general , the court will take into consideration a variety of factors , including the following
Length of marriage : the longer the marriage , the greater the likelihood is that an application for spousal support will be successful .
Relative difference in income : the greater the difference in income between the parties is at the end of a marriage , the greater the likelihood that an order will follow , awarding spousal support .
Economic disadvantage :
The more one spouse has lost as result of the marriage , such as job skills , job opportunities or employability , the greater the likelihood of an order for spousal support .
Likewise , the more one party ’s earning capacity is reduced because of family obligations ( ie. the obligation to rear the children while the spouse works outside the home ) , the greater the likelihood of an order for spousal support .
After the applicant proves that they are entitled to receive support , the next question is , how much should she get ?
As a general rule , sum of spousal support is calculated with a view to the disposable income of the paying party and the actual needs of the recipient .
Just because a party receives an order for spousal support of , say $ 2000 per month , does not mean that the party will continue to receive this sum during her lifetime .
Various factors to determine the length of time for which support payments should be made .
For persons in long - term relationships , spousal support might be paid permanently .
For example , imagine a scenario in which an age 60 female housekeeper raised a family of 5 while her husband worked as a dentist - she may have little ability to start earning income , and in particular , to support herself as her pre-divorce level .
She may be entitled to spousal support for the remainder of her life .
In contrast , for people in shorter relationships , particularly where the recipient is either working outside the home or capable of working outside the home , support may only be payable for a short , fixed length of time .
There are various ways that an order or agreement for spousal support can deal with the issue of time , including lump sum payments , division of assets , review dates and escalated payments .
You can discuss each of these options with your counsel .
Spousal support can be changed .
The receiving party may want to change an order or agreement for spousal support if their spousal support payments are going to end but their financial situation has not improved , their financial situation has worsened and they need more support than they did before or something unexpected has happened , like an illness or an accident that causes them to need support .
Conversely , the paying party may want to change the sum of spousal support in an order or agreement if their financial situation unexpectedly worsens , the recipient finds work or gets better - paying work / the recipient ’s financial situation unexpectedly improves .
( CNN ) --
The 5 - year - old girl found the note tucked inside a plastic bag and left in a basket used as a flower pot .
April Tinsley , 8 , abducted in Fort Wayne , Indiana , was raped and killed 21 years ago .
The case was not solved .
" Hi Honey I Been watching you , " it said .
" I am the same person that kidnapped an Rape an kill Aproil tinsely here is a present foR yo you are my next vitem . "
A used condom was stuffed in the bag alongside the note .
It was March 2004 -- nearly 16 years after 8 - year - old April Tinsley was abducted from a Fort Wayne , Indiana , neighborhood , raped and killed .
Her killer remains at large , and police believe he has surfaced several times , scrawling a message in crayon on a barn in 1990 , then leaving four chilling notes for children in the Fort Wayne area years later .
Indiana authorities are now asking an FBI task force -- the Child Abduction Response Deployment ( CARD ) team -- to help take a fresh look at the case .
" Investigators believe the case is ' highly solvable , ' and after 21 years , their desire to bring April Tinsley 's killer to justice is stronger than ever , " the FBI said .
CARD teams were created three years ago , aimed at bringing together " a variety of experts in child abduction cases who could quickly respond on the ground to help local authorities with time - sensitive investigations , " the FBI said .
While CARD responds to abductions and disappearances , the team also works cold cases , like April 's , the agency said .
" As team members discovered , there is enough evidence -- including notes , pictures , and DNA left by the killer years after the murder -- to make investigators hopeful they can break the case . "
The team includes behavioral profilers , agents and analysts from the FBI 's Crimes Against Children Unit and coordinators and representatives from the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime and the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program .
April Marie Tinsley was playing outside with friends on Good Friday , April 1 , 1988 .
As the three girls were moving from one friend 's home to another 's , the first - grader realized she had left her umbrella behind and went back to get it .
She never returned .
Her body was found three days later , in a ditch some 20 miles northeast of the Tinsley home .
April 's body was clothed , but an autopsy showed she had been raped and suffocated .
Two years later , a teenage boy called police to report a message scrawled in crayon and black marker on the front doors of a barn about 10 miles from April 's home .
He never saw the writer , according to the TV program " America 's Most Wanted , " which profiled the case in May , but each day noticed the print was getting darker and more pronounced .
Although the message was hard to read , the person wrote he had killed April , and that he would kill again .
Crayons were left behind at the scene , " America 's Most Wanted " said on its Web site .
Police attempted to conduct forensic analysis on them , but came up empty .
Then , in spring 2004 , the four notes appeared at various Fort Wayne homes , several of them placed on bicycles that young girls had left in their yards .
All the notes were written on lined yellow paper and placed inside plastic bags along with used condoms or Polaroids of the killer 's body , the FBI said .
Several notes referred to April .
Authorities have reason to believe the writer of the 1990 note also left the notes 14 years later , Fort Wayne police said .
" That tells us that the person 's still around , still out there , " said Fort Wayne police Capt .
Paul Shrawder .
" It 's definitely very odd , " he added .
" Even the FBI is puzzled by the behavior , that the letters would come out so many years later and then nothing again . "
DNA evidence was recovered from April 's body and from the condoms , Shrawder said .
While police have no one to match it with at this point , " things have been resubmitted and retested " as technological advances have been made , he said .
The advantage of the CARD team , from a local police standpoint , is that members only work such cases , while " we 're local -- we work on whatever happens here , " Shrawder said .
The team has experience in such matters , and might look at new aspects , angles and possibilities that local authorities have n't thought of , he said .
Federal investigators were deployed to Fort Wayne to work the Tinsley case earlier this month .
After the " America 's Most Wanted " profile and the renewed push , authorities received between 400 and 500 tips , Shrawder said .
Some could be ruled out right away -- someone who had died between the murder and the 2004 notes , for instance , he said .
DNA samples were taken on about 150 people .
Police are still trying to run down about 50 or 75 tips , he said .
" That was the purpose , was to go out and run down every single one of these , no matter how vague it was . "
Some of the authorities ' leads , according to the FBI , include identifying Fort Wayne residents who used Polaroids as late as 2004 ; tracking down a green paisley bedspread similar to that seen in one Polaroid ; and looking at misdemeanor offenses in the area near the time of April 's death and the 2004 note spree , as offenses like indecent exposure could indicate more serious sex crimes .
In addition , the FBI has released a behavioral profile of Tinsley 's killer .
Police believe he is a white male currently in his 40s or 50s who prefers and desires sexual contact with children , particularly little girls .
" This offender has demonstrated that he has strong ties to northeast Fort Wayne and Allen County , " the profile said .
" This is where he likely lives , works and / or shops .
You may be standing next to him in line at the grocery store , sitting beside him in the pew at church , or working beside him on the production line . "
Such profiles can be helpful in that they might spur local residents to tell police , " You know , I always wondered about this one guy , " Shrawder said .
To offer information on the Tinsley case , contact your local FBI office or Fort Wayne police at ( 866 ) 602-7745 .

One of the biggest reasons that some companies still avoid social media is because they think it ’s too hard to measure the return on investment .
Facebook is set to announce a plan to tackle this issue head - on , through a partnership with Nielsen .
According to The Wall Street Journal , the companies will be unveiling a product called Brand Lift on Tuesday .
Brand Lift will “ measure the impact of … ads on Facebook through polls that Facebook will show its users who have seen the ads .
Facebook will then compare the users ' responses to those of other people who did n't see the ads and package the data for advertisers . ”
That sounds like a solid way to tangibly measure whether or not ads on the site perform , which could represent a big step forward in Facebook ’s ability to attract advertisers and get them to spend more on advertising to the social network ’s 300 million users .
On caveat , however , is that you will have to be a Nielsen customer in order to use Brand Lift .
While we have n’t yet seen a demo of the platform , expect more details to be revealed tomorrow .

Singapore Grand Prix organisers have carried out modifications to the circuit for this weekend 's second race in the country .
The Marina Bay circuit , which hosted F1's first night race last year , has been tweaked in several places in order to improve the racing conditions this season .
Among the most significant changes , there 's a modification to the pit exit , which has been realigned to join the track after the first corner .
The pit entry has also been realigned to leave the track before turn 22 .
Organisers said the circuit has been resurfaced between turns 5 and 7 in order to reduce the bumps many drivers complained about last year .
The rest of the changes are :
• The outer pit lane has been resurfaced .
• New kerbs have been installed on the entry to turns 1 and 5 .
• The apexes of turns 13 and 14 have been tightened slightly .
• The second and third apexes of turn 10 have been moved left and right respectively to make the chicane slower .
• The kerbs on the three apexes of turn 10 have been redesigned in order to reduce the risk of a car being damaged if it crosses them .
• The kerbs on the exit of turn 14 have been moved 10 metres downstream .
• All rubber exit kerbs have additional fixations .
• An extra driver egress point has been added on the left between turns 17 and 18 .
• The wall around the outside of turns 22 and 23 has been moved closer to the track .
Reefer madness ?
Apparently not , according to a new Swiss survey of students that concludes teenagers who smoke pot function better than those who also use tobacco .
In addition , researchers at the University of Lausanne report in theteens who only use marijuana are apparently more socially driven and have no more psychosocial problems than those who neither smoke nor toke .
The scientists surveyed 5,263 Swiss students ( 2,439 females ) aged 16 to 20 years , including 455 who said they smoked weed only ; 1,703 who reported being tobacco and marijuana users ; and 3,105 who said they did not imbibe at all .
" The gateway theory hypothesizes that the use of legal drugs ( tobacco and alcohol ) is the previous step to cannabis consumption , " the authors wrote .
" However , recent research also indicates that cannabis use may precede or be simultaneous to tobacco use and that , in fact , its use may reinforce cigarette smoking or lead to nicotine addiction independently of smoking status . "
Among their findings : Compared with students who reported using both drugs , those who smoked pot only were more likely to be male ( 71.6 percent versus 59.7 percent ) ; get good grades ( 77.5 to 66.6 percent ) ; play sports ( 85.5 to 66.7 percent ) ; and live with both parents ( 78.2 to 68.3 percent ) .
Cannabis - only smokers were also less likely than their cigarette - and - joint smoking brethren to have used other illegal drugs or to have been soused or have used pot more than twice in the previous 30 days , according to the study .
In contrast to those who shunned both substances , the pot -only crowd was more likely to be male ( 71.6 to 47.7 percent ) ; have a good relationship with friends ( 87 versus 83.2 percent ) ; and play sports ( 85.5 versus 76.6 percent ) .
They were less likely than the abstainers , however , to get along well with their parents ( 74.1 percent compared with 82.4 ) .
The researchers stressed that whereas students who smoked and toked seemed more prone to psychosocial problems , the marijuana - only users should not be dismissed .
" Even though they do not seem to have great personal , family or academic problems , " they wrote , " the situation of those adolescents who use cannabis but who declare not using tobacco should not be trivialized . "
Groups working toward the decriminalization of marijuana especially for medical purposes praised the findings .
" Studies like this show associations , not cause and effect , " says Bruce Mirken of the Washington , D.C. –based Marijuana Policy Project , a lobby that believes marijuana should be legalized but also regulated and taxed much like cigarettes and alcohol .
" But the drug czar 's office regularly uses associations between marijuana use and problems like poor grades to frighten parents into thinking that cause and effect is proven .
So will [ it ] now say that smoking marijuana makes teens have better peer relationships and be more likely to participate in sports ? "
" No one wants to encourage teens to smoke marijuana , " he adds , " but this study strongly suggests that the most serious problems for teens and parents is n't occasional marijuana use , but heavy use of multiple substances , which is likely a sign of kids who are seriously troubled and need help .

When no other European country dared to withstand the wrath of Nazi Germany , it was the Muslims of Albania who saved a large number of Jewish people from extermination .
Albania , a Muslim majority country in Europe , opened its borders during World War II and took in thousands of Jews fleeing from different countries .
They were treated like honored guests , and many were given fake names and even passports .
This little - known chapter of history is the focus of the photographic exhibition Besa : Muslims Who Saved Jews During the Holocaust , which kicked off in July at the Holocaust Museum Houston and continues through February .
The exhibition displays photographs taken by Norman Gershman , a Jewish photographer based in Colorado , who traveled to Albania in 2003 to research the topic .
Gershman said it took him six years to complete the project .
He interviewed Albanians who had harbored Jewish people at that time and were still alive and the relatives of those who were not .
He took their photographs to accompany their individual stories in his book Besa : Muslims Who Saved Jews During World War II .
The photographs and stories displayed at the exhibition are taken from this book .
Everyone had a different story to tell , but one thing was common .
“ They were compelled to act the way they had by Besa , a code of honor deeply rooted in Albanian culture and incorporated in the faith of Albanian Muslims , ” Gershman said .
He said they were dismissive of the attention they were getting .
“ To them it was nothing unusual , ” he said .
“ They believed any Albanian would have done the same in a similar situation . ”
Yad Vashem , the Holocaust museum in Israel , is the sponsor of this traveling exhibition .
Taking action
Marci Dallas , director of Changing Exhibits at the Holocaust Museum Houston , said the exhibition gives the message that no one should stand by during human suffering .
Eileen Reed , a visitor to the exhibit , was surprised how different people could decipher teachings of their faith differently .
“ The Albanian Muslims derived inspiration from their religion to save Jews , ” she said .
“ They were so different from those who perpetrate violence in the name of the same religion . ”
Unknown history
These stories have remained unknown for decades , even to students of the Holocaust .
Rob Satloff , director of the Washington Institute of Near East Policy in Washington , D.C. , offers an explanation .
“ First , we — Jews , Israelis , Western historians — did n't look very hard , ” Satloff said .
“ And second , they — Arabs and Muslims , even those who rescued Jews — often did not want to be found .
The result is a tacit conspiracy of silence about this lost chapter from the Holocaust . ”
Satloff wrote the book Among the Righteous : Lost Stories from the Holocaust 's Long Reach into Arab Lands .
Ellen Kennedy , interim director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota , believes these stories remained untold because many surviving Jews and Albanians were reluctant to share them .
“ When survivors first began speaking about their experiences in the years immediately after the war , they were met with disbelief , ” Kennedy said .
“ The public simply could not imagine that such horrors occurred . ”
Gershman 's work is an attempt at building bridges between Muslims and people of Jewish faith .
“ Islam and Judaism are Abrahamic faiths , and we have lot of things in common , ” said Dr. Aziz Siddiqui , president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston .
“ We must strive to highlight these as Gershman has done and avoid everything that tends to divide us . ”

Mario Theissen has confirmed that the BMW Sauber team will be Ferrari powered if it can get a place in the 2010 field under its new ownership .
After BMW 's decision to withdraw from Formula 1 , the squad has been rescued by the Qadbak investment group , but its chances of racing next season depend on the FIA convincing the rest of the pitlane to allow the entry to expand to 14 teams , or another team dropping out .
BMW 's original place in the entry has gone to the new incarnation of the Lotus team .
The Sauber squad has been strongly linked to a return to the Ferrari engine deal it had prior to the BMW takeover , and in Singapore today current team boss Theissen confirmed that this had been finalised .
" It will run a Ferrari power - train , " he said .
Theissen said it was not too soon to decide whether he would remain in charge of the new - look team .
" My personal future is fully open , and I will keep it open until the end of the season , " he said .
" It would not be helpful to mix up my own situation with all the efforts to secure the future of the team .
And I am not concerned that there will be [ too little ] time later this year . "
But he believes the team has a bright future , and that it will definitely be in the field despite the current uncertainty .
" We are very confident to be on the grid next year , and the new investor apparently is quite strong , " Theissen said .
" He wants to continue with the team in a strong state , not just as an also - ran .
That is an excellent perspective for the team .
We could not really expect that .
" So there is strong morale .
The team is really positive .
We have a good upgrade for the car here , and we want to achieve something in the final four races . "
An abundant greenhouse gas could someday help clean up the earth .
Converting methane to liquid methanol could produce clean , low - cost fuel and prevent the potent greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere .
Exploiting methane in this way could also produce a hydrogen source for fuel cells and yield other industrial applications .
The key to taming methane , and synthesizing it in the laboratory , rests in identifying the starter link in methane 's armor chain of hydrocarbons .
A National Science Foundation grant is supporting a novel approach using laser light to convert methane into methanol .
Roger Dube , research professor at Rochester Institute of Technology 's Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science , won the $ 79,000 exploratory research award to apply optical catalytic conversion to the problem .
Dube will use finely tuned laser light , not heat , to reduce the barrier to reaction in methane and to create longer chain molecules or fuels .
The process works without the need for heat or a catalytic surface .
This is important because heat consumes some of the fuel stock and decreases overall conversion efficient .
Catalysts get dirty and have to be replaced or cleaned , both expensive and time - consuming propositions .
" Successful photo - catalysis of methane would theoretically produce clean fuels and remove methane gas that otherwise would simply be released into the atmosphere , " Dube says .
" If successful , the technology could have broad impact in other fields of chemistry . "
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , methane -- the odorless component of natural gas -- remains in the atmosphere for approximately nine to 15 years .
To make matters worse , methane beats carbon dioxide in efficiently trapping heat in the atmosphere .
Sources of the gas range from the expected -- such as cattle , coal mining and natural gas and petroleum production -- to the somewhat unexpected practice of rice cultivation .
Methane has ample natural and human - caused sources and is a byproduct of wetlands , wildfires , permafrost , landfills , agricultural applications , coal mining , stationary and mobile combustion , wastewater treatment and certain industrial processes .
" Unfortunately , almost half of the proven reserve of methane is ' stranded , ' " Dube says .
" Access to the natural gas is effectively blocked by terrain and the economies of converting natural gas to liquid for efficient transport .
A compact , high - gain process is needed that would convert methane gas to a room temperature liquid , such as diesel , and be sufficiently portable to enable access to stranded gas . "

According to one torture law expert I spoke with , Gitmo interrogations often involved a boom box being placed near a prisoner 's cell and turned up very loudly — somewhere between elevator Muzak and a Nine Inch Nails concert .
And , yes , Nine Inch Nails is listed as one of the musical acts used by interrogators , according to a 2008 report in Mother Jones .
So , reportedly , was the theme song from Barney , Sesame Street songs and lots and lots of rap music .
Neil Diamond 's patriotic " America " also reportedly has been used , along with the metal staple " Enter Sandman " by Metallica .
Once the song is chosen , often by the interrogator himself or whatever soldier is operating the boom box , the music might go on for hours , or according to Jordan Sekulow , the Director of International Operations for the American Center for Law & Justice , up to 72 hours nonstop .
Technically , the playing of the music is filed under a " futility technique " — wearing the prisoner down and convincing him that , to borrow a Star Trek term , resistance is futile .
In solitary confinement , Sekulow tells me , " time can stand still , and when a song is playing over and over , it can get to you . "
Particularly if that song is offensive to you and your particular culture .
" They put you in a room they play music that will throw you off balance , " says Jeff Addicott , director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary 's University in San Antonio .
" If you 're an Islamic fundamentalist , you do n't want to hear patriotic songs about America , that would make you upset . "
As would , presumably , a sexually charged song by a nubile Lolita like Britney or Christina , or an absurd children 's song .
If that does n't do it , being told by James Hetfield to " sleep with one eye open " can't possibly prove much of a comfort .
A remote Neolithic burial mound on an Orkney island may contain carvings of human eyes and eyebrows , it has been revealed .
The stone is inside the Holm of Papa Westray tomb .
Historic Scotland believes it is linked to the find of a carving believed to be Scotland 's earliest human face , dating back thousands of years .
That small Neolithic sandstone human figurine at Links of Noltland was believed to be up to 5,000 years old .
Richard Strachan , senior archaeologist with the Historic Scotland cultural resources team , said : " Initial comparisons do show a similarity in use of this eyebrow motif and may point to the possibility that the markings in the cairn are meant to show human eyebrows and eyes , as the style is very similar to the figurine .
The previous carving find was said to be of great importance
" Alternatively , we may be seeing the re-use of a motif familiar to the carver and applied to different contexts with different meaning .
" This is highly intriguing and raises yet more questions about Neolithic people 's attitudes to artistic representations of human beings . "
He added : " Images of people are very rare indeed , which some people believe suggests that it was considered taboo .
" But the discovery of the figurine shows there were some exceptions , and the lintel in the tomb may suggest that there were situations where particular features could be shown . "
The Holm of Papa Westray tomb 's remote location can only be reached by private boat hire .
Experts described the previous find of the figurine as one of " astonishing rarity " .
On Monday , a secret Hezbollah munitions bunker in South Lebanon blew up under mysterious circumstances , injuring a senior official in the organization .
This is the second such incident in recent months .
The first occurred on July 14 , when an explosion destroyed a major Hezbollah munitions dump in the South Lebanese village of Hirbet Salim .
Hezbollah immediately pointed fingers at the Mossad .
Whether or not Israel was to blame , the explosion caused Hezbollah considerable discomfort by proving that it was in flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 , which forbids stockpiling weapons south of the Litani ...

A fight outside a block of units in Sydney where convicted pedophile Dennis Ferguson is living has resulted in a man being taken to hospital with stab wounds to his abdomen .
Mr Ferguson , 61 , has been living in public housing in Ryde for the past two weeks and is under pressure to move after residents learnt of his past at the weekend .
He was jailed for 14 years in 1988 for kidnapping three children and sexually molesting them in a Brisbane motel .
He completed a 14 - year jail term for the offence and has since been chased out of several Queensland communities before relocation to NSW .
A suspected unlit petrol bomb was found outside Mr Ferguson 's home on Tuesday night , after NSW Housing Minister David Borger said the Government did not have the power to remove him from the area .
Who would have thought ... Do you know that simple yet boring Google search home page ?
Of course you do !
( If not , just " google " - it - up ~LOL ~ )
Well , apparently Google think it is more than what meets the eye and patented the design .
It has been five years since Google first submitted the patent design of its search result along with the home page on 2004 back then , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the patent of what Google calls it as : " Graphical user interface for a display screen of a communications terminal "
Wow !
Guess all of patents in the world always have long names for every little - short things ...
So beware all of you web designers , if you 're planning or already use Google 's famous search home page design .
Because like Ryan Tate from Valleywag said it : " In other words , ...
Google owns the idea of having a giant search box in the middle of the page , with two big buttons underneath and several small links nearby " ;-

On the cover of the daily " Incident Action Plan " for the Station fire is an unusual warning : " No energy drinks . "
Even though firefighters expend a tremendous amount of energy , officials said high levels of caffeine in many energy drinks can be dangerous .
" It 's been a concern , " said Nathan Judy of the U.S. Forest Service .
" When they drink those things , it dehydrates them . "
Judy said that during a previous fire some years back , a firefighter consumed four cans of Red Bull in one day and went into diabetic shock .
Since then , fire officials have warned crews to re-energize in other ways , he said .
" Drink water , drink water , drink water , " Judy said .
He also said that the meals served to firefighters each day are high in calories because firefighters are " going through calories like crazy on the line . "
Breakfast this morning at the Hansen Dam fire camp included scrambled eggs with cheese , sausage , hash browns and grits .
Judy said lunches are hearty , sometimes consisting of two sandwiches , and that dinners often include lots of pasta , chicken and other meat .
Instead of energy drinks , officials ask firefighters to think about replacing salt , sugar , water and calories as a way to gain a boost .
Posters bearing an outline of a slim , energy drink can with a big red strike through it are scattered around the camp .
Mark Whaling of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters do other things in preparation for work on wildfires as well .
They include keeping their socks dry and sanding , oiling and reshaping the wooden ends of their hand tools so they are comfortable for long stretches of labor .
[ Updated at 6:22 p.m. : Paul Yoffee , a spokesman for Red Bull , said there are no medical findings that connect someone drinking four cans of Red Bull and going into diabetic shock .
" There are no dangers or drawbacks associated with the consumption of Red Bull , and we are confident in the safety of our product ....
We absolutely agree that people need to hydrate themselves , as Red Bull is a functional drink and not a thirst - quencher .
Thus , individuals should make sure that they drink lots of water when engaging in physical activity and drinking Red Bull . " ]

In just a few weeks time The Pirate Bay as we know it will be no more .
There is no doubt that its demise will signal the end of an era , however , it will also mark the start of a new one .
Or to use the words of Pirate Bay insider Rasmus Fleischer , " It ’s time to sink the ship and move on ! "
Whether or not The Pirate Bay will end up being sold , the ship has served its purpose and is destined for Davy Jones ’s Locker .
Luckily for most BitTorrent fans there are plenty of alternatives .
However , in the current climate where media moguls send their lawyers after everything that could be used to infringe copyrights , a paradigm shift might be needed .
This is exactly what Piracy Bureau co-founder and Pirate Bay insider Rasmus Fleischer is hinting at .
“ The symbolic value of The Pirate Bay has enabled us to make a difference in many ways .
But there are also problems with it which are becoming ever more clear .
After all , P2P was never meant to have one single ship as its almighty symbol , ” he writes in a recent blog post .
“ It ’s time to sink the ship and move on , ” Rasmus adds , as he links to a presentation ( see below ) where he explains how it may live on in a more decentralized setup .
In short he argues that The Pirate Bay will dissolve , but in its place many “ new TPBs ” will return , just without the familiar domain name and pirate ship logo .
This is very similar to a concept Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde had in mind for the new Pirate Bay .
A decentralized setup through which the ‘ torrent site ’ controls only a tiny part of the ‘ sharing ’ process .
At the basis of this new scheme are two services that have launched in recent months , all run by people close to the original Pirate Bay crew .
On the one hand there is the new OpenBitTorrent tracker that does not have a searchable index of torrents , but is simply used as a standalone tracker handling communication between peers .
To decentralize even further , friends of The Pirate Bay have launched the new torrent hosting service Torrage .
This new service is open to other torrent sites and can be accessed through an API .
When Torrage and OpenBitTorrent are combined everyone can run a BitTorrent site of their own with minimal resources .
There is little doubt that The Pirate Bay as we know it will cease to exist , but with OpenBitTorrent and Torrage it is easy enough to build new ones – and there are already a few promising projects in the making .
You ’ll be surprised .
Earlier this year , quite by happenstance , I read a book written by Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter James B. Stewart .
" Heart of a Soldier " tells the story of two men who , well before it happened , foretold not only of the terrorist attack of 9/11 but also the 1993 bombing in the World Trade Center parking garage that preceded it .
One of the men , Rick Rescorla , was chief of security for Morgan Stanley with an office in the World Trade Center .
He died on 9/11 , but not before he shepherded all but six of Morgan Stanley 's 2,700 employees to safety because of a well - prepared and well - executed evacuation plan .
He 'd have made it out , too , had he not gone back in the building looking for those six .
The other man , Daniel J. Hill , is still alive .
With another Sept. 11 approaching I wanted to talk to The Man Who Predicted 9/11 .
Although the primary focus in Stewart 's book is on Rescorla — a bona fide hero for his actions on 9/11 — I found Hill to be an even more fascinating character .
It was Hill who converted to Islam as a young U.S. Army paratrooper stationed in Beirut in 1958 .
It was Hill who learned fluent Arabic .
It was Hill who joined the Mujahedeen Freedom Fighters in Afghanistan and fought the Soviet invasion there in the 1980s .
It was Hill who personally met Osama bin Laden .
It was Hill who used information from Islamic extremists to warn Rescorla that terrorists would use the underground parking garage for a car bomb attack on the World Trade Center .
It was Hill who asked the U.S. government to assist him in an assassination attempt on bin Laden in 1998 ( the request was rejected ) .
And it was Hill who warned the FBI just weeks before Sept. 11 , 2001 , that his Mideast contacts told him " something big " was about to happen in the United States , in New York , Washington , D.C. , or Philadelphia — maybe all three .
Through the Internet I managed to contact Hill at his home in Florida .
He 's 71 now .
I asked him if his reputation as a terrorism prognosticator without parallel has changed his life much .
" Oh , that blew over pretty fast , " he said .
" Most of the people even in my hometown do n't know any of that stuff . "
He did n't want to talk about the past .
He wanted to talk about the future .
The very near future .
The man who predicted 9/11 is worried that its sequel is imminent .
" Muslims that I talk to say things like , ' America thinks they 're safe now .
They 've forgotten about 9/11 .
But watch , Daniel .
Stay near your TV .
It 's going to be bigger than 9/11 , ' " he said .
Hill said the next terrorist attack will involve suitcase nuclear bombs that will be detonated in small , low - flying two - seater private airplanes manned by men hanging onto the belief that , like the 9/11 hijackers , they are about to die as martyrs and enter paradise .
He is not alone in suggesting such a scenario .
A 2007 book , " The Day of Islam , " spells out the details , as do any number of Internet sites about a plot called " American Hiroshima . "
The nukes , he said , will be detonated over New York , Washington , D.C. , Chicago , Miami , Houston , Las Vegas and Los Angeles .
I asked Hill , " Why now ? "
" Eight years from 1993 to 2001 , eight years from that 9/11 to this 9/11 , " he said .
" Symbolism .
They 're big on symbolism . "
" Ramadan started two weeks ago Saturday , " he said , referring to the Muslim holy month of fasting .
" It always hits around Ramadan . "
Eight years ago , Hill predicted the attack would come on Oct. 16 — almost in the middle of that year 's Ramadan ( the timing of Ramadan varies from year to year ) .
He was about a month off .
" I do n't know the second , hour or day .
I just know they have the means , will , motivation and desire to do it , " he said , noting that it 's believed that years ago the suitcase nukes , acquired from former USSR operatives , were smuggled into America across the Mexican border .
Hill said he has warned the FBI , the CIA and others in government .
For the past two years , he 's sent out proposals for a book on the subject .
All he 's gotten back are rejections .
" To most people , I am a deviant personality , " he said .
But there 's no arguing his credentials .
" I'm a Muslim , " he says .
" I 'm a special ops expert , I 'm a terrorist and I 've lived among Muslims .
I fought the Russians with the same guys we 're now fighting in Afghanistan .
I met Osama .
I volunteered to assassinate him .
I know ( the enemy ) so well because I 've worked , slept and prayed alongside them for years .
I 've become one of them .
I know their nature , I know their culture , I know how they think .
I can quote the Koran like a Southern Baptist minister can quote the New Testament .
I know these are people who do not tire , who do not quit .
There are odds this wo n't happen , but they are n't big odds . "
" I hope you 're wrong , " I told him .
" Yeah .
I hope so , too , " he said .

Mr Karroubi said if even one account were true , it would be a tragedy A defeated opposition candidate in Iran 's presidential election has called for an investigation into allegations some protesters were raped in prison .
In a letter to former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Mehdi Karroubi said senior officials had informed him of the " shameful behaviour " taking place .
Mr Karroubi wrote that both male and female detainees had been raped , with some suffering serious injuries .
He asked Mr Rafsanjani to consult the Supreme Leader about the allegations .
About 200 people arrested during the mass protests sparked by June 's disputed election , which saw President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected by a wide margin , are still being detained .
' Brutality '
In the letter addressed to Mr Rafsanjani in his capacity as head of the Assembly of Experts , Mr Karroubi demanded an investigation into allegations that several detainees had been sexually assaulted .
" Some of those arrested [ as a result ] of the unrest claim that detained girls have been sexually assaulted with ... brutality , " he wrote .
If Mousavi , Karroubi and [ former president Mohammad ] Khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in Iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them
Yadollah Javan
Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
" The young men in detention were also sexually assaulted in such a way that some are now suffering from depression and other physical and psychological problems , and are incapable of even leaving their homes , " he added .
Mr Karroubi said that the people who had told him about the allegations of sexual assault held " sensitive positions " .
" Even if one account is true , it would be a tragedy for the Islamic Republic and it would whitewash the sins of many dictatorships , including that of the deposed Shah , " he added .
On Thursday , police confirmed serious rights violations had taken place at the Kahrizak detention centre , where most of those arrested at the protests were sent .
The head of Kahrizak was sacked and jailed on Sunday along with three of his guards , who were found to have beaten detainees .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the closure of the centre in July , because it had failed to " preserve the rights of detainees " .
Police officials have admitted that some of those held since June might have been tortured .
Earlier on Sunday , a senior commander of Iran 's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said that Mr Karroubi , and the other main defeated opposition presidential candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , should be tried for inciting unrest after the election .
" If Mousavi , Karroubi and [ former president Mohammad ] Khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in Iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them , arrest them , put them on trial and punish them , " Yadollah Javan told the Irna news agency .
Foreign media , including the BBC , have been restricted in their coverage of Iran since the election protests turned into confrontations with the authorities in which at least 30 people died .

We 've known we would run out of IP v4 addresses since 1981 , when the Internet Protocol was standardized .
The numbers dictate that there will never be more than 4,294,967,296 different IP v4 addresses .
( 4 billion and change being the number of combinations that can be made with IPv4's 32 address bits ) .
Before 1993 , addresses were given out in very large blocks because of technical limitations in routing protocols .
This limitation was lifted , but around the same time , the Internet started to become more mainstream , requiring more and more addresses .
This was also the moment the IETF realized that at some point , we 'd run out of IP addresses .
Its estimated date for the well to run dry was 2005 .
Although they got the year wrong , they were right about their notion that 32 bits was n't enough for the decades to come .
The invention of network address translation ( NAT ) , which allows multiple systems to share a single address , has been credited for stretching the life of IP v4 , but two other technologies were also very important .
Variable length subnetting makes it possible to give different subnetworks the appropriate size address block , and ethernet switching made it possible to have much larger subnets , reducing wasteful subdivision of networks .
The well is running dry
Next year could very well be the last year that large Internet Service Providers can obtain IP addresses under the rules that have been in effect for more than a decade , however .
Let 's have a look at the current state of the IP v4 address space first , and then see what 's in store in the near future .
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) keeps track of the IP v4 address space in what are known as / 8 blocks ( hereafter referred to as / 8 ) .
This slash notation is simply a way to specify address ranges .
A /8 is all the addresses starting with a given 8 - bit value .
There are 28 ( 256 ) of those blocks , in five classes :
Class A : 0 - 127 Class B : 128 - 191 Class C : 192 - 223 Class D : 224 - 239 Class E : 240 - 255
Class D is used for multicast , where a single packet is sent to multiple receivers .
Class E has been " reserved " since the dawn of time , so overzealous system designers have sprinkled their code with checks that refuse these addresses .
It 's often only a handful lines of code , but there is no way to update all those systems before we need those addresses , so class E can never be deployed for general use .
Class A holds three / 8s that can't be used .
0.0.0.0 refers to the default route , and taints the entire 0/8 block .
10/8 is used for private addressing , and the localhost address 127.0.0.1 makes 127/8 unusable .
So that leaves 221 usable / 8s in class A , B and C space .
Their current status is 101 allocated , 92 legacy , and 28 unallocated .
Allocated means given out under ( some variation of ) the current rules by one of the five Regional Internet Registries ( RIRs ) .
Legacy are mainly the / 8s given directly to the US government ( about 10 of them ) and the likes of IBM , Apple , DEC , HP , and MIT , or class B networks ( / 16s ) given to universities and somewhat smaller organizations .
The unallocated blocks are the ones that are completely unused .
They represent the main source of free IP v4 addresses , forming the IANA global pool ( graphical representation ) .
However , in addition to the IANA global pool , each block delegated to a RIR has a little unused space as people give back address space , or larger amounts in the blocks that the RIRs are currently drawing new delegations to ISPs from .
( We 'll ignore the fact that some end users also get addresses directly from RIRs for simplicity . )
There is also unused space in the class B legacy blocks .
Which brings the total amount of unused IP v4 address space , in millions of addresses , to :
( For the accountants among us : 2919 + 788 = 3707 while 221 X 224 ? 106 = 3707.764736 . )
So how far will those 788 million addresses take us ?
Basically , the amount of address space given out per year was 10 / 8s in 2005 and 2006 and nearly 12 in 2007 and 2008 .
Assuming no big changes , that would give us almost four years before we 've used up those remaining 788 million addresses ( 47 /8s ) .
However , there is a deal between IANA and the RIRs that each of the RIRs gets one of the final five / 8s .
When the global pool reaches five / 8s , each RIR gets one , the pool will be empty , and that 's that .
The RIRs maintain nine months worth of address space .
When they dip below that , they request two new / 8s from IANA .
For ARIN and the RIPE NCC , that 's around two /8s , but for APNIC it 's more like four , as APNIC needs to satisfy the insatiable thirst for IP v4 addresses that China has developed in recent years .
LACNIC uses about half a / 8 in nine months , and AfriNIC only a couple million addresses .
So in two year 's time , the RIRs will get their final / 8s .
At that point , the situation for each of the five RIRs will be very different .
Because AfriNIC has such a slow burn rate , it will be able to continue business as usual for a good number of years , unless Africa suddenly starts using up a lot more address space .
The situation for LACNIC will be similar , but to a lesser degree .
The three other RIRs will have about 1 to 2 years worth of regular address space and used scraps in legacy space left .
But ... the question is whether the RIRs will have the courage to continue burning the address space they still hold when it 's clear that they wo n't be receiving any more .
ARIN will .
" Yes , ARIN will continue to provide address allocations to ISPs as long as it has address space available , " says ARIN president and CEO John Curran .
" ARIN will set aside a ' / 10 ' address block from that final block which will only have allocations made out of it for purposes of facilitating IP v6 deployment , but the remainder will be made available . "
I 'm not so sure .
The trouble is that the address allocation policies for each RIR are set by the " community " .
Having followed this process for the RIPE and ARIN regions for some time in the past , I think it 's very likely that new , more restrictive policies will be created as the amount of free IP v4 address space dwindles .
So we are more likely to find ourselves in a situation where there is ( some ) IP v4 address space left , but almost nobody will be able to get any of it because the bar is set so high .
In fact , some people argue that we 're already there , as large telcos forego using public address space for things like 3G service without even bothering to try to get sufficient address space for these services .
Considering the fact that only one percent of the 2,500 or so ARIN members get more than 80 percent of the address space that ARIN gives out , it makes sense for the other 99 percent to push through a policy change that effectively makes it impossible for the broadband ISPs and wireless carriers to get more addresses , allowing ARIN to continue operations at 20 percent capacity for years to come .
Of course , when the one percent fat cats see this coming , they may go for broke and put in a last , huge request .
The RIRs do check requests , but they have little recourse against consistent lying .
In the long run that wo n't work for ISPs , because invariably , they 'll need to come back for more address space .
At this point , the RIR checks whether the previous allocations are used in accordance with the policies .
If not , no new addresses .
Of course this mechanism does n't really work for a last request .
When we reach the point that the half - million or larger blocks that the big ISPs need are no longer available , or are too hard to get , it will still be possible to get the small blocks of address space necessary to host services , so services can probably stay on IP v4 indefinitely .
The ISPs , on the other hand , need a continuous supply of fresh addresses to connect new customers .
Some have suggested that making IP addresses a tradable commodity could solve this problem .
Apart from the question of whether entities such as the US government ( 150 million + addresses ) and HP ( 33 million addresses ) that have been sitting on huge amounts of addresses deserve a huge windfall , I do n't think this will work .
Someone who wants addresses for a 19 " rack full of servers in a data center will be happy to pay $ 1 , $ 10 , or even $ 100 per address .
The Comcasts , Deutsche Telekoms , and Softbanks of this world will never pay anything like that , even if they were prepared to buy dozens of small blocks rather than get whatever they need for ( pretty much ) free .
Also , if HP wanted to sell off 16/8 , the addresses that were once given to DEC , it would have to perform a huge audit to make sure there are n't any firewall rules or application filters that treat 16/8 as special before it could release these addresses .
So the price of the addresses would at least have to cover such an audit .
Either by choice or otherwise , the big ISPs will soon have to stop giving each customer an IP v4 address of his or her own .
Giving those customers just IP v6 is not an option , as the majority of the services are still IPv4 - only and many IP - capable devices that do n't run a full operating system ( smartphones , VoIP phones , webcams ) do n't support IPv6 .
So that means stretching the existing IP v4 addresses in some way through " carrier grade NAT " ( CGN ) .
But wo n't existing IP v4 users be sitting pretty ?
Maybe , maybe not .
Some ISPs may take away addresses from existing users to provide their CGNs with enough addresses .
Client - server applications such as the Web and e-mail will work just fine through CGNs and IP v6 - to - IP v4 translators , but peer - to - peer applications such as VoIP and BitTorrent , not so much .
Maybe the ISPs will care about that , maybe not .
Even those of us who still have unencumbered IP v4 addresses at that point will start feeling the pain , as more and more of the peers we want to talk to are sitting behind largely impenetrable CGNs .
So enjoy your peer - to - peer applications while you can ; their expiration date will be coming up not long after 2010 .

Las Vegas - area home prices are likely to fall further as local foreclosure activity shows no sign of slowing down , two reports said this week .
The Wall Street Journal today reported on its quarterly survey of housing - market data in Las Vegas and 27 other major areas .
The report found sharp declines in the number of homes listed for sale around the nation as government programs tried to help delinquent mortgage borrowers keep their homes .
" That campaign has gummed up the foreclosure process , slowing the flow of houses into bank ownership -- but only temporarily , " the Journal reported .
Despite the limited inventory , " the potential supply of homes is far larger because banks are likely to acquire significant numbers of foreclosed homes in some areas , notably Las Vegas , Atlanta , Detroit , Phoenix , Miami and other parts of Florida , and Sacramento , Calif. , over the next few years , " the Journal reported .
Quoting numbers from LPS Applied Analytics in Denver , the Journal said 22.6 percent of first - lien home mortgages are 30 days overdue or in foreclosure in the Las Vegas area .
Among the metro areas covered , only Miami -Fort Lauderdale and Orlando were higher with 26.6 percent and 23.3 percent , respectively , of such loans overdue .
The national average is 12.4 percent , up from 5.2 percent at the end of 2006 , the Journal said .
And the Journal reported that Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com , predicts prices in Las Vegas and other hard - hit metro areas will continue to fall .
Moody's Economy.com forecasts Las Vegas prices in the second quarter of 2010 will be down about 24 percent from the second quarter of 2009 .
Also this week , data analysis firm Fiserv of Brookfield , Wis. , projected Las Vegas - area home prices would fall another 23.9 percent from June 's level to June 2010 -- and after that continue falling another 4.3 percent through June 2011 .
Fiserv , too , noted the large number of foreclosures expected to enter the market .
The national median home price is predicted to drop 11.3 percent by the end of June , but then rise 3.6 percent through June 2011 Fiserv said .
The projected declines in Las Vegas would be on top of a 38 percent decline in the median price of Las Vegas homes , to $ 140,000 , from June 2008 to June 2009 .
That was reported by the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors .
The Las Vegas median price for new homes and resales peaked at about $ 313,000 in October 2006 .
The Las Vegas mortgage delinquency numbers reported today by the Wall Street Journal are consistent with an Oct. 15 report from RealtyTrac , which found Nevada continued to lead the nation in foreclosure filings in both the third quarter and in September .
With unemployment running at 13.3 percent in Nevada in September , 18,766 foreclosure filings were reported in the state that month .
These include default notices , scheduled auctions and bank repossessions .
The number of Nevada filings increased 4.8 percent from August and was up 44 percent from September 2008 , Realty Trac said .
The reports this week follow release of the September existing - home sales statistics from the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors .
The Las Vegas Realtors reported :
-- The median price of single - family homes sold in the Las Vegas area in September was $ 138,000 , up 1.8 percent from $ 135,500 in August ; but down 29.2 percent from $ 195,000 one year ago .
-- For condos and townhomes , the median price decreased 0.9 percent from $ 66,288 in August to $ 65,720 in September .
That ’s down 45 percent from $ 119,450 one year ago .
Where do those without health insurance live ?
The Census Bureau sought to find that out , for the first time , in a survey taken last year and released in September .
Over all , it found that 9.9 percent of children lack any health insurance , half the rate for adults under 65 .
But there was widespread variation in coverage .
Children in Texas , the state with the least health insurance , are more than eight times as likely not to have it than children in Massachusetts , the state with the broadest coverage .
Those who lack health insurance now are far more likely to live in states that usually vote Republican  the states whose senators and representatives are least likely to support a law to extend coverage .
That would seem to indicate that Republican constituents are the ones who would most benefit from passage of universal health insurance coverage .
But an analysis of Congressional districts within those states indicates that those without health insurance are much more likely to live in strongly Democratic Congressional districts .
Many of those contain large minority populations with relatively low incomes .

Mount & Blade – What We Think :
Mount & Blade released by Paradox Interactive from developer Taleworlds – both established and reliable names in the independent game world – has become my favorite new indie game .
I began playing this game to spend my leisure time but it has since evolved into a hobby .
The game has great graphics , an oddly engaging musical score and compelling features , all of which can be easily adjusted by the user .
There are a lot of customization options , in the vein of Oblivion or The Sims wherein the user can adjust the length and breadth of a character ’s forehead , the size of its jaw , height , complexion and color of dress and so on .
Mount & Blade features a user - friendly design and provides complete entertainment to the user by taking him into its dynamic and imaginative world .
NPC ’s have a rather detailed AI set , and battles between factions and groups may rage on regardless of whether you are present – all of which enriches the sense of immersion in the world of Caladria .
Moreover , the various quests and journeys are fairly well - paced ( when you can actually figure out what to do in this sandbox ) the world is quite massive , veering dangerously close to the same problem that plagues the ill - fated XBOX 360 Steampunk release “ Damnation ” , but at least the game - play reins this title back towards the fun side whereas Damnation just straight failed at making things fun in spite of its exhaustive scope .
Combat is one of the highlights of the game ; there are no “ health potions ” and a few well landed blows will take you down .
What may set Mount & Blade apart most , however , is it mounted combat , using a rather deep physics engine to tackle the idiosyncrasies of mounted combat .
These are not auto - pilot type skirmishes – the player is pushed to really dig in to the tactical maneuvers available to pull of these bold encounters .
Little bugs do creep in here and there , but for the innovative streak introduced with this title , they can ultimately be forgiven .
Mount &
Blade is a bold new indie title , recommended for anyone looking for a solid new role - playing adventure with a refreshing new take at the combat action level .
Mount & Blade is available via Steam .

Time is the New Memory
A Conversation with Rich Hickey
by Bill Venners
September 21 , 2009
Advertisement
In his keynote at the JVM Languages Summit last week , Rich Hickey , the creator of the Clojure programming language , suggested that the problems people associate with shared state are problems of time .
He compared the lack of time management facilities in mainstream object - oriented languages today to the lack of memory management in C ++.
In this interview , Rich Hickey explains what he means by " problems of time , " and why he believes that future languages should support constructs for time management directly .
Bill Venners :
What do you mean when you say the problem of mutable state is a time problem ?
Rich Hickey :
If somebody hands you something mutable — let 's say it has methods to get this , get that , and get the other attribute — can you walk through those and know you 've seen a consistent object ?
The answer is you can't , and that 's a problem of time .
Because if there were no other actors in the world , and if time was n't passing between when you looked at the first , second , and third attribute , you would have no problems .
But because nothing is captured of the aggregate value at a point in time , you have to spend time to look at the pieces .
And while that time is elapsing , someone else could be changing it .
So you wo n't necessarily see something consistent .
For example , take a mutable Date class that has year , month , and day .
To me , changing a date is like trying to change 42 into 43 .
That 's not something we should be doing , but we think we can , because the architecture of classes is such that we could make a Date object that has mutable year , month , and day .
Say it was March 31 , 2009 , and somebody wanted to make it February 12 , 2009 .
If they changed the month first there would be , at some point in time , February 31 , 2009 , which is not a valid date .
That 's not actually a problem of shared state as much as it is a problem of time .
The problem is we 've taken a date , which should be just as immutable as 42 is , and we 've turned it into something with multiple independent pieces .
And then we do n't have a model for the differences in time of the person who wants to read that state and the person who wants to change it .
Bill Venners :
In what way is that a time problem ?
Rich Hickey :
If there was a way to glance at a date , at one point in time , there would be no problem .
So that 's the problem .
You can't look at a date all at once .
You only can look at it over time .
That 's a time problem .
Similarly imagine you could change it all at once .
Then you would n't have the problem of changing it from March to February , somehow in - between having some observable bad thing .
That is also a time problem , because your perception was n't atomic and your changing was n't atomic .
The time problem is not easy to see in today 's mainstream languages because there are no constructs that make time explicit .
It is implicit in the system .
We do n't even know that 's what we 're doing when we use locks to try to make this work .
Because what we 're trying to do is partition time up to say , I 'm going to get a portion of time when I get to look at it , and you 're going to get a separate portion of time when you 'll get to write it .
That time management we have to do manually .
We have to use locks and come up with some kind of convention , because it 's not automatic .
So that 's why I 'm saying , the problem here is a lack of automatic time management .
We have to do that manually , just like we had to call delete before we had garbage collection .
Somebody allocated something , and we had to call delete .
It was our problem .
It was manual .
Now when we want to change a date or look at a date coherently , we have this time management problem that we use locks to try to solve .
Bill Venners :
When you said " consistent , " you meant you do n't want to see February 31 .
Rich Hickey : Right , that 's inconsistent .
No one ever intended that to exist .
It 's a side effect of our language that it can happen .
Bill Venners :
In your keynote , you said we need to make decisions based on " stable values . "
What did you mean by that ?
Rich Hickey : Let 's say I 'm trying to send out a notice a certain amount of time after a particular date .
So I need to calculate something with that date .
As I 'm starting to do this calculation , if the date is mutable , it could change into something that does n't work .
Bill Venners : Because the calculation takes time .
Rich Hickey :
And the calculation uses the state .
It will have to look at the pieces of it .
It needs to perform addition with dates .
It needs to look at the pieces and could see February 31 somewhere in the middle .
Because it is not actually working with a value .
If it were working with a value , if that date could not be changed , there would be no problem .
We can't see that date without stopping time .
Bill Venners :
What would built - in time management look like in a language ?
Rich Hickey :
For something as simple as a date , it just means get rid of the setDay , setMonth , and set Year methods .
Treat dates as values .
Have all the pieces be final .
And all functions of dates produce new dates .
They do n't change dates .
And I 'm saying that 's the right way to approach all of your objects .
They should n't change .
They should only have functions that produce new objects .
That should be true for 42 .
When you add 7 to 42 , 42 does n't change .
You get this different number over here , which is 49 .
Same thing with a date .
If I want to say , three months from this date , I should n't be changing its fields .
I should be making another date .
And those fields should be final , immutable .
And if it is something bigger , like a collection , a persistent collection tree is the way to do that even for something big .
You can take a two million item collection and add something to the end without copying the whole tree .
And you still have the property where the old collection can't be changed .
The new one is really a new collection .
And that will make your programming life much better .
Bill Venners :
You said in your talk that we'd be able to sleep better at night .
Rich Hickey : Yes , how do you sleep at night if you build your system on things that can be changing ?
How do you know you got it right ?
If you inserted locks in your program to try and coordinate time , how do you know you did it right ?
It is the same thing that kept you up at night when you had to manage memory manually .
Do I have a memory leak ?
If I do , where is it ?
Where am I allocating that I should be freeing ?
Maybe in this call path I always free it , but when I go to this other call path , I fail to do that .
Because it is a complex thing to do , it 's easy to get wrong , which means it should be something that worries you .
We are suffering the problems of the lack of time management in our languages , but do n't connect this as the cause .
But we will over time .
I think concurrency will make it more evident to people .
Bill Venners :
Is the pain felt only when you have concurrency ?
Rich Hickey : No , I do n't think so .
We talked about the date changing while you were looking at it .
That 's indeed a concurrency problem .
But there 's a second problem that exists without concurrency :
You gave me a date , and when I looked at it , it said March 31 .
And I said , OK I 'm going to need this date later .
I want to remember it .
Now it 's not a concurrency problem .
I 've just aliased the date you gave me .
I return from that method , but the date is stored somewhere .
Another part of the program continues and changes that date , and eventually calls some code that looks at the date that was saved .
And now it 's different .
So that 's the non-concurrent case .
That still makes programs very hard to understand .
Can I understand a large system if I call a method here and it can change things ?
How can I know the effect it will have ?
How can I know all the people who remembered that ?
How can I know that all the people who based a decision on that are not going to be thrown by this mutation that 's occurred ?
I do n't know .
Somebody could have looked at a list of logged in users and seen that someone was there , and remembered that .
They still have the collection .
Then you change that .
They are counting on something that 's no longer true , but they have the same data structure .
They have to keep questioning , do I need to look at this again ?
A large system that 's a graph of mutable objects is just very hard to understand .
A lot of times you wo n't see that in a small program that an individual writes .
But in a larger program written by multiple people , you can be looking at a problem in the program .
You look at an object and its internal state seems strange or wrong .
How did that happen ?
Those are the real problems of large object - oriented systems .
That 's very hard to understand .
Also , if I change something over here , what will be impacted ?
Because the program is a graph .
A big program becomes a network .
Bill Venners : Besides immutable values , what else would language support for time management entail ?
Rich Hickey :
It is a bunch of things that work together .
You want to program with values .
That can be anything from 42 to that date that you can't change , to a large collection that 's also immutable .
That 's all you 're going to be manipulating .
And then you have time constructs .
It can be as simple as a little box , and in this box will always be a value , and there are rules about how that can change , which will basically ensure that it will change from one thing to the next .
And the thing that it changes to is a function of the thing that it is .
There 's a collection there with 10 things in it , and you call a function on that and produce a collection with 11 things in it , and the time construct makes sure that two people are n't doing that at the same time .
Bill Venners :
What do you mean by time construct ?
Rich Hickey :
It will be something in the language .
This is what we 're missing in , say , Java or Scala : something in the language that does this .
Maybe Scala Actors are a form of a time construct , where there you get the serialization because you send messages to the actors .
You can also have a compare - and - swap ( CAS ) time construct where you say swap what 's in this time construct using this function and these arguments .
That will atomically call the function on what 's in there already , make a new version and replace that back .
And it will make sure if multiple people are trying to do that , only one will succeed at a time .
They will be ordered .
That 's a tiny one .
A bigger one is something like software transactional memory ( STM ) , where everything that has an identity will have an associated reference , and those references will also have some function to change what 's in there .
If you do that outside of a transaction it will throw an exception to indicate it can't do this now .
So it 's managing time .
CAS would be a way to do it for a single cell .
A transaction is a bigger thing that also has management .
The time constructs will coordinate the time parts of your program .
The rest of the program will be functions .
We 'll make new values by calling functions from values to values .
And the only thing that will look like it is changing is the contents of these time constructs , which will have rules .
The rules will enforce that changes happen atomically and sequentially .
But it is very important that what 's inside this time construct is n't the good old mutable date , because then it does n't work .
It has to be a succession of values .
Bill Venners :
So the time construct encapsulates the succession of values .
Rich Hickey :
It encapsulates the entire process .
It manages the succession of values by giving you two things .
First , it needs to make sure what is in it , and what 's going to be in it , are both immutable .
Second , it needs to give you a way to process what 's in there , so you can move it forward in time using a function .
The time management construct makes that happen sequentially and atomically .
Basically , it 's just one level of indirection .
For example , in Clojure there are things called references , and they are special .
There are different kinds .
There are ones that do CAS - like time , and some that do STM - like time .
For the Clojure programmer , those are the only things that can change .
Everything else can't change .
Unless they are using Java stuff .
Obviously I can't control that .
So Clojure programmers work with things that can't change by default , but can also work with things that have identity when they need to .
Maybe they have a collection that represents the logged in users .
They are going to refer to it over time and expect to see different values over time .
If they want to see values that differ over time , associated with that identity , they will have to put that inside one of these reference types .
Now they have a model .
Now they know .
If they look at it , they 'll always see a valid list .
They wo n't see a list that 's in the process of being manipulated and has dead leaves , things like that .
And they know that if multiple parts of the program need to maintain that list , that will be coordinated .
That 's now automatic .
Before , when we both wanted to see a good date , that was our problem .
Let 's say we still want to see dates change logically , like we want to model a due date .
That now has an identity .
It 's not the actual , physical date .
It 's an identity , a logical construct .
When is this due ?
Maybe somebody will decide it is due at a different point .
Bill Venners : Like renewing a library book .
Rich Hickey : Right , so we need to change that date .
Well , they 're not actually changing the date .
They are associating that identity , when it is due , with a different value .
And the system can help .
So that 's what 's automatic about it .
It 's automatic time management .

DEEPING ST .
JAMES , England , Oct. 15 ( UPI ) -- A 60 - year - old grandmother has been dubbed Britain 's loudest snorer for her 111.6 - decibel breathing at nighttime .
Experts said Jenny Chapman , 60 , of Deeping St. James , England , whose snoring was measured during a seminar last week at the Hilton Warwick Hotel in Warwick , England , eclipses the sound of a washing machine by 33 decibels and is 61 decibels louder than the average snorer , the Daily Mail reported Thursday .

" I was shocked to hear how loud my snoring was at its peak .
I knew I was noisy but not that noisy , " Chapman said .
" It was a bit embarrassing to be told in front of everyone but it was all good fun by then .
The experts said it was the loudest they had ever experienced . "
She said she can now sympathize with her husband , who is always complaining about her snoring .
Graham Carr - Smith of Helps Stop Snoring , which ran the seminar , said he is attempting to help Chapman with her snoring through a combination of diet , exercise and natural remedies .
This did not make the news !
Challenging America was the prime focus of extended meetings in Yekaterinburg , Russia ( formerly Sverdlovsk ) June 15 - 16 for Chinese President Hu Jintao , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and other top officials of the six -nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
The alliance is comprised of Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , Kyrghyzstan and Uzbekistan , with observer status for Iran , India , Pakistan and Mongolia .
It will be joined on Tuesday by Brazil for trade discussions among the BRIC nations ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) .
The attendees have assured American diplomats that dismantling the US financial and military empire is not their aim .
They simply want to discuss mutual aid – but in a way that has no role for the United States , NATO or the US dollar as a vehicle for trade .
US diplomats may well ask what this really means , if not a move to make US hegemony obsolete .
That is what a multipolar world means , after all .
For starters , in 2005 the SCO asked Washington to set a timeline to withdraw from its military bases in Central Asia .
Two years later the SCO countries formally aligned themselves with the former CIS republics belonging to the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) , established in 2002 as a counterweight to NATO .
Yet the meeting has elicited only a collective yawn from the US and even European press despite its agenda is to replace the global dollar standard with a new financial and military defense system .
A Council on Foreign Relations spokesman has said he hardly can imagine that Russia and China can overcome their geopolitical rivalry , suggesting that America can use the divide - and - conquer that Britain used so deftly for many centuries in fragmenting foreign opposition to its own empire .
But George W. Bush ( “ I ’m a uniter , not a divider ” ) built on the Clinton administration ’s legacy in driving Russia , China and their neighbors to find a common ground when it comes to finding an alternative to the dollar and hence to the US ability to run balance - of - payments deficits ad infinitum .
What may prove to be the last rites of American hegemony began already in April at the G - 20 conference , and became even more explicit at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 5 , when Mr. Medvedev called for China , Russia and India to “ build an increasingly multipolar world order . ”
What this means in plain English is :
We have reached our limit in subsidizing the United States ’ military encirclement of Eurasia while also allowing the US to appropriate our exports , companies , stocks and real estate in exchange for paper money of questionable worth .
“ The artificially maintained unipolar system , ” Mr. Medvedev spelled out , is based on “ one big centre of consumption , financed by a growing deficit , and thus growing debts , one formerly strong reserve currency , and one dominant system of assessing assets and risks . ”
At the root of the global financial crisis , he concluded , is that the United States makes too little and spends too much .
Especially upsetting is its military spending , such as the stepped - up US military aid to Georgia announced just last week , the NATO missile shield in Eastern Europe and the US buildup in the oil - rich Middle East and Central Asia .
The sticking point with all these countries is the US ability to print unlimited amounts of dollars .
Overspending by US consumers on imports in excess of exports , US buy - outs of foreign companies and real estate , and the dollars that the Pentagon spends abroad all end up in foreign central banks .
These agencies then face a hard choice : either to recycle these dollars back to the United States by purchasing US Treasury bills , or to let the “ free market ” force up their currency relative to the dollar – thereby pricing their exports out of world markets and hence creating domestic unemployment and business insolvency .
When China and other countries recycle their dollar inflows by buying US Treasury bills to “ invest ” in the United States , this buildup is not really voluntary .
It does not reflect faith in the U.S. economy enriching foreign central banks for their savings , or any calculated investment preference , but simply a lack of alternatives .
“ Free markets ” US - style hook countries into a system that forces them to accept dollars without limit .
Now they want out .
This means creating a new alternative .
Rather than making merely “ cosmetic changes as some countries and perhaps the international financial organisations themselves might want , ” Mr. Medvedev ended his St. Petersburg speech , “ what we need are financial institutions of a completely new type , where particular political issues and motives , and particular countries will not dominate . ”
When foreign military spending forced the US balance of payments into deficit and drove the United States off gold in 1971 , central banks were left without the traditional asset used to settle payments imbalances .
The alternative by default was to invest their subsequent payments inflows in US Treasury bonds , as if these still were “ as good as gold . ”
Central banks now hold $ 4 trillion of these bonds in their international reserves – land these loans have financed most of the US Government ’s domestic budget deficits for over three decades now !
Given the fact that about half of US Government discretionary spending is for military operations – including more than 750 foreign military bases and increasingly expensive operations in the oil - producing and transporting countries – the international financial system is organized in a way that finances the Pentagon , along with US buyouts of foreign assets expected to yield much more than the Treasury bonds that foreign central banks hold .
The main political issue confronting the world ’s central banks is therefore how to avoid adding yet more dollars to their reserves and thereby financing yet further US deficit spending – including military spending on their borders ?
For starters , the six SCO countries and BRIC countries intend to trade in their own currencies so as to get the benefit of mutual credit that the United States until now has monopolized for itself .
Toward this end , China has struck bilateral deals with Argentina and Brazil to denominate their trade in renminbi rather than the dollar , sterling or euros , and two weeks ago China reached an agreement with Malaysia to denominate trade between the two countries in renminbi .
Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad explained to me in January that as a Muslim country , Malaysia wants to avoid doing anything that would facilitate US military action against Islamic countries , including Palestine .
The nation has too many dollar assets as it is , his colleagues explained .
Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan of the People ’s Bank of China wrote an official statement on its website that the goal is now to create a reserve currency “ that is disconnected from individual nations . ”
This is the aim of the discussions in Yekaterinburg .
In addition to avoiding financing the US buyout of their own industry and the US military encirclement of the globe , China , Russia and other countries no doubt would like to get the same kind of free ride that America has been getting .
As matters stand , they see the United States as a lawless nation , financially as well as militarily .
How else to characterize a nation that holds out a set of laws for others – on war , debt repayment and treatment of prisoners – but ignores them itself ?
The United States is now the world ’s largest debtor yet has avoided the pain of “ structural adjustments ” imposed on other debtor economies .
US interest - rate and tax reductions in the face of exploding trade and budget deficits are seen as the height of hypocrisy in view of the austerity programs that Washington forces on other countries via the IMF and other Washington vehicles .
The United States tells debtor economies to sell off their public utilities and natural resources , raise their interest rates and increase taxes while gutting their social safety nets to squeeze out money to pay creditors .
And at home , Congress blocked China ’s CNOOK from buying Unocal on grounds of national security , much as it blocked Dubai from buying US ports and other sovereign wealth funds from buying into key infrastructure .
Foreigners are invited to emulate the Japanese purchase of white elephant trophies such as Rockefeller Center , on which investors quickly lost a billion dollars and ended up walking away .
In this respect the US has not really given China and other payments - surplus nations much alternative but to find a way to avoid further dollar buildups .
To date , China ’s attempts to diversify its dollar holdings beyond Treasury bonds have not proved very successful .
For starters , Hank Paulson of Goldman Sachs steered its central bank into higher - yielding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities , explaining that these were de facto public obligations .
They collapsed in 2008 , but at least the US Government took these two mortgage - lending agencies over , formally adding their $ 5.2 trillion in obligations onto the national debt .
In fact , it was largely foreign official investment that prompted the bailout .
Imposing a loss for foreign official agencies would have broken the Treasury - bill standard then and there , not only by utterly destroying US credibility but because there simply are too few Government bonds to absorb the dollars being flooded into the world economy by the soaring US balance - of - payments deficits .
Seeking more of an equity position to protect the value of their dollar holdings as the Federal Reserve ’s credit bubble drove interest rates down China ’s sovereign wealth funds sought to diversify in late 2007 .
China bought stakes in the well - connected Blackstone equity fund and Morgan Stanley on Wall Street , Barclays in Britain South Africa ’s Standard Bank ( once affiliated with Chase Manhattan back in the apartheid 1960s ) and in the soon - to - collapse Belgian financial conglomerate Fortis .
But the US financial sector was collapsing under the weight of its debt pyramiding , and prices for shares plunged for banks and investment firms across the globe .
Foreigners see the IMF , World Bank and World Trade Organization as Washington surrogates in a financial system backed by American military bases and aircraft carriers encircling the globe .
But this military domination is a vestige of an American empire no longer able to rule by economic strength .
US military power is muscle - bound , based more on atomic weaponry and long - distance air strikes than on ground operations , which have become too politically unpopular to mount on any large scale .
On the economic front there is no foreseeable way in which the United States can work off the $ 4 trillion it owes foreign governments , their central banks and the sovereign wealth funds set up to dispose of the global dollar glut .
America has become a deadbeat – and indeed , a militarily aggressive one as it seeks to hold onto the unique power it once earned by economic means .
The problem is how to constrain its behavior .
Yu Yongding , a former Chinese central bank advisor now with China ’s Academy of Sciences , suggested that US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner be advised that the United States should “ save ” first and foremost by cutting back its military budget .
“ U.S. tax revenue is not likely to increase in the short term because of low economic growth , inflexible expenditures and the cost of ‘ fighting two wars . ’ ”
At present it is foreign savings , not those of Americans that are financing the US budget deficit by buying most Treasury bonds .
The effect is taxation without representation for foreign voters as to how the US Government uses their forced savings .
It therefore is necessary for financial diplomats to broaden the scope of their policy - making beyond the private - sector marketplace .
Exchange rates are determined by many factors besides “ consumers wielding credit cards , ” the usual euphemism that the US media cite for America ’s balance - of - payments deficit .
Since the 13th century , war has been a dominating factor in the balance of payments of leading nations – and of their national debts .
Government bond financing consists mainly of war debts , as normal peacetime budgets tend to be balanced .
This links the war budget directly to the balance of payments and exchange rates .
Foreign nations see themselves stuck with unpayable IOUs – under conditions where , if they move to stop the US free lunch , the dollar will plunge and their dollar holdings will fall in value relative to their own domestic currencies and other currencies .
If China ’s currency rises by 10 % against the dollar , its central bank will show the equivalent of a $ 200 million loss on its $ 2 trillion of dollar holdings as denominated in yuan .
This explains why , when bond ratings agencies talk of the US Treasury securities losing their AAA rating , they do n’t mean that the government cannot simply print the paper dollars to “ make good ” on these bonds .
They mean that dollars will depreciate in international value .
And that is just what is now occurring .
When Mr. Geithner put on his serious face and told an audience at Peking University in early June that he believed in a “ strong dollar ” and China ’s US investments therefore were safe and sound , he was greeted with derisive laughter .

Anticipation of a rise in China ’s exchange rate provides an incentive for speculators to seek to borrow in dollars to buy renminbi and benefit from the appreciation .
For China , the problem is that this speculative inflow would become a self - fulfilling prophecy by forcing up its currency .
So the problem of international reserves is inherently linked to that of capital controls .
Why should China see its profitable companies sold for yet more freely - created US dollars , which the central bank must use to buy low - yielding US Treasury bills or lose yet further money on Wall Street ?
To avoid this quandary it is necessary to reverse the philosophy of open capital markets that the world has held ever since Bretton Woods in 1944 .
On the occasion of Mr. Geithner ’s visit to China , “ Zhou Xiaochuan , minister of the Peoples Bank of China , the country ’s central bank , said pointedly that this was the first time since the semiannual talks began in 2006 that China needed to learn from American mistakes as well as its successes ” when it came to deregulating capital markets and dismantling controls .
An era therefore is coming to an end .
In the face of continued US overspending , de-dollarization threatens to force countries to return to the kind of dual exchange rates common between World Wars I and II : one exchange rate for commodity trade , another for capital movements and investments , at least from dollar - area economies .
Even without capital controls , the nations meeting at Yekaterinburg are taking steps to avoid being the unwilling recipients of yet more dollars .
Seeing that US global hegemony cannot continue without spending power that they themselves supply , governments are attempting to hasten what Chalmers Johnson has called “ the sorrows of empire ” in his book by that name – the bankruptcy of the US financial - military world order .
If China , Russia and their non-aligned allies have their way , the United States will no longer live off the savings of others ( in the form of its own recycled dollars ) nor have the money for unlimited military expenditures and adventures .
US officials wanted to attend the Yekaterinburg meeting as observers .
They were told No .
It is a word that Americans will hear much more in the future .

MESSAGE : Free Andnan Hajizade and Emin Milli .
The video is actually pretty funny ( you can see it below ) – it ’s subtitled in that almost - intentional Soviet - speak English that makes it even more unintentionally funny .
Of course , being a good former - Soviet state , the Azeri government is still longing for the old days when citizens knew their place ( somewhere in a gulag , if they were lucky ) :
Two video bloggers from Azerbaijan are being held in prison by local authorities after uploading a satirical video to YouTube , according to a BBC News report .
Andnan Hajizade and Emin Milli are part of a youth movement known as “ OL ! ” that works towards a democratic civil society in Azerbaijan .
The duo produced and uploaded a video of a press conference with a guy in a donkey suit in late June .
The clip criticized Azerbaijan ’s government for new laws against NGOs while making fun of staged government press conferences .
The video makers were arrested in early July after allegedly taking part in a scuffle at a restaurant — a charge that has been widely criticized as being politically motivated and an attempt to legitimize censorship of the duo .
Hajizade and Milli were officially charged with hooliganism , which could land them in prison for up to five years .
Their trial is scheduled to begin this Friday .
The video in question shows a donkey at a press conference , where uncritical journalists ask him questions like what kind of animal he would like to be in his next life .
His answer is full of praise for his host country : “ In Azerbaijan possibilities for donkeys are enormous .
If you are donkey enough , you can succeed in possibly everything . ”

Timothy Geither reportedly launched a cussing tirade against fellow regulators in a heavy - handed effort to get everyone in line behind Obama 's plan to revamp the financial regulatory system .
WASHINGTON (
The Street
) -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lost his cool with fellow regulators who are n't marching to the administration 's beat on financial reforms .
Geithner reportedly launched an all - out cussing tirade Friday in a meeting with
Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke ,
SEC
Chairman Mary Schapiro and
FDIC
Chairman Sheila Bair .
The blowup is apparently Geithner 's way of getting everyone to fall in line with President Obama 's plan to revamp the U.S. financial regulatory system , according to a report in the
Wall Street Journal
, which naturally cited unnamed sources .
We can only assume that the " people familiar with the meeting " that aired this dirty laundry came from the side of the regulators who received the tongue lashing .
I imagine it was very amusing for Ben Bernanke to see his former subordinate ranting like a political big shot .
Sounds like Geithner put on quite a show .
No doubt his fellow regulators , who represent quasi independent authorities , feel duly cowed .
This administration wants action and lock - step conformity to the master plan .
There 's no room for dissent when the president is trying to show he 's got things under control .
It 's bad enough that big banks like
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report
,
JPMorgan
( JPM ) - Get Report
,
Morgan Stanley
( MS ) - Get Report
,
American Express
( AXP ) - Get Report
,
BB&T
( BBT ) - Get Report
,
Capital One
( COF ) - Get Report
and
Bank of New York Mellon
( BK ) - Get Report
are getting out from under the government 's thumb by repaying taxpayer bailout money .
Now the administration can only pull the strings at
Bank of America
( BAC ) - Get Report
,
Citigroup
( C ) - Get Report
and
AIG
( AIG ) - Get Report
, plus a bunch of smaller banks with no particular political clout .
If Geithner can't get the rest of the regulatory team to play by Obama 's rules , the chances of a big political win on the finance front will diminish .
Congress will hesitate if even a single agency chief has doubts , and then the moment may be lost .
I wonder if we 're witnessing a variation of the good cop , bad cop strategy , with Geithner obviously playing the heavy .
The next move may be for Obama to invite everyone to the White House for beers .

Autism 's False Prophets : Bad Science , Risky Medicine , and the Search for a Cure Paul A. Offit Columbia University Press , 2008 328 pp. , hardcover , $ 24.95 0231146361 | ISBN : 0-231-14636-1
Autism is a devastating developmental neuropsychiatric disorder whose symptoms emerge during the first three years of life .
Although recent genetic studies have provided major advances in our understanding of autism 's etiologies in up to 10 % of cases , the causes of most cases are not known .
This has spawned an industry around speculative causes and cures and years of misguided notions , including the early assertion that cold , ' refrigerator ' mothers were contributory .
Because children receive vaccinations during the period of symptom emergence , there is the potential for association between the time of vaccination and the appearance of autistic symptoms .
Thus , it was a very reasonable question for parents and researchers to ask whether there is a true association , or even a causal relationship , between vaccines and the disorder .
In fact , the same issue was raised more than a decade ago with regards to a rare syndrome known as infantile spasms .
After a few epidemiological studies , and a US Institute of Medicine report , the weight of the scientific evidence was clearly against any relationship between infantile spasms and vaccination , and the issue was appropriately dropped , permitting the field to move on .
With regard to autism , more than a dozen epidemiological studies in several countries have been conducted , each asking whether autism is associated with vaccines , and all have been negative .
This scientific evidence has put the issue of whether vaccines have led to an autism epidemic to rest in biomedical circles .
Yet , the controversy regarding the vaccine - autism link still persists in the public eye .
The question for many , including me as a medical scientist involved in autism research , is why ?
This is the question that Paul Offit addresses in his gripping book Autism 's False Prophets .
In it , Offit , himself a leading figure in infectious disease research and vaccines and the parent of an autistic child , paints an eloquent picture of the social context in which the vaccine - autism controversy developed and persists .
Despite the difficulties that his position as a “ parent for vaccines ” has caused him , including death threats , Offit 's narrative is not bitter or maudlin .
Rather , Autism 's False Prophets reads like a legal thriller .
It is rapidly paced , starting with the author 's own childhood and poignant descriptions of his motivations for his career choice and ending with the media and America 's celebrity obsession , which he portrays as having had a dominant role in clouding the truth .
Offit takes the reader from claim to claim , detailing the personalities and data supposedly behind each vaccine - autism association , starting with the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine and continuing with the diphtheria - pertussis - tetanus vaccine that contained thimerosal , a mercury derivative , as a preservative .
Through vignettes containing quotations from politicians and celebrities , and backed by opinions from crusading parents and physicians , Offit weaves a compelling narrative .
Herein lies the real human interest : how , in some cases , physicians and scientists on the fringes of their fields have managed to keep the controversy alive while at the same time providing potentially dangerous therapies , such as chelation , despite no evidence supporting the efficacy of these therapies .
But this book is not just about the politics and scandals associated with science and its intersection with public policy .
It also chronicles , in a compelling fashion , the advocacy groups , public relations efforts and legal efforts that have often partnered , certainly in some cases as innocents , with rogue scientists in this endeavor to link autism with vaccines .
As the title of the book suggests , in some cases , the belief in the causal role of vaccines is an issue of faith ; in others , the motives may be less lofty .
One might consider it ironic that this book does not particularly deal with the ' hard ' science itself — it does not go into depth describing the science that has been consistently negative regarding any real connection between vaccines and autism .
Offit does not describe any of the more than one dozen negative studies in detail .
Rather , he chronicles in a careful , detailed timeline the many factors keeping the vaccine - autism controversy alive , from the sordid scientific frauds that have been perpetrated in the attempt to keep this controversy alive to simple methodological misconceptions and the personalities and potential motivations of many of the key players .
This social context is less dry than science and is , of course , what makes the book such an entertaining read .
This is an important book from a brave and articulate champion of the truth , as best we can know it .
Autism 's False Prophets highlights the frightening manner in which the media 's lack of interest in the truth , coupled with the public 's distrust of science , has created a volatile mix of falsehoods and controversy .
In fact , many fascinating questions are raised , such as the role of politicians and celebrities in fanning the flames of controversy , and why , despite being highly educated public servants with the public good at heart , these politicians have a distrust of science and the biomedical profession .
Tragically , this false controversy has the potential to cause real harm , as Offit warns .
Lack of herd immunity caused by a reduction in childhood vaccination on the basis of fears of autism has already led to measles outbreaks , resulting in dozens of hospitalizations and deaths .
Furthermore , this controversy diverts attention from some of the real issues — is the rate of autism increasing , and , if so , what is causing this increase ?
Although vaccines can induce rare adverse reactions , they are not responsible for autism in the population in any sense , so it is up to researchers to identify what might be behind a potential increase , for the sake of our children and our communities .
Diverting attention from this and from identifying the genetic and other environmental contributors to autism wastes money and time , which , unfortunately , passes quickly .
Hopefully , so will this issue , allowing the field to move on .

Some of the people alleged to have been killed by lethal injection were in the Lakeside acute care patients ’ unit at Memorial , Mr. Foti said .
Test results on the bodies of the victims found morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , according to the affidavit .
Midazolam , commonly known by its brand name Versed , is sometimes used in patients in intensive care units to cause unconsciousness before and during surgery .
An exchange of dialogue quoted in the affidavit between Dr. Pou and an unidentified nurse executive said Dr. Pou told her : “ decisions had been made to administer lethal doses ” to patients remaining on the seventh floor of the unit who would not survive .
One patient reportedly said “ that burns ” when injected .
A statement from the Tenet Healthcare Corporation called the accusations that the three might have administered pain medication to hasten the deaths of certain patients “ disturbing . ”
“ If the allegations are proven true , the doctor and nurses named by the attorney general made these decisions without the knowledge , approval or acquiescence of the hospital or their key physician leaders , ” the Tenet statement said .
A lawyer for Dr. Pou , Rick Simmons , said that the authorities went to her house in Baton Rouge and arrested her in her scrubs .
She went through the booking process and was later released , he said .
Mr. Simmons said that the arrest warrants were issued on four counts for each of the women but that there were no formal charges yet .
