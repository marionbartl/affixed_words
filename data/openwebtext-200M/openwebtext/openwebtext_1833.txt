For Mac geeks of a certain persuasion , the first mention of a soon - to - be - revealed feature of Leopard during the WWDC keynote set off a mental chain - reaction .
That feature was Time Machine , and the name alone was enough to cause one particular phrase to hammer in the mind of many people , including me : " New file system in Leopard ! "
It was even a bingo square .
In fact , it was my personal favorite bingo square , and the one that I most looked forward to marking .
But let 's back up a bit .
Why should the mere name " Time Machine " scream " new file system " to anyone ?
And why the excitement about a new file system in the first place ?
What 's wrong with HFS + , Mac OS X's current file system ?
It 's got journaling .
It supports arbitrarily extensible metadata .
It can even be case - sensitive to satisfy the Unix geeks .
Does Mac OS
X really need a new file system ?
In a word , yes .
HFS was a state - of - the - art personal computer file system when it was first released ... twenty - one years ago .
HFS + is only eight years old , but it 's built on many of the design decisions of HFS .
Progress marches on .
Today , there are new capabilities that the best modern file systems have , but that HFS + , even with all of its recent additions , does not .
Here 's a short list .
Efficient storage and handling of very small files .
Logical volume management through a pooled storage model .
Improved data integrity using checksums on all data .
Snapshots .
It 's no surprise that many of those bullet points were pulled from the ZFS home page .
I 've written about ZFS before .
It 's the most " modern " ( in terms of release date , at the very least ) of the modern file systems .
ReiserFS is a bit older , but it covers some of the same territory .
Both file systems are notable for their willingness to reconsider past assumptions about file system design .
ZFS and ReiserFS are just two examples of modern file systems , and the list of features above is far from exhaustive .
I chose these features because each has a potential benefit to Mac OS X users and developers .
Efficient storage and handling of very small files .
As disk sizes have grown , very small files have become the enemy of file system efficiency .
It 's not so much that the minimum storage required for each small file has grown ( although it has in some cases , with large block sizes on file systems optimized for high - bandwidth i /o ) .
It 's mostly that large disks can hold so many more small files .
File systems designed in an era when the largest disks held tens of thousands of files tend to choke on modern workloads where a single directory could contain hundreds of thousands of files , and the entire disk could contain many millions .
This situation may seem pathological , limited to things like mail server spool directories .
But plain old ( non-server ) Mac OS X is quite the file maven .
Thanks to its
Unix heritage and its bundle system in which a directory full of small files appears as a single logical item in the GUI ( frameworks , applications , and even some rich document formats all use the bundle system ) , even the most minimal home user 's Mac OS X boot volume probably has over half a million files .
( To see how many files you have , open Disk Utility , select your hard drive in the left - hand pane , then look in the lower - right corner of the window . )
Most of my disks have over a million .
And do n't forget Spotlight , which requires an individual file on disk for each thing being indexed .
Applications have begun to alter their storage implementations to make Spotlight happy .
Apple 's Mail application , which used an mbox - like storage format in Panther , now stores each message in an individual file in Tiger .
Microsoft 's Entourage email application has kept its monolithic database file in Office 2004 , but now also creates an individual file for each mail message purely for the benefit of Spotlight 's indexer .
New applications become " Spotlight savvy " every day .
The trend is clear : more , smaller files are coming to a Mac OS X disk near you .
A modern file system must be able to store these small files efficiently .
Very small block sizes are ideal for storing small files , but costly for large files .
One solution is to use variable block sizes .
Another solution is to pack multiple small files into a single disk block .
Then there 's performance .
There 's some minimum overhead for each file operation .
File systems that take no special steps to deal with the proliferation of small files tend to get " nickel - and - dimed to death " as the per - file overhead begins to dwarf the actual work done to each file .
Most modern file systems try to coalesce many small operations into one larger task in order to minimize this effect .
The goal of all of these techniques is to reduce the cost multiplier associated with each file .
That is , to reduce the difference in storage size and runtime performance between writing 10,240 1KB files and one 10 MB file — while still maintaining good performance when dealing with 1GB files , of course .
Logical volume management through a pooled storage model .
I touched on this topic in an earlier post .
The ability to divorce physical disks from logical volumes is the obvious next step in storage abstraction .
Imagine if adding more free space to any existing volume was as easy as just slapping in another hard disk .
Imagine if adding redundancy or increasing performance by spreading i/o across many devices was just as easy .
Now imagine it all worked with cheap commodity hard drives , with no special hardware , and with no reformatting .
This is the " storage as an ( almost ) infinitely reconfigurable cloud " model that ZFS delivers .
Although it sounds like an esoteric , tech - drenched topic , it 's actually a perfect fit for Apple 's product philosophy .
It 's storage that Just Works .
Improved data integrity using checksums on all data .
Again , this sounds like a feature that 's far from the mainstream .
Who but banks and the military really need industrial - grade software verification of all data going to and from the disk ?
Is n't that overkill for a home user ?
I do n't think it is .
Hard drives are increasingly home to the most important and precious information in people 's lives : financial documents , photos and movies of family , even seemingly trivial things like long - forgotten passwords to secure web sites stored in the Mac OS X Keychain .
Losing any of this data can be an economic or emotional hardship .
There are many ways a loss can occur , of course .
The most common is probably accidental deletion , followed by hardware failure .
Checksums prevent neither of these .
What they do prevent is less common , but much more insidious : silent data corruption .
It 's painfully obvious when a file is missing entirely , or a whole disk no longer works .
But when a few bytes here or there get corrupted due to a transient error in a disk 's firmware or an undetected bad block on a disk platter or a cosmic ray hitting the RAM cache at the wrong time or any other kind of non-catastrophic event , a failure to detect these occurrences leads not only to the corruption of your data , but also to the eventual corruption of your backups as well .
Assuming you do n't have an unlimited budget for data storage and are therefore forced to recycle backup media , the corruption will eventually wipe out any trace of the original , valid files .
And the worst part is that you 'll have no idea that it 's happening .
End - to - end data verification does not prevent user error , and cannot help recover from catastrophic failure .
But the problem it does solve is perhaps the most difficult , and most rarely addressed problem in the storage world .
Snapshots .
A snapshot preserves the state of an entire file system at a given point in time .
This may sound a lot like a backup , but there are some important differences .
First , a snapshot is entirely self - consistent , exactly preserving the state of each file at a particular instant in time across an entire file system .
A traditional backup running on an active file system makes no such guarantees without invasive locking schemes or even more onerous requirements .
Second , snapshots are considerably more space - efficient than backups .
By recording only the individual disk blocks that have changed , a snapshot takes a fraction of the disk space required by a traditional backup .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , while a full backup takes an amount of time that 's proportional to the size of the file system , a snapshot can happen in constant time , regardless of file system size .
This is why you 'll often see snapshots referred to as " instantaneous . "
The time required is usually so small that a snapshot appears to take no time at all .
And remember , this time does not increase as disks get bigger .
Time Machine
Now , back to Time Machine .
The thinking triggered by the announcement of the name during the keynote went something like this .
Time Machine .... time travel ... go back in time to get older versions of files ... to see the state of the file system as it existed in the past — OMG , snapshots !
New file system in Leopard !
New file system in Leopard !
File system nerd knows that snapshots are not the kind of feature that 's easy to tack onto an existing file system .
HFS + has already been extended significantly past its original abilities .
Trying to add snapshots is probably one extension too far .
So snapshots probably mean a new file system .
As the Time Machine demonstration progressed , revealing the user interface 's Core Animation flourishes , nothing shown precluded the existence of a new file system with support for snapshots .
On the other hand , nothing about a new file system was mentioned explicitly either .
You'd think this would be the type of thing that Apple would want to tout .
If Time Machine is n't powered by a new , snapshot - enabled file system from Apple , then how does it work ?
It 's got to be snapshots , right ?
File system nerds began to worry .
Wait !
Maybe Apple did n't say anything about a new file system because the one they 're using was created by someone else .
Maybe Apple is moving to ZFS in Leopard !
I 've written about ZFS several times , including a post that revealed that the Filesystem Development Manager at Apple is interested in porting ZFS to Mac OS X .
Stick a fork in it !
" Confirmed ! ! ! "
Time Machine → snapshots → ZFS !
In the past few months , it 's seemed like accepted wisdom among the denizens of Mac web forums and blogs that Apple was moving to ZFS .
Time Machine seemed like an official confirmation of what everyone expected .
Just google for " zfs leopard snapshots " to see how many people came to the same conclusion when Time Machine was announced .
All the pieces fit .
Too bad it 's not true .
The snapshot / ZFS revelation was debunked nearly as quickly as it sprang up .
Although all of WWDC except for the keynote is covered by an non-disclosure agreement , the particulars of Time Machine 's implementation were some of the very first technical details to leak .
Time Machine does not use ZFS .
There was a lot of initial confusion about this , partially because Leopard does include a port of DTrace , the " other " high - profile open source project to come out of Sun 's OpenSolaris efforts .
But the absence of ZFS was no surprise to me .
Although my blog has been cited frequently in other blogs and discussion forums where ZFS was predicted as a feature of Leopard , I never expected it to happen .
I said as much at the end of my post about Apple 's ZFS efforts .
While I ( still ) eagerly await whatever shiny new file system Apple has up its sleeve , it 's nice to see that Apple is working towards adding ZFS interoperability as well .
I took the ZFS port at face value — as a port of a foreign file system , not as a replacement for HFS + ( certainly not in the Leopard time frame , anyway ) .
But what I did expect was a new file system from Apple .
Not a port or a fork of an open source file system , but a brand - new , home - grown , kick - ass file system created by Apple 's own team of engineers .
Unfortunately , that did n't happen either .
The upshot , as readers probably know by now , is that Time Machine is not an interface to file system snapshots built on any sort of new , modern file system .
Instead , it 's an automated backup system that works with plain old HFS +.
The point - in - time views in Time Machine are actually sparsely populated directory trees on an external disk or server containing mostly hard links to unchanged directories , plus full copies of the few files that have been created or modified since the last backup .
Apple added traditional hard links ( that is , hard links to files ) to HFS + back before Mac OS X 10.0 was released .
In Leopard , HFS + supports hard links to directories as well — an ability wholly alien to any other Unix - like operating system that I can think of .
This is how Time Machine builds its sparse trees .
The very first backup is a full copy .
All subsequent backups contain hard links to the unchanged portions of the previous backup .
A lot of the disappointment about the lack of modern file system mojo from Apple has bubbled over into Time Machine hate — or if not hate , then at least condescension .
Does Time Machine suck because it does n't use snapshots ?
No .
The two things serve entirely different purposes .
Time Machine is " backups made easy enough that people will actually do them , " and that 's nothing to sneeze at .
Time Machine leverages the same file system event notification system as Spotlight in order to keep track of which files have changed .
( This notification system is open to third - party developers in Leopard .
Yay ! )
This makes the backup process much less demanding ; the entire volume does not need to be scoured for changed files , grinding the disk in the process .
The list of changed files is ready immediately , at any time .
Like Spotlight before it , Time Machine shows the incredible utility of global file system notifications .
The most significant feature of Time Machine has nothing to do with the underlying file system or copy engine .
Apple has set backups free from the traditional " utility application " model that so many people find intimidating and confusing .
Making the actual backup process automatic is pretty easy .
Lots of existing backup products do that .
The ingenious bit is that Apple has made the recovery process similarly free of any interaction with a dedicated backup application .
[ 1 ]
Files are recovered from a simple — fun , even !— interface right in the standard file manager .
Even better , data can be recovered from within individual applications , and not just those from Apple .
Third - party developers can also integrate Time Machine into their applications .
There 's still plenty of room for legitimate Time Machine criticism , however .
While the hard link trees are a clever solution , given the constraints of HFS + , the strategy dictates a file - level granularity for all backups .
In other words , if you change a single byte of a 500 MB file , the entire 500 MB file will be copied to the backup volume during the next Time Machine backup .
Frequent modifications to large files will fill your backup volume very quickly .
According to MacWorld , " Apple suggests that the answer will be for application developers to modify their programs to break up data into more discrete elements that can be backed up more simply by Time Machine — something they may already be doing in order to make their files searchable via Spotlight . "
Of course , this advice is totally unhelpful for people who edit video or work with other large media files on a daily basis .
Worse , there does not appear to be a way to prioritize backup retention .
When space runs out on the backup volume , presumably Time Machine will recycle old space .
But if it does so based on date rather than ( user - specified ) " importance " , a relatively unimportant change to a large file could necessitate the loss of hundreds of small files from the backup volume .
Where once a small text file may have had an entire year 's worth of revisions on the backup volume , now only the past month 's revisions may exist due to the need to reclaim space for a few recently modified large files .
All of this comes back to snapshots .
Again , snapshots are not the same thing as backups .
But they can certainly be used to more efficiently implement an automated backup system like Time Machine .
With snapshot - enabled file systems on both the primary and backup volumes , backups could be done at the block level rather than the file level .
A one byte change to a 500 MB file would then cause only a single block ( say , 4KB ) of new storage to be used on the backup volume .
Furthermore , snapshots would enable " live " file history on the primary disk as well .
This ( still ) does not constitute a backup .
( When a disk dies , all the snapshots on that same disk die too .
Backups have to be on another device . )
What it does do is enable any file on the primary volume to be reverted to a previous version , Time Machine style , but without requiring the backup volume ( or server or whatever ) to be available .
This reveals another weakness of Time Machine , particularly for laptop users .
Restoring an older version of a file is only possible if the backup volume is available .
If you 're on the road with just your MacBook and you need last week 's version of a file , you 're out of luck .
Taking stock
So , to sum up , Time Machine is an automated backup system with an inspired lack of user - visible moving parts , but a fair to middling underlying implementation .
It 's not based on snapshots .
It does n't use ZFS .
It does n't use a new Apple file system .
It 's not a big truck .
As for the future of file systems in Mac OS X , I continue to hold out hope that something more modern will replace HFS +.
It does n't have to have every buzzword feature under the sun , nor does it even need to have all the ones I described earlier .
But a few would be nice .
And yes , snapshots are high on that list .
Although I would be satisfied with ZFS , I think Apple has a unique perspective on computing that might lead to a home - grown file system with some interesting attributes .
When might such a thing appear ?
Not in Leopard , it seems — or at least not in 10.5.0 .
Does such a project even exist within Apple , or is the plan to ( eventually ) adopt an existing open source file system like ZFS ?
As usual , Apple is n't saying a word one way or the other .
And so I continue to wait .
The few minutes between the announcement of Time Machine and the eventual revelation that there 's no new file system under the covers represents the best experience for Mac file system nerds in a keynote in many years .
( Sad , but true . )
Mac OS X 10.6 has officially been added to my watch list .
WWDC 2008 , here I come !
Here we ’ll deal in the best brand of hair irons currently in the industry .
There is a reason why all of these manufacturers are where they are at the moment , as they have years of experience in producing best hair straighteners the market has to offer , and thousand of satisfied customers , ready to confirm their overall market supremacy .
So , if you want to go about it the right way , you ’ll focus your search for that one best hair straightener o these manufacturers .
You could always buy a cheap hair iron from the market , and just hold your fingers and hope for the best , as you put your hair into the great unknown of a cheap , probably poorly made and untested product .
I ’ve seen it all over the years and some of the sights were n’t pretty at all to behold .
I want to prevent something like that from happening to you , so pay close attention , as I show you where to point your research when shopping for hair irons .
First of the names I have intention of putting out there is the manufacturer simply called Chi .
They ’re a part of a company called Farouk Systems , Inc. that produce spa and professional hair care products of the highest quality .
I ’ve done a lot of reviews of their products over the years , and I know what I ’m talking about , and why I ’m suggesting this company to you now .
They really do manufacture some of the best hair straighteners money can buy right now , and you will be well off trying to find the best one for you among their endless assortment of products .
I ’ll give you the names of their newest products currently , ad you can just visit their website if you ’re interested to see more .
Their newest hair straighteners are : Ultra Pink and Tribal Zebra , Nano Digital , Ionic Single Pass , Camo and Earth Collection , Air Expert Classic , Pink Dazzle , Digital and Original Ceramic .
As I said , those are just some of the newest products , there are many , many more .
Next in our line of highly trusted manufacturers is Remington .
Yeah , I do n’t think any particular introduction is required here .
Everybody ’s heard of Remington , or owned some of their products over the years .
Well , among others things , they also make hair irons , and very high quality at that .
Some of their products that might spark your attention are : Silk , Sapphire , Pearl or Mini Straightener , a wide range of different ceramic iterations of these products , Vintage , Shine , Color Protect or Frizz Therapy Straighteners .
These are just some , of course , that came to mind right this instant .
There are a lot more , so feel free to give your trust to this manufacturer , as so many happy customers did , before you .
Our next mention will be the company called Iso .
They manufacture hair styling products , using latest technology achievements for vibrant and healthy hair .
Their products offer versatility , innovation , and overall , style .
It might not be a well known brand , such as Remington , but the again , they do only deal in hair styling products .
Remington has a much wider array of products to offer , and a much larger audience .
Some of their products that deserve our attention are : Spectrum Pro , Super Spectrum Pro , Super Spectrum Pro Diamond and Limited Collection , Gold Collection , Mini Light , Turbo Silk Limited , Limited Mini Silk Flatirons .
What I ’ve said about the others goes her too .
Much more products to browse , many options to explore .
And it would again be and endless jungle , if we did n’t learn the way to navigate it in a couple of easy steps .
Unfortunately , I ca n’t go in depth about the manufacturers here .
And there are some pretty interesting things and pointers to be shared , but we ’ll have to leave that for some other guides in the future .
Other great manufacturers of hair styling products , primarily hair irons are : Paul Mitchell , GHD , PYT , Sedu , Infrashine , Hai , Solia , Andis , Big Sexy , Kenta , T3 , and so on .
Now you have the basic steps to identify the best hair straightener for your needs , and a list of trusted names in the industry , you can start your Search from .
Just zone in on the product characteristics that speak to you , and look it up in one of these manufacture ’s catalogue .
Now that we ’ve done all that , I need to show you how to recognize the true quality product , once you see it .
There is just an absurd amount of fake hair irons , wearing the marks of some of the trusted manufacturers , and you want to be able to see it right away for the knock off it is .
No two ways around it , you just need to learn how too recognize the real deal , and once you ’ve got it , there will be no fooling you .
According to AppleInsider , a patent filed in 2002 by a Microsoft researcher has prompted the US Patent and Trademark Office to reject an Apple application to patent its iPod user interface .
But leave the black helicopters grounded for a moment : the conspiracy theories may not be flightworthy .
The AppleInsider story says the Apple application " to patent the menu - based software interface of its popular iPod digital music player has ultimately proved unsuccessful . "
However that is n't the case .
The story is coy about the patents it discusses , does n't mention the Microsoft connection and upon further research , it 's clear that several key aspects of the iPod are adequately covered by separate Apple IP applications .
Both patents discussed have weathered multiple rejections by the USPTO .
The story reports that last month an iPod- related patent application for " rotational user inputs " by Apple was rejected , with the examiner citing an earlier 2002 application filed by John Platt .
A Microsoft Research scientist who used to work for touch pad vendor Synaptics , Platt filed a claim for " playlist generation based on seed items " on May 30 2002 , some seven months after the iPod was unveiled .
Comparing the two applications , it 's hard to see how they overlap .
AppleInsider claims " the process by which the iPod 's software displays its own menu - based interface is very similar to the process Platt 's filing goes on to describe . "
Such a similarity eluded us , although you can judge for yourselves - the links are at the end of this report .
Apple 's application , assigned to iTunes engineer Jeffrey Robbins , Apple CEO Steve Jobs and VP of marketing Phil Schiller , was made on September 26 2002 , and describes rotating an input device to navigate in a linear fashion through a user interface .
" Although the type of computing device can vary , the improved approaches are particularly well - suited for use with a portable media player , " according to the filing .
AppleInsider reports that the rotational patent has been rejected by the USPTO .
However , this is n't as final as the statement suggests .
" Non-Final Rejections " ( NFR ) of this kind are n't unusual .
Patents are frequently bounced back to the inventor , and many successful patents are accepted only after several NFRs .
For example , an Amazon.com e-commerce patent we wrote about recently succeeded at the fifth attempt in four years .
Apple 's rotation application , we discover , received its first NFR on September 29 , 2004 and was bounced again on June 13 this year .
But Platt 's playlist application also has a rejection history .
It received an NFR on 17 November 2002 , and a more serious Final Rejection on 14 June 2004 .
After further documentation was received , and extension granted , the application received another NFR on 11 December last year .
Apple has filed a number of applications to protect the iPod and iTunes user interfaces , including 60/359,551 ( " Touch Pad for Handheld Device " ) and 60/387,692 ( " Method and Apparatus for Use of Rotational User Inputs " ) .
Apple is facing two infringement suits claiming the iPod violates existing IP . ®

CTSS was developed during 1963 and 64 .
I was at MIT on the computer center staff at that time .
After having written dozens of commands for CTSS , I reached the stage where I felt that commands should be usable as building blocks for writing more commands , just like subroutine libraries .
Hence , I wrote " RUNCOM " , a sort of shell driving the execution of command scripts , with argument substitution .
The tool became instantly most popular , as it became possible to go home in the evening while leaving behind long runcoms executing overnight .
It was quite neat for boring and repetitive tasks such as renaming , moving , updating , compiling , etc. whole directories of files for system and application maintenance and monitoring .
In the same vein , I also felt that commands should be usable as library subroutines , or vice versa .
This stemmed from my practice ( unique at the time ) of writing CTSS commands in MAD ( Michigan Algorithm Decoder ) , a simplified Algol - like language .
It was much faster and the code was more maintainable than the IBM 7094 assembly code .
Since I needed MAD friendly subroutine calls to access CTSS primitives , I wrote in assembly code a battery of interface subroutines , which very often mimicked CTSS basic command functions .
Or I wanted to make commands out of subroutines which handled common chores .
I felt it was an awkward duplication of effort .
However , I did not go further in the context of CTSS .
Then in 64 came the Multics design time , in which I was not much involved , because I had made it clear I wanted to return to France in mid 65 .
However , this idea of using commands somehow like a programming language was still in the back of my mind .
Christopher Strachey , a British scientist , had visited MIT about that time , and his macro - generator design appeared to me a very solid base for a command language , in particular the techniques for quoting and passing arguments .
Without being invited on the subject , I wrote a paper explaining how the Multics command language could be designed with this objective .
And I coined the word " shell " to name it .
It must have been at the end of 64 or beginning of 65 .
The small gang of Multics wizards found it a sleek idea , but they wanted something more refined in terms of language syntax .
As time left to me was short , and I was not an expert in language design , I let the issue for them to debate , and instead I made a program flowchart of the shell .
It was used after I left for writing the first Multics shell .
Glenda Schroeder ( MIT ) and a GE man did it .
Time - sharing was a misnomer .
While it did allow the sharing of a central computer , its success derives from the ability to share other resources : data , programs , concepts .
It cracked a critical path bottleneck for writing and debugging programs .
In theory this could have been achieved as well with a direct access approach .
In practice it could not .
Direct access hems users in a static framework .
Evolution is unfrequent and controlled by central and distant agents .
Creativity is out of the user 's hand .
Time sharing , as it became popular , is a living organism in which any user , with various degrees of expertise , can create new objects , test them , and make them available to others , without administrative control and hassle .
With the internet experience , this no longer need be substantiated .
Keith issued arguably his most powerful Special Comment yet tonight .
This time he takes on the GOP 's newest fearmongering ad which quotes Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri superimposed over pictures of explosions with the sound of a ticking bomb in the background .
As if that was n't enough , it 's topped off with the cryptic message echoing LBJ 's 1960 " Daisy " ad that ran just once :
These are the stakes .
Download - WMP Download -QT
In my opinion , the most important point Keith makes concerns the recent uproar over the video CNN showed this week of a sniper attack on US troops in Iraq .
House Armed Services Chairman Duncan Hunter and Congressman Brian Bilbray have come out strong against it calling it a " terrorist snuff film " yet they seem to have no problem with a RNC ad which is really nothing short of a terrorist propaganda film itself .
UPDATE : Transcripts below the fold ...
And lastly , tonight , a Special Comment on the advertising of terrorism .
The commercial , you have already seen , it is a distillation of everything this administration and the party in power have tried to do these last five years and six weeks .
It is from the Republican National Committee , it shows images of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri .
It offers quotes from them , all as a clock ticks ominously in the background .
It concludes with what Zawahiri may or may not have said to a Pakistani journalist as long ago as 2001 , his dubious claim that he had purchased suitcase bombs .
The quotation is followed by sheer coincidence , no doubt , by an image of a massive explosion .
" These are the stakes " appears on the screen , quoting exactly from Lyndon Johnson 's infamous nuclear scare commercial from 1964 , " Vote November 7th " .
There is a cheap Texas Chainsaw Massacre quality to the whole thing .
It also serves to immediately call to mind the occasions when President Bush dismissed Osama bin Laden as somebody he did n't think about , except , obviously , when elections were near .
Frankly , a lot of people seeing that commercial for the first time have laughed out loud , but not everyone .
And therein lies the true threat to this country .
The dictionary definition of the word ‘ terrorize ' is simple and not open to misinterpretation : " To fill or overpower with terror ; terrify ; coerce by intimidation or fear . "
Note please that the words ‘ violence ' and ‘ death ' are missing from that definition .
For the key to terrorism is not the act - but the fear of the act .
That is why bin Laden and his deputies and his imitators are forever putting together videotape statements and releasing virtual infomercials with dire threats and heart - stopping warnings .
But why is the Republican Party imitating them ?
Bin Laden puts out what amounts to a commercial of fear ; the Republicans put out what is unmistakable as a commercial of fear .
The Republicans are paying to have the messages of bin Laden and the others broadcast into your home !
Only the Republicans have a bigger bankroll .
When last week , the CNN network ran video of an insurgent in Iraq evidently stalking and killing an American soldier , Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mr. Hunter , Republican of California , branded that channel quote " the publicist for an enemy propaganda film , " and added that CNN used it to sell commercials .
Another California Republican , Representative Brian Bilbray , called the video quote " nothing short of a terrorist snuff film . "
If so , Mr. Bilbray , then what in the hell is your party 's new advertisement ?
And Mr. Hunter ?
CNN using the film to sell commercials ?
Commercials ?
You have adopted bin Laden and Zawahiri as spokesmen for the Republican National Committee .
‘ To fill or overpower with terror ; terrify .
To coerce by intimidation or fear '
By this definition , the people who put these videos together : first , the terrorists and then , the administration , whose shared goal is to scare you into panicking instead of thinking , they are the ones terrorizing you .
By this definition , the leading terrorist group in this world right now is al Qaeda , but the leading terrorist group in this country right now is the Republican Party .
Eleven presidents ago , the chief executive reassured us that ‘ we have nothing to fear , but fear itself . '
His distant successor has wasted his administration , insisting there is nothing we can have but fear itself .
The Vice President , as recently as this month , was caught campaigning again with the phrase " mass death in the United States " .
Four years ago , it was the now Secretary of State , Dr. Rice , rationalizing Iraq with quote , " we do n't want to be ... the smoking gun to be the mushroom cloud . "
Days later , Mr. Bush himself told an audience that quote " we cannot wait the final proof , the smoking gun , that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud . "
And now we have this cheesy commercial , complete with images of a faked mushroom cloud and implications of mass death in America .
This administration has derived benefit and power from terrorizing the very people it claims to be protecting from terror .
It may be the oldest trick in the political book : scare people into believing they are in danger and only you can save them .
Lyndon Johnson used it to bury Barry Goldwater .
Joe McCarthy leaped from obscurity on its back .
And now the legacy has come to President George W. Bush .
Of course , the gruel of fear is getting thinner and thinner , is it not , Mr. President ?
And thus , more and more of it needs to be made out of less and less actual terror .
After last week 's embarrassing internet hoax about dirty bombs in footballs stadiums , the one your Department of Homeland Security immediately disseminated to the public , a self - described former CIA operative named Wayne Simmons cited the fiasco as quote " The , and I mean , the perfect example of the President 's Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the NSA Terrorist Eavesdropping Program - how vital they are . "
Frank Gaffney , once a respected Assistant Secretary of Defense and now the president of something called The Center for Security Policy added " one of the things that I hope Americans take away from this is not only that they 're gunning for us .
Not just in a place like Iraq , but truly worldwide . "
Of course , the " they " to which Mr. Gaffney referred , turned out to be a lone 20 - year - old grocery bagger from Wisconsin named Jake .
A kid trying to one - up some loser in an internet game of ‘ chicken . '
His threat referenced seven football stadiums , at which dirty bombs were to be exploded yesterday .
It began with the one in New York City , even though there is n't one in New York City and though the attacks were supposed to be simultaneous , four of the games were scheduled to start at 1:00 pm Eastern time and the others at 4:00 pm Eastern time .
Moreover , the kid said that he had posted the identical message on forty websites since September .
We caught him in merely about six weeks , even though the only way he could be less subtle , less stealthy and less of a threat was if he bought an advertisement on the Superbowl telecast .
Mr. Bush , this is the what -- 100th plot your people have revealed that turned out to be some nonsensical misunderstanding or the fabrications of somebody hoping to talk his way off a waterboard in Eastern Europe ?
If , Mr. President , this is the kind of crack work your new ad implies that only you , and not the Democrats , can do , you , sir , need to pull over and ask for directions .
The real question , of course , Mr. Bush , is why did your Department of Homeland Security even release that information in the first place ?
It was never a serious threat .
Even the first news accounts quoted a Homeland spokesman as admitting strong skepticism .
The kind of strong skepticism which most government agencies address before telling the public , not afterwards .
So that leaves two options , Mr. President : the first option , you and your Department of Homeland Security do n't have the slightest idea what you 're doing here .
Thus , contrary to your flip - flopping between saying , " we 're safe " and saying , " but we 're not safe enough " , and contrary to the Vice President 's swaggering pronouncements about the lack of another attack since 9/11 , the last five years HAS been just an accident .
Or there 's the second option : your political operatives leaked this nonsense for the same reason your political operatives put out that commercial .
To scare the gullible .
Obviously , the correct answer , Mr. Bush , is : all of the above .
There are some of us who could forgive you , for trying to run your candidates on the coattails of the Grim Reaper , for reducing your party 's existence to " Death and the Tax Us . "
It 's cynical and barbaric , but after all , it may be merely the extension of the gutter politics to which you have subscribed since you sidled over from baseball and the business world of other people 's money .
But to forgive you for terrorizing us , we would have to believe that you somehow competent in keeping others from terrorizing us .
Yet last week , construction workers repairing a subway line in New York City were cleaning out an abandoned manhole on the edge of the WTC site , when they stumbled on the horrific and impossible : human remains from 9/11 .
Bones and fragments , eighty of them .
Some as much as a foot long .
The victims had been lying literally in the gutter for five years and five weeks .
The families and friends of each of the 2,749 dead , who had been grimly told in May 2002 , that there were no more remains to be found , were struck anew as if the terrorism of that day had just happened all over again .
And over this weekend , they have found still more remains .
And now this week will be spent looking in places that should have already been looked at a thousand times , five years ago .
For all the victims in New York , Mr. Bush , the living and the dead , it is a touch of 9/11 all over again .
And the mayor of this city , who called off this search four and a half years ago is a Republican .
The governor , with whom he conferred , is a Republican .
The House of Representatives , Republican .
The Senate , Republican .
The President , Republican .
And yet you can claim that you and you alone can protect us from terrorism ?
You can't even recover our dead from the battlefield .
The battlefield in an American city .
When we 've given you five years and unlimited funds to do so .
While citing a Military Commissions
Act so monstrous that it has now been criticized by even the John Birch Society , you told us , Mr. Bush , quote , " there is nothing we can do to bring back the men and women lost on September 11th , 2001 , yet we 'll always honor their memory and we will never forget the way they were taken from us . "
Except of course , for the ones that have been lying under a manhole cover for five years .
Setting aside the fact that your government has done nothing else for those five years but pat itself on the back about terror , while waging pointless war on the wrong enemy in Iraq and waging war on the cherished freedoms in America , just on this subject of counter - terrorism , sir , yours is the least competent government in time of crisis in this country 's history .
These are the stakes indeed , Mr. President .
You do not know what you are doing .
And the commercial , the one about which Zawahiri might say , " hey , pretty good , we love your choice of font style , " all that further needs to be said about that is to add three words to Shakespeare .
Mr. President , you and that advertisement of terror are full of sound and fury , signifying -- and competent at -- nothing .
I declare from the beginning that I am no authority on digital certificates .
This document is a summary of all the articles I have read about openssl .
It describes in short how to become your own Certificate Authority ( CA ) and how to create and sign your own certificate requests .
Make no mistake , these certificates are good only for personal use or for use in your intranet in order to provide a secure way to login or communicate with your services , so that passwords or other data is not transmitted in the clear .
Noone else will or should trust these certificates .
Prerequisites
The package openssl should be installed in the machine you will use to manage your certificates or create the certificate requests .
First things first …
The openssl package comes with some scripts that can help you create your server certificates fast , but here I will describe how to set things up from scratch in a new directory , so that you can customize things later if you like or delete everything without touching openssl ’s or the system ’s default files .
This article is based on a Fedora installation , but will do for all distributions .
Creating the necessary directories
First of all we will create a directory tree where all certificate stuff will be kept .
Fedora ’s default directory is / etc / pki/tls / .
So , as root , we create our own directories :
# mkdir -m 0755 /etc/ pki_jungle
And then we create our CA ’s directory tree :
# mkdir -m 0755 \ /etc/pki_jungle/myCA
\ /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private \
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/certs \
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/newcerts \
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/crl
myCA is our Certificate Authority ’s directory .
is our Certificate Authority ’s directory .
myCA / certs directory is where our server certificates will be placed .
directory is where our server certificates will be placed .
myCA / newcerts directory is where openssl puts the created certificates in PEM ( unencrypted ) format and in the form cert_serial_number.pem ( eg 07.pem ) .
Openssl needs this directory , so we create it .
directory is where openssl puts the created certificates in PEM ( unencrypted ) format and in the form cert_serial_number.pem ( eg 07.pem ) .
Openssl needs this directory , so we create it .
myCA / crl is where our certificate revokation list is placed .
is where our certificate revokation list is placed .
myCA / private is the directory where our private keys are placed .
Be sure that you set restrictive permissions to all your private keys so that they can be read only by root , or the user with whose priviledges a server runs .
If anyone steals your private keys , then things get really bad .
Initial openssl configuration
We are going to copy the default openssl configuration file ( openssl.cnf ) to our CA ’s directory .
In Fedora , this file exists in /etc / pki/tls .
So , we copy it to our CA ’s dir and name it openssl.my.cnf .
As root :
# cp /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/openssl.my.cnf
This file does not need to be world readable , so we change its attributes :
# chmod 0600 /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/openssl.my.cnf
We also need to create two other files .
This file serves as a database for openssl :
# touch /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/index.txt
The following file contains the next certificate ’s serial number .
Since we have not created any certificates yet , we set it to " 01 " :
# echo ' 01 ' >
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/serial
Things to remember
Here is a small legend with file extensions we will use for the created files and their meaning .
All files that will be created will have one of these extensions :
KEY – Private key ( Restrictive permissions should be set on this )
– Private key ( Restrictive permissions should be set on this ) CSR – Certificate Request ( This will be signed by our CA in order to create the server certificates .
Afterwards it is not needed and can be deleted )
– Certificate Request ( This will be signed by our CA in order to create the server certificates .
Afterwards it is not needed and can be deleted ) CRT – Certificate ( This can be publicly distributed )
– Certificate ( This can be publicly distributed ) PEM – We will use this extension for files that contain both the Key and the server Certificate ( Some servers need this ) .
Permissions should be restrictive on these files .
– We will use this extension for files that contain both the Key and the server Certificate ( Some servers need this ) .
Permissions should be restrictive on these files .
CRL – Certificate Revokation List ( This can be publicly distributed )
Create the CA Certificate and Key
Now , that all initial configuration is done , we may create a self - signed certificate , that will be used as our CA ’s certificate .
In other words , we will use this to sign other certificate requests .
Change to our CA ’s directory .
This is where we should issue all the openssl commands because here is our openssl ’s configuration file ( openssl.my.cnf ) .
As root :
# cd /etc/pki_jungle/myCA /
And then create your CA ’s Certificate and Private Key .
As root :
# openssl req - config openssl.my.cnf - new - x509 - extensions v3_ca - keyout private / myca.key - out certs / myca.crt - days 1825
This creates a self - signed certificate with the default CA extensions which is valid for 5 years .
You will be prompted for a passphrase for your CA ’s private key .
Be sure that you set a strong passphrase .
Then you will need to provide some info about your CA .
Fill in whatever you like .
Here is an example :
Country Name ( 2 letter code ) [ GB ] : GR State or Province Name ( full name ) [ Berkshire ] : Greece Locality Name ( eg , city ) [ Newbury ] : Thessaloniki Organization Name ( eg , company ) [ My Company Ltd ] : My Network Organizational Unit Name ( eg , section ) [ ] :
My Certificate Authority Common Name ( eg , your name or your server 's hostname ) [] :server.example.com Email Address [] :whatever@server.example.com
Two files are created :
certs/myca.crt –
This is your CA ’s certificate and can be publicly available and of course world readable .
– This is your CA ’s certificate and can be publicly available and of course world readable .
private / myca.key –
This is your CA ’s private key .
Although it is protected with a passphrase you should restrict access to it , so that only root can read it : # chmod 0400 /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private/myca.key
More openssl configuration ( mandatory )
Because we use a custom directory for our certificates ’ management , some modifications to /etc/ pki_jungle/myCA/openssl.my.cnf are necessary .
Open it in your favourite text editor as root and find the following part ( around line 35 ) :
[ CA_default ] dir = ../../ CA # Where everything is kept certs = $ dir / certs #
Where the issued certs are kept crl_dir = $ dir / crl #
Where the issued crl are kept database = $ dir/index.txt # database index file .
#unique_subject = no #
Set to ' no ' to allow creation of # several ctificates with same subject .
new_certs_dir = $ dir / newcerts # default place for new certs .
certificate = $ dir/cacert.pem #
The CA certificate serial = $ dir / serial #
The current serial number # crlnumber = $ dir / crlnumber # the current crl number must be # commented out to leave a V1 CRL crl = $ dir/crl.pem #
The current CRL private_key = $ dir / private/cakey.pem #
The private key RANDFILE = $ dir / private / .rand # private random number file x509 _extensions = usr_cert #
The extentions to add to the cert
You should modify the following settings in order to coform to our custom directory and our custom CA key and certificate :
[ CA_default ] dir = .
# <--CHANGE THIS certs = $ dir / certs crl_dir = $ dir / crl database = $ dir/index.txt #unique_subject = no new_certs_dir = $ dir / newcerts certificate = $ dir/certs/myca.crt # <--CHANGE THIS serial = $ dir / serial #crlnumber = $ dir / crlnumber crl = $ dir/crl.pem private_key = $ dir / private/myca.key # <--CHANGE THIS RANDFILE = $ dir / private / .rand x509 _extensions = usr_cert
Create a Server certificate
Further openssl.my.cnf file ’s customization is possible , so that we define our policy for certificate creation and signing or define our desired extensions for the new certificates .
I may add this info to a future version of this document .
It ’s easy though , just try to familiarize yourself with the openssl.cnf ’s structure and you ’ll figure it out .
Anyway , the certificates we are going to create , without customizing openssl.my.cnf any further , are general purpose certificates and their usage in not restricted to server authentication only .
One thing that you should take a note of is that the private keys will not be protected by a passphrase , so that when the services are restarted they do not ask for a passphrase .
This means that you should set restrictive permissions on the private keys , so that only root or the user under whose priviledges a server runs can read these files .
Generate a Certificate Request
First , we change to our CA ’s directory :
# cd /etc/pki_jungle/myCA /
Then we create the certificate request :
# openssl req - config openssl.my.cnf - new - nodes - keyout private / server.key - out server.csr - days 365
The - nodes option is needed so that the private key is not protected with a passphrase .
If you do not intend to use the certificate for server authentication , you should not include it in the above command .
You can customize the number of days you want this certificate to be valid for .
You will be prompted for the certificate ’s info .
Here is an example :
Country Name ( 2 letter code ) [ GB ] : GR State or Province Name ( full name ) [ Berkshire ] : Greece Locality Name ( eg , city ) [ Newbury ] : Thessaloniki Organization Name ( eg , company ) [ My Company Ltd ] : My Network Organizational Unit Name ( eg , section ) [ ] :
My Web Server Common Name ( eg , your name or your server 's hostname ) []:www.server.example.com
Email Address [] :whatever@server.example.com
The Common Name ( CN ) is the info that uniquely distinguishes your service , so be sure that you type it correctly .
When prompted for some extra attributes ( challenge password , optional company name ) just hit the [ Enter ] key .
Two files are created :
server.csr – this is the certificate request .
– this is the certificate request .
private / server.key – this is the private key , which is not protected with a passphrase .
Set restrictive permissions on the private key .
Only root or the user that is used to run the server should be able to read it .
For example :
# chown root.root /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private/server.key # chmod 0400 /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private/server.key
Or :
# chown root .
apache
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private/server.key # chmod 0440 /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/private/server.key
Sign the Certificate Request
Now we are going to sign the certificate request and generate the server ’s certificate .
First , we change to our CA ’s directory :
# cd /etc/pki_jungle/myCA /
Then we sign the certificate request :
# openssl ca - config openssl.my.cnf - policy policy_anything - out certs / server.crt - infiles server.csr
You will need to supply the CA ’s private key in order to sign the request .
You can check the openssl.my.cnf file about what policy_anything means .
In short , the fields about the Country , State or City is not required to match those of your CA ’s certificate .
After all this is done two new files are created :
certs / server.crt – this is the server ’s certificate , which can be made available publicly .
– this is the server ’s certificate , which can be made available publicly .
newcerts /01.pem –
This is exactly the same certificate , but with the certificate ’s serial number as a filename .
It is not needed .
You can now delete the certificate request ( server.csr ) .
It ’s no longer needed :
# rm -f /etc/pki_jungle/myCA/server.csr
Verify the certificate
You can see the certificate ’s info with the following :
# openssl x509 - subject - issuer - enddate - noout - in /etc/ pki_jungle/myCA/certs/server.crt
Or the following :
# openssl x509 - in certs / server.crt - noout - text
And verify that the certificate is valid for server authentication with the following :
# openssl verify - purpose sslserver - CAfile /etc/ pki_jungle/myCA/certs/myca.crt
/etc/pki_jungle/myCA/certs/server.crt
Server certificate and key in one file
Some servers , for example vsftpd , require that both the private key and the certificate exist in the same file .
In a situation like that just do the following :
# cat certs / server.crt private / server.key > private / server - key - cert.pem
You should restrict access to the final file and delete server.crt and server .
key since thay are no longer needed .
# chown root.root private / server - key - cert.pem # chmod 0400 private / server - key - cert.pem # rm -f certs / server.crt # rm -f private / server.key
Revoke a Server Certificate
If you do not want a certificate to be valid any more , you have to revoke it .
This is done with the command :
# openssl ca - config openssl.my.cnf - revoke certs/server.crt
Then you should generate a new CRL ( Certificate Revokation List ) :
# openssl ca - config openssl.my.cnf - gencrl - out crl/myca.crl
The CRL file is crl / myca.crl .
Distribute your certificates and CRL
Your CA ’s certificate and your servers ’ certificates should be distributed to those who trust you so they can import them in their client software ( web browsers , ftp clients , email clients etc ) .
The CRL should also be published .

I doubted it .
I , on the other hand , have thought of him nearly every day since .
He has certainly been important to me over the years .
A tarot - card reader once told me that the rape enabled me to break away from my family .
I thought it was a ridiculous thing to say , but I suppose it ’s true .
When I was raped , I did n’t feel I could tell my parents what happened , so I washed out my bloody panties and kept quiet .
A few days later , I was ironing a shirt when my mother asked me what was wrong , because it was apparent something was wrong — but even then I did n’t say anything .
Four months later I left for college , having told no one but a teacher and a guidance counselor .
( Actually , I did n’t even really tell the counselor .
When I came to the part I could n’t bring myself to say , the counselor supplied the words : “ And then he got a little rough . ”
Even in my confusion , that seemed like an understatement .
And that ’s as far as it went . )
After I left at 17 , I never lived in my hometown again .
When I returned for short visits , I rarely left my parents ’ house .
I felt as uncomfortable and vulnerable as I did when I was 16 .
But that was another gift my rapist bestowed — agelessness .
Because I think so frequently of that night in April 1980 , my teenaged self is still strong inside me .
Because of my rapist , I ’m forever young .
I ’ve always called him “ my rapist , ” mostly because I do n’t know what else to call him .
Whenever I use the phrase , I think I should find another one .
I do n’t want to say his name , though , and no word I can come up with conveys what I think or feel , so I just go on calling him “ my rapist . ”
Seeing my rapist ’s engagement photo that day triggered a fantasy in my mind , one I ’d never had before .
I told myself that if I ever actually saw my rapist , I would have no trouble killing him , especially if all the legal and karmic rules were somehow suspended .
( It was a fantasy , so I got to make that bargain . )
For the record , I 'm not opposed to game patents .
Currently , they seem to be the only way that people who do what we do - invent game mechanics - can get the same sort of protection that authors get from copyrights .
In fact , I 'm more predisposed to them than software patents - with software , you can protect yourself with trade secrets * and* copyright .
Game mechanics not so .
That said .
Abstract
When a player instructs a movement of a player character from an input device , a control section obtains a position of the player character during a current frame period .
The control section obtains a distance between the position of the player character during the current period and a position of a view point of a virtual camera during a previous frame period .
If the obtained distance is less than a predetermined critical near distance , the control section moves the position of the view point away from the player character .
If the obtained distance exceeds a critical far distance , the control section moves the position of the view point towards the player character .
If the obtained distance is in the range between the critical near distance and the critical far distance , the control section does not move the position of the view point .

Dear Mr. Dobbs , Congratulations on having a large new bloc of voters bear your name !
Politicians ignore the " Lou Dobbs Democrats " at their peril .
Every night on CNN you claim to speak for these people .
They are America 's middle class : decent folks who work hard and play by the rules but who , you insist , are abused by the powerful elite .
Free trade is one of the policies allegedly supported by the elite and for which you reserve special vitriol .
You thunder that imports destroy American jobs , reduce wages , and make the economy perilously " unbalanced . "
But you are mistaken .
First , some basic facts about the state of middle - class Americans .
The US unemployment rate now is at a healthy 4.5 percent .
This rate is lower than the average annual unemployment rate for the 1970s ( 6.2 percent ) , the 1980s ( 7.3 percent ) , and even the high - growth 1990s ( 5.6 percent ) .
Inflation , meanwhile , is running below the average for the 70s , 80s , and 90s .
Here 's more good news for ordinary Americans .
The percentage of Americans who own their own homes is higher than ever , even though the size of today 's typical home is larger than ever .
Workers ' leisure time , too , is at historically high levels .
And jobs are just as secure today as they were in the late 1960s , according to a research paper by University of California - Davis economist Ann Huff Stevens .
Perhaps you think that this prosperity exists only because so many of today 's households require two income earners .
But women started leaving homes for paid employment at least a century ago , with no jump since the end of World War II in the rate at which women enter the workforce , according to a recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Had worker pay truly deteriorated in the past 30 years , and had families reacted by sending moms to the workforce , the rate at which women join the workforce would have increased .
It did not .
Today , the percentage of household expenditures used to buy nonessential items is at an all - time high – about 50 percent compared with about 45 percent in the mid-1970s .
That undercuts your notion that two incomes are needed just to scrape by .
Not only is America 's middle class not disappearing – it's thriving .
Perhaps you miss this fact because you are misled by familiar trade jargon .
In your book , " Exporting America , " in your columns , and on your television show you complain vigorously and often about America 's trade deficit .
You call it " staggering , " and wonder how long America can continue to run such deficits .
Admittedly , the word " deficit " sounds ominous .
In fact , though , America 's trade deficit is evidence of its economic vigor and promise .
Here 's why :
When Americans buy foreign - made goods and services , foreigners earn dollars .
The only way America would run no trade deficit is if foreigners spent all of these dollars buying goods and services from Americans .
Instead , though , foreigners invest some of their dollars in America .
They buy American corporate stock , they build their own factories and retail outlets in the US , they lend dollars to Uncle Sam , and they hold some dollars in reserve as cash .
Are n't you proud that so many people the world over eagerly invest their hard - earned wealth in America ?
As an American , I 'm proud and optimistic .
Foreigners invest in the US so readily because its economy is so strong .
And even better , these investments strengthen the economy by creating more capital for American workers .
These investments raise workers ' productivity and wages .
Remember : A trade deficit is not synonymous with debt .
I 'm writing this letter on a new Sony computer that I bought with cash .
I owe Sony nothing .
If Sony holds the dollars it earned from this sale , or if it uses these dollars to buy stock in General Electric or land in Arizona – that is , as long as Sony invests its dollars in America in ways other than lending it to Americans – the US trade deficit rises without raising Americans ' indebtedness .
Americans go more deeply into debt to foreigners only when Americans borrow money from foreigners .
Uncle Sam , of course , borrows a lot of money , from both Americans and from non-Americans .
I share your concern about the reckless spending and borrowing practiced by politicians in Washington .
Foreigners , however , are not to blame for this recklessness .
Indeed , I 'm grateful that foreigners stand ready to help us pay the cost of our overblown government .
Fortunately , Washington 's spending binges are not serious enough to cripple America 's entrepreneurial economy .
If they were , foreigners would refuse to invest here .
If you 're still skeptical that America 's trade deficit is no cause for concern , perhaps you 'll be persuaded by Adam Smith , who wrote that " Nothing , however , can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade . "
Smith correctly understood that with free trade , the economy becomes larger than any one nation – a fact that brings more human creativity , more savings , more capital , more specialization , more opportunity , more competition , and a higher standard of living to all those who can freely trade .
Sincerely ,
Donald J. Boudreaux

LINCOLN supposedly said :
If I call a tail a leg , how many legs does a dog have ?
Five ?
No , calling a tail a leg does n’t make it a leg .
Which brings us to the proposal to treat the District of Columbia as if it were a state .
Today ’s Democratic - controlled Congress wants to give D.C. , by legislation , a full voting member in the House of Representatives .
Having failed to achieve ratification of a constitutional amendment , sent to the states in 1978 , which would have conferred statehood on D.C. ( only 16 states ratified it , 22 short of the required number ) , Democrats now say an amendment is unnecessary – a statute will suffice to do essentially that .
Many clauses in the Constitution leave room for conflicting interpretations .
What constitutes “ commerce . . . among the several states , ” “ establishment of religion , ” “ cruel and unusual punishments ” ?
Regarding the composition of the House of Representatives , however , the Constitution is unambiguous .
Article I , Section 2 says the House shall be composed of members chosen “ by the people of the several states . ”
Until the nation ’s flag has 51 stars – at which point D.C. will have two senators – the city should not have a full member of the House .
( Today , D.C. ’s “ delegate ” votes in committees , and on floor amendments – as long as the vote does not change the outcome – but not on final passage of legislation . )
But those – mostly Democrats – who favor full House membership for D.C. cite Congress ’ constitutional power “ to exercise exclusive legislation ” over “ the seat of the government . ”
They say Congress can exercise its “ exclusive legislation ” power to nullify Article I , Section 2 ’s requirement that House members be chosen by people “ of the several states . ”
But that is preposterous : If Congress ’ “ exclusive legislation ” power concerning D.C. can trump one constitutional provision , it can trump any provision : Congress could establish a religion , stifle free speech or authorize unreasonable searches and seizures in D.C. And if Congress ’ power over D.C. allows it to award full House representation , why could it not also award two Senate seats ?
Today ’s Congress is pressing House representation for D.C. in part because of that predictable next step : D.C. would be a reliable source of two Democratic senators .
If majorities in both houses of Congress want the fewer than 600,000 residents of D.C. to be fully represented , they can accomplish that with legislation shrinking D.C. to the core containing the major federal buildings and monuments , and giving the rest back to Maryland .
Democrats are uninterested in that because it would n’t serve their objective of increasing their Senate seats .
If Congress wants residents of D.C. as it exists to enjoy full representation , it can initiate the process of amending the Constitution to make it a state .
But statehood would be a problem , for the contiguous states , Maryland and Virginia , and for the nation .
The new state probably would promptly enact a commuter tax hitting Maryland and Virginia residents .
And , more important , the splendid vistas of the nation ’s capital might be jeopardized .
They are protected by the limits on building heights that Congress mandates .
But Congress would have no authority to impose such mandates on the new state .
Congress admitted Oklahoma to statehood on the condition that Guthrie remain the state ’s capital until 1913 .
But in 1910 Oklahoma made Oklahoma City the capital , and the U.S Supreme Court held that statehood could not be conditioned by limiting a state ’s sovereign powers .
Anyway , 38 state legislatures are unlikely to make of D.C. the only state with no rural interests , and one dominated by a single interest – the federal government .
Meanwhile , Congress should ponder Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson ’s recent dissent when a federal appeals court ruled 2 - 1 that D.C. ’s severe restriction on gun ownership violates the Second Amendment .
She noted that the Second Amendment restricts the power only of Congress and the states , and she demonstrated that “ there is no dispute that the Constitution , case law and applicable statutes all establish that the District is not a state within the meaning of the Second Amendment . ”
Neither is it a state within the meaning of Article I , Section 2 .
The Supreme Court will remind Congress of that , if Congress ever sends to a Democratic president , who would sign it , what today ’s Congress wants to send to President Bush , who surely would veto it .
The Constitution ’s 23rd Amendment , enacted in 1961 , entitles D.C. to the number of presidential electoral votes to which it would be entitled “ if it were a state . ”
Until it is one , calling it one by statute can’t generate for it the political entitlements “ of the several states . ”

An anonymous reader wonders : What are the pros and cons of such a move for a mid-sized or large college ?
If you were in charge of the communications of a such a university , would you outsource [ please note the vendor neutrality , here ] your e-mail ?
Has anyone else 's tech department migrated to Windows Live Mail ?
Why did they make that decision , and how did it work out for the students ?
For those of us who have already switched our accounts with no way to revert , what ways exist to get around the lack of POP and still use a client ?
Is there any hope we can get the University to change back or Microsoft to implement POP before the semester 's end ?
How does your University manage their email ? "
How else do you explain that Mega Man has to begin every game with no boss weapons ?
You would think after the third or seventh time that Dr. Wily escapes that Dr. Light would be smart and let him keep them .
Then again , by the eighth game if he had retained all the power ups , I doubt it would be Dr. Wily who was trying to take over the world .
For those of you new to Dueling Analogs you might not know that I am a BIG Mega Man fan .
Here ’s a link to my previous Mega Man comic and here ’s to the latest Rejected Mega Man Villians ( there ’s six so far ) .
Side note …
I just wanted to point out that even though this comic was done on Wednesday , it was so close to Thursday that I just labeled it as coming out then .
That ’s why it says January 4th and not 3rd .
Remember there is an off cycle comic this week .
So I ’ll see you guys on Friday !
Welcome to the Chávez revolution - where the rich keep getting richer
Another agreeable lunch ended at the Caracas Country Club with a bottle of Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon , the chef 's famous flan and a round of espressos served on a silver platter .
From their table in the sun-kissed courtyard the three businessmen could hear only the fountain 's gurgle , the murmur of other diners , the clink of glasses and the swish of waiters in wine - coloured waistcoats .
A socialist revolution is supposed to be clanging through Venezuela but from this oasis of wealth in the heart of the capital it is inaudible , just like the traffic .
" The revolution is blah blah blah .
We do n't feel threatened , " said one of the trio , a shoe factory owner .
Much of the country 's elite , it seems , feel the same way .
President Hugo Chávez has warned that " capitalism will lead to the destruction of humanity " but seldom has there been a better time to make , spend and enjoy money .
The economy is surging at 9.4 % and banks and credit card companies are reporting exponential increases in deposits and loans .
Car sales are expected to more than double this year to 300,000 , many of them luxury models , and property price rises rival Manhattan .
The reason is oil .
As the world 's fifth biggest exporter Venezuela has thrived as the barrel price hovers around $ 60 .
Unlike previous petro-booms , however , this one is supposed to be different as there is a powerful president who wears a red beret , quotes Che Guevara and praises Cuban communism .
Mr Chávez has garnered global attention with promises to " transform the structures of capitalism " .
Billions of dollars have been spent on improving health care and education for the country 's poor and in the countryside a small minority of sugar plantations and ranches have been turned into socialist cooperatives .
But property rights and the structure of the economy remain intact , largely because the government does not want to impede its revenue , prompting relief from the elite and grumbles from the radical left who want greater redistribution of resources .
" If you look at what it has accomplished , it is a neoliberal government , " Douglas Bravo , a former Marxist guerrilla who was once close to Mr Chávez , lamented to the daily El Nacional .
Mr Chávez has described his eight years in power as a transition and promised a more radical phase , inspired partly by Fidel Castro 's Cuba , if he wins another term in an election next month .
Polls predict a landslide .
Alberto Garrido , a historian and leading pundit , said there was revolutionary intent but that an Americanised consumer culture in love with baseball , McDonald 's and designer labels obliged the government to tread cautiously .
A notable example is golf .
In August the mayor of Caracas and presidential ally , Juan Barreto , threatened to expropriate swaths of Caracas Country Club and Valle Arriba golf club to build houses for the poor .
Three months later Chávismo has not conquered the fairways .
The vice - president , Vincente Rangel , scorned the idea and Mr Chávez , not wanting to pick this particular fight in the run-up to an election , said not a word , leaving the mayor to fight a lonely battle against the clubs ' lawyers .
Caracas Country Club , founded in 1918 and with 8,000 well - heeled members , went on the offensive last week by claiming the expropriation threat was based on fraudulent documents .
" We feel it will be resolved rationally , we are confident in the rule of law , " said the club president , Fernando Zozaya .
Asked about the revolution Mr Zozaya was wary , not wanting to provoke the government .
" Let 's say it 's a very special type of socialism . "
The three businessmen lunching in the courtyard were more explicit in mocking it as empty bluster .
" It has n't touched my work , I 'm left alone , " said one .
That did not stop them loathing Mr Chávez , whom they blamed for inflation , crime , corruption and a climate of intolerance which blocks government critics from state jobs .
Tellingly , none of the trio wanted to give his name .
" You do n't know the way it 's going to end up so you do n't want to jeopardise yourself , " said one .
Stories abound of money being spirited abroad and of lobbying for US and European visas , lest hasty emigration become necessary .
A US opinion pollster , Alex Evans , said the boom was insufficient reason for the elite , comprising 5 % of the population , to support the incumbent .
" They just do n't like the guy . "
There is a paradox that the more Mr Chávez denounces the United States , which he calls an empire run by a devil , the closer the countries ' two economies become .
Bilateral trade soared by over a third to $ 40 bn ( £ 21 bn ) last year .
Most was oil but it also included car production and financial services from the likes of Halliburton , a company linked to the US vice - president , Dick Cheney .
The fruits were on display at a Caracas expo of luxury vehicles and speedboats .
Staff at six stands interviewed by the Guardian all said business had never been so good .
" It 's ironic , this revolution .
The rich are even richer now , " said Rene Diaz , who was selling Humvee - type 4x4s which cost up to $ 150,000 .
The most popular drink at the bar was the most expensive - an 18 - year - old whisky .
" They do n't want the cheaper stuff , " shrugged a barman .
Recall , back in May of 2004 , a superficially contrite New York Times editorial staff admitting it published “ questionable ” information about claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , information that ultimately paved the way for the slaughter of 650,000 Iraqis .
In an rather unconvincing and apparently obligatory mea culpa , the editors shifted blame for publishing this blatantly false and obvious propaganda , more accurately described as neocon spawned fairy tales , to convicted embezzler Ahmad Chalabi and “ a circle of Iraqi informants , ” refusing to admit they were used as a propaganda tool by the neocons , described merely as “ hard - liners within the Bush administration , ” not psychopathic warmongers .
“ We consider the story of Iraq ’s weapons , and of the pattern of misinformation , to be unfinished business .
And we fully intend to continue aggressive reporting aimed at setting the record straight , ” the newspaper concluded .
Of course , the New York Times did n’t really mean it , as “ unfinished business ” would necessitate sweeping out the rogues and neocon agents ensconced deeply within its editorial offices .
One such rogue is Michael R. Gordon , “ the same Times reporter who , on his own , or with Judith Miller , wrote some of the key , and badly misleading or downright inaccurate , articles about Iraqi WMDs in the run-up to the 2003 invasion , ” notes Greg Mitchell , writing for Editor and Publisher .
Recall Gordon ’s absurd claim , following Colin Powell ’s theatrical dog and pony show held before the gathered at the United Nations in the orchestrated lead - up mass murder in Iraq , “ it will be difficult for skeptics to argue that Washington ’s case against Iraq is based on groundless suspicions and not intelligence information . ”
As we now know , and some of us knew at the time , Powell ’s evidence was little more than a donkey cart of steaming dung , rolled out into the public arena , offered as gospel truth , thus straining credulity , at least for those of us who recognized the stench immediately .
Gordon is at it again .
“ The Bush administration is expected to make public this weekend some of what intelligence agencies regard as an increasing body of evidence pointing to an Iranian link , including information gleaned from Iranians and Iraqis captured in recent American raids on an Iranian office in Erbil and another site in Baghdad , ” the seasoned propagandist is allowed to write .
As expected , the race is on to sell us another murderous pretext , thus demonstrating we are indeed a nation of chumps , although this designation would require we are fully awake , paying attention , and give a whit about the prospect of World War Four and what it means for our families , children , and neighbors .
As it stands , we are fast asleep , or half - awake , tuned in to the circus sideshow that is the untimely death of Anna Nicole Smith .
“ U.S. military commanders in Iraq have shown members of Congress explosive devices that bear Iranian markings as evidence Tehran is supplying Iraqi militants with bombs , a senior U.S. government official said Saturday , ” reports Forbes , the business magazine founded by B.C. Forbes , a former scribe for Hearst newspapers , the media empire infamous for publishing lies that helped facilitate a handy pretense for the Spanish - American War .
In normal , non-Bushzarro times , with a semi-cognizant public in attendance , the fact this “ evidence ” is vetted by Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , a congressional cheerleader for Israeli and American war crimes nonpareil , would be highly suspect , to say the least .
“ One of the lawmakers , independent Sen .
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , said he has seen some of the evidence , though he would not be specific .
‘ I ’m convinced from what I ’ve seen that the Iranians are supplying and are giving assistance to the people in Iraq who are killing American soldiers , ’ said Lieberman , who was attending an international security conference in Munich , ” a one - worlder confab “ devoted to the 50th anniversary of the European Union , ” according to RIA Novosti .
Of course , as we are well into the Bushian era , or rather the neocon era , few take note of this particularly egregious conflict of interest , least of all the corporate media , inheritors of the Hearst “ yellow journalism ” legacy .
So - called “ national security officials ” are about ready to proffer “ materials , ” said to consist of in part “ slides and 2 inches of documents , ” providing “ evidence ” of “ Iran ’s role in supplying Iraqi militants with highly sophisticated and lethal improvised explosive devices and other weaponry , ” never mind the nagging question of why exactly Iran would collude with the Iraqi resistance , composed in large part of former enemies .
“ The assertions have been met with skepticism by some lawmakers still fuming over intelligence reports used by the administration to propel the country to war with Iraq in 2003 .
In fact , a report this week by the Pentagon ’s internal watchdog criticized prewar assertions by the Defense Department about al - Qaida ’s connections to Iraq , ” thus “ there is some disagreement about how much to make public to support the administration ’s case , ” in other words , the neocons will need more time to tweak their fairy tale and make it more palatable to “ lawmakers still fuming , ” mostly over the fact they were hornswoggled .
Naturally , such considerations serve only as a minor irritant for the neocons , who will , regardless of what Congress and the American people think , push on with the Iran attack .
As the Guardian reports , the neocons are antsy to get moving with their mass murder campaign , blaming Bush for apparent reluctance , if such can be believed .
For instance , Meyrav Wurmser , wife of David Wurmser , the neocon accused of spying for AIPAC at the behest of Israel , “ is disappointed with the response of the Bush administration so far to Iran and said that if the aim of US policy after 9/11 was to make the Middle East safer for the US , it was not working because the administration had stopped at Iraq . ”
Of course , she really means making the Arab and Muslim Middle East “ safer ” for Israel , as Ms. Wurmser is a Revisionist - Herut - Likud “ scholar ” and co-founder and director of the Middle East Media Research Institute , along with Colonel Yigal Carmon , formerly of Israeli military intelligence .
MEMRI specializes in mistranslating Arabic and Farsi , most notably the speeches of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , thus preparing the groundwork for an attack designed to kill Iranian toddlers and grandmothers .
Another blood - thirsty neocon , Josh Muravchik , purportedly a “ Middle East specialist ” at the American Enterprise Institute , the criminal organization where Bush gets his “ minds , ” is “ among its most vocal supporters of such a strike ” against Iran , although of late he has voiced frustration with the Bushites , as has Wurmser .
“ The Bush administration have said they would not allow Iran nuclear weapons .
That is either bullshit or they mean it as a clear code : we will do it if we have to .
I would rather believe it is not hot air . ”
In lieu of an attack , Muravchik and Wurmser advocate meddling in Iranian domestic affairs , unleashing officially declared terrorist groups against the Iranian people , including Mujahideen-e Khalq , the wacky Marxist cult led by husband and wife team Massoud and Maryam Rajavi .
In the 1970s , MEK killed U.S. military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Tehran , not that Dr. Wurmser and Josh Muravchik can be bothered by such niggling details , as their primary focus is Israel , not America .
Finally , as if to demonstrate hysterical propaganda here in the heartland knows no bounds , the Associated Press tells us Iran school kids are being trained as suicide bombers .
“ Textbooks used in Iranâ € ™s schools are instilling students with hatred toward the West , especially the United States , and urging them to become ‘ martyrs ’ in a global holy war against countries perceived to be enemies of Islam , a new study says , ” the news agency reports .
“ The books emphasize the teachings of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and repeatedly refer to the United States as the ‘ Great Satan ’ and to Israel as ‘ the regime that occupies Jerusalem , ’ said the study by the Israel - based Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace , ” described as “ a shadowy pro-Israel group ” by the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee .
Normally , such obvious propaganda would be discarded out of hand , but then , as the New York Times demonstrates , the point here is not objectivity and unbiased reportage , but rather greasing the skids for an attack leveled against Iran .
No doubt , after the attack , the New York Times may once again admit it was used , although the neocons guilty will likely remain on staff , as they did after the invasion of Iraq .
In January 2004 a crew of CIA agents checked into the five - star Marriott Son Antem golfing resort in Palma for a well - deserved rest .
The agents had just flown from Rabat in Morocco to Afghanistan and back to Algeria - a gruelling 8,000 - mile journey - and were looking forward to luxuriating in the hotel 's spa where , as the brochure put it , they could " journey to deep inner peace " .
But as the crew were basking in comfort at US taxpayers ' expense there was little peace for their cargo .
In the hold on that day was Benyam Mohammed , a former Guantánamo Bay detainee alleged to be one of the world 's most dedicated jihadists .
In Morocco , Mohammed would later allege , he had been doused in hot liquids , subjected to incessant loud noise and had his penis slashed with a scalpel .
The details of Mohammed 's treatment emerges in Ghost Plane , a new book by investigative journalist Stephen Grey describing the CIA 's clandestine system of international terrorist transfers known as extraordinary rendition .
The Marriott Son Antem was not the only luxury hotel in Palma frequented by CIA agents .
The rendition crews also liked to stop off at the Gran Melia Victoria , a five - star hotel in the centre of the Majorcan capital .
On one occasion , they ordered three bottles of fine Spanish wine , and five crystal glasses from Mallorcair , one of the plane 's ground handling agents - refreshments for the flight home , all charged to the CIA 's bill .
Agents displayed a similar taste for luxury in Milan where Italian prosecutors accuse the CIA of involvement in the seizure and rendering of Abu Omar , a radical Egyptian cleric , to Cairo in 2003 .
Italian investigators found the CIA agents spent nearly $ 150,000 ( £ 80,000 ) on accommodation .
Two spent nearly $ 18,000 during a three - week stay at Milan 's Savoy hotel .
But the US secret service operatives ' indiscretions meant the task of the Italians investigating the kidnapping of Abu Omar was made simple .
CIA officers frequently called each other 's hotels and many of the 22 CIA agents allegedly involved had " frequent flyer " numbers or hotel loyalty cards so they could earn points during their stay in the Italian fashion capital .
Among itemised phone bills discovered by Italian counter - terrorism police was one showing 156 calls had been made to a landline in Milan .
This led them to the US consulate .
Another example of the indiscretions and contradictions in the US administration 's rendition programme emerges in its willingness to lavish money on entertaining the Syrians .
In December 2002 , Syrian president Bashar Assad and his wife paid an official visit to London .
They were guests of honour at the City of London .
But back in the Syrian capital , Damascus , on that same day in December 2002 , seven prisoners were languishing in jail , sent there by the US despite President George Bush 's view that Syria was part of an " axis of evil " with a legacy of " torture , oppression , misery , and ruin " .
There is clear evidence the seven rendered there by the US were brutally tortured .
One , Maher Arar , abducted with the help of Canada , was freed after more than nine months when he signed a false confession that he had trained at a camp in Afghanistan .
For Mr Arar , the contrast between his treatment and the Syrian president 's is likely to be a bitter pill to swallow .
Get enchanted by a aluminium foil ship floating above ground on hexafluorid ( gas significantly denser than air ) at the Physikshow of the University of Bonn !
What they have is Sulfur hexafluoride .
Itâ€™s 5.11 times as dense as air .
Itâ€™s non toxic , although itâ€™s byproducts can be extremely dangerous .
Another interesting point is that inhaling this gas will make your voice sound deeper .
Sound does not travel as fast in this medium .
Helium can transmit sound very rapidly , hence making your voice squeaky .
The explanation that came with this on YouTube says : I looked on the Really Weird Materials site Alex posted earlier , but found no explanation of â€œhexafluoridâ€ .
I Googled the word , and found plenty of documentation , none of it in English , at least what a non-scientist would understand .

Tiny planetary system orbiting between Mars and Jupiter 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A UC Berkeley astronomer and his French colleagues have discovered what must be the smallest planetary system of them all , an asteroid with two tiny moons existing amid all the countless billions of asteroids circling the sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter -- and the delighted scientists are guessing there may be as many as 10 more moons as yet undiscovered around the same asteroid .
The group , scanning the sky with a huge telescope in Chile and the latest in high - tech optics , have calculated and clearly observed two of the asteroid 's moons whirling around it in widely separated orbits .
A report on their triple asteroid discovery is being published today in the journal Nature .
The scientists ' story is a neat one , harking back to the origins of our own solar system and the formation of planets ; it 's also an example of how star - gazing these days can be accomplished by computer links to distant telescopes without ever leaving home base .
Berkeley research astronomer Frank Marchis , leading a group at the Paris Observatory , spent six months last year scanning a group of asteroids large enough to be considered minor planets .
Marchis ultimately focused in on one object known as 87 Sylvia with a telescope run by the European Southern Observatory high on a mountain top in Chile 's Atacama dessert .
He did n't have to go to Chile to keep watch : Data from the telescope 's observations flowed into the computers of his Paris colleagues , and e-mail relayed the data to his own computer in Berkeley .
Sylvia , with a diameter of about 175 miles , is one of the largest objects among the immense swarms in the asteroid belt .
Four years ago , planet hunter Michael E. Brown of Caltech and his colleagues used the Keck telescope in Hawaii to discover that Sylvia has one satellite barely 11 miles in diameter that circles its parent from about 860 miles away .
Brown 's discovery made Sylvia and its moon the 60th known " binary " asteroid in the sky , but Marchis and his colleagues examined Sylvia more closely , exploiting the high - resolution capabilities of a technology called adaptive optics .
To their astonishment , they found another tiny moonlet only 4 . 4 miles in diameter swinging around Sylvia at a distance of 450 miles .
" We first saw this triple system last March , and we could n't believe it , " Marchis said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro , where he is attending an international conference on asteroids , comets and meteors .
" We were really skeptical , but all of us did our own analysis of the data independently , and it took us a month .
Now , we think there might be as many as 10 more tiny moonlets in orbit there , but it will take a much more powerful telescope to find them .
" This is a big step in the study of asteroids -- it 's really enjoyable and more than exciting . "
The 87 in the name 87 Sylvia refers to Sylvia 's being the 87th minor planet ever discovered .
It was named for Rhea Sylvia , the vestal virgin in Roman mythology who was raped by Mars and bore the twins who founded Rome .
So Marchis and his colleagues named the two new - found asteroid satellites Romulus and Remus -- names that the all - powerful International Astronomical Union has officially accepted .
After calculating the mass and density of Sylvia and its two moonlets , Marchis has concluded that the mother asteroid is probably nothing more than a loose pile of rocky rubble -- more than half of it empty space with a little frozen water inside and all of the rocky bits held together by its own weak gravity -- weak , perhaps , but strong enough to keep the two small satellites in well - behaved orbits running in the same prograde direction as Earth 's moon circles us high overhead .
" It 's really a neat result , " said David Morrison , a longtime expert on asteroids who is the senior scientist of the NASA Astrobiology Institute at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View .
" And it 's wonderful what astronomers can accomplish using powerful ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics . "
The origin of Sylvia and its satellites is a story in itself :
It 's one of many so - called " rubble pile asteroids , " and according to Marchis , it must have been formed hundreds of millions of years ago .
Like other asteroids with single satellites , it apparently formed when two larger asteroids smashed into each other with such force that they burst into showers of rocky fragments , each fragment a mini-planet all its own .
Some of those small disrupted fragments began attracting each other under their own gravity until they clumped together by accretion and became massive enough to attract a moon -- or in this first - ever discovery , to attract two moons and become a full - scale mini-planetary system .
The story of Sylvia and its accretion , Marchis and his colleagues said in their Nature report , can yield " unique information " about the formation of our own Solar System -- a process that began in a vast swirling ring of dust and gas surrounding the sun more than 4.5 billion years ago and that continued until all the planets , their satellites and the asteroids had formed by similar accretion .

Talk about creativity .
Professional artists and poets hook up with two or three times as many sex partners as other people , new research indicates .
A study of 425 British men and women found the creative types averaged between four and ten partners , while the less creative folks had typically had three .
The more creative the study participants , the more partners they 'd had .
Previous studies have hinted at all this , and anyone mingling seriously with artists might have suspected as much .
But this is the first study to provide firm evidence , the researchers say .
What 's behind the results ?
It could be that " very creative types lead a bohemian lifestyle and tend to act on more sexual impulses and opportunities , often purely for experience 's sake , than the average person would , " said study leader Daniel Nettle , a psychologist at Newcastle University .
" Moreover , it 's common to find that this sexual behavior is tolerated in creative people , " Nettle notes .
" Partners , even long - term ones , are less likely to expect loyalty and fidelity from them . "
There may be an evolutionary reason , however .
The study also included some known schizophrenics .
And Nettle 's personality surveys revealed that the artists and poets shared certain traits with schizophrenics .
Again , perhaps no big surprise .
But these traits are linked with increased sexual activity , Nettle and his colleagues say ( though full - blown schizophrenic patients tend to withdraw from society and have less active sex lives ) .
Insofar as evolution is concerned , maybe teetering on the brink is a good thing , the researchers speculate .
" These personality traits can manifest themselves in negative ways , in that a person with them is likely to be prone to the shadows of full - blown mental illness such as depression and suicidal thoughts , " Nettle said .
" This research shows there are positive reasons , such as their role in mate attraction and species survival , for why these characteristics are still around . "
The results are detailed today in the academic journal , The Proceedings of the Royal Society ( B ) .

Are we what we eat ?
It 's a question we put to the test with the help of the UK 's leading scientists , setting up a number of experiments using the latest research techniques .
To assess the effectiveness - or not - of detoxing , we took ten female volunteers between the ages of 19 and 33 , who had been partying hard at a rock festival , and whisked them away to country cottages in Devon .
Five were put on a detox regime designed by a group of eminent dieticians , including Nigel Denby from Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte 's Hospitals in London .
The other five acted as " controls " and followed a normal , healthy diet .
The detox diet rules included : no processed food - everything to be made from scratch ; no added salt or sugar ; no tea or coffee ; no wheat , red meat , dairy produce , alcohol , squash or fizzy drinks ; and organic produce wherever possible .
Two toxicology experts from Imperial College ,
London , and nutritionist Professor Gary Frost from the University of Surrey checked over what we were feeding both groups .
We then investigated kidney function by measuring the level of creatine in the women 's urine .
Creatine is produced by the breakdown of a chemical in your muscles : a healthy kidney will allow a fairly constant amount in your urine .
We also checked the women 's liver function and gave all of them a blood test to find the concentrations of aluminium - a metal commonly used in takeaway cartons and kitchen foil .
Finally , we measured levels of key antioxidants ( vitamin C and vitamin E ) .
So did the detox regime cleanse our testers ' bodies to a superior degree ?
No .
Livers and kidneys were functioning just as well in both groups , while both also had similar concentrations of antioxidant vitamins .
There is no evidence to show that starving ourselves rids us of the toxins that we like to think are clogging our bodies : our liver and kidneys are the perfect detox machines already .
Most people lose weight on a detox diet simply because they have reduced calorie intake .
To help " cleanse " your body , experts advise cutting down on high - fat , high sugar foods and topping up with filling fruit and veg .
To reduce the amount of detoxing the liver must do , avoid alcohol and caffeine .
Is there any easy way to lose weight ?
Science shows that a slow and methodical approach to weight loss , with calorie control and exercise , is the best way to lose weight and keep it off .
So nothing new there .
But are there any additional steps you can take to help you slim down more easily ?
The latest research indicates there are .
• CALCIUM - in particular , low - fat dairy products - seems to help the body burn fat more efficiently .
In 2003 , Professor Michael Zemel of the University of Tennessee carried out a study in which half the volunteers consumed three small cartons of low - fat yoghurt each day as part of a calorie - controlled diet .
All the volunteers had exactly the same number of calories overall , but those who ate the calcium - rich yoghurt managed to lose 20 per cent more body fat .
There seem to be two sides to the flab - busting effect of calcium .
First , and most surprisingly , calcium has been shown to cling to the fat inside our intestines .
Together , calcium and fat form a substance very similar to soap that can't be absorbed across the wall of the intestine , so it passes out of the body .
The more calcium you have in your diet , the more fat will be excreted .
The second effect of dietary calcium is the more complex role it plays in metabolism .
As a rule , calorie controlled diets tend , unfortunately , to reduce the rate at which your body burns energy and slow down weight loss .
Calcium , however , seems to offset this effect - boosting metabolism and helping to speed weight loss .
You should aim for around 700 mg of calcium a day : 300 ml of semi-skimmed milk contains 360 mg calcium ; 1 canned sardine with bones , 115 mg ; 2 large tablespoons shelled prawns , 90 mg ; 1 large orange , 70mg .
• SOUP can help you slim .
On any weight loss programme , you want to keep your calorie intake down and feel full for as long as possible .
To do this successfully , experts recommend eating low - calorie soup .
Working with scientists at the University of Nottingham , we recruited 20 volunteers and prepared two versions of the same meal - chargrilled chicken and vegetables with a bottle of still water .
In one version , all the ingredients were presented solid on a plate and the bottle of water drunk .
In the other version of the meal , the same ingredients were mixed with the water and blended to make a soup .
Volunteers completed a questionnaire every 45 minutes for three hours - to let us know how full they felt .
Everyone who ate the soup meal felt fuller for longer , while MRI scans of the volunteers ' stomachs showed the soup did indeed fill the stomach for significantly longer .
Do party foods make children hyperactive ?
Most parents assume that children plus sugary foods equals raucous and uncontrollable behaviour - the dreaded sugar " high " .
But although a child can consume the equivalent of 20 to 30 teaspoonfuls of sugar at a typical children 's party , the " high " is a myth .
The body does n't use up all its sugar all at once : if there 's extra glucose available , it squirrels some away to have later .
True , blood - glucose levels will rise slightly and temporarily - but will soon be back to normal .
And even if the blood - glucose level is slightly raised , your brain does n't start working faster .
Brain cells have only one speed .
So if kids consume lots of cakes at a party , they may
feel full , even sick , but it wo n't make them hyperactive .
To prove the science , we held two carefully orchestrated children 's parties .
The first was a high - energy romp with an entertainer and music - but hardly any sugar .
When the parents dropped off their children , they saw plates of sugar - rich goodies that they assumed were for the party but were quickly hidden once all the parents had gone .
Two weeks later , the same children came to our second party - a calmer affair with storytellers and quiet activities .
This time , there was an array of sugar - packed foods presented to look like a healthy lunch .
After the first party , all the children were indeed hyped up , even badly behaved - despite the fact they had eaten little or no sugar .
After the second party , they were much quieter - even though they 'd had lots of sugary foods .
However , the parents believed the children 's behaviour after the first party had been due entirely to sugar .
In another experiment , we found that restricting children 's access to certain foods only makes them more popular .
So allow all foods - but teach children that some are healthier than others .
They need to learn that cakes , biscuits , sweets and sugary drinks should be enjoyed only occasionally .
Will drinking more water help your skin ?
We 've all been told that drinking more water is essential for good health and can lead to better looking skin - but is this myth or fact ?
According to a plethora of scientific evidence , you really do n't necessarily need two litres of water every day .
Research shows that your body will let you know when to take some more fluid on board long before you become dehydrated - and caffeinated and alcoholic drink , as well as the water that occurs naturally in food , all contribute to your total intake .
Can drinking more water make your skin look and feel more rejuvenated , though ?
The science behind your body 's water regulation system would suggest not .
You can't force extra water into skin cells to pump them up , for example .
To find out the truth and convince the unbelievers , we worked with two sisters , Susie and Alice , who usually stick rigidly to two litres of water a day .
Both girls lead busy lives , working and socialising .
We asked Susie to abstain from her water habit for five days .
During those five days , we then made sure both sisters ate and drank the same - apart from the extra 2 litres of water Alice drank each day .
We used a " triplesense " sensor to measure the women 's skin moisture content .
Using a sophisticated microscope , we also looked at their skin close up .
And we measured the colour of the women 's urine to gauge their levels of hydration .
Tests at the start and end of the five days showed that neither sister was dehydrated .
Both women 's skin was in great condition in both tests .
The only difference was that Alice had to splash out on an expensive two litre bottle of mineral water every day - and she probably spent more time in the bathroom .
Can healthy eating beat PMS ?
The big news in Pre-Menstrual Syndrome research at the moment concerns a clever combination of calcium and vitamin D .
Calcium is vital not just for building healthy teeth and bones , but also in a huge number of other vital body processes .
Vitamin D fulfils many roles , too - but most importantly , it helps your body absorb calcium from food .
Researchers have shown that calcium and vitamin D supplements can reduce the severity of PMS symptoms by half in just under 50 per cent of sufferers .
With the help of Nigel Denby , senior dietician at Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte 's Menopause and Women 's Health Clinic , in London , we devised the " Double D " anti-PMS diet .
The first D is for dairy foods - a good source of calcium ; the second for vitamin D .
And if the calcium and vitamin D combination works with supplements , there seems no reason why it wo n't work if the nutrients come from your food .
If you suffer from PMS , the Double D diet is well worth a try .
It can be used as an add - on to what you normally eat , with extra calcium from additional milk , yoghurt and cheese , and extra vitamin D from oily fish , margarine , eggs and cereal .
Every day , you should consume 1,500 mg of calcium and 20 micrograms of vitamin D from food .
Sources of calcium include : 300 ml semi-skimmed milk , 360 mg calcium ; 300 ml semiskimmed milk with 50g of dried skimmed milk powder added , 1,000 mg ; 150g pot low fat yoghurt , 285mg ; 75g Cheddar cheese , 630mg ; 75g Parmesan , 900mg ; 75g Edam , 578mg .
Sources of vitamin D include : 100g grilled herring , 25mcg vitamin D ; 100g baked kipper , 25 mcg ; 100g smoked mackerel , 8 mcg ; 100g canned salmon , 12.5 mcg ; 100g sardines in tomato sauce , 7.5 mcg ; 100g tuna in oil ( drained ) , 5.8mcg ; 50g low - fat spread , 2mcg ; large boiled egg , 1.2 mcg .
Is there a diet that cuts blood pressure ?
Current medical wisdom suggests that if you lower your cholesterol and your blood pressure , you will significantly reduce your chance of suffering from heart disease and stroke - two of the developed world 's biggest killers .
As a result , millions of people now take drugs called statins that reduce levels of " bad " cholesterol by up to a third .
We wanted to see if cholesterol and blood pressure could be lowered through diet alone .
Some scientists say you just have to say no to junk food , alcohol and sugary snacks , and eat the same basic diet as our ancestors did .
Archaeological research tells us that the human diet in 180,000 BC consisted mostly of vegetables , fruits , nuts and seeds , with a little lean meat and fish .
In other words , a high - fibre diet rich in plants and unsaturated fat and low in saturated fats .
We asked a group of junk food - loving volunteers to try out the " evo " ( evolutionary ) diet for 10 days .
Blood and urine samples were taken , as well as blood pressure readings .
After 10 days , our volunteers ' blood cholesterol had reduced by nearly a quarter and their blood pressure was down by about 10 per cent .
Eat like your ancestors
Aim to eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables , and at least five portions a day .
Reduce your intake of saturated fat : cut down on fatty meat , meat products such as sausages , hard cheese and full - fat dairy products .
Replace with oily fish , lean meat , nuts and low - fat dairy products .
• Choose oils rich in monounsaturated fats such as olive oil and rapeseed oil .
• Choose unrefined carbohydrates such as wholemeal breads and pasta , brown rice and wholegrain cereals .
• Watch your salt intake .
Avoid adding salt and choose herbs , lemon juice and garlic for flavouring .
Avoid heavily salted food such as bacon , cheese and crisps .

A six - part BBC2 series of the same name begins on January 11 .
In the first reported account of the event , Jamyang Samten , 15 , said he was among those who ended up being given electric shocks and forced to dig ditches " as a warning to others " .
Samten was in a 75 - strong group making their way over the 5,800 - metre - high ( 19,000 ft ) Nangpa La pass in September when Chinese guards opened fire .
At least two people , including a 17 - year - old Buddhist nun , were killed .
The incident was filmed by a Romanian television producer on a mountaineering expedition , sparking an international outcry .
Beijing had claimed the refugees were shot when border guards were attacked .
Of the survivors , 41 managed to reach India but 32 were caught and detained .
The teenager said he was interrogated over a three - day period during which he was repeatedly hit with an electric cattle prod .
" It went on until I fainted , " Samten told reporters , adding that police repeatedly asked him to identify the dead nun .
After three days the Tibetans were taken to a prison in Shigatse , Tibet 's second - largest city , Samten said .
They were questioned again while chained to a wall , he said .
" A guard wearing a metal glove would hit us in the stomach . "
Samten was held in a labour camp there for 48 days and forced to dig ditches , build fences and work on fields , he said .
Once released he paid guides to take him via Nepal to India where the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan leader , has been based since 1959 .
" He wanted to come to see his holiness [ the Dalai Lama ] and he also wanted an education in the Tibetan language , " said Tsering Ngodup , who works with the Tibetan refugee centre in Dharamsala .
The account could not be verified but echoes the stories of others who have made similar treks .
Lobsang Gyaltsen , who managed to escape when Samten was captured , said he feared for his family in Tibet .
" I do not know if they are safe .
We come here to learn about our language and culture .
These things are hard in Tibet where we do not have freedom . "
Gyaltsen said he had been walking for 17 days when Chinese guards caught up with his group , who had eaten little and spent days struggling over ice and rock .
More than 4,000 Tibetans flee to Nepal each year across the border , which crosses several of the highest mountains on earth , including Everest .
Supporters of the Dalai Lama claim China runs a repressive police state in Tibet .
Beijing regards him as leading a separatist movement from exile .
With a new railway linking mainland China to Lhasa , Tibet 's capital , Beijing has tightened its grip on the region .
" China has become emboldened over Tibet , " said Phunchok Stobdan , an Indo - Tibetan affairs expert .
" Nobody dares to raise the issue with them . "
UNITING BRANDS TO SAVE THE PLANET
Stephen Fern is on a mission to reverse climate change with the help of brands , consumers - and loyalty points .
A monster lightning strike , captured by a Herald reader during yesterday 's freak storm , narrowly missed luxury yachts owned by the likes of Nicole Kidman but almost wiped out a yellow sloop moored at Rushcutters Bay .
As the afternoon storm passed over the city , blanketing streets with ankle - deep hail , Gabriel Urbinaga snapped the bolt at the exact moment its zigzagging body struck the mast of the 22 - foot sloop .
" I was ... at the balcony watching the storm and as a matter of luck I took this photo .
I thought [ it ] could be interesting for you to illustrate the big rain , " Urbinaga wrote in an email to the Herald .
BEIJING , Oct. 15 — Chinese police officials have charged a prominent human rights lawyer with inciting subversion , part of a continuing crackdown on people who have sought to use China ’s nascent legal system to limit the power of the state .
The lawyer , Gao Zhisheng , was taken into custody in mid-August and was formally arrested on Sept. 21 , but the police only recently made clear the nature of the charge , said his lawyer , Mo Shaoping .
If Mr. Gao ends up being indicted and tried on subversion charges , it could mark one the highest profile prosecutions of an internationally recognized dissident in recent years .
China often uses the legal system to punish people it considers subversive .
But in recent years it has mainly sought to prosecute them for violating ordinary criminal laws , such as leaking state secrets , violating commercial codes , disrupting traffic or committing fraud .
Farmers sell tomatoes at a market near the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka , December 24 , 2004 .
Food scientists at Ohio State University in Columbus have grown a special variety of orange tomatoes that may be healthier than garden - variety red tomatoes .
The orange tomatoes contain a type of lycopene that is more readily used by the body than the type found in red tomatoes , they report .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Food scientists at Ohio State University in Columbus have grown a special variety of orange tomatoes that may be healthier than garden - variety red tomatoes .
The orange tomatoes contain a type of lycopene that is more readily used by the body than the type found in red tomatoes , they report .
Lycopene -- an antioxidant thought to have a number of health benefits such as reducing the risk of cancer , heart disease and age - related eye problems -- is what gives red tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables their rich color .
Dr. Steven Schwartz and colleagues had 12 adult volunteers eat two spaghetti test meals on separate occasions .
One meal was made with sauce from the orange tomatoes and the other with sauce from red tomatoes .
For 13 days before the test meals , the volunteers avoided eating tomatoes or food made with them .
Blood samples taken from each subject right before the spaghetti meals and every hour or two up to 10 hours after the meals were analyzed for lycopene content .
Results showed that lycopene absorption from the orange tomato sauce was 2.5 times higher than that absorbed from the red tomato sauce .
Blood lycopene levels spiked about 5 hours after the orange tomato sauce meal and at this time the levels were some 200 times higher than those seen after the red tomato sauce meal .
“ While red tomatoes contain far more lycopene than orange tomatoes , most of it is in a form that the body does n’t absorb well , ” Schwartz , a professor of food science and technology at Ohio State , explained in a university - issued statement .
“ The people in the study actually consumed less lycopene when they ate sauce made from the orange tomatoes , but they absorbed far more lycopene than they would have if it had come from red tomatoes , ” he noted .
The orange tomatoes are not readily available at grocery stores ; they were grown at an Ohio State - affiliated agricultural research center .
Schwartz and colleagues suggest that interested consumers could seek out orange or gold - colored heirloom tomatoes as an alternative -- although they have n’t tested how much or what kind of lycopene these varieties contain .

Back in the day when I was growing up , my mom taught me all of those little things that any young lady should know :
How to sew a button on a shirt , knit a scarf , clean a house from top to bottom , and so on .
I thought she had covered everything , but she left out two things that ended up being of great importance - cooking and money .
As I approach 40 , I still ca n’t make my way around a kitchen , but I did teach myself to make a mean macaroni and cheese , as well as quite a bit about money and finance .
Personal finance can sometimes seem maddingly complex , but it does n't have to be ; knowledge of some basic principles will make your life much , much easier .
Why parents do n't teach us how to pay the bills , how to apply and use same day payday loan or what are mortgage payments ?
So , achieve financial literacy by yourself .
The Very Basics
Spend Less than You Earn .
This may seem like a bit of common sense to many , but it really is an issue when it comes to trying to save money .
The term “ Champagne Taste on a Beer Budget ” comes from this area of finances , as there are hundreds of thousands of folks that just spend way more money than they bring in , with the help of credit cards , car payments and other personal loans from financial institutions that see you as nothing more than a dollar sign .
Cutting spending habits and / or aiming for a large pay increase are the only two options available to help you .

Cutting spending habits and / or aiming for a large pay increase are the only two options available to help you .
Pay Yourself First .
Financial expert David Bach , author of Start Late , Finish Rich tells everyone to throw out the dreaded “ family budget ” for this simple reason :
It does n’t work - if it did we ’d all be doing it and we ’d all be rich .
According to Bach , as long we all save a percentage of our pay each month , what the rest is spent on really does n’t matter .
If you “ Pay Yourself First ” , meaning that before you sit down to pay your monthly expenses , pay yourself in savings / retirement the equivalent of one hour per work - day ( or 12.5 % ) before anything else .
Buying a House / Mortgages
Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage before You Begin House Hunting .
When you put in a bid on a house , the seller looks at more than the amount you are willing to pay .
The seller will give more consideration to a lower bid amount that is already pre-approved by the bank than a higher bid without definite financial backing .

Pay Your Mortgage First .
Sure , your credit can go through the ringer , but you ’ll at least have a roof over your head .
Many first - time buyer programs require you to attend classes taught by financial experts , and this is one of the first things they will tell you .

Many first - time buyer programs require you to attend classes taught by financial experts , and this is one of the first things they will tell you .
Always Try to Pay More than the Minimum Mortgage Payment .
By paying one additional principle and interest payment ( mortgage payment minus any escrow payments ) onto your mortgage balance each year , you will knock 7 years off the life of your note .
It all adds up - to a lot !
Credit & Debt
Do n’t Try to Keep Up with the Joneses .
Yes , the Joneses next door might have a colossal house , landscaped backyard with a kidney - shaped , in ground pool and two 9 - series BMW ’s parked in the driveway , but they also might have $ 40,000 in credit card debt and owe on their three cars .
Giving into social pressures as an excuse to buy elaborate items is nothing short of silly .

Pay Off Credit Cards Before Other Debts .
The world of compounded interest is alive and well within the credit card industries .
While these companies love it when you only pay the minimum , paying a more than the minimum , no matter how much , is better than nothing at all .

Know that Credit Scores Affect More Than Interest Rates .
If your score is less than 620 , not only will you pay significantly more money for mortgages and other types of loans , but also more for your insurances .
Your car , life and auto policy premiums will all reflect your credit .
An adverse score may also keep you from leasing an apartment , or getting your dream job .

Keep Credit Card Balances Below Half of the Credit Limit .
Credit cards below the 50 % mark create higher marks on credit reports than those past the half waypoint of the limit .
Continuously “ maxing - out ” you credit cards is considered to be almost as bad as a few late payments .

Continuously “ maxing - out ” you credit cards is considered to be almost as bad as a few late payments .
Always Pay Credit Card Bills on Time .
Not only will you have to pay a late fee ( as much as $ 35 ) for not making your credit card payment on time , but that new fee could put you over your credit limit , which would , in turn , warrant another fee added to your balance .
And do n’t forget that your interest rate will most likely increase after all of these tiny instances , which will take it even harder for you to get rid of the balance .
Education
Community College Credits Transfer to Big-Name , 4 - Year Universities .
By hitting the college books at a close to home locale , not only are you saving money on the courses , you ’re saving a bundle on room & board .
After an associate degree is attained from your local CC , transfer the credits to your dream school - your bachelors degree will contain the name of your beloved higher learning institute , and you ’ll have saved over $ 50,000 .

Take Advantage of National College Savings Programs for FREE Money .
U - Promise , among others , is a medium between corporate moneymakers looking for tax breaks and you , the consumer looking for ways to save money for college for yourself or your kids .
Take advantage of it , but do n’t be sucked into buying items that you wo n’t use , do n’t need , or are more expensive than you normally buy .
If you habitually buy the soda brand that ’s on sale at the supermarket , do n’t not - buy it because of the U - Promise tag - it ’s just not worth it .
General Spending
Avoid the 20 % “ Fool ’s Tax ” - Do n’t Buy a Brand New Vehicle .
As soon as you drive a brand new vehicle off the lot , it ’s value drops 10 - 15 % .
Depending on the make and model of the car , the depreciation will continue to drop an additional 10 % by year ’s end and each year after for the next two years .
By purchasing a previously owned or leased vehicle either a year or two old , you ’ll still have a quality auto with available warranty while letting someone else take the major financial hit .

Buy Certain Everyday Items Used .
DVD ’s , CD ’s , books and sports equipment can each cost significantly less bought used than if purchased new .
If you do n’t have a good used book or CD shop nearby , there are thousands of them on the Internet .
Of course , you ’ll need to calculate shipping and handling into the price to be sure if you ’re truly saving money .

Do n't Waste Too Much Time with Coupons .
Take , for example , coupons .
Although these little slips of paper can add up to save you a few dollars a week ( ever more if you shop at a store that offers “ double coupons ” ) , ask yourself a few questions before busting out the scissors .
First , do you need it ?
Second , is it something that you and / or your family will use ?
Thirdly , is there a comparable item , possibly generic , that ’s cheaper without the coupon ?
If you were planning on buying an item and have a coupon , great !
But if not , do n’t even bother - it ’s money spent on something you do n’t need , which is considered to be a waste .

If you NEED to Buy Designer Clothes , Buy them Second Hand .
Clothes do not increase in value , no matter what anyone tells you .
The only millionaires that sport the brand name gear are those who designed it .
Celebrities and those in the public eye that are wearing a particular name across their chest are being paid to do so and more than likely received the clothing for free .
The designers are hoping that you ’ll see your favorite star in their brand and run out and buy some for yourself .

Always Shop Off - Season .
When you want a new patio set , buy it towards the end of the summer ( after the 4th of July ) and you ’ll pay roughly half of what you would have at the beginning of the season .
The same goes for clothes and shoes , including for the kids .
By stocking up during clearance time , you can save yourself a bundle of cash over purchases at peak times .
Health
Do n’t Skimp on Healthcare .
Of all the ways to save money on monthly expenses , cutting your healthcare is the worst idea .
Saving a few hundred dollars a year is hardly worth having to pay $ 50,000 in medical bills a few years down the road .

Prescription Coverage Is a Must .
Even if your doctor has given you a clean bill of health , you just do n’t know what could happen - and with the rising costs of medicine , you very well be stuck with $ 200 of necessary meds at any given moment .
Insurance ( Auto & Homeowners )
Ask for Discounts .
Many insurers wo n’t volunteer discounts like multi-policy , safe driver and good - grade deductions on your premium , but will be “ reminded ” when you mention it , so do n’t be afraid to ask .

Do n’t File Small Claims on your Homeowners or Auto Insurance Policy .
Too many small claims on a policy ( at or slightly above the deductible ) will send up a red flag to your insurer - when renewal time comes around , you might just get a cancellation notice in the mail .

Higher Deductibles on Home and Auto Policies are Usually a Good Idea .
You want to try to save these types of insurance for the “ big stuff ” like a fire ( on either ) , not a smashed window that will cost less to repair than your deductible ( see previous entry ) .
You can figure on about a 25 % savings when raising your deductible from $ 500 to $ 1,000 .

Shop Around for New Auto and Homeowner Insurance Every 3 Years .
Your car is getting older , so the cost to replace it is dropping .
Ergo , some parts of your insurance premium should be dropping to coincide .
However , some insurers do n’t look at it this way and insist on increasing your premium .
Shopping around for a new insurance company and policy from a fresh - eyed agent might just yield a lower payment for you .
Investing
Do n’t Even Bother Trying to Pick and Choose Stocks .
Picking stocks for the sake of picking stocks is a poor investment decision , to say the least , as 80 % of fund managers can't beat the S&P after expenses .
If you ’re going to buy into funds , you need to keep the costs low from every possible angle .
Warren Buffet , investment guru , suggests ETFs and index funds to individual investors wanting to maximize their money .

Keep Some of Your Investments in Liquid Assets .
You ’re going to need to keep some of your investments somewhat close to home in case of an emergency , like in a Certificate of Deposit or other no-risk investment .

Check out Commission Rates for Potential Financial Advisors .
Some financial products out there come with high costs and commissions - paid by you , the investor , to the fast talking advisors who sell them .
The high commissions involved can unfortunately steer some advisors to sell some unworthy products , leaving you , the investor , alone and out in the cold .
Ideally , you do n't pay a commission to a financial advisor , at all ; instead , hire for a fee - only planner .

If You Don’t Understand an Investment Product , Avoid It .
Not understanding where your money is going to go does n’t mean that you ’re stupid .
Do n’t try and act like you know what ’s going on when you really do n’t ; in the end , you could lose money - and then you ’ll be stupid .

There ’s a Big Difference between Saving and Investing .
While saving money is something that should be done regardless ( rainy day savings , retirement , etc. ) , investing should be done when you are relatively debt - free , especially when it comes to credit card debt .
The 18 % annual interest paid by you on credit card balances will be hardly made up for in any investment opportunity .
Life Insurance
When Applying for Life Insurance , Answer all Questions Honestly .
Paying a bit more now to accommodate for your skydiving hobby is much better than having your family ’s claim on your policy denied when your chute does n’t open .

Buy Life Insurance with the Hopes of Never Using it Life insurance should be purchased to help care for your dependants in the unfortunate event of your untimely passing - and that ’s all .
Mortgage payments , groceries and a college fund should be the goals , not making your family millionaires .

Keep Life Insurance and Investments Separate
The commissions and fees for “ Whole Life ” life insurance policies can rack up quickly - and guess who ’s paying for it ?
( Hint : It ’s not the insurer ) .
Buy yourself about 5 years salary worth of term - life insurance and take the difference from what you would have paid for a whole policy and invest it into some index funds or ETFs .

Never , Ever , Under Any Circumstances
Take a Cash Advance on a Credit Card .
Not only will you pay a ridiculous interest rate on the cash you withdraw , you ’ll pay fees - and interest on those fees - for the remaining years on your new , giant–sized , credit card balance .

Stay Away from Cash Advances / Payday Loans .
At a national average fee of $ 18 per $ 100 borrowed for each 2 week period , the annual interest rate calculates well into the triple digits .
To put it another way : it ’s cheaper to borrow money from the Mafia .
Retirement
Do n’t Count on Social Security .
By the time the tail - end of the baby - boomers retire in about 25 years ( the last of this generation was born in 1968 ) , there is n’t a very good chance that social security will be paying out as much as we have paid in .
A solid back - up plan , like a tax - deferred IRA or 401K will help to keep you from living in a shelter .

If Your Employer Matches 401K Invesments , Absolutely Get the Entire Match .
This is FREE money that your employer is giving to you towards your retirement , but they wo n’t give a dime out until they see you putting money in it , too .
Plus , 401K paycheck deductions are usually pre-tax , so you 're getting even more free money .
And you can raid this money before retirement , without penalty , when you buy your first house .

Getting a Part - time Job for Retirement Helps More than Your Finances .
Besides the fact that you can make up to $ 17,000 per year without having your Social Security check docked , getting out and earning an income , seeing people each day and basically being a money - making member of society will help your health , happiness and well being ( in addition to your wallet ! )

Do n’t Cash Out Your 401K
When You Change Jobs .
No matter how tempting it may be to pay off that credit card balance or car loan , you need to pretend that your hard - earned , 401K - money was never yours to begin with .
Otherwise , be prepared to pay heavy taxes and penalties , and work until your dying day .

The Feds Give Tax - Breaks for Retirements Savers .
The amount that you put away for retirement in an IRA is tax deferred up to a certain amount each year .
This means that your money is “ hidden ” from taxes on your annual income - for now , anyways .
You pay the taxes on any money withdrawn from the account only when you retire - and by then your tax rate will probably be minimal , anyway .
Savings
Saving Money is a Positive Habit , not a Negative Burden .
Parents who save money have children who save money , as long as the parents make a positive impression when it comes to the savings part .
A habit can also be considered an addiction - and an addiction to watching your hard - earned money grow is not a bad one , either ;-)

Save 10 Cents From Every Dollar you Make .
The 10 % rule has been around since my mom ’s mom , I think that it was just misplaced along the way .
If I would have saved just 10 cents from every dollar that I ever made , well …wow .

Always have an Emergency Fund Available Equal to 3 Months Pay .
Just in case of illness , auto accident or you ’re the victim of corporate downsizing , the 3 month rule should be enough for you to get through without having to dip into any long - term investments .
Taxes
Get Receipts for All Charitable Donations .
Tax deductions come in many shapes and sizes , but none quite as comforting as the one you get for charitable donations .
When you head out to donate your used clothing , furniture and knick - knacks , bring them inside of the building and ask for a receipt .
Keep all donation receipts together , make sure they total over $ 500 - ( anything under that does n’t require receipts ) and come April , you ’ll have an extra tax deduction .

Keep a Travel Log of All Work - Related Miles Driven in Your Car .
Any mileage traveled for work - related purposes above and beyond what you normally travel is eligible for a tax deduction .
If you normally travel 30 miles each way to work , and a meeting takes you 50 miles away from home , you can deduct the difference in mileage , or 50 miles - 30 miles= 20 miles .

Although it ’s not the greatest option , it is one if you ’re in a financial bind on April 15 .
By contacting the IRS with a written plan ( like $ 100 monthly until your debt is settled ) , it will still cost you some serious fees , penalties and interest , but at least you wo n’t have the feds knocking down your door .
One Final Tip
Money is Important , but It Ain’t Everything .
Health and happiness are the most important things in life , but that does n’t mean that you should be foolish with your money .
Fighting and worrying about money are n’t going to solve any problems and could , in fact , destroy your health and happiness .
A bit of planning , a common goal and some serious focus will help lay the building blocks for a strong and sturdy financial future .

Arguably , the first cooking implement created was the knife .
Knives were used for hunting and gathering , as well as for food preparation .
Skipping forward a few millennia , the knife remains one of the most important tools , if not the most important tool , in the kitchen .
As important as the knife is , I am amazed when I visit home kitchens , both in France and America , to find a plethora of poor quality knives .
Plus the knives are poorly treated , and their owners often do n’t know how to use them properly .
And my experience in professional kitchens has n’t always been much better .
Maybe my expectations are too high ?
After all , most knives are n’t sold with instructions for use .
And if they were , who would read them ?
No one shows us how to use a knife when we are young .
Maybe there ’s some instruction in a cooking class , but was the instruction correct ?
( I ’ve seen a lot of cooking teachers use knives incorrectly , too ! )
Maybe it ’s all a conspiracy of the “ Band - Aid ” cartels !
One proficiency that is required of French cooking students before they can apprentice in a restaurant is that they have excellent knife skills .
Often , they do n’t seem to know much else , but I ’ve been amazed at their abilities with a knife .
On the next few pages is “ Knife Basics 101 . ” I ’ll first review some knife anatomy and design .
That page is followed by one with a brief discussion of knife materials — which are best and why .
Next , there ’s my version of how to use knives — the most important part of this article .
Finally , there ’s some information on caring for , storing , and sharpening knives .
This is not meant to be an exhaustive dissertation on knives , but a highly opinionated overview .
If you have specific questions , please go to the comments section and send me an email .
If you ’d like specific information as to how to cut various fruits , vegetables , meat , poultry , or fish , check out Knife Skills Illustrated , my “ User ’s Manual ” for knives .
There ’s more to a knife than a blade and handle !
The tip of the knife is used for puncturing tough materials , such as the skin on some vegetables .
It ’s also used for cutting very thin items .
The most used part of a knife is the middle of the cutting edge .
It works best when the knife is moved with a forwards and backwards motion .
The best cut is achieved by moving the blade parallel to the cut .
The end of the cutting edge near the handle is called the heel .
The heel is used mostly for heavy cutting , or when maximum leverage is needed .
It is most efficient for making quick , coarse cuts , and for jobs which require strength or pressure .
Additional force for cutting with the heel is sometimes applied with the palm of the hand not holding the handle of the knife .
The spine of the blade should be smooth with rounded edges .
If the edge is n’t rounded , the user will develop a blister on the thumb - side of the forefinger with heavy use .
The bolster is a thickened portion of the blade just before the handle .
Bolsters are a feature of forged blades where the manufacturing process starts with a thicker piece of metal than when the blade is stamped .
Because the bolster tends to extend all the way to the cutting edge , sharpening the cutting edge all the way to the end of the heel can be difficult with many standard methods of knife sharpening .
Some chefs believe that the bolster gives a knife better balance .
The bolster also helps prevent the user ’s hand from slipping onto the blade .
On some knives without a bolster , especially those with molded handles , there ’s often a guard at the blade end of the handle that functions in a similar manner .
The part of the blade that extends into the handle is called a tang .
Better quality knives with riveted , two - piece handles have a “ full ” tang that extends all the way to the butt of the handle .
The extension improves the balance of the knife .
For knives with a molded handle , a round , pointed , rat - tail tang is used .
It is wholly contained within the handle .
Handles come in both natural materials , such as wood , and in molded materials .
Some modern knives are also being manufactured with hollow metal handles that are welded to the blade to give the appearance of the knife being made out of a single piece of metal .
Years ago , cooks only had a couple of knife designs from which they could choose .
Now , there ’re more knives of different designs for sale than one could ever need .
Still , for most cooking , a good , large knife and a good , small knife are all one really needs .
With a good , sharp , 26 cm ( 10 in ) chef ’s knife and a very small paring knife , one should be ready to conquer the world .
( Because my background is firmly rooted in Chinese cooking , I use a Chinese slicing cleaver instead of a chef ’s knife .
For a paring knife , I use a German mushroom fluter which I originally bought for carving vegetables for decorating Chinese dishes .
When working in restaurant kitchens in France , I use a chef ’s knife and a paring knife . )
When purchasing a chef ’s knife , it ’s important to remember that French knives have a straighter cutting edge than the German and American versions .
The French design requires less “ rocking ” of the blade when slicing to ensure that one cuts cleanly to the cutting board .
The French often use a “ bird ’s beak ” knife as a paring knife because the tip is at a better angle for peeling .
For example , when peeling an onion , where the tip is used to lift the skin from the flesh , the angle of the tip is slightly better with the “ bird ’s beak ” knife .
Other knife designs that I find useful are a serrated bread slicer , a boning knife , a filleting knife , and a ham slicer .
Because of the serrated blade , a cheap knife seems to work just as well for bread as an expensive one .
A boning knife is a nice luxury for boning small poultry and other meats .
The flexible blade with the smaller tip makes it easier to cut close to the bone .
For larger poultry , I still prefer a chef ’s knife , or my Chinese knife , because the heavier weight makes it easier to disjoint the fowl .
A boning knife is designed for cutting meat on the bone ; it ’s very difficult to use on a cutting board because the cutting edge curves outward near the handle .
What the boning knife is to meat , the filleting knife is for fish .
The thin flexible blade makes it easy to skin fillets .
The long , straight shape of the blade allows the user to use the tip of the blade to delicately separate flesh from bone .
The small handle — the same size as a paring knife handle — of a filleting knife helps to encourage a delicate touch .
The ham slicer has a round tip because only the center of the cutting edge is used with this knife design .
The sides of the blade have slight indentations that reduce surface tension between the blade and the foodstuff being cut .
This means there is less drag on the blade as one “ saws ” through the food .
I find it especially useful for slicing terrines and solid , fatty items like foie gras .
There ’re lots of other knife designs other than the six mentioned above .
It is possible to have a huge collection , but only a couple are really essential .
Most knife blades are made of steel .
( There ’re a few specialty knives made with ceramic blades — zirconium carbide and zirconium oxide . )
The steel blades can in turn be divided into three broad groups : carbon steel , stainless steel , and high carbon stainless steel .
Knives with plain stainless steel blades are usually inexpensive — which is good because they usually are dull when purchased and never get any sharper .
Food - service grade stainless steel is too soft to make an effective blade because it cannot hold an edge .
These knives were very common a few years back , but are available less and less ( except in the local supermarket or hardware store ) .
Knives with carbon steel blades have a number of advantages and a couple of disadvantages that have been their downfall .
Blades made from carbon steel , sometimes referred to as high carbon steel , can be sharpened to a very keen edge .
Carbon steel blades are not quite as hard as high carbon stainless steel so they must be sharpened more often .
The blades are also more flexible than those made of high carbon stainless steel .
Chefs who use knives with carbon steel blades swear by them , but they also know how to take care of them .
Carbon steel will oxidize — in other words , tarnish or rust .
These knives must be cleaned and dried immediately after use .
If not used daily , they should be given a light coating of vegetable oil to prevent oxidation .
Knives with high carbon stainless steel have become the standard nowadays .
Besides carbon , the steel is usually alloyed with trace amounts of chrome , vanadium , and molybdenum to increase its hardness .
Since these blades are slightly harder than carbon steel knife blades , they hold an edge better , although one that is n’t quite as sharp .
The edge is a bit more brittle , too .
This means that more care has to be taken to avoid bones and other hard materials when using these knives .
But these blades wo n’t oxidize — a major selling point .
At the other end of the knife is the handle .
Formerly , handles were made of wood or bone .
Today , most commercial knives are made of moldable materials .
Sometimes the handle material is attached to the knife with rivets in the old - fashioned manner , but often the handle is now molded in place .
There are still knives sold with wood handles , but these are becoming less and less common in the commercial kitchen .
Also , some of the high - end knives are now being manufactured with hollow metal handles that are welded to the blade and finished to give the knife a one - piece appearance .
I believe that the choice of handle material is largely a personal one .
The knife must feel good in the user ’s hand .
Also , finding a knife with a carbon steel blade has become very difficult in most areas , so high carbon stainless steel blades dominate the market nowadays .
I have found some high - quality knives with carbon steel blades in France , but even there they are becoming less common .
My biggest frustration with knives , the reason I started to write this article , is that watching people use knives incorrectly affects me like dragging a fingernail across a chalkboard .
I realize that no knife comes with instructions for use , but why ca n’t people learn to use them correctly — or at least the way I think they should be used ?
I believe that there are essentially three ways to hold a knife , depending on the knife and what is being cut .
For cutting against a board or the bone , the knife should generally be held with the blade between the thumb and the forefinger .
The other three fingers are used to grip the handle .
For cutting hanging meat , the knife needs to sometimes be held in dagger fashion for proper leverage .
For peeling and turning with a small knife , the knife is held by the fingers with one or two gripping the blade .
The thumb , in this situation , is used to support the item being cut .
Although some force is required when using a knife , by moving the blade parallel to the surface being cut , the force is reduced .
With this back - and - forth , parallel motion , food is sliced .
If there is no motion other than perpendicular to the surface , the food may be crushed more than cut .
The illustrations below demonstrate three methods of knife use .
When cutting small items with a large chef ’s knife , the tip of the knife is left in contact with the cutting board .
The knife is moved forward and angled down simultaneously to cut the food .
Once the cut is made , the handle of the knife is angled upward and the blade is slid backwards to its original position .
Once a rhythm is developed , it ’s possible to cut small , long items , such as green onions , herbs , chives , etc. , very quickly with this method .
Also , this method is best accomplished with a long knife blade .
A short blade requires too much of an angle when starting the cutting cycle to gain much speed .
When cutting larger items with a chef ’s knife , the blade still starts at an acute angle to the cutting board , but the blade tip is not in contact with it .
As the cut proceeds , the blade is brought parallel to the board as it is move forward .
At the end of the cut , the motion is reversed until the blade is once again on top of the food being cut .
Here a long blade is an advantage because more forward motion can be achieved relative to the downward motion of the blade .
This makes cutting easier .
When cutting or peeling small items with a paring knife , the knife is held closely with the fingers and the food supported with the thumb .
Although for some items , such as shallots , moving the blade back and forth makes the cut easy , care must be taken near the thumb not to cut it .
This is accomplished by stopping the back and forth “ sawing ” just before contact is made with the thumb .
SARASOTA , Fla. , Nov. 9 — A Democrat who narrowly lost the Congressional race here is seeking a recount after dozens of people reported problems using Sarasota County ’s touch - screen voting machines and a significant number of ballots had no recorded votes in the high - profile race .
The Democrat , Christine Jennings , lost to her Republican opponent , Vern Buchanan , by just 373 votes out of a total 237,861 cast — one of the closest House races in the nation .
More than 18,000 voters in Sarasota County , or 13 percent of those who went to the polls Tuesday , did not seem to vote in the Congressional race when they cast ballots , a discrepancy that Kathy Dent , the county elections supervisor , said she could not explain .
In comparison , only 2 percent of voters in one neighboring county within the same House district and 5 percent in another skipped the Congressional race , according to The Herald - Tribune of Sarasota .
And many of those who did not seem to cast a vote in the House race did vote in more obscure races , like for the hospital board .
More than 100 voters have told the Jennings campaign that their votes for her did not show up on the summary screen at the end of the touch - screen voting process , and that they had to re-enter them .
The candidate ’s lawyers said they feared that not everyone had noticed the problem or realized that they could re-enter the vote .
By Robin Lustig
BBC News , Santa Ana
In a season of programmes called Who Runs Your World ? , the BBC is examining the nature of power in the world today .
Here , in the first of a series of five articles entitled Looking for Democracy , the BBC's Robin Lustig examines " democracy " at work in five very different ways around the world , beginning in California .
Voters know prominent political figures but not their local elected officials
He is the man voters chose to look after the water and sewage services in a large swathe of Orange County , California , one of the richest places on the planet , and , arguably , one of the most democratic .
I say arguably , because it depends how you define democratic .
Yes , they have lots of elections - not only do they vote for Mr Miller , who runs the Irvine Ranch Water District , but they also vote for the people who run the local schools , and for the judges who sit in the courts .
So if lots of elections mean lots of democracy , then Orange County comes top of the league .
But in Santa Ana , the biggest town in the county , things do not look democratic at all .
' Underclass '
A third of the town 's 350,000 residents - some estimates put the figure even higher - are , to put it politely , " undocumented " .
In other words , they entered the US illegally , smuggled across the border from Mexico .
They have no papers , no official identity , and no right to vote .
When President Bush talks of spreading democracy and freedom across the world , is Californian - style democracy what he has in mind ?
Read Robin Lustig 's introduction to this series
Yet Santa Ana - probably the whole of Orange County - would collapse without them .
They are the gardeners , the nannies , the cleaners , the cooks , the waiters .
They are a bit like the slaves of ancient Greece , where democracy was invented : they are , politically , invisible .
Applying for legal residence and , in the fullness of time , US citizenship does not come cheap - a $ 1,000 ( £ 555 ) fine to change your status from illegal to legal - and then another $ 390 to become a citizen .
Mr Miller and his fellow directors are elected because their company has no shareholders - it is owned by its customers , the voters .
But when I stopped a random selection of shoppers not far from his state - of - the - art water treatment plant , they had not a clue who he was .
They knew President George Bush and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , but not Mr Miller , who provides the water that comes from their taps , and takes the waste away from their kitchens and bathrooms .
' Immigrant - makes - good '
Miguel Pulido , on the other hand - well , that is a very different story .
He is the mayor of Santa Ana : Mexican - born , smooth - talking and very much at home with the trappings of power .
On the walls of his office are photos of him with President Clinton and President Bush : Mayor Pulido is the Mexican - immigrant - makes - good story personified .
Pulido ( r ) is the Mexican - immigrant - makes - good story personified
And he is candid enough to acknowledge that life would be a lot simpler as mayor if he did not always have to stitch together coalitions to get his way .
When President Bush talks of spreading democracy and freedom across the world , is Californian - style democracy what he has in mind ?
Does he want the people of Iraq to elect their sewage officials , the people of Afghanistan to choose their judges ?
In his presidential inauguration speech last January he said :
" It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture , with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world . "
So perhaps Orange County , California , or something like it , is the future .

This is an instance of a general problem , i.e. , that algorithm +data structure analysis ( especially in searching and sorting ) has not tracked current hardware .
I include below a note incited by dealing with people scaling up hash algorithms without worrying about cache effects .
People looking for article or M.S. thesis topics take note : we need a whole lot of these to update the literature .
Algorithm Analyses * Must Change * to Model Current Processors OR " Time to update Knuth Volume 3 " :-)
John R. Mashey
A great deal of traditional algorithm analysis needs serious extension to cope with currenty and likely - future processors .
Many of the traditional and long - known results need to be modified , especially for searching and sorting methods .
Traditional analyses of in - memory algorithms usually assume that : - memory is " about " the same speed as the CPU , or close .
- items in memory have time - and location - invariant access speeds .
- items in memory have access speeds invariant with regard to the total number of items and their reference patterns .
These assumptions may once have been reasonable approximations , but are often outdated , and they need to be extended to better match current computers .
In the early 1980s , on microprocessors , these assumptions might have been appropriate , when CPU and DRAM cycle times were much closer .
Classic analyses count table probes , compares , etc ... but these days , counting * cache misses * is much likelier to be useful .
Most current computer systems use substantial cache memory hierarchies .
This includes mainframes , superminis , the popular RISCs , some PCs built with Intel 386 or Motorola 68030s , and all systems built with Intel 486 ( or later ) and Motorola 68040 ( or later ) .
In cached systems : - CPUs are rapidly increasing in speed , much faster than main memory .
It is already possible , in faster multiprocessors , for a cache miss to cost 100 or more CPU cycles .
This effect is likely to get worse , not better .
- Memory access times are affected by spatial locality , that is , accessing two pieces of data close together may be much faster than accessing two that are further apart .
For example , simple hashing with linear search may perform * better * than one would expect .
Even odder , for small tables , it may be better to do linear searches , touching only a few cache lines , than to hash at all .
- Memory access times are affected by temporal locality , that is , if an item has been referenced " recently " , it is much faster to re-reference it .
For example , in searching a tree , frequent accesses to items near the root of a tree are almost free .
The presence of caches affects sorting and searching somewhat separately .
Sort routines likely have more opportunity for affecting their own cache behavior than do search functions that must cope with potential cache flushing by other code outside their control .
You might prefer one kind of search routine if you think it is called often enough for some of its data to stay cache - resident , and prefer another if you expect enough other cache activity to have flushed its data .
-
Access times can be affected by the total amount of data accessed , that is , large amounts of data can cause cache - thrashing that adds substantial overhead beyond that of the algorithmic complexity .
For example , traditional analysis shows that it is better to hash items into a larger hash table to reduce collisions , but it may well be much better to keep a table smaller , so that it stays in the cache , and do a few more probes .
People who deal with scientific codes on cached machines have noticed the drastic effects on speed caused by ignoring the existence of caches , and there is even compiler support for reworking code to use them better .
[ KAP , etc ]
It seems time for cache hierarchies to start getting modeled into other important algorithms .
This will not be easy , but needs to be done to improve traditional results that no longer fit , and could easily generate hundreds of good papers .
For example , one could start with traditional analyses of searching and sorting techniques , then start asking questions like : - Given algorithm S1 , and memory system design D1 , and problem size N , show timing analyses as N varies , including comparisons with the traditional architecture D0 ( simple , fast memory , no cache ) .
- Compare algorithms S1 and S2 as above .
- Compare algorithm S1 as above , but for architectures D1 and D2 with different cache structures , cache sizes , memory latencies , etc .
At a minimum , one would like to compare single - level , medium - size caches against 2 - level caches , as both designs are heavily used .
One might ignore instruction - vs - data clashes for machines where they can happen , although this should be checked .
-
How detailed does the memory system model have to be ?
Can one get good predictive results with simple models , or need one run simulations in great deal ?
- Both cached and uncached machines are sensitive to inherent algorithmic complexity effects of size .
How strong are the additional size effects on cached machines ?
- Processors are designed by using data derived from running code , then designing the CPU to optimize across a range of codes .
Can algorithms be better designed to cater to a range of CPU designs ? -
Is there any help from compilers for these kinds of algorithms ?
Does compiler - controlled prefetching help at all ?
Does hardware data - prefetching ?
-
Can one return to some of the oldest models , where main memory was very small , and sorts and searches were quite aware of disk and / or tape ?
Do any of those give insight onto processor designs with longer memory latencies ?
As it stands , the programmer who follows the standard analyses that have worked for years may well encounter serious surprises on the heavily - cached processors that we now use .

For longer cache lines , adjust the base of the search accordingly .
This is going in the right direction , for sure .
1 ) I 've more than once complained that the typical undergradaute courses in " Algorithms and Data Structures " have become obsolete .
Many such textbooks do n't explain the effects of memory hierarchy , and many do n't even list " cache memory " in the index .
For example , KNUTH Volume 3 : Searching & Sorting seems way out - of - date .
( Hennessy says Knuth is rewriting it ... but I 've heard * that * before :-) ) .
2 ) There is room for a ton of MS theses to reanalyze the classic algorithms in the light of current and expected memory hierarchies .
3 ) Of the various things that program do , 2 are real killers : a ) Following chain of pointers with cache misses .
b)
Multi-way branching ( like a switch table ) , or loading a pointer to a function and calling it .
It is bad enough to have a ) with cache misses , and b ) is even worse , in that even a speculative - execution chip has great difficulty guessing where a jump is going and doing anything useful .
4 ) A few rules of thumb : a ) Count cache misses , not just ALU & load / store . b)
Wider structures are better than deeper , if the widths can be tuned to cache linesize ( David 's comments above ) .
c ) Current o-o-o CPUs can unroll loops for you , but ca n't outguess indirect pointer fetches .
5 ) Temporal & spatial locality : some strange interactions , even in uniprocessors ( ignore MP for now ) : a )
For some algorithms , you have a chance to " own " the cache for a while , i.e. , the faster sorts right now get tuned to the cache sizes , since you call the sort , and during the actual sort phase , there does n't have to be too much else going on .
b)
At the other extreme , no amount of caching helps : suppose you need to hash into a billion - element table : you have plenty of cache misses , and they do n't go away .
c)
In the middle , your results and algorithm choices depend on the rate of cache interference from other code , so it is useful to understand the frequency of calling , and the amount of conflict misses likely to be generated by others .
For example , you might use a hash table if you have a modest - sized table that is used often , as there is a good chance the table will end up cache - resident , but you might more likely use a B - Tree or similar setup if you have to cover much larger tables than might fit , but you at least have some hope of getting the intermediate nodes into the cache .
Some symbol - lookup functions might fiit in c ) , as do parts of OS code .
6 ) Of course , object - oriented code and CPU design seem to conflict a bit :-) -- - john mashey DISCLAIMER : < generic disclaimer : I speak for me only ...>

I 've been writing a lot lately about the different sides of content sharing , which for lack of a better word , we have been calling Web 2.0 .
In fact , just the other day , I blogged about Theresa Clifford 's article where she speculated that perhaps we need a few more experts amidst the free wheeling world of content sharing .
Well , today I discovered the ultimate in expert content sharing , a site calling itself the Open Courseware Consortium .
Here , you 'll find for free , full courses from some of the world 's elite universities , and according to this article in InfoWeek , there are plenty of others who are jumping on the bandwagon that have not joined the consortium .
The venerable Massachusetts Institute of Technology is among the participating institutions .
According to a blurb on the MIT Open Courseware Media page :
MIT Open Courseware ( MIT OCW ) makes the course materials that are used in the teaching of almost all MIT ’s undergraduate and graduate subjects available on the Web , free of charge , to any user anywhere in the world .
This initiative continues the tradition at MIT , and in American higher education , of open dissemination of educational materials , philosophy , and modes of thought .
Through November 1 , 2006 , MIT OCW has published 1550 courses .
How can you not like this idea ?
This is the ultimate in the free exchange of ideas , simply providing the pure intellectual fodder for you and you can do with it what you will .
Certainly , this does not give you the rich experience of the exchange of classroom banter between teacher and students , but for those people simply looking for professional development or trying to satisfy intellectual curiosity , this provides access to some of the top minds in any particular field .

Coach Das says Budhia could be a Guinness World Record holder
And Budhia
Singh is just three and a half years old .
When Budhia 's father died a year ago , his mother , who washes dishes in Bhubaneswar , capital of the eastern Indian state of Orissa , was unable to provide for her four children .
She sold Budhia to a man for 800 rupees ( $ 20 ) .
But the young boy came to the attention of Biranchi Das , a judo coach and the secretary of the local judo association .
Mr Das said he noticed Budhia 's talent when scolding him for being a bully .
" Once , after he had done some mischief , I asked him to keep running till I came back , " Mr Das told the BBC .
" I got busy in some work .
When I came back after five hours , I was stunned to find him still running . "
Siesta
Mr Das , also the president of the residents ' association of the run-down area where Budhia used to live , summoned the man who had bought Budhia and paid him his 800 rupees back .
Then started a strict diet and exercise regimen that saw Budhia adding a few kilometres to his daily marathon every few days .
A few stretching exercises for the marathon boy
In place of a few lumps of rice that he used to get at his mother 's place , he now has a diet of eggs , milk , soybean and meat .
He starts running at 0500 each day and does not stop till noon .
After a few stretching exercises , he has lunch and goes for a siesta .
At 1600 it is time to run again .
Budhia is enjoying his stay at the judo hostel .
" I can run and eat to my heart 's content here , " he says .
His speech is not yet easy to understand .
Though he has yet to go to school , he has completed learning the alphabet of Oriya , the local language .
Budhia 's coach has now set his eyes on a place in the Guinness Book of World Records .
That , he says , will be possible when he can run for 90 km at a stretch .
" I have no doubt whatsoever that he will achieve it soon " , Mr Das says .

Here are the 2 things you need to know about personal development and how you can use them to your advantage .
1 . You ’re human .
2 . It ’s hard .
Well duh you say .
Ok , let me start of by saying that I ’m assuming , since you ’ve come here , that you ’re interested in personal development .
I ’m also going to assume that you ’ve read something about it .
It ’s probably also safe to assume that you ’ve tried various personal development ideas .
And you ’ve probably failed at some of them .
Most personal development books make it sound so easy .
“ Just list your goals and work on the top priorities .
If you do that you ’ll be one of the best time managers of your era ! ” or “ Just 10 minutes a day and you ’ll have the perfect abs ! ” or “ Get a clear vision about your projects and you * will * achieve them ! ”
So you read this stuff and get fired up .
“ Yeah , I can do it ! ”
And then ….
nothing .
Sure , you may do something for a day or so but pretty soon after that you are n’t following through .
Maybe you missed a day .
Then the next day .
By the third day , the whole thing is entirely forgotten .
Then you ’re reminded of it some time later and it ’s like “ oh yeah , I should really do that ” and again it never happens .
The enthusiasm and passion to implement the idea has gone .
Your mind is n’t in the same state as when you were fired up .
There could be a number of reasons - often it ’s as simple as just being tired after a long day at work .
You get home and think “ I should do some work on that software app but oh look , my bittorrent client has just finished downloading the latest StarGate episode .
Hmmmmm , which shall I choose . ”
And the video wins most times .
Note that I said “ most times ” .
There will be those nights when you actually get on and do something productive .
It ’s these small actions that help build your personal development muscle .
It can take a long time but it will eventually prove fruitful .
Ok , so let ’s look at those 2 things you have to accept .
First , you ’re human - what does that mean ?
It means you ’re run by a bunch of desires that are very hard to overcome .
“ I ’d like to get out of bed early and go for that run , but gee it ’s nice and warm in bed … ”
At it ’s most basic level you want to gain pleasure and avoid pain .
And you have hundreds of conflicting emotions and desires .
You are not a robot that blindly follows a script .
Second , personal development is hard - yep , hard .
Of course , that ’s not what infomercials promise .
That ’s because no - one would buy “ Get thin in 20 hard steps that will take 5 years . ”
Open and honest people agree that it ’s hard .
Steve Pavlina says it on his homepage and discusses it further here .
Here ’s the important bit .
How can you use these 2 things to your advantage ?
On being human - if you accept that there are going to be times when you do n’t feel like working on your projects you can do two things - make sure that when you do feel like working on them that you actually do it !
Make use of those golden times when you feel great .
Second , set up brain - dead systems that you can work through when you do n’t want to do things .
I have a bunch of business stuff I need to do every month or so .
I ’ve made it easy on myself by writing HowTo lists for these tasks - completely brain - dead simple lists that tell me exactly what to do .
Click here , open this file , get this folder out of the filing cabinet , enter in this value there .
Get an envelope out of the drawer .
Write this address on it , etc .
If I make the task as easy as possible in this way , it cuts down on the pain threshold .
On being hard - do n’t get discouraged when you are n’t earning 1 million dollars in 6 months .
Have smart goals - you know , the realistic ones - Specific , Measurable , Attainable or Action oriented , Realistic , Time - bound .
Just because you exercise for a week and then do n’t follow through for another month does not mean getting up early and exercising is a bad thing that does n’t work for you .
Accept that this stuff is hard and try a different approach - maybe change the exercise or start listening to podcasts while you exercise so you do n’t feel like you ’re ‘ wasting ’ your time .
If that does n’t work , alter it again - buy a better alarm clock , place it across the room to make you get out of bed .
Just keep trying things and one day it will eventually click into place .
This is the point - it will take time .
You wo n’t get it right first go .
But with perseverance and trying out all sorts of personal development ideas , you ’ll eventually hit on those ideas that work for you .
And the great thing about personal development is that everything builds on everything else .
As you improve your discipline , you ’ll find it easier to take the time to write and review goals .
As you take more time to write and review goals , you ’ll find it easier to follow through in completing projects .
And on it goes .
Accepting up front that you ’re human and that personal development is hard will save you disappointment and give you the stamina to keep going to achieve your dreams in the long run !

Pune , Nov. 5
IF you are one among those who hold that Google is , by far , the best search engine around and you coincidentally believe that the US presidency of Mr George W. Bush is an unmitigated disaster for just about everybody on this planet , you might want to check this out .
Go to the Google home page , enter " failure " or , if you 're feeling particularly mean , " miserable failure , " ( but without the inverted quotes ) as the search term / phrase and then hit the `I'm Feeling Lucky ' key - not the ` Search ' key .
You 'll find yourself at >
http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html which is the page in the official White House Web site featuring Mr Bush 's biography and will be able to amuse yourself hugely reading about how the US President has worked with Congress to create an " ownership society and build a future of security , prosperity , and opportunity for all Americans " and about his conviction that the " strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of its citizens " - as against the country 's military might , presumably .
The interesting thing about this instance of " cyber - graffiti , " as The New York Times dubbed it , is not that it is there - but that it has been there since late 2003 .
Some insight into its persistence is afforded by the September 16 posting by Ms Marissa Mayer , Director of Consumer Web Products of Google , on the official Google blog site : " If you do a Google search on the word `failure ' or the phrase `miserable failure , ' the top result is currently the White House 's official biographical page for President Bush .
We 've received some complaints recently from users who assume that this reflects a political bias on our part .
I 'd like to explain how these results come up in order to allay these concerns . "
" Google 's search results are generated by computer programmes that rank Web pages in large part by examining the number and relative popularity of the sites that link to them .
By using a practice called Google - bombing , however , determined pranksters can occasionally produce odd results .
In this case , a number of webmasters use the phrases `failure ' and `miserable failure ' to describe and link to President Bush 's Web site , thus pushing it to the top of searches for those phrases .
We do n't condone the practice of Google - bombing , or any other action that seeks to affect the integrity of our search results , but we 're also reluctant to alter our results by hand in order to prevent such items from showing up .
Pranks like this may be distracting to some , but they do n't affect the overall quality of our search service , whose objectivity , as always , remains the core of our mission .
People take up Google - bombing for a variety of reasons .
By way of illustration , the linking of " miserable failure " with the current occupant of the White House has its origins in a programmer , Mr George Johnston 's dislike for the policies of Mr Bush .
Mr Johnston , as it happened , had been struck by a Google bomb that threw up a Web page made to look like a Microsoft error message in response to a search for " weapons of mass destruction . "
He decided to express his antipathy to Mr Bush 's policies by creating a Google bomb tying the US President 's official biography to the phrase " miserable failure , " watchwords of the presidential campaign of Mr Richard A. Gephardt .
In October 2003 , Mr Johnston created links on his blog ( oldfashionedpatriot.blogspot.com ) , tying the phrase to the Bush biography .
He sent messages to other anti-Bush bloggers , informing them of his project .
Many of them added the phrase to their own sites - and urged their readers to follow suit .
And so , Mr Bush was well and truly google - bombed .
Mr Craig Silverstein , Google 's director for technology , was quoted by Mr Saul Hansell of The New York Times ( Foes of Bush Enlist Google to Make Point / December 8 , 2003 ) as saying that the company did not see anything wrong in the public using its search engine this way .
" No user is hurt because there is no clearly legitimate site for `miserable failure ' being pushed aside . "
Mr Silverstein went on to point out that Google 's results were taking stock of the range of the opinions that are expressed online .
" We just reflect the opinion on the Web , for better or worse . "
Google 's PageRank algorithm works in such a way that a page is ranked higher if the sites that link to that page all use consistent anchor text .
A Google bomb is created when a large number of sites link to the page in this manner .
Google - bombing , incidentally , is quite different from spamdexing , which involves a dishonest attempt to modify HTML pages to increase the chance of their being placed higher up in search engine results or to influence the category to which the page is assigned .
According to some Web chroniclers , the first Google bomb was made perhaps accidentally in 1999 when Google users discovered that the query " more evil than Satan " returned Microsoft 's home page .
Can Mr Bush hope for relief at some point of time from being google - bombed ?
He can .
Ironically , Google bombs , like politicians , usually stop working when they become very popular .
They are written up extensively in the media - and consequently get knocked off the pedestal .
Brigit interviews Ali Sina Aug , 30 , 2002 1 - Could you elaborate a bit on your background , e.g. were you in Iran at the time of the Revolution ?
Can you talk about society under the Shah and why fundamentalism triumphed ?
I was already living outside Iran when the revolution took place .
I actually see the late Shah with his repressive regime as the main culprit of this whole mess .
He was a weak man , a paranoid and a despot .
On one hand he wanted to modernize the country but on the other , he had no regards for the opinions of the people .
Democracy had no meaning for him .
He created a secret force called Savak that terrorized the Iranians and acted above the law .
Iranians did not want fundamentalism .
They did not start the revolution to create an Islamic state .
All they wanted was to get rid of the Shah and his despotic rule .
They rallied around Khomeini because he was an obstinate man who stood against the Shah and to them he was just a name who could unite them against their oppressor .
But later the revolution was hijacked by Khomeini and the fundamentalists .
When Khomeini came to power he started eliminating one by one all his opponents .
In reality this group that is now running the country represents a very small fraction of the Iranians .
Not even 5 % of the Iranians support them .
They are there by killing anyone who criticizes them .
An armed man can take a thousand unarmed people as hostage and this is what has kept the regime of the Mullahs alive so far .
They have people as hostage .
2 . What made you leave Islam on coming to the West ?
What has been the reaction of family / friends to this apostasy ?
You have to realize that many Muslims or in fact the majority of them have strong humanistic values .
Unfortunately you do not see these values coming to fruition in Islamic countries .
They are nipped in the bud because the laws of Sharia and the teachings of the Quran are against them .
Unfortunately Muslims blame this on the “ fundamentalists ” .
Only when you read the Quran you realize that the culprit is not fundamentalism but Islam itself .
Islam is fundamentalism .
Quran is full of violent and bloody instructions .
If you have a conscience , no matter how strong your faith , you cannot remain untouched after you read the Quran .
This is what happened to me .
I read the Quran and I was enlightened . :)
As for my family and friends , although at first there were some negative reactions now most of them agree with me .
Muslims , especially the Iranians are going through a metamorphosical phase of soul searching and are questioning their beliefs .
3 . How big of a culture shock is coming to the West for a devout Muslim ?
It is a big shock .
Some of them overcome this shock and integrate in the society but some do not and instead seclude themselves in their own shells .
They start criticizing everything in the West and even grow hostile to their host countries .
They search for their own identity with their coreligionists and often they become more fanatical than when they first arrived .
I believe if this problem is not addressed soon , eventually it will become a major problem that could cause civil wars in many Western countries and we may even see the resurgence of Islamic separatist movements in Europe and America .
I believe that the Western countries must place more emphasis on integrating the Muslims and reshaping their values .
Muslims come from a different world with completely different values — values that my even seem inhumane and shocking to a westerner .
Take the example of honor killings taking place in Scandinavian countries .
4 . How afraid are you of attacks from believers ?
What kind of threats have you had ?
Well if you read the Muslim ’s comments in my site you see that there have been numerous death threats .
I will be a fool not to take them seriously .
You have to realize that assassinating the opponents was a an example set by the holy Prophet .
He used to sent assassins to eliminate his critics very treacherously in the middle of the night .
Among the dozen of his victims are Asma , a poetess and a mother of 5 small children and Abu Afak , a 120 - year - old man .
Their crime was to compose poetries criticizing the messenger of Allah .
This sunnah ( tradition ) of the Prophet has continued since those days .
Only the Iranian Islamic regime has assassinated hundreds of their opponents outside the country in recent years .
Shapour Bakhtiar , the last PM of the Shah was the most famous one of them .
5 . Why did you make it your mission to challenge the beliefs of Muslims ?
Because this belief is killing people !
Because it is a danger to the peace of the world !
If 70 years ago enough people had risen to expose the Nazism this evil would not have grown so strong and 60 million lives would not have been lost because of it .
Today Islam is a danger to human civilization far greater than Nazism was in its time .
This time billions of lives could be sacrificed .
We can avoid that if we stop Islam .
I do not see any mission worthier than this to live for .
If I am successful , no one will ever know me , and no one will remember me .
But if I fail the disaster would be incalculable .
6 . What kind of success have you had – are you just preaching to the converted , ie , other ex-Muslims ?
The response has been tremendous .
But I do not see that as “ my success ” .
This is an idea that its time has come .
A new movement is taking momentum within Islamic intellectuals .
I am not the leader of this movement .
I am just part of it .
This is the beginning of a renascence in Islamic world .
And yes you can say that I am preaching to the converted .
A Great number of Muslim intellectuals have already come to the same conclusions independently .
All I have done is to set up a site and a forum where we can come together , exchange ideas and experiences .
Of course there are many honest Muslims who still believe Islam is a religion of peace and it could be salvaged .
We help them dissipate this false belief .
7 . How responsible was Islam for 9/11 ?
Do you think that date was strategically chosen because on 9 September 1683 the Muslims were stopped in their conquest of Europe at the gates of Vienna ?
Whether 9/11 was strategically chosen or not does not change the fact that Islam is responsible for this dastardly act .
Only Islam can generate this much hate and this much senseless devastation .
As Pascal said “ Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction . "
This applies to no one better than to Muslims who believe in an evil religion . .
8 . How much of a turning point do you think 9/11 will be historically ?
Is it the beginning of the end of Islamic extremism or it is the beginning of a great ‘ clash of civilisations ’ ?
9/11 is the beginning of the end of the Islam itself .
Islamic extremism is a redundancy .
And for clash of civilizations you need to have another civilization to clash with .
This is going to be the clash of the civilized world with barbarity .
And perhaps the major impact of this clash would take place in Islamic countries where good will rebel against evil and humanity will eventually overcome savagery .
9 . Is Bin Laden simply following his faith more strictly and honestly than most Muslims dare to ?
How well do most Muslims know the Koran ?
Yes that is true .
Bin Laden and Khomeini are the real Muslims .
I challenge the Islamic apologists and those who claim Islam is a religion of peace to tell us what did these men do that was contrary to the Quran ?
They can’t .
But I can tell you that those Islamic countries that are not planning to invade other nations and claim them as Dar al Islam , that allow women the right to vote , that elect women as their Prime Ministers , that do not impose extortion tax on the Jews and the Christians , do not subdue them , humiliate them or make them wear distinctive badges , are breaking the laws of the Sharia .
The reason you see some humanity , some tolerance , some goodness in Islamic countries is because Muslims do not read the Quran .
They project their own goodness and assume that because it is good that is what Allah wants from them .
10 .
Are Bin Laden and his extremist views more popular among Muslims than they would have you believe ?
If you paid attention to the reaction of the populace in Palestine , Pakistan , Egypt and many other Islamic countries to the 9/11 tragedy you can fairly assume that unfortunately the answer is “ yes ” .
Even the Islamic intellectuals and apologists who on the surface condemned the 9/11 , did it with reservation and added a big BUT to their comments blaming America for a myriad of things such as support for Israel , causing poverty in Islamic countries , backing up dictatorial regimes , etc , etc .
They shifted the responsibility of the attack on America and somehow found it deserving for what happened .
11 . Are civil liberties in the West under threat as a result of largely Muslim immigration there ?
If Muslim immigrants do not integrate in the West and fail to adopt Western values , all our liberties will be in danger .
I see the spread of Islam in the West whether through immigration ; high birthrate or proselytism as a real threat to the peace and stability of western societies .
It is no secret that Westerners after they convert to Islam become ready , willing and able to kill their own people and loyalty to Islam becomes far more significant to them than loyalty to their own country .
A man who is so brainwashed that he would kill himself in order to kill a bunch of other people , would easily kill his own mother and father .
We celebrate life ; they celebrate death !
We have different values .
12 . Do people in the West take Enlightenment values too lightly ?
Is multiculturalism now a more popular ideology ?
I do not think multiculturalism works .
Muslims have different values that are diametrically opposed to secular humanistic values .
But the problem is that Muslims believe that it is their duty to impose those values on others .
You can tolerate Islam but Islam does not tolerate you .
Muslims are not allowed to take friends from amongst the non-Muslims ( Q.3:28 , Q.66:9 ) .
We would be fooling ourselves if we believed that the true Muslims would ever make good citizens in the West .
How can you be a good citizen and obey the laws made by Kafirs when your holy scripture tells you : “ So obey not the disbelievers , but strive against them herewith with a great endeavor ” ?
( Q.25:52 )
13 . Is Islam a ‘ Religion of Peace ’ as we have been told by Blair , Bush and others ?
Blair and Bush are politicians .
They are expected to be politically correct and say this .
But I doubt either one of them has read the Bible let along the Quran .
Even Gandhi said some good things about Islam and Muhammad .
Prince Charles also said Islam is a misunderstood religion .
These are all political talks .
These guys are not scholars .
Even if they knew the truth it would have been unwise to tell it publicly .
Islam is not a religion of peace .
This is clear to anyone who reads the Quran or reads the history of the expansion of Islam .
But a lie repeated often becomes true .
So Muslims bank on this cliché hoping that the uneducated westerners who do not like a religion of hate would buy into this lie if they keep repeating it .
14 . Why has there been no Reformation in Islam ?
Were there any Martin Luther types and why did they fail to have much impact ?
Do you see your website as akin to Luther ’s nailing a list of 95 objections on the church door in 1517 ?
There have been many reformatory movements in Islam .
Mo’tazalis were the first group of Iranian thinkers who gave precedence to reason when it came in collision with faith .
Sufism is another reformist attempt to reduce the violence of the verses of the Quran by attributing to them “ inner ” and “ allegorical ” meanings .
Throughout the history there have been many individuals who tried to reform the Islam .
But they all failed because Quran ’s teachings of hate are very clear .
There is no way to reform Islam unless one scraps the Quran .
The group behind Faith Freedom International does not see itself as a reformist group .
We simply do not believe that reforming Islam is possible .
And of course we do not see any point to preserve the name of Islam and the belief in a mass murderer , pedophile , rapist , plunderer , and assassin prophet .
Christ could be a mythological personage but he is a saintly personage .
There is nothing saintly about Muhammad .
If anyone behaves like Muhammad today , he would have to expend the rest of his life in Jail .
What is the point believing in a pervert man when you do not want to follow him ?
It is like trying to reform Nazism and make it a doctrine of love .
What is the point ?
15 . How much impact do you think Salman Rushdie or Ibn Warraq do or can have on Western Muslims ?
A lot !
The problem is to convince the Muslims to read their books .
Unfortunately Muslims refuse reading any book that can shake them up and jolt them to reality .
If you read the Muslim ’s comments on Ibn Warraq ’s book “ Why I Am Not a Muslim ” in Amazon.com , you can see that none of those who attacked him read any of his books .
That is why I opted for a website .
Considering the amount of the time I expend on faithfreedom.org it is , financially speaking , a foolish investment of my time .
But I hope some Muslims will read one or two articles because it is free and readily available and hopefully this triggers in them the desire to learn more .
In that sense the site has been very successful .
16 . How big an impact does the internet have in changing peoples ’ views ?
Does it have revolutionary potential ?
Revolutionary is the right word .
Without the Internet there is no way to reach the Muslims .
Books that criticize Islam are banned , writers and publishers are assassinated and a slight opinion that someone else may consider offensive could hand you death sentence .
Today we have two men waiting for their executions .
One is an Iranian journalist Mr. Aghajari who said ; “ people are not monkeys and should not imitate Mullahs in matters of religion ” .
The other is Dr. Yunus Sheikh a Pakistani professor who said ; “ Muhammad ’s parents were not Muslims because they died prior to the Prophet receiving his revelation ” .
Both of these individuals are Muslims and what they said is logical .
Yet Muslims interpret their comments blasphemous and call for their heads .
Now imagine how can you reach the masses of Muslims and say things so openly like what we say if not through the Internet ?
Islam has survived by suffocating any voice of criticism .
But the Internet has taken away that power from Islamic clerics and therefore the end of Islam is very near .
However my site is banned in most Islamic countries .
But if I get enough support I will start a radio to reach them in their own language .
Well , I keep buying the lotteries and you keep praying Allah , may be one day this dream will become a reality .
17 .
Why do you think faithfreedom.com was set up ?
Is it a confirmation that your views are getting through to people ?
What else it could be ?
The very existence of faithfreedom.com is proof that Muslims are scared of us .
They chose our name with dot com extension just to focus on us and refute us .
Yet just after a few months they removed all the links to our site .
Yes we are making a difference and they are concerned .
18 . How much do Muslims view their faith as an identity ?
Is that part of the reason they feel an attack on Islam is the same as racism ?
Very much !
Islam is being inculcated in the psyche of the Muslims from the childhood .
Muslims are asked to love and obey Muhammad more than their own parents .
All loyalties are to him and to his imaginary god who was an alter ego of him .
But that will change .
Once they see the truth , many of them will wake up and those very Muslims who hate us now will join us in our sacred cause to eradicate hate and the religion of hate .
19 .
How much of their Persian identity was lost by Iranians after the Islamic Revolution ?
Do you see Islam amongst non-Arabs as a form of colonialism ?
Historically the Persians lost a lot to Islam .
We lost our history , our libraries , our culture and the purity of our language .
But more importantly we lost our humanistic values .
Did you know that the first charter of Human rights was written in Iran 2500 years ago ?
But today the Islamic Iran is the main violator of human rights .
There is yet another loss that is not Iran ’s only but the loss to humanity .
One thousand years ago , Iranian rulers were tolerant and they allowed free thought to flourish .
The great luminaries of the so - called “ Golden Age of Islam ” are all products of that era .
Men like Ar Razi were so audacious that they called the prophets “ charlatans ” and praised Socrates , Plato and Aristotle .
Rationalism and freethinking became the vogue .
But Islamic fundamentalism cut the life of this Golden Age of rationalism short because the fundamentalists had the Quran on their side and they put a halt on freethinking , science and knowledge .
I cannot but imagine what would have been of science today if Islam was not a factor and freethinking had continued to flourish in Iran 1000 years ago .
What would be of the world today if centuries prior to Europe Iranians had reached the Renascence ?
When you study the works of Ibn Sina , Ar Razi , Khayyam , Al Farabi and others of that era you see that they were so close to Renascence .
But Islam slammed that door and the advancement of science was hold back for centuries .
This I believe is the biggest loss to humanity .
But this is all speculation , you say .
Yes it is , I say , but there is no reason to dismiss it .
But as for your question is concerned , amazingly the Islamic revolution and its failure ignited a strong patriotism among Iranians .
Iranian kids born after the revolution and even those of the second and third generation living outside the country have developed an insatiable interest to find about their roots .
Iranian festivities like norooz , charshanbe soori , and yalda have gained amazing popularity and they are celebrated like never before .
Very few Iranians put Arabic names on their kids although more than 80 % of the names prior to revolution were Arabic ( Islamic ) .
If you talk to jewelers they will tell you that it is rare that someone order Allah , Muhammad or Ali necklaces .
Today Iranians want purely Iranian emblems such as Persepolice , Cyrus ’s charter of human rights , etc. Iranians today are rebelling against Islamization by clinging fast to their Iranian identity .
So although many Iranians lost their lives and their wealth after the revolution , they never let their identity to be taken away from them .
The Islamic revolution in Iran should be marked as the beginning of the end of Islam in Iran and eventually the rest of the world .

Most Muslims reportedly saw the war on terror in Afghanistan as a war against Islam .
Is that because the Taliban were seen as strict Muslims with every right to run their country as they did ?
The truth is that Muslims do not care about each other .
If you let them they will exterminate each other .
But they cannot accept a Kafir attacking a Muslim , “ subduing and humiliating ” him .
That makes them go crazy .
Muslims believe that Allah has given THEM the right to invade non-Muslims , subdue them , humiliate them , enslave them , rape their wives and loot their belongings .
It is not acceptable to them that a non-Muslim country attack and humiliate a Muslim country .
Even if that Muslim country is their enemy she is still their Muslim sister country .
It is not that there is much brotherly love among the Muslims ; it is because the hatred of the non-Muslims is much stronger .
21 . Do you think most Muslims have a victim mentality vis-à - vis the West ?
( ie there were numerous conspiracy theories re 9/11 including one that held Mossad to be responsible ) .
That is the root of the problem .
Muslims are in denial of their own evil deeds and they justify all their violence against others by thinking of themselves as victims .
They are genuinely oblivious of the pain that they cause to others with their terrorist activities .
But as soon as one of their victims retaliates , they cry foul and play victim .
This will justify more acts of terrorism and fuel their frenzy .
They even blame the West for their own illiteracy , ignorance and poverty .
But they are unable to see that in reality the main cause of their misery is Islam .
22 . Does their belief that Islam is the one true faith mean that their suffering ( and the stagnation that generally affects the Muslim world ) can only be due to Western wrong - doing ?
( eg Zionist plots )
Of course , as I explained above it is always the fault of somebody else .
Even when they fight among each other , they blame the Western powers for instigating the other party .
But in all due fairness , even if this is not entirely true one has to acknowledge that in many cases the western powers have fueled the ethnic fights in the third world countries .
Unfortunately the United Kingdom still believes in the divide - and - rule policy .
And human rights have never had much weight for UK .
The Brits are born exploiters .
They love and support dictatorial puppet regimes such as the Islamic Republic of Iran because it is much easier for them to deal with a a few dictators than with a democratically elected government answerable to people .
It is a shame that a country with a history of democracy so old act so inhumanely in her foreign policies .
I can say with certainty that Iran never had an more formidable enemy than Britain .
One day we will reclaim our country and will remember who were our enemies and who were out friends .
23 .
If the Ayatollahs are overthrown in Iran and democracy reinstated will it force other Muslim countries to re-evaluate their commitment to Islamic values ?
How long do you think it will take for this overthrow to happen given the discontent that young people there seem to be expressing ?
Iran has always been the trendsetter in the Middle East .
Islamic Rationalism , Islamic Mysticism , the Golden Age of Islam , all have their roots in Iran , Rumi was an Iranian and even Ghazali the father of Islamic fundamentalism was Iranian .
The founders of the four Sunni schools of thought , Hanafi , Maliki , Shafi'i , Hanbali were also Iranians .
The collectors of the Hadithes were Iranians .
The rise of Islamic fundamentalism in our days is also originated from Iran .
Bin Laden admitted that he was inspired by Khomeini when the latter mobilized huge masses using their religious sentiments to overthrow the Shah .
Without Iran and Iranian contribution , Islam would not be considered a religion but a cult of a bunch of marauding desert dwellers .
Islam is bereft of philosophy , mysticism and otherworldliness .
Even the " Islamic " architecture and art are Iranian .
It is all thanks to Iranian genius that Islam is what it is .
But today Iranians have seen the real face of Islam and have come to their senses .
More than half of the Iranians do not call themselves Muslims anymore .
There is no doubt that when the present repressive regime is removed , Islam will become extinct in Iran in no time .
Iranians are learning about the real Islam and what it did to their country , from sources that are not liked by the Mullahs .
I am confident that even in this time Iran will maintain its historic role as the trendsetter and the fall of Islam in Iran would put in motion a domino effect that would lead to total eradication of Islam from the face of the planet .
The fall of the Islamic Republic of Iran is imminent , and the fall of Islam will also take place in our own lifetime .
Many of us shall see Islam ’s sudden end just as we saw the end of communism unexpectedly .
24 .
How much harm do you think the use of suicide - bombing ( sanctioned as ‘ martyrdom ’ in the Koran ) does to the Palestinian cause ?
A lot !
Palestinians are depicting themselves as terrorists .
In fact they have put themselves in a no win situation .
The only way that Palestinians could win is through non-violence struggle .
They need to attract the sympathy of the world opinion and the Israelis themselves .
Fortunately their “ enemy ” is civilized .
The Palestinians have to learn to speak in a civilized language to be heard .
If Palestinians renounce violence , if they accept the Israel ’s right to exist , if they stop sowing the seeds of hate in their children and even toddlers , if they mobilize the public opinion , they will find many allies and sympathizers even among the Israelis .
But alas the language of peace is an alien language to Muslims .
Honestly , I am not optimistic about the future of the Palestinian / Israeli affair .
There is so much hatred against the Jews , inspired by the Quran and inherited directly from Muhammad that I see no hope of any lasting peace .
How can you have peace with the Jews when all you dream of is to finish what Hitler did n’t ?
Again the problem here is Islam and the solution is the eradication of Islam .
25 . How well do Muslims know the teachings contained in the Koran ?
I ’ve found that even when confronted with some dubious quotes , there is always a justification or ‘ context ’ for them .
Why the willingness to condone behaviour that could get you arrested today in the West ?
The majority of Muslims know very little about Islam .
They hardly read the Quran and when they read it , they do not understand it and those who understand it , do not ponder upon it .
Muslims live in denial .
It is less painful for them to live in denial than accept the bitter fact that they have been following a mentally sick man bereft of any humanity for 1400 years .
That is truly a painful revelation and most Muslims are not ready to even read the facts to refute it , let alone accept it .
But truth is obstinate and eventually they will have to face it .
They can not live cocooned in lies forever .
26 . Is it possible to ‘ reform ’ Islam or would you prefer if it were eradicated ?
Islam can not be reformed .
All those who tried , failed .
In fact Iranians would not have accepted Khomeini if it were not for believing the lies of a misguided individual called Ali Shariati who concocted a “ reformed ” version of Islam embellished it with some Marxist Socialism , added a dash of Humanism and a pinch of Aristotelism .
He convinced the young generation that Islam can be reformed .
But actually what he did was to embellish an aged and ugly woman masquerading her , covering her face in veils and making her look attractive to the youth who foolishly fell in love with her .
This gullible folk took that old bitch to bed with stars in their eyes .
But the next day when the Sun came out and they laid their gaze on her repugnant face , they realized that they were duped .
Now they are trapped .
Ali Shariati might have had good intentions , but he paved the road to hell with his good intentions .
I do not think Islam can be reformed or rejuvenated .
It is time to put her to sleep and bury her in the tomb of history .
But we are not the ones who will eradicate Islam .
How can you eradicate a belief , which is in the minds of people ?
Islam will be eradicated by Muslims themselves .
After they see the truth and realize how evil this Muhammad was no Muslim would want to be called with that name .
When the Christians leave Christianity , they do not hate Jesus .
But that is different with Muslims leaving Islam .
Muhammad was no Jesus .
He was the embodiment of all what is abhorrent and evil
27 .
Will the forthcoming ( we ’re told ) attack on Iraq be perceived as another attack on Islam ?
Do you support this proposed war ?
It will be perceived as attack on Islam but I support it .
I wrote to President Bush , the father , and told him it is a mistake to leave Saddam in power after the Desert Storm .
I told him to kill that snake now that he had wounded him .
But he did not read my message or did not care to answer .
Instead he chose to punish the most vulnerable and the most innocent , i.e. the children by boycotting Iraq .
Hundreds of thousand more Iraqi lives were lost and who knows how many more will be lost now because of that error .
The more you wait , the bigger threat Saddam becomes .
28 .
The internet can be used to promote Islam too – what do you think of Islamic websites in general ?
They rehash the same junk .
These sites are eloquent testimony to the fact that there is no intelligent life in Islam .
The more they write , the more they incriminate themselves .
Give them all the rope they need and they will hang themselves with it .
29 .
Do you think any religion benefits humanity and are they all religions equally bad ?
Religion is a personal thing .
I do not need a religion to tell me the right from the wrong .
I follow the Golden Rule and I can find answers to all my questions in this simple teaching .
“ Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you . ”
This is my religion .
I love humanity , I strive for peace , I fight against prejudices and hate , I seek to establish unity , I am a peacemaker by nature .
I believe in a higher reality that I call the Single Principle , which is not the same as the God of the religions .
I rely on my own judgment and do not want to be a follower .
However many people need a religion .
They need to believe in something and they need an authority to tell them what to do .
I am not going to decry what people hold dear to their hearts .
I do not care if you worship gods , cows , snakes , rats , stones or phalli ( as some people in India do ) .
But if you try to impose your religion on me , and violently force it on me , if you think I should believe in what you believe or die , that is no more your personal religion .
You have declared a war on me .
It is my duty to defend myself and defend my loved ones .
In this case all humanity are my loved ones .
It is my duty to stop this aggression and that is why I fight against Islam .
I am not against Islam because it is false and foolish , but because it is dangerous .
Read these two sites and see that Muslims are not abashed to declare the “ Supremacy of Islam at the global level ” http://www.geocities.com/mahazislami/
And “ establishing the ascendancy of Islam over all ( what they call ) man -made systems of life . ”
http://www.tanzeem.org/intro/mission/index.htm
As for your question whether all religions are equally bad , my answer is no .
Not all religions are equally bad .
Some are worse .
30 .
Are there any other points you would like to make ?
Well you wanted to write an article not more than 1500 words .
But just your questions are over 730 words .
This article now contains 5000 words .
I suppose it is enough .
I thank you for your questions .
County court moves to Dickson , first time in nearly 100 years
Tesco is pushing its range of non -food goods
Tesco said it would offer six packages , including office software , security systems and a photo editing tool .
Britain 's biggest retailer said each title would cost less than £ 20 , challenging what it described as the current " high " price of PC software .
Tesco has been pushing aggressively into the market for non -food goods .
In August , the firm announced it was launching a new home shopping service for a range of 8,000 items including sofas , bikes , golf clubs and cameras - taking the supermarket into direct competition with retailers such as Argos .
Analysts expect
Tesco to announce half - year profits later this week of more than £ 1bn .
More choice
When it comes to software there is little choice and prices are high - our new range of software changes this
Daniel Cook , Tesco
Tesco said its own - brand software range , which will also include a CD / DVD burning tool , would be available in 100 of its stores from later in October .
The supermarket group said it had developed the range of titles with UK software distributor Formjet .
Formjet 's products include Ability Office , a software package which includes word processing , spreadsheet and photo editing applications , the basic version of which retails at £ 20.99 .
" When it comes to software there is little choice and prices are high , " said Tesco buyer Daniel Cook .
" Our new range of software changes this , bringing choice and value to the market that has offered little of either for too long . "
However , the software market has become increasingly competitive recently , with online companies like Google challenging Microsoft 's dominance of the industry by offering free downloads of software .
Biggest player
UK 's computer software market is currently worth about £ 8.5 bn , according to Tesco .
The software and home shopping services are the latest in a growing list of non-food products offered by Tesco , which also includes finance and insurance packages and phone and broadband services .
Tesco 's successful move into retail areas not previously associated with supermarkets has helped the firm hold on to its position as Britain 's dominant retailer .
The latest data published last month by market retail analysts TNS Worldpanel showed that Tesco had a 31.4 % share of the UK grocery market , followed by Asda with a 16.4 % and Sainsbury 's with 15.9 % .
Commentary by Cory Doctorow
Science Fiction is the Only Literature People Care Enough About to Steal on the Internet .
As a science fiction writer , no piece of news could make me more hopeful .
It beats the hell out of the alternative  a future where the dominant , pluripotent , ubiquitous medium has no place for science fiction literature .
When radio and records were invented , they were pretty bad news for the performers of the day .
Live performance demanded charisma , the ability to really put on a magnetic show in front of a crowd .
It did n't matter how technically accomplished you were : if you stood like a statue on stage , no one wanted to see you do your thing .
On the other hand , you succeeded as a mediocre player , provided you attacked your performance with a lot of brio .
Radio was clearly good news for musicians  lots more musicians were able to make lots more music , reaching lots more people and making lots more money .
It turned performance into an industry , which is what happens when you add technology to art .
But it was terrible news for charismatics .
It put them out on the street , stuck them with flipping burgers and driving taxis .
They knew it , too .
Performers lobbied to have the Marconi radio banned , to send Marconi back to the drawing board , charged with inventing a radio they could charge admission to .
" We 're charismatics , we do something as old and holy as the first story told before the first fire in the first cave .
What right have you to insist that we should become mere clerks , working in an obscure back - room , leaving you to commune with our audiences on our behalf ? "
Technology giveth and technology taketh away .
Seventy years later , Napster showed us that , as William Gibson noted , " We may be at the end of the brief period during which it is possible to charge for recorded music . "
Surely we 're at the end of the period where it 's possible to exclude those who do n't wish to pay .
Every song released can be downloaded gratis from a peer - to - peer network ( and will shortly get easier to download , as hard - drive price / performance curves take us to a place where all the music ever recorded will fit on a disposable pocket - drive that you can just walk over to a friend 's place and copy ) .
But have no fear : the Internet makes it possible for recording artists to reach a wider audience than ever dreamt of before .
Your potential fans may be spread in a thin , even coat over the world , in a configuration that could never be cost - effective to reach with traditional marketing .
But the Internet 's ability to lower the costs for artists to reach their audiences and for audiences to find artists suddenly renders possible more variety in music than ever before .
Those artists can use the Internet to bring people back to the live performances that characterized the heyday of Vaudeville .
Use your recordings  which you can't control  to drive admissions to your performances , which you can control .
It 's a model that 's worked great for jam bands like the Grateful Dead and Phish .
It 's also a model that wo n't work for many of today 's artists ; 70 years of evolutionary pressure has selected for artists who are more virtuoso than charismatic , artists optimized for recording - based income instead of performance - based income .
" How dare you tell us that we are to be trained monkeys , capering on a stage for your amusement ?
We 're not charismatics , we 're white - collar workers .
We commune with our muses behind closed doors and deliver up our work product when it 's done , through plastic , laser - etched discs .
You have no right to demand that we convert to a live - performance economy . "
Technology giveth and technology taketh away .
As bands on MySpace  who can fill houses and sell hundreds of thousands of discs without a record deal , by connecting individually with fans  have shown , there 's a new market aborning on the Internet for music , one with fewer gatekeepers to creativity than ever before .
That 's the purpose of copyright , after all : to decentralize who gets to make art .
Before copyright , we had patronage : you could make art if the Pope or the king liked the sound of it .
That produced some damned pretty ceilings and frescos , but it was n't until control of art was given over to the market  by giving publishers a monopoly over the works they printed , starting with the Statute of Anne in 1710  that we saw the explosion of creativity that investment - based art could create .
Industrialists were n't great arbiters of who could and could n't make art , but they were better than the Pope .
The Internet is enabling a further decentralization in who gets to make art , and like each of the technological shifts in cultural production , it 's good for some artists and bad for others .
The important question is : will it let more people participate in cultural production ?
Will it further decentralize decision - making for artists ?
And for SF writers and fans , the further question is , " Will it be any good to our chosen medium ? "
Like I said , science fiction is the only literature people care enough about to steal on the Internet .
It 's the only literature that regularly shows up , scanned and run through optical character recognition software and lovingly hand - edited on darknet newsgroups , Russian websites , IRC channels and elsewhere ( yes , there 's also a brisk trade in comics and technical books , but I 'm talking about prose fiction here  though this is clearly a sign of hope for our friends in tech publishing and funnybooks ) .
Some writers are using the Internet 's affinity for SF to great effect .
I 've released every one of my novels under Creative Commons licenses that encourage fans to share them freely and widely  even , in some cases , to remix them and to make new editions of them for use in the developing world .
My first novel , Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom , is in its sixth printing from Tor , and has been downloaded more than 650,000 times from my website , and an untold number of times from others ' websites .
I 've discovered what many authors have also discovered : releasing electronic texts of books drives sales of the print editions .
An SF writer 's biggest problem is obscurity , not piracy .
Of all the people who chose not to spend their discretionary time and cash on our works today , the great bulk of them did so because they did n't know they existed , not because someone handed them a free e-book version .
But what kind of artist thrives on the Internet ?
Those who can establish a personal relationship with their readers  something science fiction has been doing for as long as pros have been hanging out in the con suite instead of the green room .
These conversational artists come from all fields , and they combine the best aspects of charisma and virtuosity with charm  the ability to conduct their online selves as part of a friendly salon that establishes a non-substitutable relationship with their audiences .
You might find a film , a game , and a book to be equally useful diversions on a slow afternoon , but if the novel 's author is a pal of yours , that 's the one you 'll pick .
It 's a competitive advantage that can't be beat .
See Neil Gaiman 's blog , where he manages the trick of carrying on a conversation with millions .
Or Charlie Stross 's Usenet posts .
Scalzi's blogs .
J. Michael Straczynski's presence on Usenet  while in production on Babylon 5 , no less  breeding an army of rabid fans ready to fax - bomb recalcitrant TV execs into submission and syndication .
See also the MySpace bands selling a million units of their CDs by adding each buyer to their " friends lists . "
Watch Eric Flint manage the Baen Bar , and Warren Ellis 's good - natured growling on his sites , lists , and so forth .
Not all artists have in them to conduct an online salon with their audiences .
Not all Vaudevillians had it in them to transition to radio .
Technology giveth and technology taketh away .
SF writers are supposed to be soaked in the future , ready to come to grips with it .
The future is conversational : when there 's more good stuff that you know about that 's one click away or closer than you will ever click on , it 's not enough to know that some book is good .
The least substitutable good in the Internet era is the personal relationship .
Conversation , not content , is king .
If you were stranded on a desert island and you opted to bring your records instead of your friends , we 'd call you a sociopath .
Science fiction writers who can insert themselves into their readers ' conversations will be set for life .

Manatee synesthesia
The humble manatee gets no respect .
With its potato - like head , stubby flippers , and blimp - shaped body , it looks like something evolution left behind a long time ago .
When a manatee recently drifted north and wound up swimming in the Hudson River next to Manahattan , the main reaction from city residents was man , that thing is ugly .
Worse , its brain is almost entirely smooth on the outside ; and since neurologists typically assume that a more - folded brain indicates higher intelligence , scientists have long assumed manatees are slow , dopey idiots :
The cows of the briny deep .
Ah , but this foul libel is finally being lifted — because a new generation of scientists are finally getting interested in the unusually dense vibrissae , sensory whiskers , that cover a manatee ’s body .
( They use them to detect undersea plants , and they ’re accurate up to 0.05 millimeters . )
Plenty of animals have vibrissae , but not in such huge numbers , and usually only on their faces .
So when you peel back the hood on the manatee ’s much - maligned brain , it turns out to be a torqued - up machine of deep neurological weirdness .
Roger Leep , a neuroscientist at the University of Florida , explored sensory clusters in the brain that process information from the whiskers , and made a startling discovery .
As the New York Times ’s Science section reported this week :
Even more tantalizing is that , in the manatee , these clusters extend into a region of the brain believed to be centrally involved with sound perception .
“ Either these things have nothing to do with the hair at all , or the more exciting possibility is that perhaps somatic sensation is so important that the specialized structure is overlapping with processing going on in auditory areas , ” Dr. Reep said .
Manatee synesthesia !!
I could not be more excited .
It reminds me , in a mental random - linking way , of those experimental rigs that let you use your tongue to “ see ” visual information .

Purdue University researchers have created a handheld sensing system its creators liken to Star Trek 's " tricorder " used to analyze the chemical components of alien worlds .
But the system could have down - to - earth applications , such as testing foods for dangerous bacterial contaminants including salmonella , which was recently found in a popular brand of peanut butter .
The new portable system is an ultrafast chemical - analysis tool that has numerous promising uses for detecting everything from cancer in the liver to explosives residues on luggage and " biomarkers " in urine that provide an early warning for diseases .
The instrument is a miniature mass spectrometer combined with a technique called desorption electrospray ionization , or DESI .
The device and technique were developed by a team of researchers led by R. Graham Cooks , the Henry Bohn Hass Distinguished Professor of Analytical Chemistry in Purdue 's College of Science .
" Conventional mass spectrometers analyze samples that are specially prepared and placed in a vacuum chamber , " Cooks said .
" The key DESI innovation is performing the ionization step in the air or directly on surfaces outside of the mass spectrometer 's vacuum chamber . "
Unlike conventional mass spectrometers , which are cumbersome laboratory instruments that weigh more than 300 pounds , the new handheld device weighs less than 20 pounds and can be used in the field .
" We like to compare it to the tricorder because it is truly a handheld instrument that yields information about the precise chemical composition of samples in a matter of minutes without harming the samples , " Cooks said .
The researchers at Purdue look for compounds that indicate the possible presence of a particular substance , such as cocaine or explosives residues .
If these indicators are found , the equipment performs a more in - depth analysis to determine the exact chemical structure .
The research team has used the device to analyze clothes , foods and tablets , and to identify cocaine on $ 50 bills in less than 1 second .
Two startup companies have been established on the basis of DESI and the portable mass spectrometer : Prosolia Inc. in Indianapolis , has commercialized the DESI source , and Griffin Analytical Technologies LLC , in West Lafayette , Ind. , has commercialized miniature ion trap mass spectrometers
While I 'm safely removed from the dating pool , Stephanie Street is not ( is this perhaps a pseudonym ? ) .
She phoned in a Valentine 's Day question to the PRI radio program Fair Game , and won the dubious honor of chatting with me and the host on air ( tonight , online at www.morefairgame.org by 9:00 pm ) and thus having her pseudonym forever attached to this equation , heretofore known as The Manometer .
Her dilemma was the choice between two proposed Valentine 's Day dates — one eight years older , mature and stable and another two years younger , brash and exciting ( does this sound like the plot of a Danielle Steel novel to anyone else ? ) .
The older gent was thinking basketball game while the younger had gone with the standby wine - and - dine .
Which to choose ?
Luckily the revolutionary Man-O - Meter makes Stephanie 's decision easy ( and maybe yours , too ) .
Just plug in the numbers to rank each dude and go with the one that scores highest .
And guys — it does n't take a PhD in String Theory to switch the genders , just be careful with the age variables .

Which date should I accept this Valentine ’s Day ?

An Overnight failure ?
The idea of an overnight success is relatively new .
Joan of Arc , Robin Hood and Sarah Bernhardt were not overnight successes .
It took media ( the old kind , like TV and movies , and especially the new kind , like Google video ) to create the overnight success .
My friends Pomme and Kelly are overnight successes .
So are some of the characters on American Idol .
Along the way , some people have trained themselves to believe that the only kind of success worth having is overnight success .
That if you do n’t hit # 1 the first week , you ’ve failed .
That if your interface is n’t perfect out of the box , or if you do n’t get 5,000 people standing in line at the opening of your new store , you ’ve failed .
The Times today reports on Kathleen McGowan , easily considered an overnight failure .
She spent years researching and writing a novel .
She went to the annual book convention on her own nickel last year , trying to pitch it .
Day after day was spent slogging her way to any person willing to look at it .
This year , of course , she ’s back with a million dollar plus advance , feted by booksellers , the whole drill .
Squidoo is another interesting case .
Here ’s a look at our daily traffic , courtesy of our Google Analytics package , since January ( I removed four weeks in mid-March , mid-April , because of a glitch with search . )
Squidoo has more than 27,000 lenses built by 15,000 people in about five months .
No , the chart does n’t look like MySpace or Flickr .
What it does look like is the early days of Google and Wikipedia and other overnight failures .
The challenge for observers , investors and partners ( like the publisher who took on Kathleen ) is to avoid the temptation of buying the media infatuation with the overnight success story ( which rarely happens overnight ) .
The challenge for marketers is to figure out what daily progress looks like and obsess about that .
The goal , I think , is to be an overnight failure , but one that persists .
Keeping costs low , building a foundation that leads to the right kind of story , the right kind of organic growth .
Kathleen wrote a book that she believes in , one that was worth investing years of her life into .
And then she painstakingly made progress until she became the next big thing .

The purpose of these links is not to condemn Islamic countries or to assert that the West is better than they are .
Facts say that the West has many problems .
Rather , the purpose is to demonstrate that Islamic countries have their share of problems as well .
This means that Islamic countries are also decadent .
This means that Islamic punishments do not work entirely ( except by scare tactics ) , but they can drive the sin or crime underground .
This article says that authorities in Turkey threaten to imprison online gamblers , and this page links to a report ( scroll to the second one ) that discusses how Turkey must deal with the problem of monetary interest , alcohol , and gambling .
It is revealing to see how Muslim religious leaders try to squirm out of Quranic laws against interest , in order to help Islamic financial institutions make money .
This article says that even though the Taliban , the tyrants who formerly ruled Afghanistan , outlawed the growth of poppies , which are the source of opium , the leaders of the Taliban may have profited from the drug trade .
The new and democratic government has a hard time keeping this drug under control .
This article reveals how Iranians get around the official ban on alcohol , like beer and vodka and other intoxicants , like opium .
A black market has sprung up — just like the one in America during Prohibition .
" Western analysts note that alcohol smuggling of the magnitude underway in Saudi Arabia —— perhaps tens of millions of dollars ' worth of illegal merchandise annually — — would likely involve the complicity of Saudi customs agents and perhaps a higher — level patron . "
This article says that Bahrain , an island and independent sate that is connected to Saudi Arabia by a causeway , provides a ' breathing lung ' for Saudis because this Islamic island allows the free flow of alcohol and a night life .
The words ' breathing lung ' in Bahrain mean that Saudi Arabia suffocates people .

In private emails to me or on websites , Muslim apologists ( defenders ) claim that the Islamic way of dealing with vices is superior to the western way , even in Islam 's punishments like flogging and stoning .
It is true that the West is filled with decadence , but are Islamic countries pure and pristine through and through , as these Muslim apologists imply ?
To anyone whose mind has not been clouded by a lifetime of devotion to Islam , the answer to this rhetorical question is obvious .
Alcohol and other intoxicants and gambling serve as test cases .
Thankfully , the province of Quebec , Canada , has forbidden sharia .
This is the right initiative .
It is true that the Enlightenment teaches tolerance , but it also teaches critical thinking and reasoning .
Sharia cannot stand up under scrutiny .
It is intolerant and excessive , and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics teaches the West that excess is never just .
One of the most tragic and under — reported occurrences in the West in recent years is the existence of a sharia court in Canada .
Muslims are pushing for a sharia divorce courting Australia as well .
Having a court of arbitration if it is based on western law and legal theory is legitimate , but sharia does not hold to this standard .
Whether sharia is imposed gradually or rapidly , Canada should promptly shut down any sharia court , and Australia should never allow one .
Such a court should never be permitted in the US , the rest of the West , or anywhere else in the world that is battling Islam .
Since Islamic law cannot be reformed without doing serious damage to original and authentic Islam — the one taught by Muhammad — then a second plan must be played out .
Sharia must never spread around the world .
At least that much is clear and achievable .
The hard evidence in this article demonstrates beyond doubt that sharia does not benefit any society , for it contains too many harsh rules and punishments .
Can Islamic countries benefit from an Enlightenment that may deny the Quran and the hadith ?
This seems impossible .
Islamic law threatens Muslims with death if they criticize Muhammad and the Quran , not to mention denying them .
In contrast , the West has undergone the Enlightenment or the Age of Reason ( c. 1600 — 1800 + ) , so western law has been injected with a heavy dose of reason .
Also , the New Testament tempers excessive punishments .
At least when Christianity reformed ( c. 1400 — 1600 ) , the reformers went back to the New Testament , which preaches peace and love .
So religion and reason in the West permit justice to be found more readily — the Medieval Church is not foundational to Christianity ; only Jesus and the New Testament are .
The nightmare must end .
Sharia oppresses the citizens of Islamic countries .
Islam must reform , but the legal hierarchy in Islamic nations will not do this because the judges and legal scholars understand the cost : many passages in the Quran and the hadith must be rejected , and this they can not do .
After all , the Quran came down directly from Allah through Gabriel , so says traditional theology .
So how can Islam reform ?
But reform it must .
It can start by rewriting classical fiqh ( interpretations of law ) .
Again , though , that would mean leaving behind the Quran and Muhammad 's example .
How can the legal hierarchy in Islamic nations do this ?
For the supporting article of reason no .
one , please go here .
It also has a segment on the differences between jihad in Islam and the wars in the Old Testament .
Another article on that topic can be read here .
There are vast differences between Islam and Judaism on this topic .
For an analysis of the Christian Crusades and the Islamic Crusades , click here .
Thus , jihad is aggressive , coercive , and excessive , and Allah never revealed to Muhammad to stop these practices .
(1) Women and children are enslaved .
They can either be sold , or the Muslims may ' marry ' the women , since their marriages are automatically annulled upon their capture .
( 2 ) Jihadists may have sex with slave women .
Ali , Muhammad 's cousin and son — in — law , did this .
( 3 ) Women and children must not be killed during war , unless this happens in a nighttime raid when visibility was low .
( 4 ) Old men and monks could be killed .
( 5 ) A captured enemy of war could be killed , enslaved , ransomed for money or an exchange , freely released , or beaten .
One time Muhammad even tortured a citizen of the city of Khaybar in order to extract information about where the wealth of the city was hidden .
( 6 ) Enemy men who converted could keep their property and small children .
This law is so excessive that it amounts to forced conversion .
Only the strongest of the strong could resist this coercion and remain a non —Muslim .
( 7 ) Civilian property may be confiscated .
( 8 ) Civilian homes may be destroyed .
( 9 ) Civilian fruit trees may be destroyed .
( 10 ) Pagan Arabs had to convert or die .
This does not allow for the freedom of religion or conscience .
( 11 ) People of the Book ( Jews and Christians ) had three options ( Sura 9:29 ) : fight and die ; convert and pay a forced ' charity ' or zakat tax ; or keep their Biblical faith and pay a jizya or poll tax .
The last two options mean that money flows into the Islamic treasury , so why would Muhammad receive a revelation to dry up this money flow ?
What are some of the legalized rules of jihad found in the Quran , hadith , and classical legal opinions ?
Money flowed into the Islamic treasury .
So why would Muhammad get a revelation to dry up this money flow ?
Muhammad is foundational to Islam , and he set the genetic code for Islam , waging war .
In the ten years that he lived in Medina from his Hijrah ( Emigration ) from Mecca in AD 622 to his death of a fever in AD 632 , he either sent out or went out on seventy — four raids , expeditions , or full — scale wars .
They range from small assassination hit squads to kill anyone who insulted him , to the Tabuk Crusades in late AD 630 against the Byzantine Christians .
He had heard a rumor that an army was mobilizing to invade Arabia , but the rumor was false , so his 30,000 jihadists returned home , but not before imposing a jizya tax on northern Christians and Jews .
And the number one reason why sharia is bad for all societies . . .
This Muslim website has an overview of Islam on apostates .
They should be given time to repent , but if they refuse , they must be killed .
Sayyid Maududi , a respected Islamic scholar , in this booklet argues that Sura 9:11 — 12 refers to apostates and that they should be put to death ( scroll down to ' The Proof in the Quran for the Commandment to Execute Apostates ' ) .
See the previous point no .
three for acts that entail leaving Islam according to Islamic law .
Apostates are those who leave Islam , like Salman Rushdie ( see the linked article in no .
three , above ) , whether they become atheists or convert to another religion .
They are supposed to be killed according to the Quran , the hadith , and later legal rulings .
In Iran an academic was condemned to death for criticizing clerical rule in Iran .
The rulers assert that he was insulting Muhammad and Shi'ite laws .
He was charged with apostasy .
For the supporting article that analyzes the Quran and the hadith , both of which orders death to critics , click here .
How confident was Muhammad ( and today 's Muslims ) in his message that he had to rely on violence and force to protect his message , besides reason and persuasive argumentation ?
Ultimately , censorship testifies to a lack of confidence in one 's position and message .
If the message of Islam were truly superior , one could trust in the power of truth .
As it stands , sharia with its prescribed punishments for questioning Muhammad , the Quran , and sharia itself testifies to their weakness since sharia threatens those who dare to differ .
According to the discretion of the caliph or his representative , the punishments for violating these rules are as follows : ( 1 ) death , ( 2 ) enslavement , ( 3 ) release without paying anything , and ( 4 ) ransoming in exchange for money .
These punishments also execute free speech — even repulsive speech — and freedom of religion or conscience .
(1) Commit adultery with a Muslim woman or marry her ; ( 2 ) conceal spies of hostile forces ; ( 3 ) lead a Muslim away from Islam ; ( 4 ) mention something impermissible about Allah , the Prophet . . . or Islam .
The non —Muslims living under Islamic rule are not allowed to do the following ( p. 609 , o11.10 ( 1 ) — ( 5 ) ) :
It is no wonder that critical investigation of the truth claims of Islam can never prevail in Islamic lands when the sword of Muhammad hangs over the scholars ' head .
(1) Reviling Allah or his Messenger ; ( 2 ) being sarcastic about ' Allah 's name , His command , His interdiction , His promise , or His threat ' ; ( 3 ) denying any verse of the Quran or ' anything which by scholarly consensus belongs to it , or to add a verse that does not belong to it ' ; ( 4 ) holding that ' any of Allah 's messengers or prophets are liars , or to deny their being sent ' ; ( 5 ) reviling the religion of Islam ; ( 6 ) being sarcastic about any ruling of the Sacred Law ; ( 7 ) denying that Allah intended ' the Prophet 's message . . . to be the religion followed by the entire world . '
First , the Muslim deserves death for doing any of the following ( Reliance of the Traveler pp. 597—98 , o8.7 ) :
In 2005 , British Muslims have been campaigning to pass a religious hate speech law in England 's parliament .
They have succeeded .
Their ability to propagandize has not been curtailed .
Opponents of the law say that it stifles free speech that may criticize Muhammad , the Quran , and Islam .
In 2005 , The Muslim Council of Victoria , Australia , brought a lawsuit against two pastors for holding a conference and posting articles critiquing Islam .
Three Muslims attended the conference and felt offended .
The two pastors have been convicted based on Australia 's vilification law .
While on trial , one of them wanted to read from the Quran on domestic violence ( see 9 , above ) , but the lawyer representing the Council would not allow it .
The pastors are appealing their conviction .
In 1989 , Iran 's Supreme Leader issued a fatwa ( legal decree ) to assassinate Salman Rushdie , a novelist , who wrote Satanic Verses , which includes questions about the angel Gabriel 's role in inspiring the Quran .
Now the extremists in the highest levels in Iran have recently renewed the fatwa .
3. Islam orders death for Muslim and possible death for non —Muslim critics of Muhammad and the Quran and even sharia itself .
Later Islamic legal rulings follow the Quran and the hadith closely , so we do not need to analyze them here .
The Prophet prayed over her dead body and then buried her .
Truthfully , though , how effective was the prayer when Muhammad and his community murdered her in cold blood ?
The rest of the hadith says that Muhammad told Khalid not to be too harsh , but the Prophet 's words drip with irony .
Perhaps Muhammad meant that Khalid should not have cursed her .
However , if they really did not want to be harsh , they should have forgiven her and let her go to raise her child .
And when he had given command over her and she was put in a hole up to her breast , he ordered the people to stone her .
Khalid b. al — Walid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head , and when the blood spurted on his face he cursed her . . . ( Muslim no .
4206 )
This gruesome hadith passage reports that a woman was buried up to her chest and stoned to death :
An Iranian woman charged with adultery faces death by stoning in the next five days after her death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last month .
Her unnamed co—defendant is at risk of imminent execution by hanging .
Amnesty International members are now writing urgent appeals to the Iranian authorities , calling for the execution to be stopped .
She is to be buried up to her chest and stoned to death .
According to this report , in Iran a teenage boy broke his Ramadan fast , so a judge sentenced him to be lashed with eighty — five stripes .
He died from the punishment .
Though his sad case does not deal with fornication , it is cited here because it shows that lashing can be fatal .
The classical legal rulings follow the Quran and the hadith closely , so we do not need to analyze them here .
The additions in the brackets , though not original to the Arabic , have the support of the hadith .
These command flogging only of unmarried fornicators : Bukhari , Punishments , nos.
6831 and 6833 .
24:2 The fornicatress and the fornicator , flog each of them with a hundred stripes .
Let not pity withhold you in their case , in a punishment prescribed by Allah , if you believe in Allah and the Last Day .
And let a party of the believers witness their punishment .
[ This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime ( illegal sex ) , but if married persons commit it ( illegal sex ) , the punishment is to stone them to death , according to Allah 's law ] .
( Hilali and Khan ) .
If the reader would like to see the confusion in the Quran on the matter of homosexuality , the severity in the hadith , and excessive rulings of classical fiqh , they should see the supporting article .
This longer one has links to many discussions on Islamic punishments of homosexuals ( scroll down to ' Supplemental material ' ) .
Though this punishment of a wall being toppled on them is extreme , the Taliban were merely following the origins of their religion .
Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira reported God 's messenger as saying , ' Accursed is he who does what Lot 's people did . '
In a version . . . on the authority of Ibn Abbas it says that Ali [ Muhammad 's cousin and son — in — law ] had two people burned and that Abu Bakr [ Muhammad 's chief companion ] had a wall thrown down on them .
( Mishkat , vol. 1 , p. 765 , Prescribed Punishments )
This hadith passage says that homosexuals should be burned alive or have wall pushed on them :
' If you find anyone doing as Lot 's people did , kill the one who does it , and the one to whom it is done ' ( Abu Dawud no. 4447 ) .
Ibn Abbas , Muhammad 's cousin and highly reliable transmitter of hadith , reports the following about early Islam and Muhammad 's punishment of homosexuals : . . .
These homosexuals were lucky .
Early Islam would have executed them , as these hadith demonstrate .
On April 7 , 2005 , it was reported that Saudi Arabia sentenced more than 100 men to prison or flogging for ' gay conduct . '
In April 2005 , a Kuwaiti cleric says homosexuals should be thrown off a mountain or stoned to death .
In February 1998 , the Taliban , who once ruled in Afghanistan , ordered a stone wall to be pushed over three men convicted of sodomy .
Their lives were to be spared if they survived for 30 minutes and were still alive when the stones were removed .
For more information on Muhammad 's brutality and the barbaric laws that flow out of it , go to the back — up article .
Islamic law says that these punishments are imposed for highway robbery , and in some cases crucifixion does not need a murder before it is imposed .
See this short article for details on another example of Muhammad 's use of torture .
The next hadith reports that the renegades died from bleeding to death because Muhammad refused to cauterize their amputated limbs .
Then the hadith after that one reports that the renegades were not given water , so they died of thirst .
They probably died of both causes : thirst and loss of blood .
Narrated Anas : Some people . . . came to the Prophet and embraced Islam . . .
[ T ] hey turned renegades ( reverted from Islam ) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took the camels away . . .
The Prophet ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron , and that their cut hands and legs should not be cauterized , till they died .
( Bukhari , Punishments , no .
6802 )
It may be difficult to accept , but the hadith says that Muhammad tortured these next people before he executed them .
This scenario provides the historical context of Sura 5:33 — 34 .
The explanations in parentheses have been added by the translator :
5:33 Those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive to spread corruption in the land should be punished by death , crucifixion , the amputation of an alternate hand and foot or banishment from the land : a disgrace for them in this world , and then a terrible punishment in the Hereafter , 34 unless they repent before you overpower them : in that case bear in mind that God is forgiving and merciful .
( Haleem )
In 2002 Amnesty International reports that even though Saudi Arabia ratified the Convention against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( Convention against Torture ) in October 1997 , amputation is prescribed under both Hudud ( punishments ) and Qisas ( law of retaliation ) .
AI has recorded thirty — three amputations and nine cross— amputations where the alternate hand or foot is mutilated .
In September 2003 , Scotsman Sandy Mitchell faced crucifixion in Saudi Arabia .
He was beaten and tortured until he confessed to a crime he did not commit : a bomb plot masterminded by the British embassy .
The article says of this punishment that it is the worst kind of execution and that two have been carried out in the last twenty years .
If the reader would like to see more hadith passages , modern defenses of this indefensible punishment ( and a refutation of them ) , and the Biblical solution to theft , they should click on this long supporting article or this shorter one .
At first glance , verse 39 seems to accept repentance before the thief 's hand is cut off .
But the hadith states emphatically that repentance is acceptable only after mutilation .
Muhammad himself says that even if his own daughter , Fatima , were to steal and then intercede that her hand should not be cut off , he would still have to cut it off ( Bukhari , Punishments , no .
6788 )
5:38 Cut off the hands of thieves , whether they are male or female , as punishment for what they have done — a deterrent from God : God is almighty and wise .
39
But if anyone repents after his wrongdoing and makes amends , God will accept his repentance : God is most forgiving and merciful .
( Haleem )
Warning !
This short article has photos of severed hands .
The reader should never lose sight of the fact that this punishment is prescribed in the Quran , the eternal word of Allah .
It does not exist only in the fevered imagination of a violent and sick radical regime like the Taliban , which once ruled in Afghanistan .
Islamic law calls all of humanity to march backwards 1,400 years BC and to re—impose the old law of retaliation — literally , and the evidence suggest that the Torah never intended the law to be carried out literally , as the supporting article demonstrates .
Please go here for the supporting article that cites the hadith and later legal rulings .
The hadith and later legal rulings demonstrate that this excessive option was actually carried out , as do the three modern examples linked above .
This passage allows for an indemnity or compensation instead of imposing the literal punishment of eye for an eye .
No one should have a quarrel with this option .
According to the hadith , the plaintiff also has the option to forgive , and this is legitimate , provided a judge oversees the process .
The problem is the literal law of retaliation .
5:45 And We ordained therein for them : Life for life , eye for eye , nose for nose , ear for ear , tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal .
But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity , it shall be for him an expiation .
And whosoever does not judge by that which Allah has revealed , such are the Zalimun ( polytheists and wrongdoers . . . ) .
( Hilali and Khan , The Noble Qur'an , Riyadh : Darussalam , 1996 )
In 2005 , an Iranian court orders a man 's eye to be removed for throwing acid on another man and blinding him in both eyes .
In 2003 , a court in Pakistan sentenced a man to be blinded by acid after he carried out a similar attack on his fianc�e .
In 2003 , in Saudi Arabia a man had two teeth extracted under the law of retaliation .

It has a long list of different translations of Sura 4:34 , in order to resolve confusion over this verse , circulating around the web .
This longer article has many links that demonstrate the oppression of women under Islamic law ( scroll down to ' Further discussion ' ) .
It is claimed that Islamic societies have fewer incidents of fornication and adultery because of strict laws or customs , for example , women wearing veils over their faces or keeping separate from men in social settings .
But these results of fewer incidents of sexual ' crimes ' may have unanticipated negative effects in other areas , such as the oppression of women .
Generally , sharia restricts women 's social mobility and rights , the more closely sharia is followed .
For example , in conservative Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to drive cars .
In Iran , the law oppresses women .
For example , women 's testimony counts half that of men , and far more women than men are stoned to death for adultery .
Rifa 'a divorced his wife whereupon ' AbdurRahman bin Az — Zubair Al — Qurazi married her .
' Aisha said that the lady ( came ) , wearing a green veil ( and complained to her ( Aisha ) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating ) .
It was the habit of ladies to support each other , so when Allah 's Apostle came , ' Aisha said , " I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women .
Look !
Her skin is greener than her clothes ! " ( Bukhari )
The hadith says that Muslim women in the time of Muhammad were suffering from domestic violence in the context of confusing marriage laws :
4:34 . . .
If you fear highhandedness from your wives , remind them [ of the teaching of God ] , then ignore them when you go to bed , then hit them .
If they obey you , you have no right to act against them .
God is most high and great .
( MAS Abdel Haleem , the Qur'an , Oxford UP , 2004 )
Saudi television aired a talk show that discussed this issue .
Scrolling three — fourths of the way down the link , the readers can see an Islamic scholar holding up sample rods that husbands may use to hit their wives .
In 2004 , Rania al — Baz , who had been beaten by her husband , made her ordeal public to raise awareness about violence suffered by women in the home in Saudi Arabia .
9 . Islam allows husbands to hit their wives even if the husbands merely fear highhandedness in their wives .
Here is the article that supports this tenth point and that analyzes the confusing Quranic verses on drinking and gambling .
It analyzes the hadith and later legal rulings .
It is sometimes argued that Islamic countries are pure , whereas the West is decadent .
No one can argue with this latter claim , but are Islamic countries pure ?
The Supplemental Material , below , demonstrates that Islamic countries still have drinking and gambling in them .
The later classical legal rulings follow the Quran and the hadith , so we do not need to examine them here .
Thus , we see no offer of help for the alcoholic when he is dragged before Muhammad and his followers .
Why does Muhammad not offer rehabilitation ?
Why does he immediately go to corporal punishment ?
The Prophet felt it hard ( was angry ) and ordered all those who were present in the house , to beat him [ the drinker dragged into Muhammad 's presence ] .
( Bukhari , Punishments , nos .
6774 — 6775 )
After going through two previous confusing stages before coming down hard on drinkers and gamblers , the Quran finally prohibits alcohol and gambling in Sura 5:90 — 91 ; they do not prescribe the punishment of flogging , but the hadith does .
A poor ' criminal ' was brought to Muhammad who became angry :
In 2005 , in the Indonesian province of Aceh , fifteen men were caned in front of a mosque for gambling .
This was done publicly so all could see and fear .
Eleven others are scheduled to undergo the same penalty for gambling .
In 2001 , Iranian officials sentenced three men to flogging not only for illicit sex ( see reason no. nine ) , but also for drinking alcohol .
Here are the top ten reasons why sharia or Islamic law is bad for all societies .
Fourth , in each of the lengthy supporting article ( or articles ) , a Biblical view on these infractions of moral law ( or sometimes civil law or personal injuries ) is presented .
One of the reasons we all sense that these Islamic punishments are harsh and excessive is that Christianity has also filled the globe .
Even if one is not a Christian or is only a nominal Christian , he or she has breathed deeply of Christianity by virtue of laws and customs or even driving by churches .
New Testament Christianity , when properly understood and followed , offers humanity dignity .
Third , it must be pointed out that these harsh laws are not ( or should not be ) imposed outside of an Islamic court of law .
Careful legal hurdles must be passed before the punishments are carried out .
However , even in that case , it will become clear to anyone who thinks clearly that these punishments and policies are excessive by their very nature , and excess is never just , as Aristotle taught us in his Nicomachean Ethics .
Second , each of these ten reasons has a back — up article ( or more ) that is long and well documented with quotations and references to the Quran , the hadith , and classical legal opinions .
The supporting articles also examine the historical and literary context of each Quranic verse .
If the readers , especially critics , wish to challenge one or all of these ten reasons , or if they simply doubt them , they should click on the supporting articles .
They will see that Muhammad himself actually laid down these excessive punishments and policies .
First , sometimes these ten points quote the Quran or omit it ; sometimes they quote the hadith ( reports of Muhammad 's words and actions outside of the Quran ) or omit it .
This is done only to keep down the length of the article .
No one should be fooled into believing that these harsh and excessive laws were invented in the fevered imagination of extremists who came long after Muhammad .
These harsh and excessive laws come directly from the founder of Islam in his Quran and in his example in the hadith .

Here are the top ten reasons why sharia or Islamic law is bad for all societies .
10 . Islam commands that drinkers and gamblers should be whipped .
In 2001 , Iranian officials sentenced three men to flogging not only for illicit sex ( see reason no. nine ) , but also for drinking alcohol .
In 2005 , in Nigeria a sharia court ordered that a drinker should be caned eighty strokes .
In 2005 , in the Indonesian province of Aceh , fifteen men were caned in front of a mosque for gambling .
This was done publicly so all could see and fear .
Eleven others are scheduled to undergo the same penalty for gambling .
After going through two previous confusing stages before coming down hard on drinkers and gamblers , the Quran finally prohibits alcohol and gambling in Sura 5:90 — 91 ; they do not prescribe the punishment of flogging , but the hadith does .

Why does Muhammad not offer rehabilitation ?
Why does he immediately go to corporal punishment ?

8. Islam allows an injured plaintiff to exact legal revenge — physical eye for physical eye .
In 2003 , in Saudi Arabia a man had two teeth extracted under the law of retaliation .
In 2003 , a court in Pakistan sentenced a man to be blinded by acid after he carried out a similar attack on his fianc�e .
In 2005 , an Iranian court orders a man 's eye to be removed for throwing acid on another man and blinding him in both eyes .
The Quran says :
5:45 And We ordained therein for them : Life for life , eye for eye , nose for nose , ear for ear , tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal .
But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity , it shall be for him an expiation .

5:38 Cut off the hands of thieves , whether they are male or female , as punishment for what they have done — a deterrent from God : God is almighty and wise .
39
But if anyone repents after his wrongdoing and makes amends , God will accept his repentance : God is most forgiving and merciful .
( Haleem )
At first glance , verse 39 seems to accept repentance before the thief 's hand is cut off .
But the hadith states emphatically that repentance is acceptable only after mutilation .
Muhammad himself says that even if his own daughter , Fatima , were to steal and then intercede that her hand should not be cut off , he would still have to cut it off ( Bukhari , Punishments , no .
6788 )

6. Islam commands that highway robbers should be crucified or mutilated .
In September 2003 , Scotsman Sandy Mitchell faced crucifixion in Saudi Arabia .
He was beaten and tortured until he confessed to a crime he did not commit : a bomb plot masterminded by the British embassy .
The article says of this punishment that it is the worst kind of execution and that two have been carried out in the last twenty years .
In 2002 Amnesty International reports that even though Saudi Arabia ratified the Convention against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( Convention against Torture ) in October 1997 , amputation is prescribed under both Hudud ( punishments ) and Qisas ( law of retaliation ) .
AI has recorded thirty — three amputations and nine cross— amputations where the alternate hand or foot is mutilated .
The Quran says :
5:33 Those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive to spread corruption in the land should be punished by death , crucifixion , the amputation of an alternate hand and foot or banishment from the land : a disgrace for them in this world , and then a terrible punishment in the Hereafter , 34 unless they repent before you overpower them : in that case bear in mind that God is forgiving and merciful .
( Haleem )
It may be difficult to accept , but the hadith says that Muhammad tortured these next people before he executed them .
This scenario provides the historical context of Sura 5:33 — 34 .
The explanations in parentheses have been added by the translator :
Narrated Anas : Some people . . . came to the Prophet and embraced Islam . . .
[ T ] hey turned renegades ( reverted from Islam ) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took the camels away . . .
The Prophet ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron , and that their cut hands and legs should not be cauterized , till they died .
( Bukhari , Punishments , no .
6802 )
The next hadith reports that the renegades died from bleeding to death because Muhammad refused to cauterize their amputated limbs .
Then the hadith after that one reports that the renegades were not given water , so they died of thirst .
They probably died of both causes : thirst and loss of blood .
See this short article for details on another example of Muhammad 's use of torture .
Islamic law says that these punishments are imposed for highway robbery , and in some cases crucifixion does not need a murder before it is imposed .

5. Islam commands that homosexuals must be executed .
In February 1998 , the Taliban , who once ruled in Afghanistan , ordered a stone wall to be pushed over three men convicted of sodomy .
Their lives were to be spared if they survived for 30 minutes and were still alive when the stones were removed .
In its 1991 Constitution , in Articles 108 — 113 , Iran adopted the punishment of execution for sodomy .
In April 2005 , a Kuwaiti cleric says homosexuals should be thrown off a mountain or stoned to death .
On April 7 , 2005 , it was reported that Saudi Arabia sentenced more than 100 men to prison or flogging for ' gay conduct . '
These homosexuals were lucky .
Early Islam would have executed them , as these hadith demonstrate .
Ibn Abbas , Muhammad 's cousin and highly reliable transmitter of hadith , reports the following about early Islam and Muhammad 's punishment of homosexuals : . . .
' If you find anyone doing as Lot 's people did , kill the one who does it , and the one to whom it is done ' ( Abu Dawud no. 4447 ) .
This hadith passage says that homosexuals should be burned alive or have wall pushed on them :
Ibn Abbas and Abu Huraira reported God 's messenger as saying , ' Accursed is he who does what Lot 's people did . '
In a version . . . on the authority of Ibn Abbas it says that Ali [ Muhammad 's cousin and son — in — law ] had two people burned and that Abu Bakr [ Muhammad 's chief companion ] had a wall thrown down on them .
( Mishkat , vol. 1 , p. 765 , Prescribed Punishments )
Though this punishment of a wall being toppled on them is extreme , the Taliban were merely following the origins of their religion .
If the reader would like to see the confusion in the Quran on the matter of homosexuality , the severity in the hadith , and excessive rulings of classical fiqh , they should see the supporting article .
This longer one has links to many discussions on Islamic punishments of homosexuals ( scroll down to ' Supplemental material ' ) .
4. Islam orders unmarried fornicators to be whipped and adulterers to be stoned to death .
Fornication :
In 2001 , Iranian officials sentenced three men to flogging for illicit sex .
The Quran says :
24:2 The fornicatress and the fornicator , flog each of them with a hundred stripes .
Let not pity withhold you in their case , in a punishment prescribed by Allah , if you believe in Allah and the Last Day .
And let a party of the believers witness their punishment .
[ This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime ( illegal sex ) , but if married persons commit it ( illegal sex ) , the punishment is to stone them to death , according to Allah 's law ] .
( Hilali and Khan ) .
The additions in the brackets , though not original to the Arabic , have the support of the hadith .
These command flogging only of unmarried fornicators : Bukhari , Punishments , nos.
6831 and 6833 .
The classical legal rulings follow the Quran and the hadith closely , so we do not need to analyze them here .
According to this report , in Iran a teenage boy broke his Ramadan fast , so a judge sentenced him to be lashed with eighty — five stripes .
He died from the punishment .
Though his sad case does not deal with fornication , it is cited here because it shows that lashing can be fatal .
Adultery :
In December 2004 , Amnesty International reports :
An Iranian woman charged with adultery faces death by stoning in the next five days after her death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last month .
Her unnamed co—defendant is at risk of imminent execution by hanging .
Amnesty International members are now writing urgent appeals to the Iranian authorities , calling for the execution to be stopped .
She is to be buried up to her chest and stoned to death .
This gruesome hadith passage reports that a woman was buried up to her chest and stoned to death :
And when he had given command over her and she was put in a hole up to her breast , he ordered the people to stone her .
Khalid b. al — Walid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head , and when the blood spurted on his face he cursed her . . . ( Muslim no .
4206 )
The Prophet prayed over her dead body and then buried her .
Truthfully , though , how effective was the prayer when Muhammad and his community murdered her in cold blood ?
The rest of the hadith says that Muhammad told Khalid not to be too harsh , but the Prophet 's words drip with irony .
Perhaps Muhammad meant that Khalid should not have cursed her .
However , if they really did not want to be harsh , they should have forgiven her and let her go to raise her child .
Later Islamic legal rulings follow the Quran and the hadith closely , so we do not need to analyze them here .
Here is the back — up article that supports this fourth reason .
3. Islam orders death for Muslim and possible death for non —Muslim critics of Muhammad and the Quran and even sharia itself .
In 1989 , Iran 's Supreme Leader issued a fatwa ( legal decree ) to assassinate Salman Rushdie , a novelist , who wrote Satanic Verses , which includes questions about the angel Gabriel 's role in inspiring the Quran .
Now the extremists in the highest levels in Iran have recently renewed the fatwa .
In 2005 , The Muslim Council of Victoria , Australia , brought a lawsuit against two pastors for holding a conference and posting articles critiquing Islam .
Three Muslims attended the conference and felt offended .
The two pastors have been convicted based on Australia 's vilification law .
While on trial , one of them wanted to read from the Quran on domestic violence ( see 9 , above ) , but the lawyer representing the Council would not allow it .
The pastors are appealing their conviction .
In 2005 , British Muslims have been campaigning to pass a religious hate speech law in England 's parliament .
They have succeeded .
Their ability to propagandize has not been curtailed .
Opponents of the law say that it stifles free speech that may criticize Muhammad , the Quran , and Islam .
Here are the classical legal rulings .
First , the Muslim deserves death for doing any of the following ( Reliance of the Traveler pp. 597—98 , o8.7 ) :
(1) Reviling Allah or his Messenger ; ( 2 ) being sarcastic about ' Allah 's name , His command , His interdiction , His promise , or His threat ' ; ( 3 ) denying any verse of the Quran or ' anything which by scholarly consensus belongs to it , or to add a verse that does not belong to it ' ; ( 4 ) holding that ' any of Allah 's messengers or prophets are liars , or to deny their being sent ' ; ( 5 ) reviling the religion of Islam ; ( 6 ) being sarcastic about any ruling of the Sacred Law ; ( 7 ) denying that Allah intended ' the Prophet 's message . . . to be the religion followed by the entire world . '
It is no wonder that critical investigation of the truth claims of Islam can never prevail in Islamic lands when the sword of Muhammad hangs over the scholars ' head .
The non —Muslims living under Islamic rule are not allowed to do the following ( p. 609 , o11.10 ( 1 ) — ( 5 ) ) :
(1) Commit adultery with a Muslim woman or marry her ; ( 2 ) conceal spies of hostile forces ; ( 3 ) lead a Muslim away from Islam ; ( 4 ) mention something impermissible about Allah , the Prophet . . . or Islam .
According to the discretion of the caliph or his representative , the punishments for violating these rules are as follows : ( 1 ) death , ( 2 ) enslavement , ( 3 ) release without paying anything , and ( 4 ) ransoming in exchange for money .
These punishments also execute free speech — even repulsive speech — and freedom of religion or conscience .
Ultimately , censorship testifies to a lack of confidence in one 's position and message .
If the message of Islam were truly superior , one could trust in the power of truth .
As it stands , sharia with its prescribed punishments for questioning Muhammad , the Quran , and sharia itself testifies to their weakness since sharia threatens those who dare to differ .
How confident was Muhammad ( and today 's Muslims ) in his message that he had to rely on violence and force to protect his message , besides reason and persuasive argumentation ?

2. Islam orders apostates to be killed .
In Iran an academic was condemned to death for criticizing clerical rule in Iran .
The rulers assert that he was insulting Muhammad and Shi'ite laws .
He was charged with apostasy .
This analysis tracks the application of apostasy laws around the world , citing many examples .
Apostates are those who leave Islam , like Salman Rushdie ( see the linked article in no .
three , above ) , whether they become atheists or convert to another religion .
They are supposed to be killed according to the Quran , the hadith , and later legal rulings .
See the previous point no .
three for acts that entail leaving Islam according to Islamic law .
Here are the articles that support reason no .
two .
This is a short , but full article on apostasy , citing Quranic verses and hadith passages .
Sayyid Maududi , a respected Islamic scholar , in this booklet argues that Sura 9:11 — 12 refers to apostates and that they should be put to death ( scroll down to ' The Proof in the Quran for the Commandment to Execute Apostates ' ) .
This Muslim website has an overview of Islam on apostates .
They should be given time to repent , but if they refuse , they must be killed .
And the number one reason why sharia is bad for all societies . . .
1. Islam commands offensive and aggressive and unjust jihad .
Muhammad is foundational to Islam , and he set the genetic code for Islam , waging war .
In the ten years that he lived in Medina from his Hijrah ( Emigration ) from Mecca in AD 622 to his death of a fever in AD 632 , he either sent out or went out on seventy — four raids , expeditions , or full — scale wars .
They range from small assassination hit squads to kill anyone who insulted him , to the Tabuk Crusades in late AD 630 against the Byzantine Christians .
He had heard a rumor that an army was mobilizing to invade Arabia , but the rumor was false , so his 30,000 jihadists returned home , but not before imposing a jizya tax on northern Christians and Jews .
Money flowed into the Islamic treasury .
So why would Muhammad get a revelation to dry up this money flow ?
What are some of the legalized rules of jihad found in the Quran , hadith , and classical legal opinions ?
(1) Women and children are enslaved .
They can either be sold , or the Muslims may ' marry ' the women , since their marriages are automatically annulled upon their capture .
( 2 ) Jihadists may have sex with slave women .
Ali , Muhammad 's cousin and son — in — law , did this .
( 3 ) Women and children must not be killed during war , unless this happens in a nighttime raid when visibility was low .
( 4 ) Old men and monks could be killed .
( 5 ) A captured enemy of war could be killed , enslaved , ransomed for money or an exchange , freely released , or beaten .
One time Muhammad even tortured a citizen of the city of Khaybar in order to extract information about where the wealth of the city was hidden .
( 6 ) Enemy men who converted could keep their property and small children .
This law is so excessive that it amounts to forced conversion .
Only the strongest of the strong could resist this coercion and remain a non —Muslim .
( 7 ) Civilian property may be confiscated .
( 8 ) Civilian homes may be destroyed .
( 9 ) Civilian fruit trees may be destroyed .
( 10 ) Pagan Arabs had to convert or die .
This does not allow for the freedom of religion or conscience .
( 11 ) People of the Book ( Jews and Christians ) had three options ( Sura 9:29 ) : fight and die ; convert and pay a forced ' charity ' or zakat tax ; or keep their Biblical faith and pay a jizya or poll tax .
The last two options mean that money flows into the Islamic treasury , so why would Muhammad receive a revelation to dry up this money flow ?
Thus , jihad is aggressive , coercive , and excessive , and Allah never revealed to Muhammad to stop these practices .
For an analysis of the Christian Crusades and the Islamic Crusades , click here .
For the supporting article of reason no .
one , please go here .
It also has a segment on the differences between jihad in Islam and the wars in the Old Testament .
Another article on that topic can be read here .
There are vast differences between Islam and Judaism on this topic .
Therefore , Islam is violent — unjustly and aggressively .
Conclusion
The nightmare must end .
Sharia oppresses the citizens of Islamic countries .
Islam must reform , but the legal hierarchy in Islamic nations will not do this because the judges and legal scholars understand the cost : many passages in the Quran and the hadith must be rejected , and this they can not do .
After all , the Quran came down directly from Allah through Gabriel , so says traditional theology .
So how can Islam reform ?
But reform it must .
It can start by rewriting classical fiqh ( interpretations of law ) .
Again , though , that would mean leaving behind the Quran and Muhammad 's example .
How can the legal hierarchy in Islamic nations do this ?
In contrast , the West has undergone the Enlightenment or the Age of Reason ( c. 1600 — 1800 + ) , so western law has been injected with a heavy dose of reason .
Also , the New Testament tempers excessive punishments .
At least when Christianity reformed ( c. 1400 — 1600 ) , the reformers went back to the New Testament , which preaches peace and love .
So religion and reason in the West permit justice to be found more readily — the Medieval Church is not foundational to Christianity ; only Jesus and the New Testament are .
Can Islamic countries benefit from an Enlightenment that may deny the Quran and the hadith ?
This seems impossible .
Islamic law threatens Muslims with death if they criticize Muhammad and the Quran , not to mention denying them .
Since Islamic law cannot be reformed without doing serious damage to original and authentic Islam — the one taught by Muhammad — then a second plan must be played out .
Sharia must never spread around the world .
At least that much is clear and achievable .
The hard evidence in this article demonstrates beyond doubt that sharia does not benefit any society , for it contains too many harsh rules and punishments .
One of the most tragic and under — reported occurrences in the West in recent years is the existence of a sharia court in Canada .
Muslims are pushing for a sharia divorce courting Australia as well .
Having a court of arbitration if it is based on western law and legal theory is legitimate , but sharia does not hold to this standard .
Whether sharia is imposed gradually or rapidly , Canada should promptly shut down any sharia court , and Australia should never allow one .
Such a court should never be permitted in the US , the rest of the West , or anywhere else in the world that is battling Islam .
It is true that the Enlightenment teaches tolerance , but it also teaches critical thinking and reasoning .
Sharia cannot stand up under scrutiny .
It is intolerant and excessive , and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics teaches the West that excess is never just .
Thankfully , the province of Quebec , Canada , has forbidden sharia .
This is the right initiative .
Sharia ultimately degrades society and diminishes freedom .

Supplemental material :
In private emails to me or on websites , Muslim apologists ( defenders ) claim that the Islamic way of dealing with vices is superior to the western way , even in Islam 's punishments like flogging and stoning .
It is true that the West is filled with decadence , but are Islamic countries pure and pristine through and through , as these Muslim apologists imply ?
To anyone whose mind has not been clouded by a lifetime of devotion to Islam , the answer to this rhetorical question is obvious .
Alcohol and other intoxicants and gambling serve as test cases .
This article says that Bahrain , an island and independent sate that is connected to Saudi Arabia by a causeway , provides a ' breathing lung ' for Saudis because this Islamic island allows the free flow of alcohol and a night life .
The words ' breathing lung ' in Bahrain mean that Saudi Arabia suffocates people .
On the weekends an average of 40,000 cars line up to cross the bridge .
This article discusses the smuggling of alcohol in Saudi Arabia and says :
" Western analysts note that alcohol smuggling of the magnitude underway in Saudi Arabia —— perhaps tens of millions of dollars ' worth of illegal merchandise annually — — would likely involve the complicity of Saudi customs agents and perhaps a higher — level patron . "
This article reveals how Iranians get around the official ban on alcohol , like beer and vodka and other intoxicants , like opium .
A black market has sprung up — just like the one in America during Prohibition .
This article says that even though the Taliban , the tyrants who formerly ruled Afghanistan , outlawed the growth of poppies , which are the source of opium , the leaders of the Taliban may have profited from the drug trade .
The new and democratic government has a hard time keeping this drug under control .
This article says that authorities in Turkey threaten to imprison online gamblers , and this page links to a report ( scroll to the second one ) that discusses how Turkey must deal with the problem of monetary interest , alcohol , and gambling .
It is revealing to see how Muslim religious leaders try to squirm out of Quranic laws against interest , in order to help Islamic financial institutions make money .
The purpose of these links is not to condemn Islamic countries or to assert that the West is better than they are .
Facts say that the West has many problems .
Rather , the purpose is to demonstrate that Islamic countries have their share of problems as well .
This means that Islamic countries are also decadent .
This means that Islamic punishments do not work entirely ( except by scare tactics ) , but they can drive the sin or crime underground .
A 15 - year - old girl ’s effort to start a Caucasian Club at her California high school has won her some support — and an avalanche of anger .
Freshman Lisa McClelland gathered about 250 signatures from students and adults to start a club at Freedom High School in Oakley , Calif. , that would focus attention on European heritage and history .
Her campaign has won the support of many students , not all of them white , who say such a group would be no different from the school ’s other ethnic clubs , which include the Black Student Union , the Latinos Unidos and the ALOHA club for Asian - American students .
“ I applaud Lisa McClelland .
She should be allowed to be proud of her heritage and want to know more about it just like anyone else , ” said one student on the high school ’s e-mail forum .
“ What a bunch of hypocrites when people start using the word ‘ racist . ’
Why is n’t the Latino club racist ?
Or the Asian or African - American club ? ”
But the Caucasian Club has run into opposition from those who accuse the club of fueling racial tension .
Darnell Turner , vice president of the East County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said he fears the club could morph into a white - supremacy group after Lisa graduates .
“ I think she ’s doing this for the right reasons , but what ’s going to happen when she graduates ?
What ’s it going to turn into ? ” said Mr. Turner , who added he was speaking for himself and not the NAACP .
He suggested that she change the name to the European - American Club so that the focus would be on heritage , not race .
Lou Calabro , president of the European - American Issues Forum , said he spoke with Lisa on Wednesday when she called to ask for advice .
Since then , he ’s become an informal adviser for the would - be club .
On Friday , he sent letters to two civil - rights organizations requesting an investigation of the school administration .
In the letters , he accused Principal Eric Volta of “ resisting the formation of the club ” because it “ would upset the alleged current positive feelings at the school , ” said Mr. Calabro in a letter to the U.S. Department of Education ’s Office for Civil Rights .
He cited e-mail he received from Lisa on Friday describing her difficulty in finding an adviser for the club and threats from other students .
She also said that teachers are allowing students to place fliers around campus criticizing her campaign .
“ She ’s scared , ” said Mr. Calabro , who said he receives three to five letters a month from students interested in starting such clubs .
“ One white football player called her [ obscene epithets ] .
Others are calling her names .
She ’s only 15 , so naturally she ’s upset . ”

Worst Pickup Line Ever December 18 , 2006
I ran across this essay that discusses the relationship between IQ and success in society .
It summarizes the state of research in psychometrics up to 1995 .
Here are some correlations that appear to be strong .
Remember that correlation does not equal causation .
Remember this does not mean all people in a group are like this , but a statistically significant percentage are .
Low IQ is correlated with poor academic performance , poverty , and criminality .
Low IQ is correlated with low IQ parents and low socio-economic status .
IQ appears to be immutable .
Better education does not improve IQ substantially .
On IQ tests , Asians score higher than average , while blacks and Latinos score lower than average .
Whites are average .
If these statistics are true , then blacks and Latinos could become a permanent underclass in a globalized world that devalues manual labor and enriches a high IQ elite .
Since most people mate with someone within their same socio- economic class , the low and high IQ groups will become more firmly entrenched .
This disparity can lead to social instability and is undesirable in a country that aspires to give every child a fair shot at a comfortable middle class life .
I propose that black & Hispanic women mate with high IQ Asian men .
This solves many problems at once .
Black & Hispanic women have a hard time meeting eligible men who can , or are willing to , support a family .
On the other hand , high IQ Asian men have a hard time meeting women and are perpetually single .
Get these two groups together and they can produce children that will be closer to the white IQ average .
Problem solved .
Unfortunately , it ’s very difficult to explain all this to low IQ , yet smoking hot , black & Hispanic women .
I have n’t been able to condense this into a quick pickup line yet .
The line , “ how would you like to make some smart babies tonight ” , has gotten me slapped several times .
Anyone got a better idea ?

あなたが誰かのことを知りたいと思っていて、5つだけ質問できると想像してみよう。そしたらどんなことを聞く?
一番知りたいことは何 ?
当然コンテキストにもよるだろう——その人がデートの相手なのか、採用面接を受けに来た人なのか、顧客なのか、娘のデートの相手なのかに応じて、聞くことは違うだろう。だけど
本当のところ、私たちはユーザにデートの相手とは別なことを聞くべきなのだろうか?
あなたが受けたアンケートを思い出してみて。カンファレンスの登録や、雑誌とかオンラインニュースサイトの申し込みをするときには、たぶんこんな質問をされているだろう:

2 ) あなたの予算はどれくらいですか ?
3 ) 購入予定のものはありますか [ 分野を限らず、いつごろかを合わせてお答えください]
4 ) あなたは購入を決定する立場ですか ?
これを言い換えると、 「あなたは我々の広告主やスポンサーにとってどれだけ有用なのか?」ということだ。こういうアンケートには「我々に興味があるのは、おたくがどれくらい買えるのか
ってことだけだ」と言われているように感じる。
カスタマサーベイであれば、たぶんこんな質問をされる:
1 ) 年齢は ?
2 ) 性別は ?
3 ) お子様は何歳ですか ?
4 ) 所得は ?
5 ) 持ち家ですか、それとも借家ですか ?
これを言い換えると、 「我々に興味があるのは、統計上おたくみたいな人たちにどうすればもっと売ることができるかということだけだ」
こういった質問で私個人についてわかることはあまりない。もし熱烈なユーザを手にしたいなら、彼らが気にかけていることを気にかけるべきではないか?
もちろん顧客に聞くには不適当な個人的質問というのもあるが、ここにいる私たちの多くは、ユーザとのより個人的な繋がりを持とうと努力しており、それは彼らを個々の人間としてよく知ることができるよう振る舞うということ なのだ。
最近 「あなたがおそらく私について知らないだろう5つのこと」( Five Things You Probably Don't Know About Me ) というミームが飛び交っているのを目にしているんじゃないかと思う。私も楽しんで読んでいる。素敵なブロガーが何人か私にもバトンを渡してくれた:

だけど、私はあなたについて知ることのほうに興味がある——私たちがすごく多くのことを学んでいるすばらしい読者であるあなた方のことを知りたい。それでお願いなのだけど、この後に書く5つの質問のいくつか、あるいは全部にコメント欄で答えてほしい——あるいはあなたのブログででもいい(書いたら教えて)。これは
今回の話の始めに戻ることになる。私はどんな5つの質問をすべきか?
私がよく最初に聞くのは「他の人たちに読んでほしいと思う本は何?」という質問だ。でもこれはすでにみんなに聞いていて、そしてその結果すばらしい読書リストができた。私がそのほかに知りたいと思う5つ(くらい)のことをあげてみよう:

The editor of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry needs to have his head examined
The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry recently published a paper on the relationship between smoking and post - traumatic stress disorder .
This newspaper report on the article starts out okay : “ Post - trauma mental health disturbances such as post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) are associated with increased smoking , either by starting to smoke or an increase of tobacco use , ” write Dr Peter G Van der Velden , of the Institute for Psychotrauma , Zaltbommel , the Netherlands , and colleagues .
That certainly makes sense .
The article continues :
However , few trauma studies have examined whether smoking is a risk factor , or “ marker ” for PTSD or other mental health disorders following a disaster .
That seems a reasonable thing to test as well .
You find a bunch of smokers and non-smokers before a traumatic event .
You subject them to a traumatic event .
Then you see how they fare .
It wo n’t tell you anything about the impact that smoking has on coping with trauma , but it will tell you something about whether the kind of people who smoke might fare better or worse in response to a tragedy .
To look into that aspect , the researchers conducted surveys 18 months and 4 years after a fireworks disaster in Enschede , the Netherlands .
Included were 662 adult victims and 526 residents of another Dutch city who were used as a comparison group .
Oops …by surveying victims for the first time 18 months after the disaster we cannot even answer the question about whether the kind of people who smoke respond badly to tragedy because they are classifying people as smokers based on whether they smoke 18 months after the event .
If you look back up to the first passage in italics in this blog post , you will see that we already know that people start to smoke after traumatic events .
Presumably , the harder the tragedy hits you , the more likely you are to take up smoking .
Of course , you could ask people whether they smoked before the tragedy , but it appears that these researchers did n’t bother , or at least are n’t using the information ( or maybe they do but it is n’t mentioned in this media report ) .
Victims who smoked at the first evaluation were more than twice as likely as those who did not smoke to have severe anxiety symptoms , nearly twice as likely to have severe hostility symptoms , and close to three times as likely to have a diagnosis of disaster - related PTSD at the 4 - year evaluation .
Interesting , perhaps , but I have no idea how to interpret the result .
One thing I can guarantee you I would not conclude with any confidence is what the authors conclude :
If these findings are confirmed by other studies , disaster victims who smoke may be able to reduce their risk of developing mental health disturbances if they quit smoking , Van der Velden and colleagues conclude .
What ?!
For starters , there is nothing in the study about quitting smoking — only about people who do smoke .
Second , where do they get the idea this relationship is causal , or that the direction of causality runs from smoking to anxiety rather than vice - versa ?
This is not too different than advising sick people to avoid hospitals because people who visit hospitals die at a much higher rate than people who do n’t .
Or me thinking that if I wear a Bulls jersey with the number 23 , I will win an NBA championship .
( Thanks to David Jones for pointing out this study . )
Anyone who has poked around in the Scheme or Functional Programming community has no doubt heard about PLT , or at least one of its projects , which include DrScheme and the book How To Design Programs .
PLT is a group of people spread across four universities that works on a number of projects , some of which involve making really cool software , and others which involve teaching programming .
They ’ve created a complete graphical programming environment called DrScheme , which includes a Scheme interpreter , various Scheme libraries , and an IDE written in Scheme using their libraries .
It even has its own HTML renderer that is used to implement the Help Desk feature of DrScheme .
They ’ve used PLT Scheme ( the umbrella name for the different distributions of their Scheme implementation ) to build :
A PLT web server , which presumably is used to host their own website , which is well designed .
A Slideshow application , which Matthew Flatt uses for in - class presentations
PLaneT , a package repository for PLT Scheme
Four of them wrote a great introductory programming book , How To Design Programs , ( HtDP ) which covers a lot of practical programming concepts that were sadly skipped over in my C. S. program .
Using HtDP , they have a TeachScheme !
project , which aims to “ turn Computing and Programming into an indispensable part of the liberal arts curriculum ” [ 1 ] .
This is an important goal .
Even if most people in other fields do n’t program as part of their job , I think it ’s a good idea for them to learn enough to understand the process of programming , as it often effects their work .
HtDP starts at a level that most high school student ought to be able to understand , while still being interesting to a graduate of a state university ’s C. S. program .
That is an impressive achievment .
I think that in order to make a really good learning organization , you ’ve got to have ambitious projects and invite all members to participate .
PLT certainly has more than its share of ambitious projects – a Scheme compiler , language extensions , a portable GUI framework , a web server and application framework , a package repository , and an HTML renderer .
The same could be said about MIT , with their wide variety of operating systems , graphics , and compiler projects .
It should be possible for any school to work on something along those lines .
The first step would be for a member of faculty to start an ambitious project , and invite students to participate ( hopefully with pay for anyone who does substantial research ) .
To start an ambitious project , you need something to work on .
Fortunately , there are a lot of ideas already out there , and it ’s not that hard to come up with an idea .
In the words of John Locke :
The acts of the mind , wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas , are chiefly these three : 1 . Combining several simple ideas into one compound one , and thus all complex ideas are made .
2 . The second is bringing two ideas , whether simple or complex , together , and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once , without uniting them into one , by which it gets all its ideas of relations .
3 . The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence : this is called abstraction , and thus all its general ideas are made .
John Locke , An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1690 )
A lot of programming projects are started by a programmer noticing problems that take lots of repetetive work to solve , and coming up with useful abstractions .
Ruby On Rails was started this way .
There ’s a very good chance that the next big thing will as well .

Most developers are familiar with the desktop metaphor that dominates the modern - day computer experience .
This metaphor has evolved over the past 30 years , giving rise to distinct classes of interface elements that we expect to find in every OS : desktop , icons , files , folders , windows , etc .
While this metaphor makes sense at the office — and perhaps even at home — it does not translate well into a collaborative environment such as the one that the OLPC laptops will embody .
Therefore , we have adopted a new set of metaphors that emphasize community .
While there are some correlations between the Sugar UI and those of traditional desktops , there are also clear distinctions .
It is these distinctions that are the subject of the remainder of this section .
We highlight the reasoning behind our shift in perspective and detail functionality with respect to the overall laptop experience .
Though multitasking has become somewhat of a standard in today 's desktop computing world , we 've chosen to break away from this model , instead adopting a fullscreen activity view that focuses the children 's energies on one specific task at a time .
Although one may have several activities open in the activity ring at any given moment , only one can be denoted as the active activity ( similar to focus in a window system ) .
Several factors contributed to this decision : first , although the laptops have an extremely high - resolution display — 200 d pi — the actual viewing area remains quite small — a modest 7.5 - inch diagonal — leaving little room for multiple activities on the screen ; second , as noted , it naturally focuses efforts on a specific task .
The Frame detailed below serves as the interstitial tissue between activities .
As a visual extention of the Journal , it enables objects to move between activities .
Zooming in from the Home view , a child finds the Activity view .
This view contains the activities where all of the actual creation , exploration , and collaboration takes place .
This is where you , the developer , come into play , providing new and engaging tools , extending the functionality and encouraging new types of creative exploration .
While the Neighborhood view does n't currently provide any true spatial or geographical data , it does provide an at - a - glance social geography of the mesh and its participants .
Similar to the Groups view , launching an activity here implicitly opens that activity up for anyone in the Neighborhood to join .
While no one receives an explicit invitation in this case , the newly started activity will appear in the view , with its participants clustered about it , so that anyone who wishes to may join .
Of course , this also means that the Neighborhood provides an excellent space for exploration .
Here , one can both search for , locate and join activities of interest using a powerful and adaptable search technology , and also interact with and make friends with other children in their neighborhood they have n't yet met .
Zooming out one more step we reach the Neighborhood view .
Here children can see everyone on their local mesh .
At this level we intend to support a variety of views , each with a different focus : the individuals ; the activities in which they are presently engaged ; etc .
In the figure , individuals are shown clustered around their currently active activities , providing a direct visual representation of the popularity of an activity , since group size is immediately perceptible .
Groups have several advantages .
First , it allows the children to view their friends , classmates , and other groups , and allows them to freely chat with them as well .
Additionally , each group will have its own private Bulletin Board where members can post notes and share Objects .
Finally , all of the members of the selected group — a child 's friends , for instance — receive invitations whenever the child starts an activity from the Groups view , making collaboration implicit .
Moreover , this view allows the child to see what activities their class , friends , and other groups are presently engaged in , providing the opportunity to join any non-private activities .
Already , you can see how this view changes the usual method of application launch , allowing one to start new networked activities or join existing ones directly .
In addition to several special classes of groups , children may also generate groups on their own .
This might provide a way for a close group of friends to keep up with each other 's activities , or for a group of aspiring photographers to share photos .
In a classroom setting , this provides a way for the children to create temporary groups for working on classroom exercises , or long term groups for extended projects .
To create a group , a child can search for or select any number of individuals on the mesh .
Each of these individuals will receive an invitation to join the group , and upon accepting the invitation will have its name added to their list of Groups , where they can see and chat with members , and post to the group Bulletin Board .
Although one person initially creates a group , groups are not managed .
Instead , people may choose to leave a group on their own , and anyone in the group may invite other members into it .
When this happens , all current group members receive introduction notification , making them aware of the new member .
This open model simplifies the interaction and encourages the learning of natural social dynamics instead of attempting to enforce them via rules and restrictions .
The Groups view takes a small step back from the child 's
Home space , opening up to include their circle of friends , their classmates , and any other groups to which a child belongs .
The Friends group essentially represents a spatially viewable and editable buddy list .
From here the child can add or remove friends and move individuals around , perhaps arranging them logically .
The Class group is defined dynamically , and includes all others in the same class , and their teachers as well .
This group provides the perfect space for working and sharing with classmates , posting projects for class critique , or for picking up the homework assignment the teacher posted to the class Bulletin Board .
When used in conjunction with the Bulletin Board , the Home view becomes the most direct correlate to a typical PC desktop as a place for keeping things handy : tomorrow 's homework , a drawing one is working on , a favorite song , a reminder to oneself to do one 's chores , etc .
The Home view interface is minimalistic .
In the center of the screen , the XO icon —rendered in the child 's user - specified colors — represents the child to whom the laptop belongs .
The activity ring surrounds the character , indicating all of the currently open activities .
Furthermore , the section of the ring that a given activity occupies directly represents the amount of memory that the particular activity requires to run , providing immediate visual feedback about memory constraints and exposing a means for resource management that does n't require knowledge of the underlying architecture .
Most activity management happens here : starting new private activities , ending current activities , and switching between activities .
Of all the zoom levels , the Home view relates most closely to the traditional desktop .
As the first screen presented to the child at startup , it serves as a starting point for the exploration of both the mesh network and also of personal activities and objects .
From this view , the child may either back up first to their Groups — such as their Friends or their Class — and beyond that to a view of the entire mesh Neighborhood , or , instead , zoom in to focus on a particular Activity .
The mesh network is a permanent fixture of the laptop environment and is represented explicitly in the interface .
A zoom is used to relate four discrete views , each of which caters to a particular set of goals : Home , Groups , Neighborhood , and Activity .
Using keyboard shortcuts or controls in the Frame , children may zoom in and out on the mesh community .
Though rare , some urgent notifications such as low battery levels may override the Frame , automatically bringing it into view without user interaction .
These overrides come from the system only ; applications do not have privileges for override , although they may alert the user via standard notifications .
In addition to trackpad - based activation , the information within the Frame lies just one keystroke away .
A dedicated key has two modes of functionality : ( 1 ) momentary presses act as a toggle , turning the Frame on and off with each press ; and ( 2 ) holding the key down , the Frame will appear on screen until release of the key .
This latter method provides a quick way to glance at incoming invitations or other system status elements for a brief moment and then return full focus to the activity view itself .
Hot corners serve as the Frame 's primary invocation method .
As Fitts '
Law implies , the corners are the easiest part of the screen to hit with a cursor .
Moving the cursor to any corner of the screen will instantly invoke the frame .
From a corner , one can readily scroll along an edge in search of a desired element .
Since newly added people , objects , and invitations insert from the corners , the latest invitation , clipping , or participant is always close at hand .
Notifications , the third aspect of the Actions edge of the frame , function slightly differently .
While they do n't represent an activity that the child can join , they do come as messages from activities or from the system , conveying important information about the state of the activity or system status such as battery strength or wireless signal .
Though slightly different from activities and invitations , these notifications still require some action on the child 's part , and are an appropriate addition to the frame which provides a convenient way to access them from within any view .
Just as in the other edges of the frame , invitations and notifications organize by time , the most recent always in the lower left - hand corner , so that the child may handle them in a timely manner .
The bottom edge of the frame functions primarily as an activity launcher , but it also accumulates both incoming invitations and notifications .
As a starting point for instantiating activities , this part of the frame is fairly straightforward .
Whenever an activity receives a click , a colored instance of that activity appears within the activity ring in the child 's own colors , and invitations are automatically sent as appropriate .
On the other hand , anytime the child receives an invitation it appears as a colored activity icon ( in the color of the inviting XO , of course ) , clearly distinct from the uncolored outlines of the activities which reside on the child 's own machine .
Since an invitation to join an activity has no functional differences from starting , the invitations appropriately indicate this by their similar form .
The rollover state for these invitations allows the child to accept or decline the invitation , optionally providing a reason for declining .
With the presence of a clipboard which contains multiple items , it becomes necessary to add a means for selecting an active clipping as the source for any paste command .
Since the usual copy / paste keystrokes will quickly become familiar to all , any invocation of the copy shortcut will automatically place the resulting clipping at the top of the stack , selecting it as the source , so that a subsequent paste command behaves as expected .
When not using these traditional shortcuts , a single click on any object in the clipboard will select it , visibly indicating it as the new source .
Additional copy commands ( or drags ) will continue to add elements to the clipboard stack .
Once the clipboard reaches a predefined limit , the elements at the bottom of the stack will begin to drop off making room for the new ones .
Elements may also be removed explicitly by the user via their contextual rollover , and a modified paste shortcut for advanced users will serve to both paste an item and pop it from the stack at the same time .
On the laptops , the clipboard takes the form of the left - hand edge of the frame .
This region serves as temporary storage for objects - a paper , an image , a sentence , a URL - facilitating their transfer among activities and , perhaps more importantly , among the various zoom levels .
Any type of object that can be stored in the Journal can likewise be transported via the clipboard .
A child may place an object on the clipboard in a couple of convenient ways .
First , keyboard shortcuts will provide an interface for simple copy and paste functions in the way already familiar to us .
Additionally , since objects support direct manipulation , the child may simply drag a photo , file , or selection onto the frame in order to copy it , and may then drag it out to paste it in another location , such as within another activity , on a friend , or to a Bulletin Board .
As items are placed on the clipboard , they are arranged temporally in a push - down stack , the most recent clipping appearing in the upper - lefthand corner of the frame .
The clipboard has become a staple in any modern operating system .
Nonetheless , its implementations have changed little , if at all , in decades .
The clipboard has one " page " , to which you can copy to , cut to , and paste from , and in most cases this hypothetical page remains invisible : to see what 's on it , you 've got to paste its contents .
While this is n't strictly true ( On Mac OSX , for instance , an item at the bottom of the ' Edit ' menu allows you to ' View Clipboard Contents ' ) , most users are oblivious about viewing its contents , as one must explicitly seek it out .
This basic model , while simple , often falls short of many use cases .
Thus , OLPC has extended the traditional clipboard , empowering the user with added functionality without increasing complexity .
On the other side of the Places edge resides the Bulletin - Board button .
Again , this button has an analogous key on right - hand side of the keyboard 's function keys .
Discussed later , this button acts as a toggle for an auxiliary layer which can provide contextual chat and a place to share objects .
This button functions within the Places bar because it acts as a modifier to any view .
In a sense , it adds an additional layer of context to any other " place " on the laptop .
Of the various frame components , the Places category is the most abstract .
However , it also emphasizes the metaphors that the zoom levels build upon .
In the upper left - hand corner reside the zoom buttons , which can instantly transition the user among the Activity , Home , Groups , and Neighborhood views .
For clarity , the upper left - hand function buttons on the keyboard have identical icons and functionality .
As previously mentioned , the presence of others on the mesh defines much of the laptop experience .
In order to surface this at all times in the interface , the right - hand edge of the Frame provides an easily accessible list of all the individuals a child is collaborating with in the currently active activity , represented by their colored XOs .
This has a number of benefits .
First , it provides a quick reference to the people the child is working with , which updates as new people join and others leave .
As new people arrive , they appear in the upper right corner , and as they leave they simply vacate their current location .
Additionally , the secondary rollovers for these XO objects reveal biographical information about them : name , age , class , interests , and even a small photo .
This makes the frame a great resource for meeting new friends , for what better place to meet them than in the activity shared with them ?
At a high level , one can consider the frame in two parts :
The left , top , and right sides of the frame represent nouns : things , places , and persons .
The bottom of the frame represents those elements that require action : activities , invitations , and notifications .
More specifically , each edge of the frame is dedicated to one of people , places , objects , or actions .
When activated , the Frame slides in atop the currently visible view , providing access to needed functionality , yet quickly retracting from view once the task for which the child invoked it ends .
Although these transitions happen quickly , a forgiveness parameter prevents unintentional Frame retraction in hopes of making interaction with this interface element completely natural .
Glancing at the previous screen shots , you might have noted the absence of a menu bar or other form of persistent interface element .
Such a persistent element reduces the screen space available for activities ; since screen is at a premium , we have opted to use a frame — always on the periphery and just out of sight — to contain all of the peripheral information that a child might need , across all views .
Since the Frame persists at all zoom levels , it provides a consistent place for those interface elements which apply to all views , including search , incoming invitations and notifications , a clipboard , and buddies you are currently interacting with .
Finally , the shared space the Bulletin Boards provide take on a slightly different , yet quite powerful meaning at the Activity level .
Again , contextual to the current view , each activity has its own shared Bulletin - board .
Posts to this layer provide supporting materials for the underlying activity that other participants in the activity may view ( Or , if they 'd like , keep for themselves ) .
This actually means a great deal , since any object at all can be shared this way , including many objects that the activity itself may not provide support for .
For instance , though one could n't paste a song inside a drawing ( no compound document ) , a song posted to the Bulletin Board layer could provide inspiration for it .
Similarly , it provides a means of collecting materials relevant to the task at hand within the activity .
Rather than having 5 individuals each pasting images of a shark directly into the drawing , they could instead post them to the Bulletin Board for others to see and discuss before deciding which to use as a basis for the drawing .
Thus , Bulletin Boards provide a space for gathering research and supporting materials , and holding discussions around both them and the activity .
From the Friends and Mesh view , the Bulletin Board serves as a place to share interesting things a child has found or created with friends , and the entire mesh respectively .
The important thing to remember with regard to sharing , of course , is that " Share this JPEG ( or GIF or SVG or any other picture format ) file with Bob and Sue " translates to " Share this photo ( or picture ) with Bob and Sue . "
The sharing metaphor functions much more naturally than the file transfer systems we 're used to , since file transfer really just represents a technical implementation of the more abstract idea of sharing in the first place .
Of course , children can also view the things that others have posted as well .
Moreover , as a community space , group sharing occurs naturally .
In the Home view , for instance , only the child to whom the laptop belongs has access to the contents of the Bulletin Board .
Here , the Bulletin Board provides a convenient area for the temporary storage of objects and activities , as well as those things kept around for quick access : tomorrow 's homework assignment , the pictures taken last week , the book the child is reading , a favorite game .
In this way , the traditional desktop that the zoom levels replaced finds its way back through the Home view Bulletin Board .
The functionality described here mimics the traditional desktop to some extent .
Note that the contextual chat bubbles are also available in the Home view , providing a mechanism for writing " notes - to - self " .
The Bulletin Board metaphor emphasizes a temporary and ever changing space for placing objects , distinctly separate from the space in which they are stored .
This may prevent the common overuse of the desktop as the primary place to store everything , which limits its usefulness as a quick way to find the files that matter most at any given point in time .
In addition to contextual chats , Bulletin Boards provide a space for sharing .
Any object may be posted to a Bulletin Board for others to look at and enjoy and to pass on to others , promoting viral sharing .
The sharing environment is an integral element of all views .
As a transparent layer above any view , the Bulletin Board provides a spatially contextual chatting interface .
This means that , unlike traditional forum - style threads that organize temporally , chat bubbles may be freely positioned on screen .
Discussions formulate around specific areas of the activity beneath .
Annotation - style comments open the door to a wide variety of conversational interactions .
In a drawing of the ocean , for instance , one conversation could be happening below the water 's surface , while another group of children discuss what kind of birds fly through the sky .
In another situation , one child could remotely assist another in learning how to use a new activity , pointing out specific interface elements with detailed descriptions of their functionality .
In a literary application , child or teacher could proofread another child 's story , correcting spelling mistakes , pointing out grammatical errors , and sharing thoughts about specific sections of the story without directly editing the work on the activity layer beneath .
Context is key to the usefulness of Bulletin Boards on the laptops .
A button in the Places edge of the Frame toggles the Bulletin Board layer on and off , and although only one button exists for this purpose , each view among the various zoom levels has its own Bulletin Board .
The scope of individuals who have access to a given Bulletin Board matches the scope of individuals that the view currently represents .
For example , any items posted to the Home view Bulletin Board may only be seen by the child that posted them , effectively providing a traditional desktop environment .
Likewise , anyone within the child 's list of Friends may view things the child has posted to the Friends view Bulletin Board , and all of a child 's classmates and her teacher can view her posts to the Class Bulletin Board ; the Mesh view Bulletin Board provides an environment for sharing with the entire laptop community .
Furthermore , each activity has its own Bulletin Board , providing a space for sharing files and ideas surrounding the activity itself that do n't have a place within it .
Since the laptops have implicit connectivity via the mesh network , an additional layer of the UI has been designed to take advantage of it : Bulletin Boards .
Taken literally , the Bulletin Boards provide a space for posting things .
While Bulletin - boards provide a layer of abstraction on top of any given activity , the View Source button allows one to look behind the activity , peeling away layers of abstraction in order to reveal the underlying codebase which makes it tick .
This feature will integrate cleanly with the Develop activity , encouraging children to view , modify , and redistribute variations on the activities they use .
Through collaboration and sharing , a garden of home grown activities will begin to develop on the laptops , created by the children themselves .
The Journal
The Notion of " Keeping "
We believe that the traditional " open " and " save " model commonly used for files today will fade away , and with it the familiar floppy disk icon .
The laptops do not have floppy drives , and the children who use them will probably never see one of these obsolete devices .
Instead , a more general notion of what it means to " keep " things will prevail .
Generally speaking , we keep things which offer value , allowing the rest to disappear over time .
The Journal 's primary function as a time - based view of a child 's activities reinforces this concept .
Most of us heard the " save early , save often " mantra , largely ignored it , and incurred the consequences .
The laptops aim to eliminate this concern by making automatic backups .
This lets the children focus on the activity itself .
Incremental backups occur regularly and are also triggered by such activity events as changes in scope , new participants , etc .
To cater to the many types of editing environment needs , activities can also specify " keep - hints " which prompt the system to keep a copy .
For instance , a drawing activity may trigger a keep - hint before executing an " erase " operation immediately preceded by a " select all " .
Of course , a child may choose to invoke a keep - hint by selecting the " keep in journal " button , but the increasing adoption of this new concept of keeping should ultimately eliminate this .
Based on the Object model associated with files , each kept Object is , technically speaking , a separate instance of the activity which created it .
This eliminates the need to " open " a file from within an activity , replacing the act of opening with the act of resuming a previous activity instance .
Of course , a child will have the option to resume a drawing with a different set of brushes , or resume an essay with a different pen , providing " open with " style functionality , but no substitute for an " open " command will exist within an activity 's interface .
Deprecating Hierarchy
Temporal Organization
Along with the idea of implicit keeping , the laptops will drastically minimize the hierarchical filesystem as a means for organization , replacing it with a temporally organized list of activities and events , furthering the Journal metaphor .
This drastically simplifies the auto - keeping behavior , since it eliminates the need to specify a location in which a newly started activity should be kept ; naturally , the newly started activity will appear as the most recent entry in the journal .
Temporal organization functions naturally in the absence of explicit or hierarchical methods , since humankind 's intrinsic relationship to time gives them , at the very least , a relative notion of " how long ago " something happened .
By moving back through the Journal , a child can simply locate the period in time within which she knows she made something , and then employ additional use of searching , filtering , and sorting to pinpoint exactly what she 's looking for .
Falloff
Due to the laptops ' limitations in storage capacity , the potential exists for the Journal to contain so many entries that no more may be written .
However , the frequency of such occurrences is limited by temporal falloff , which tidies up the Journal contents and keeps space available for new entries .
One might think of this as an intelligent combination of garbage collection and disk defragmentation .
The driving principle here is that of temporal granularity , derived directly from our very capacity for human memory .
Our minds , generally speaking , maintain a high level of granularity with respect to very recent events , but only a low granularity for events from several years ago .
Moreover , this granularity tends to follow a logarithmic curve , where the past few minutes remain quite clear , the past few hours more blurry , and by last month quite vague .
When we look years into the past , only specifically memorable events stand out in our minds .
On the laptops the policies are a bit more strict , but the principle remains the same .
With a finite amount of memory , there must exist some means of managing what 's remembered , or kept ; and what 's forgotten , or erased .
An intelligent algorithm will assist children in identifying " forgotten " entries .
Taking into account how old an entry is , how many times she 's viewed it , how recently she 's worked on it , how many hours she 's worked on it , how many people she 's worked on it with , its tags , and even more forms of automatically generated metadata , the Journal can suggest to her those entries which it feels can be erased .
She will then have the opportunity to review those items prior to their erasure , if she wishes , and can keep any she still feels attached to .
In a time where gigabytes have become cheap , many of us still manage to fill our hard drives .
Excepting the cases of multimedia collections of audio or video files , much of that space is consumed by files we either do n't remember we ever made , or will never open again .
On the laptops , where space is precious , so too will be the objects and entries that remain in the journal years down the road .
The temporary , the experimental , the duplicate , and the unwanted files will naturally fall off the bottom , maintaining a browsable history of those that remain important to the children .
Journal Entries
Implicit
Implicit journal entries will be the most common .
These appear as the result of many kinds of a child 's interactions with her machine , but most commonly when engaging in an activity .
Other implicit entries might appear when she takes a photo , or receives a note from a friend , or downloads a file from the Web .
In all of these cases , the journal entry itself has a basic format which conveys important information about the event which created it .
Most importantly , the associated Object - the photo , the message , the drawing , the story - becomes embedded within the entry .
It also includes key metadata , such as its name , when it was made , and who collaborated on it .
The journal entry also provides some means to interact with it .
For instance , each entry has a description field where a child can tag it with meaningful related words which will make searching for it in the future a breeze .
This field will automatically receive any tags that the activity itself associates with the entry .
In addition to this tag field , several buttons will allow direct manipulation of the Object , making it possible to resume the activity , place the Object on the clipboard , send it to a friend , print it , or erase it , among others .
Note
In addition to implicit ones , children have the opportunity to create several special kinds of entries on their own .
The first of these , the Note , has the simplest form .
Taking a cue from a traditional journal , a Note entry simply provides a large text entry field .
This freeform entry allows the children to write down short descriptions of their day to day experiences , just as one would within a real journal .
Providing this layer of personalized entries further emphasizes the idea that the Journal really does provide more than a filesystem , as an actual record of events and interactions of the children with the laptop and with their peers .
In practice , children may also use this feature as a means of jotting down a note to themselves - a reminder .
In these instances , a simple control within the entry will turn the note into a " to - do " note .
As a to - do entry , it will have a checkbox indicating its completion status .
By filtering the Journal to show only these entries , it doubles as a basic to - do list , providing another useful tool for learning organizational skills .
Clipping
Clippings serve a slightly different purpose in the journal .
Similar in spirit to notes , a child can create a clipping from anywhere , or from within any activity on their laptop .
As an extension of the copy to clipboard idea , clippings copy a selection - some text from a chat session with a friend , an image from a web page , etc. - directly to the journal for safekeeping .
This provides a quick and easy way to keep a quick record of anything that you might want to keep around for future reference : a phone number , a link , a password , etc .
Event
Taking the temporal aspect of the Journal one step further , Events act like " future " journal entries .
By specifying a name for the event , a brief description , and a time , these Journal entries serve as a basic planning system .
A control within the entry also enables an audible alert , so that Events can act as alarms .
Events also tie in closely with some implicit actions of the laptops .
For instance , a child might want to go on a photo safari with her friend after school .
While still in class , she sends him an invitation to join a photo capture activity , but schedules a time of 3:00 .
He then receives an invitation , as usual , but upon accepting it receives an Event entry in the journal , with a reference to the scheduled activity , instead of immediately entering it .
When 3:00 arrives , both children receive notifications that their scheduled event is about to start , and join each other both physically outside and virtually in the referenced capture activity .
Progress Indicator
In many cases , entries will appear at one point in time but the desired result of the entry wo n't be immediate .
This might occur , for instance , when downloading a file from the Web , receiving a file from a friend , restoring a file from the server , or saving a large Object such as video or audio data .
All of these processes take some non-trivial length of time , and so when necessary , Journal entries will provide a progress indicator stage .
When the download , transfer , or task begins an entry will be created in the journal to indicate that .
This entry will include a progress bar with estimated time until completion ; once completed , it will transition to a standard entry .
This makes the Journal a consistent place to keep track of progress , and also provides an easy means to pause and resume transfers , which will prove extremely useful when in areas with intermittent connectivity .
The Power of Metadata
Despite the flatness of the Journal , finding past entries should n't prove difficult thanks to a tagging structure built from the ground up for the laptops .
By associating relevant descriptive words with each journal entry , searching for an entry becomes as easy as describing it .
These descriptions will manifest in two ways , tagging and metadata .
The former provide a straightforward manner for the children to describe and organize their stuff , while the latter provides a more technical means by which activities can associate relevant data and tags with all Journal entries they create .
Tagging
Tagging will become a fundamental process for all types of data and activities on the laptops .
Fortunately , children have a natural inclination to describe their world and the things they see and do .
This actually aids kids in learning , as they will enjoy describing the drawing they 've made , the stories they 've written , or the composition they produced , and can learn new vocabulary in doing so .
Of course , the kid - like desire to describe things does n't detract from the usefulness of this tag - based system as they grow older .
As such an integral part of the system , the tagging interface will be exposed in various places .
Of course , as mentioned , each journal entry will have a field for tags .
Likewise , each open activity instance will have a tag field adjacent to its name field , so that the act of naming a particular activity or Object becomes associated with describing it in their minds .
Additionally , activities could offer specific places within the interface for tagging to occur , such as in the description field for a photo the child just took .
Metadata
Metadata adds an additional level of sophistication to the tagging model .
Rather than thinking of this as data about data , consider it a means of tagging tags .
Metadata on the laptops will be an extension of the basic tagging model where the tag itself consists of a key : value pair .
Or , you could simply consider a tag to be a metadata pair with a null key .
Whichever way you look at it , this categorization of tags has powerful implications when it comes to organizing and categorizing data .
The Journal itself assigns a variety of useful metadata tags to entries as they appear .
These include the time of the entry , its sharing scope , who participated in the activity , its size , and more .
The Journal will also keep track of other useful metadata , such as the number of times a child views a particular entry , the number of revisions an entry has gone through , etc .
Likewise , activities will deal primarily with metadata rather than simple tags .
This allows activities to define specific parameters , or keys , that make sense for the Objects they produce , and then assign values to those dynamically .
In a music composition activity , for instance , potential keys might be beats per minute , the key the composition is written in , the length of the track , and the composer , among others .
See the sorting section to fully understand the usefulness of this metadata within the Journal .
Of course , since tags and metadata both follow a very basic format , children can assign their own metadata associations with Journal entries once they have enough experience simply by typing key : value pairs into the description field .
Powerful Search , Filter & Sort
Searching
The search field provides the most direct means of locating a particular Journal entry , returning instant results as the search is typed , and offering auto - completion for popular tags .
In order to find anything on their laptop , a child need merely describe it , since the tags she 's associated with it already appear within its description field .
Her searches also apply to the metadata associated with the entry by either the Journal or the activity that created it , making it even easier to find things .
For simplicity , the search field will employ OR logic to all terms entered , which ensures the least amount of confusion when used by children who do n't yet understand boolean logic .
As such , a search for " orange cat " will return a list of everything orange and also every cat .
Of course , any entries tagged with both orange and with cat will match more strongly , and will automatically filter to the top of the results .
However , in keeping with a primary goal of the laptops , this wo n't eliminate the possibility for more complex boolean searches .
Full support for AND , OR , NOT , and parenthetical grouping of terms will be built into the search engine , providing advanced functionality for those who desire to enter more complex queries .
Since the laptops will find themselves in the hands of many children , additional modifications to the search algorithm will assist them as they grow .
The youngest children who receive them will still be learning how to spell , and those that can may still require some time to learn typing skills .
For these reasons , a fuzzy match algorithm will assist the children , returning some results even when the corresponding tags do n't match what they typed exactly .
This algorithm is adaptive , and so as they become more comfortable with their language and with using the technology , the extent of the fuzziness and therefore the number of fuzzy results returned will lessen , preventing false matches from aggravating more advanced users .
Several other kinds of fuzziness could also be applied , though such possibilities are only speculation at this point .
For instance , fuzzy matches based on thesaurus entries could turn up items tagged with " funny " even when the child searches for " humorous " .
Likewise , translation fuzziness could return an entry tagged with " cat " , even though the child searched for " gato . "
These advanced fuzziness algorithms could prove invaluable in a laptop community that has been built with sharing and collaboration in mind .
Filtering
Support for basic filtering also exists within the journal .
The search and filter functionality appear together in the toolbar , since searching could also be interpreted as filtering by tags .
Additionally , their appearance together allows an easy method for the children to visually construct their query in a sentence - like format , with relevant parts of their query displayed as icons — just as those within the entries themselves — for visual reinforcement .
Several fundamental filters exist .
First and foremost , there is an advanced date filter , which can only be expected in a Journal organized temporally by default .
This control will present a timeline to the child , with visual indication over the length of the timeline of the number of entries present in the Journal from any given point in time .
By expanding and contracting the selected area she can select anything from a single day to all time , and by sliding the selection through time , she can filter out all entries that do n't lie within the specified range .
Other basic filters include the activity that the entry represent , and the activity participants .
Other available filters allow children to locate specific kinds of entries .
For instance , a child may want to view all entries that have been tagged by the Journal for possible removal when memory becomes low .
They may also want to see all their notes , or to - dos , or events .
They could also show only starred items , or in progress items , and more .
The system will provide adequate flexibility for finding anything in the Journal nearly instantaneously .
Sorting
Whereas searching and filtering provide a means of defining what entries get shown in the list of results , sorting determines how those entries are organized .
A unique approach to sorting on the laptops makes the metadata associated with entries even more valuable .
The sort bar , which the child can expand in order to more precisely control their view of the journal , offers a popup menu from which a number of options such as date , title , activity , size , participants , and others may be chosen .
In addition to this fixed list , a dynamic list of options also appears , providing a list of metadata keys that are present in the majority of the entries within the results list , the utility of which will become apparent below .
The true functionality of the system arises from " then by " sorting .
When desired , a child can specify up to three levels of sorting hierarchy .
This feature should n't be overlooked , since it serves as an extraordinarily powerful means of viewing and organizing data hierarchically , even when no hard hierarchy exists .
In fact , when used to its full advantage this approach can be more useful than a hard hierarchy , since the order of the hierarchy can be adjusted dynamically to suit the child 's needs at the time .
And , in conjunction with the intelligently compiled list of metadata keys on which to sort , children can not only find what they 're looking for , but can browse through their journal in any way that suits them .
Consider , for instance , that a child filters her journal so that all of her music appears in the results .
Since nearly every song Object in her Journal has metadata keys for artist , album , track , and year , she could sort by these keys to arrange her music collection for browsing .
Sorting by artist , then album , then track she can obtain a traditional view of her music .
In order to view a discography for each artist , on the other hand , she could sort by artist , then by album , then by track .
Or , to see a timeline of her music , she could sort by year , then by artist .
This powerful sorting method is n't necessarily limited solely to a bunch of songs , or pictures , or other specific type of data .
Since many forms of metadata will apply across Object types , the possibilities are nearly limitless .
Implicit Versioning System
As mentioned before , the laptops automatically save , or " keep " , objects in the Journal at regular intervals .
This eliminates the need for the children to constantly worry about saving , and reduces the chances that an unexpected circumstance will cause data loss .
These individual keep events are incremental , meaning that the changes within the file are kept in a nondestructive manner .
Therefore , the Journal not only stores Objects as children create them , but also keeps track of the revision history for each one .
This allows the Journal to function as a versioned filesystem .
The space limitations on the laptop cause some concern with the mention of revision history .
However , the differences between revisions will often be small .
Additionally , Objects with large revision histories provide one easy way for the journal to regain valuable space when memory becomes tight , since it can collapse the history , storing only every few automatic revisions in addition to those explicitly kept by the child .
Automatic Backup and Restore
Backup
In most locations where laptops deploy , a nearby school equipped with a server will provide additional functionality when children bring their laptops within range .
This server has one major implication for the Journal : backup .
Due to limited storage space on the laptops , children will have to choose to erase older entries to make way for new ones .
The automated backup system will ensure that , even once their creations leave their own laptops , they will remain available on the school server .
This process will happen in the background , fully automatically , anytime the child comes within range and bandwidth allows .
Her Journal will keep track of which entries have and have not yet been backed up , taking this into account when recommending items for removal .
Restore
The backup service provided by the server will allow several types of restoration , based upon the child 's needs .
Full restore functionality provides a fail - safe for the children .
Though the ruggedness of the laptops should minimize the need for a full restore , any event which causes permanent loss of any or all data on a laptop can be recovered from nearly completely from the backup files .
These files also provide a means of restoring the child 's settings and data should they for any reason ever need a new laptop .
In practice , this is a temporal restoration , recovering all files stored on the backup server within a given time period from the present .
The backup server will also provide partial restores , which allows children to select individual objects and entries to recover .
Any recovered items will appear as a new Journal entry on the date of recovery .
This form of restoration will occur with much greater frequency , purposed mainly to restore an accidentally deleted entry from a week or so ago , while flexible enough to restore any entry ever backed up on the server .
In addition to these hard restoration methods which physically copy the data back onto the children 's laptops , the server will also provide soft restore functionality , allowing children to browse through the backups on the server directly from within their Journals .
Since this browsing functionality will integrate cleanly with the entries stored on their own laptops , the children will be able to search , filter , sort , and view anything they ever entered without having to think about the technicalities of the data 's physical location .
Apart from a visual indication within the entry , the experience of browsing through backups will be seamless .
Using the temporary restore method , children can browse through their past creations , much as we might browse through a photo album .
They will have full ability to resume any instance of an activity , to view its contents .
A copy - on - write approach will be taken , so that if a child attempts to modify a temporarily restored item , it will behave identically to a partial restore for that Object , writing the modified revision into a new journal entry .

Matushita Nao ( 松下 奈緒 ) the girl behind E - Mobile Matushita Nao ( 松下 奈緒 ) the girl behind E - Mobile
When you go home tonight , you might notice some new ads starring Matushita Nao ( 松下 奈緒 ) for a cool looking PDA .
But contrary to popular belief , this is not Softbank ’s X01HT which has been receiving a lot of bandwidth in the comments section of stippy.com .
Nor is it part of DoCoMo ’s half - arsed attempt at marketing the blackberry in Japan , nor is it a rechurned ad for Wilcom ’s hugely successful PDA of 2006 , W - Zero 3 .
E- mobile ( Japan ’s youngest mobile phone carrier ) has finally unveiled their virgin products for the Japanese market .
As the newest player on the street , E - mobile is still rapidly rolling out their service area and so initial service will be purely for data only ( voice to start in Mar ’ 08 ) and basically only in the Tokyo and Osaka regions .
Due to the obvious disadvantages of not being able to roll out voice , e-mobile have been clear about their strategy and focused on the high - end data only users .
At first glance it appears as though E- mobile have surprised most market participants with the slickness of both their new datacard ( D01NE by NEC ) and PDA ( Em - One by Sharp ) .
But just as Son-san was trying to do at the end of last year with his Yosoguy - wari , it seems as though E - Mobile have realized that they are not going to win market - share without being substantially cheaper than the competition .
E- mobile ’s package is relatively simple .
First year users pay a flat fee of 5,980 per month and that entitles you to unlimited use of data on their latest technology 3.5G network ( HSDPA ) at speeds of up to 3.6 Mbps .
If you sign up for a minimum of a year then that price falls to 4,980 yen and if you sign up for a two year contract then they ’ll throw in a free ADSL service to your home for nothing .
To put that in perspective , up until now the “ standard ” for the data market ( both card or PDA ) was Willcom ’s generous offer of 12,915 yen per month for unlimited data usage on their 408 Kbps network .
All I can say is look out Willy !
E-Mobile Willcom Softbank Monthly Fee 5,980 yen 12,915 yen 11,130 Data restrictions Unlimited Unlimited 450MB / month of data included .
1.25 yen / packet for any additional use .
Network Speed HSDPA ( 3.6Mbps ) PHS ( 408 Kbps ) HSDPA ( 3.6 Mbps ) Coverage Tokyo and Osaka Nationwide Nationwide Approx .
number of base stations
1,000 160,000 25,000 Most popular PDA Em- one ( Sharp ) W - Zero 3 [ es ] ( Sharp ) X01HT ( HTC ) Picture
The disadvantages of E - Mobile are obvious .
Area coverage , area coverage and area coverage .
With only 1,000 base stations ( and only half of those in Tokyo ) they have a long way to go before they can match any of their competitors .
Obviously not having voice capability might frustrate some users ( after all I use my blackberry for voice as well as data ) but at least for data - card users ( said to be about 1.5 million in Japan ) then it is a seriously attractive proposal .
Make sure you are very happy with the service though because they will charge you a cancellation fee of 2,000 yen per month of unused contract if you want to get out of the 2 year ( “ にねん ” ) plan earlier than you planned .
Oh , and before you sign up in order to get the free ADSL package , you should be aware that it is for a 10 M bps speed connection ( not the standard 50 Mbps connection available at Bic Camera ) but hey , who ’s gonna look a gift - horse in the mouth !
To me what really appeals about E- mobile ’s new service is actually the PDA .
Especially as I ’ve been particularly frustrated with service quality on my new blackberry , I ’ve been spending a lot of time checking out the other alternatives on the market .
My conclusion so far had been Softbank ’s sleek handset from HTC ( X01HT ) although it seems as though the phone - like - look of Sharp ’s PDA ( W - Zero3 [ es ] ) that Willcom offers has been more popular amongst Japanese people .
E- mobile have clearly done their homework as they seem to have combined the best of both phones into their new Em - One ( even if the name is a little boring – “ EM ” : “ E - Mobile ” ) .
I ’m sure it is no coincidence that they asked Sharp to design their first phone .
Just like the X01HT it has Bluetooth functionality and a cool hideaway keyboard but it also has the resolution quality of the W - Zero3 but on a much larger screen ( 4.1 ″ ) .
At 4 hours , battery life is not that wonderful vs. the W - Zero 3 ( 4hr vs. 7hr ) , nor is the inbuilt camera quality as good as the X01HT ( 1.3 M vs. 2.0 M ) and at 250g it is slightly heavier than the other two ( both 175g ) .
For me , there is one very cool feature that won me over that neither of the other two have – One - Seg .
Although the RRP of 39,800 yen might sound a little steep , even if you cancel your contract you are still set for life with a free TV !
( albeit only on a 4.1 ″ screen ) .
But it is also that screen that saves you when operating the PDA every day .
All three models operate on Windows Mobile 5.0 but it is just that much easier on the Em - one screen .
Better yet , the high connection speeds that you get from HDSPA means that your internet connection feels as fast as it does at home for most applications .
Here at stippy.com , we ’re still saving up our cash to buy one but please let us know if you are lucky enough to get your hot little hands on one before we do .
They are set to hit the shops on Mar 1 with an expected “ サービスイン ” ( start date ) of April 1 .

Act Responsibly : Do n't Vote !
That 's not a bumper sticker you 're likely to see in coming weeks .
Instead the ballot will be revered like a religious object and voting will be declared a duty .
But what if the ballot is just one more government form to fill out ?
What if the most politically powerful act is to say " no " by tearing the form in half ?
This November , most people wo n't " do it " in the voting booth despite attempts to shame them .
They will spend the time on activities that enrich their lives : buying groceries , playing with children , catching up on work .
Even the recent primary , which was supposed to reflect a galvanized and outraged Democratic Party , drew only about 11.4 percent of those eligible to vote .
The Republican primary fared worse with a record low turnout of about 6.6 percent .
If war itself can't motivate people to put a checkmark in a box , it is time to consider non-voting from a radically different perspective .
Maybe non-voters are right .
After all , if most people refuse to buy a product with which they 're acquainted , do you blame them or the product ?
Politicians have only themselves to blame if people are not buying what they sell .
The knee - jerk response is to accuse non-buyers of apathy .
In many cases , this may be true but it is n't the non-voter 's fault if he thinks a ballot is irrelevant to his life .
Gerrymandered voting districts that almost ensure results , preppy and prepped candidates , a two - party system that restricts access to alternate voices , candidates in debt to corporate sponsors and lobbyists , campaign promises that dissolve , corrupt procedures which make many believe Al Gore is the rightfully - elected President .
The notoriously corrupt New York politician Boss Tweed once said , " You may elect whatever candidates you please to office , if you will allow me to select the candidates . "
In short , by the time names are on the ballot , the fix is in .
And apathy becomes a reasonable response .
Non-voting is a gauge of how deeply alienated the average person is from the political establishment .
Sometimes political disgust converts non-voting from an act of indifference to one of protest through which people express a word that all politicians fear : " no . "
Not just " no " to them but to the entire process .
Everyone who chuckles at the old joke , " Do n't vote , it only encourages them , " connects on some level with the idea of making a statement through consciously not voting .
But , for most non-voters , such protest if it exists at all is on an emotional level .
That is , a sense of disgust or disillusionment with the system makes them shy away from participating in it .
Those for whom non-voting is conscious statement of protest generally argue as follows :
The check mark or the punched chad on a ballot means " yes " it is the consent you give to the electoral process by virtue of participating .
No wonder all candidates agree on one point : you should vote .
They are like religious leaders who urge you to worship at the church of your choice .
First and foremost , politicians want you to sanction the process by which they acquire power and money because , without that sanction , they have no legitimacy .
It is commonly said , " If you do n't vote , you have no right to complain about the outcome . "
The opposite is true .
By playing the game , voters agree to the rules .
Only those who do n't play and withhold their consent have a right to complain about the outcome , especially since the winner will have his hand in the non-voter 's pocket .
Voting is not an act of political freedom .
It is an act of political conformity .
Those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence .
They are screaming in the politician 's ear : " You do not represent me .
This is not a process in which my voice matters .
I do not believe you . "
Non-voting has a rich and long history through which the dissenting electorate has expressed everything from religious convictions to political cynicism .
That history has been conspicuously ignored .
If people truly believe voting is important , they should use their mouths to do more than insult non-voters and utter election slogans .
They should discuss and debate the issue with those who disagree .

Imagine two groups struggling to win ( or , in one case , to retain ) public support for their respective , opposing causes .
The dominant group has managed to define the other 's name to mean ' violent , uncivilized destroyers of property and enemies of functioning society ' in the public mind , despite that definition being the polar opposite of the truth .
Still , the slandered group continues using the pejorative name to describe itself .
' We are violent , uncivilized destroyers of property and enemies of functioning society ! ' proclaim members of the group .
' And we 're proud of it !
You 'd join us if you only understood us better !'
Strangely , the public does not respond in a positive fashion .
- - - - -
Of course , this is only a ' what if ' scenario .
No group in the real world would be foolish enough to continue calling itself by a name that meant something so negative in the public mind .
It would be like the Republicans or the Greens renaming themselves the ' Child Molester Party . '
A more counterproductive tactical or marketing move is difficult to imagine .
- - - - -
I was just kidding about ' no group in the real world ' being so foolish , of course : anarchists continue using a descriptor that actually does mean ' violent , uncivilized destroyers of property and enemies of functioning society ' to 99 % of the public .
We can rail all we want about how wrong and unfair that is , but the fact remains that nearly everyone defines ' anarchist ' differently and far more negatively than we do .
Thanks to more than a century of media effort ( aided and abetted by violent idiots who have called themselves anarchists ) , ' anarchy ' has been relentlessly and successfully defined as , essentially : ' chaos and violence , and destruction of property rights and civil order . '
In short : ' anarchy ' = ' chaos ' or even ' terrorism ' in the public mind .
This is not a label I want attached to myself , especially during America 's War on Terror .
I see negative and hostile views of ' anarchy ' frequently and am certain you do as well .
A few examples :

THE BUSINESS OF TERROR : Anarchist outrages
By Rick Coolsaet
" TERRORISM is ancient , found in every age , every continent , every religion .
So why the current obsession with security , the suspicion that a monstrous hidden enemy is behind every attack in the world ?
History has had many eras when terrorism and fear were rife in events much like those of today .
On 24 June 1894 an Italian anarchist , Sante Jeronimo Caserio , assassinated the French president , Marie - Fran 'ois Sadi Carnot , the culmination of a series of anarchist attacks in France and elsewhere .
The international community felt threatened by this . "

What does anarchy really mean ?
In a practical sense , the term has no meaning ; with so many conflicting definitions , the word means whatever someone thinks it means .
There is no universally accepted definition for the word .
Of course , there are dictionary definitions of anarchy .
Here 's the entry from my on - disc copy [ circa mid-1990s ] of The American Heritage Dictionary :
an ' ar 'chy ( ' n ' ' r - k ' ) n. , pl. an ' ar 'chies .
1 . Absence of any form of political authority .
2 . Political disorder and confusion .
3 . Absence of any cohesive principle , such as a common standard or purpose .
[ New Latin anarchia , from Greek anarkhia , from anarkhos , without a ruler : an- , without ; see A - 1 + arkhos , ruler ; see - ARCH . ]
Definition # 3 is especially disturbing , as it absolutely negates the principled adherence to nonaggression which lies at the heart of ' anarchy ' as I understand the term .
Another way to highlight the nearly random usage of the term ' anarchy ' is found at the WikiPedia page on Anarchy , which lists these different anarchist schools of thought in a sidebar :
Capitalist – Christian
Collectivist – Communist
Eco – Feminist
Green – Individualist
Mutualist – Primitivist
Social – Syndicalist
The goals , definitions , and methods of these groups vary widely , and not all of them acknowledge the nonaggression principle .
I do not see how any person could find themselves in full agreement with even two or three of these , much less with all these versions of ' anarchy ' at once .
By the way , note that ' libertarian / market anarchist ' – Strike The Root 's self - description – is n't even listed .
Here 's STR 's self - description in detail :
' Strike The Root is a daily journal of current events and commentary from a libertarian / market anarchist perspective .
The mission of STR is to advance the cause of liberty , primarily by de-mystifying and de-legitimizing the State .
STR seeks a world where people are free to live their lives as they see fit , as long as they do n't use force or fraud against peaceful people . '
Now , that 's a definition I can embrace : the anarchist , as STR sees him or her , ' seeks a world where people are free to live their lives as they see fit , as long as they do n't use force or fraud against peaceful people . '
To be blunt , anything less would be uncivilized .
But again , this is NOT the definition most people find in their mental search engines when they hear the term ' anarchist . '
Mark Davis recently made the point in a column at STR that ' anarchy is simply a free society . '
Yet Davis ' column , titled Defining Anarchy , is mostly devoted to describing the ways people misunderstand the term anarchy and correcting the misconceptions ; as Davis points out , whenever a massive government failure creates chaos , the public ( and of course the media ) calls the result ' anarchy . '
Davis ' column is a terrific educational tool , but the very need for such a piece highlights the point of this column : any movement that must expend so much effort correcting inaccurate and prejudicial views of its own position is a movement choosing to fail .
Our opponents have successfully defined ' anarchy ' in such a way that to merely say the word is to warn others against us .
We are not merely foolish to allow ourselves to be described by this word ; we are not only setting ourselves up for continued and total failure : using the term ' anarchist ' to describe ourselves , especially in post - Patriot , Military Tribunal America , puts us at peril .

Abolitionism
So : you 're a ' live and let live ' person who believes any initiated coercion is wrong .
What DO you call yourself ?
I have a suggestion .
If you want to abolish the use of initiated coercion , why not call yourself , as I do , an abolitionist ?
Reasons for using this term include :
Accuracy : the world ' abolitionist ' accurately describes a person who wants to abolish something , in this case the evil of initiated coercion .
Positive connotations :
The term was widely used by those who wanted to abolish slavery , and slavery is , of course , merely a specific and extreme form of initiated coercion .
This use of the term ' abolitionism ' is the only one I was familiar with before doing a web search , and I would wager that most Americans have never heard of any other : in a practical sense , ' abolitionism ' means the movement to abolish slavery .
The movement to abolish all intiated coercion – all forms and degrees of slavery and attempted slavery , large and small – is clearly a continuation of the original .
Positive feelings people rightfully have for the movement to abolish slavery are equally well deserved by those who seek to abolish all forms of initiated coercion .
Furthermore , abolishing slavery did not tear the world apart or cause chaos or misery ( the Civil War did , but in most nations slavery was abolished without resorting to war .
Even in America it was the war , not freedom for the slaves , that caused violence and misery – and Americans are clear on that ) .
Continuation of a righteous cause :
As long as initiated coercion exists – from government , from the mob , from organized religion , from home - invasion robbers and rapists , from gangs of ten - year - old bullies at school , or from any other source – the cause of abolitionism should and must continue .
Explicit recognition that how we treat each other matters : Abolishing initiated coercion requires insisting that each person is the owner and proprietor of his or her own body , mind , property , and life generally .
The abolitionist insists on the rights of others .
Abolitionism holds that using force or threats of force against peaceful human beings is a crime – something any decent person can support .
This explicit concern for others puts abolitionism in harmony with the ancient Eastern doctrine of ahimsa , at least where human life is concerned .
It puts abolitionism in harmony with the Golden Rule : do unto others as you would have them do unto you .
That means abolitionism is in harmony with every major religion I am aware of , and with plenty of religions most people have never heard of .
Abolitionism fits well with Jesus ' insistence that we should love one another ( John 13:34 – 35 ) , because coercion is the practical opposite of love .
Indeed , coercion erodes and destroys love .
Civil society requires nothing less than complete abolition of initiated coercion .
If history and current events teach us nothing else , they teach us that initiated coercion is evil , and that when used widely and systematically ( as every government does ) it becomes , all too often , an evil of epic proportions .
All excuses , schemes , and rationalizations for initiating coercion against others only create more coercion .
We 've tried ' the divine right of kings . '
We 've tried ' dictatorship of the proletariat . '
We 've tried ' democracy . '
It does n't matter how you dress it up : initiating force or threats of force against peaceful human beings is a crime , and creates nothing but injustice , violence , and misery .
Using the term ' abolitionism ' points out that ALL forms of initiated coercion must go ; belief that it is necessary or benign to initiate coercion for this or for that reason , or in some special manner , is delusional and dangerous .
So call me an abolitionist , please .
I hope you will consider joining me in use of the term .
When Shirley Hatcher , 67 , parked her car in North Road , Southampton , Hampshire , there were no parking restrictions in place .
Mrs Hatcher , of Priory Road , said : " I had just gone to the hairdressers and when I returned there was this disabled bay and the £ 60 fine . "
A spokeswoman for Southampton City Council has apologised for the error .
I saw the funny side of it the next day - you could n't make it up
Shirley Hatcher
Mrs Hatcher said : " I could n't believe my eyes when I saw it .
" My car was covered in polka dots from the paint they had used .
" I was fuming , absolutely fuming , all I could think was what sort of idiot did this .
" I saw the funny side of it the next day - you could n't make it up . "
Occasionally things go wrong
Southampton City Council
A spokeswoman for Southampton City Council said the authority would cover the costs of repairs to her car .
She added : " Occasionally things go wrong no matter how hard we try to get things right .
" We were in error , as was our painting contractor , and we 're very sorry .
" We are doing everything we can to put it right , and to examine our processes to prevent anything like this happening again . "
Felix Frankfurter was never a chief justice , as we described him in the article below .
He did , however , serve for many years as an associate justice of the US supreme court .
' Whisper of how I 'm yearning " , sang George M Cohan in one of the great American songs of nostalgia , " to mingle with the old time throng " .
Well , I 'm yearning too , not for the gang at 42nd Street exactly , but for the America that Cohan was indirectly hymning - for the Idea of America , with a capital I , which once made the United States not just the most potent of all the nations but genuinely the most liked .
Perhaps , with a future new president already champing at the bit , we are about to witness its rebirth .
As a foreigner I am immune to the rivalries or seductions of American party politics , but I have loved the old place for 60 years , and I simply pray for an American leader to give us back its baraka , as the Arabs say - nothing to do with religion or economics or power or even ideology , but the gift of being at once blessed and blessing .
Of course nobody can claim that the old dreams of America were ever perfectly fulfilled .
They often let us down .
They were betrayed by the national reputations for crime , corruption , racism and rampant materialism .
Not all the presidents , God knows , were icons of virtue or even of glamour , and the benevolent Uncle Sam of the old cartoonists was more often interpreted , around the world , as a fat moron in horn - rimmed spectacles , chewing a cigar .
Nobody 's perfect , still less any republic .
But I think it is true that only in our time has the American Idea lost its baraka .
A generation or two ago , most of us , wherever we lived , loved the generous self - satisfaction of it , if not in the general , at least in the particular .
The GI was not then a sort of goggled monster in padded armour , but a cheerful fellow chatting up the girls and distributing candy not as a matter of policy , but out of plain goodwill - everyone 's friendly guy next door .
To millions of radio listeners around the world , the Voice of America was a voice of decency , and one could watch the lachrymose patriotic rituals of America - the hand on heart , the misty - eyed salute to the flag - with more affection than irony .
For myself , I responded to them all too sentimentally .
Like Walt Whitman before me , I heard America sing !
I relished the hackneyed old lyrics - Mine eyes have seen the glory , Thy word our law , Thy paths our chosen way , Oe'r the land of the free and the home of the brave , God bless America , land that I love ...
Most of the words were flaccid , many of the tunes were vulgar , but as I heard them I saw always in my mind 's eye , as Whitman did , all the glorious space , grandeur and opportunity that was America , Manhattan to LA .
Sea , in fact , to shining sea .
In those days we did not think of American evangelists as prophets of political extremism - they seemed more akin to the homely convictions of plantation or village chapel than to the machinations of neocons .
We bridled rather at the American assumption that the US of A had been the only true victor of the second world war , but most of us did not very deeply resent the happy swagger of the legend and danced gratefully enough to the American rhythms of the time .
We thought it all seemed essentially innocent .
Innocent !
Dear God !
Half a century , and nobody thinks that now .
Far from being the most beloved country on earth , today the US is the most thoroughly detested .
The rot really started to set in , in my view , with Abraham Lincoln , one of the most admirable men who ever lived .
He it was who saw in American glory the duty of a mission .
America , he declared , was the last best hope of earth .
The pursuit of happiness was not its national vocation , but the example of democracy .
The more like the United States the world became , the better the world would be .
No statesman was ever more sincere or kindly in his beliefs , but poor old Abe would be horrified to see how his interpretation of destiny has gone sour .
For the missionary instinct , which impelled Americans into so many noble policies , was to be perverted by power .
Pace Lincoln , America was not necessarily the last best hope of mankind , and the knowledge that it has possessed unchallengable powers of interference has distorted its attitude to the world and cruelly damaged its image in return .
Isolationism was not a very estimable stance , but interfereism is not much more attractive .
In humanity 's eye , the swagger has become bombast and the cocky GI has become a bully .
But there is a difference between image and idea .
One is a projection , the other an absolute .
Public relations people , tabloid newspapers , spin doctors and entertainers can all fiddle with the image of America , but the idea of it remains constant - overlaid , perhaps , dormant , even forgotten , but always there .
Everyone who visits America feels it - every package tourist returns to tell their neighbours how nice the Americans are , how different from their reputation .
And what they are all sensing , half - hidden behind the image of America , is the presence of the Idea , with a capital I .
When I first went to the United States in the 1950s , I impertinently remarked to an archetypal guru , Chief Justice Felix Frankfurter , that what with Senator McCarthy and southern segregation , and civic corruption everywhere , I was not much impressed by the condition of America .
Be patient , said the sage .
America is like a pendulum , swinging from good to bad , from bad to good , and before long it will swing again .
He was right , and with luck , perhaps the pendulum is almost ready to swing back once more .
Whatever we may think in our moments of despair , America is still a marvellous and lovable country whose patriotism can still be touching : try restraining a tear when you listen to Irving Berlin 's setting of the words on the Statue of Liberty - the ultimate American text , with music by the emblematic American immigrant .
The Great Republic is great still , full still of decent clever people trying to be good .
Even now , it is as free as can be expected , and its democracy is fundamentally honest and robust .
It laughs at itself , criticises itself and dislikes itself just as much as we do .
All it needs is someone with a key to unlock that Idea again , and I hope it will be that next president , whoever it is , even now gearing up for the election .
Please God , may it be a poetic president .
Inspiration has been the true engine of American success , and all its greatest presidents have been people with a divine spark .
The dullards may have been efficient , respected or influential , but the Jeffersons and the Roosevelts , the Lincolns and the Kennedys have all been , in their different ways , artists .
So may it be a president with the key of original inspiration who can release the Idea from its occlusion .
All the ingredients are still there , after all - the kindness , the imagination , the merriment , the will , the talent , the energy , the goddam orneriness , the plain goodness - all there waiting to burst out once more and bring us back our America , blessed and blessing too .
" Give our regards to old Broadway " , sang Cohan , " And say that I 'll be there ere long . "
So will we , so will we , just as soon as America comes home .

Dealing with the Lame Duck Code Base
I wear my green " Test First " wrist - band to remind me that when I write code , I must write the best code I can .
It does n't matter if the code is lame - duck or not .
It does n't matter if it is experimental or not .
It does n't matter if I am in a hurry or not .
What matters is that I maintain a professional attitude about writing code .
In martial arts , it is the custom to bow to the dojo ( the room in which you practice ) before entering and leaving .
This is a ritual of respect for the discipline that you are learning .
It is a way of saying : " What happens here matters . "
You may never have to use the disciplines you are learning ; indeed you HOPE you never have to use them ; but learning them matters .
When you put your fingers on the keyboard and write code , it matters .
It matters because you are a professional .
It matters because THIS IS WHAT YOU DO .
It matters because the disciplines of writing good code are hard to foster and easy to lose .
So I wear my green test - first wrist - band as a sign of respect for the discipline that I continue to foster .
I was speaking with a manager recently about a legacy codebase .
It had n't been deployed yet , but we knew it was legacy .
He told me that he could n't find anyone who would work on it other than the original developer .
None of the other team members wanted to work with such code .
My reply was that they were obligated as professionals to do the best that they could with it if their work on it would serve the best intersts of the company .
Besides , it was not for them to decide whether they would work on it ; that decision belonged to the manager .
Anyway , I do n't know anyone who is excited to work on code that would be great to have as a reference while reading your book , Michael . ;-)
Now that I think about it though , maybe we should be .
When opportunity knocks , we should answer the door and welcome it .
In late 2000 , I was working on a small team building the framework to be used for the application .
We had surveyed the various legacy systems , looking at the common services that the new application would need to provide .
At the beginning of January 2001 , we started to build some of the services , starting with language - handling ( I wo n't bother with the details why standard Java was n't good enough in that situation ) , and classes to hide the complexities of dealing with JDBC .
As my blog entry states , the decision was made in February to move to the COTS solution , but we were still allowed to work on the framework .
It was difficult , knowing that your work seemed useless , however we kept going .
In July 2001 , another group heard about what we had and asked to use it .
I left that project in August 2001 , but caught up with the same team members again in Oct. 2003 when I joined another project at that client .
Lo and behold , there was the language and SQL framework code in daily use , almost untouched from its original state in 2001 .
So had we just abandoned it the code , two other teams would have had to reinvent the same concepts .
We 're quite proud of the SQL - wrapping code , especially after we found out about Spring and discovered that their code was almost the same .
( Though we had named parameters - rather than positional ones - in 2001 , while Spring is just introducing them with the impending 2.0 release ! )
Your notion that you just do n't know if code will truly be abandoned resonates with me ...
I recently wrote a blog entry ( http://mayford.ca/blog/?p=21 ) about a project that originally was to be a custom - built Java application turned into a COTS fiasco .
In late 2000 , I was working on a small team building the framework to be used for the application .
We had surveyed the various legacy systems , looking at the common services that the new application would need to provide .
At the beginning of January 2001 , we started to build some of the services , starting with language - handling ( I wo n't bother with the details why standard Java was n't good enough in that situation ) , and classes to hide the complexities of dealing with JDBC .

If the code base does n't matter , why does the company invest time / money in it ?
If it is only because they have n't got a clue what they are doing , then find another job .
But if it really is important you do what you are doing , then it is n't really a lame duck , is it ?
Do you really want to build something your great - grandchildren will use ( and probably swear at ) or do you just want to do something that makes a difference ?
In this situation , they probably have n't allocated as much development effort as they would have otherwise , so keeping up is probably going to be more of a challenge than if you were working on something shiny and new .
So enjoy the challenge .
If everyone is bored , then that is a bad sign .
Move on , or spend time sharpening skills .
If management knows they have more developers than they need , you wo n't be around long .
This situation is very common when you are involved in an acquisition .
When the parent company and the target are in the same market space , the goal of the acquisition is to transfer the customers to one product .
The product to be retired must be maintained during this transition period .
This is a true lame duck situation .
The one bright spot is that your future efforts will be in the same domain .
What you learn today , can be used tomorrow .
The challenge is to work on the old product while the next gen product is moving ahead .
I managed a team of developers in which we would work feveriously on the latest , greatest business venture , only to have it shelved a month later .
This became a way of life .
I preached often that our work was n't in vain .
We were learning about programming , we could quickly pack up from one project and set down on the next , we were agile !
It took its tole though .
I saw that tired look in each one of my developer 's eyes when our boss would come in really fired up about the latest venture .
We got past it and acted like professionals but I bet that we did n't perform as well as we would have had we believed in it .
Remember all those Y2K [ ? ] bugs ?
Those happened because the programmers all " knew " that they were writing code that was n't going to last .
Except it did ... until it was eventually was replaced by Y2 K [ ? ] remediation .
I do n't know about you , but I like working on things that matter .
When I look back and remember the times in my work life when I 've been most demoralized they 've been when I was asked to work insane hours to finish something that will never be used .
There was the time , in grad school , when my friend Maria and I worked insane hours to meet a deadline after the rest of our team had defected .
We had to finish a piece of OS code , and we knew the professor was n't even going to look at it .
Then there were the times when I 've had to work straight through Christmas up to New Year 's because something " has to be done before the end of the year " even though it was n't going to be used until , say , March .
There are also the times that I 've worked hard on code that I knew would never be used because of a pending business change .
In one case , I had to do detailed design and coding for a product that everyone knew was about the be significantly contracted or cancelled , but we had to go through the motions .
It was just the job .
The list goes on and on ..
I do n't think I 've been in blacker moods than when I 've been in one of those situations .
I like code to matter .
Maybe this is just a personal quirk , but I do n't think so .
A few weeks ago , I was talking to the manager of a team I was teaching .
He was eager to use some of the legacy code techniques in their application , but he has a dilemma .
The code is on borrowed time .
Within the next two years it is going to be replaced .
That is the current plan , at least .
My first question to him was " does the team know ? "
And he replied " yes " the team does know , and he mentioned that he could already see quality problems .
The programmers were clearly asking themselves why they should work so hard on thiscode base , this code base that is going to go away .
Why indeed ?
Well , we can look at it rationally .
I think anyone with some experience in the industry has seen cases where " the plan " for some big code base changes ; it 's very common .
Sure , you can cut corners , but when it 's obvious that the big replacement is n't going to happen , well , all you can do is look at the mess you 've created and cry .
So yes , there is a rational reason why code always requires your best effort , and that reason is : we never know what 's going to happen next .
Things change .
The code you think may be discarded could end up being used .
Systems have lives of their own .
A piece of code that you think is insignificant could end up being used for years , decades , and for many of us now , perhaps centuries .
The truth is , we can't really tell whether a code base is aor not : it may or may not be replaced .
But if we treat it as a , we becomeourselves ; we wait for the new system , and in the interm , we are n't really programmers .
So , is that argument enough ?
Enough to convince you that code always requires your best effort ?
Maybe it is .
I hope so .
But I do n't think that argument touches the core of the issue .
The core of the issue is personal .
For me , it has been a long haul , but I find now that I am happiest when I pay less attention to whether code matters to someone else and more attention to how it matters to me .
And : Yes , I still feel cheated if I work long hours for something inconsequential .
There is no getting around that , but put hours aside .
If I 'm working a nice human - friendly schedule and I feel that the code will be underutilized or unused , I can still choose to use it as a learning opportunity .
I can still do my best .
Every day is a chance to do something in code that I 've never done before , or to find a new way of doing things .
Even the simplest problems are fertile ground for learning if you reflect enough upon them .
And , in the end that is the richest part of this work .
The other stuff , well , that can be ignored.!commentForm

While at the same time the Congress is apparently allowing the White House to send Meirs and Rove up to the Hill to have a hand - in - hand chat about the US Attorney situation without requirement of testifying under oath or public view .
IT IS TIME TO GO BALLISTIC ON THE DEMS .
To all those who have argued the belief the Dems are as bought and paid for as the Republicans , I concede .
This is simply a deal to prolong the lying , avoid prosecution , stall implementation of justice , derail the 2006 mandate of voters .
It is stupid and without precedent .
Watergate Hearings were the standard .
Present hearings are a laughable imitation .

Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army ( some very lengthy excerpts by me ! )
Investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill joins us to talk about his new book , " Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army . "
Scahill writes , " Blackwater is the elite Praetorian Guard for the ' global war on terror , ' with its own military base , a fleet of twenty aircraft , and 20,000 private contractors at the ready .
Run by a multimillionaire Christian conservative who bankrolls President Bush and his allies , its forces are capable of overthrowing governments . "
From Iraq to New Orleans , Blackwater has continued to pull in multi-million - dollar government contracts , mostly without accountability and in near - secrecy .
Four years ago today , the US invasion of Iraq was in its opening hours .
Hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries later , another date marked later this month has taken on nearly as much significance .
March 31st , 2004 .
Four employees of the private U.S. security firm Blackwater USA are ambushed as they drive through the center of Fallujah .
In images broadcast around the world , their burnt corpses are dragged through the streets .
Two of them are strung up from a bridge .
This is an excerpt of the PBS documentary , " Private Warriors " , going back to that day .
JEREMY SCAHILL : ...its founder , Erik Prince .
He 's believed to be , if not the wealthiest , one of the wealthiest people ever to serve in the elite US Navy Seals ... Erik Prince comes from a very wealthy rightwing Christian dynasty in the town of Holland , Michigan ...
And Erik Prince was political at a very early age and watched as his father used his company as a cash - generating engine to fuel the rise of what we now know as the religious right in this country , as well as the Republican Revolution of 1994 .
His father gave the seed money to Gary Bauer to found the Family Research Council .
Young Erik Prince was in the first crop of interns to serve at the Family Research Council .
They gave significant funding to James Dobson and his group Focus on the Family , which is now sort of the premier evangelical organizing network in this country , the “ prayer warriors . ”
JEREMY SCAHILL : Right .
On September 10 , 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld gave one of his first major addresses as Defense Secretary , and gathered before him was the gaggle of corporate executives that had been tapped by the Bush administration to make up the senior civilian leadership at the Pentagon .
There was a sort of mixture of people at the Pentagon .
On the one hand , you had people from corporate America , from all the defense and weapons manufacturers that were brought in , and then you also had the neoconservative ideologues , people like Paul Wolfowitz .
And so , Rumsfeld gives a speech in which he literally declared war on the Pentagon bureaucracy .
And he said , “ I ’ve come not to destroy the Pentagon , but to liberate it .
We need to save it from itself . ”
big dan | 03.20.07 - 8:19 pm | # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then literally the next day the Pentagon would be attacked .
But the vision that Rumsfeld sort of laid out that day would become known as the Rumsfeld Doctrine , where you use high technology , small footprint forces and an increased and accelerated use of private contractors in fighting the wars .
It also , at the center of the Rumsfeld Doctrine , became regime change in central strategic nations .
Rumsfeld and Cheney both had been signers of the Project for a New American Century , that envisioned a new Pearl Harbor as accelerating the agenda , the neoconservative agenda .
And , indeed , the day after Rumsfeld laid out that plan , the Pentagon was attacked , and all of a sudden the world became a blank canvas on which Rumsfeld and Cheney and Bush could sort of paint their vision .
AMY GOODMAN : What 's happened with your website ?
www.blackwaterbook.com
JEREMY SCAHILL : Well , I actually got a letter from Blackwater 's --- one of Blackwater 's many lawyers .
They have an army of lawyers .
Their counsel of record is Ken Starr , the man who led the impeachment charge against President Clinton .
Now , Blackwater has argued in its legal briefings that it can't be sued in civilian courts and that it 's entitled to the same immunity enjoyed by the military from civilian litigation inside of the United States .
And the reason that Blackwater says this , or among the top reasons , is that Donald Rumsfeld in February of 2006 classified contractors as an official part of the US total force , making up an effective part of the US war machine .
So Blackwater has turned around and taken Rumsfeld 's designation of their company as an official part of the US total force and said , “ This means we 're part of the US military , and you ca n't sue us . ”
At the same time , Blackwater , since 2004 , has been lobbying against having its forces placed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , commonly known as the court - martial system .
So Blackwater is essentially saying , “ We 're above the law .
We can't be prosecuted in military courts .
We can't be sued in civilian courts . ”
So Blackwater took active command of an active - duty US Marine in a battle that Muqtada al - Sadr ’s forces recall as a massacre on April 4 , 2004 .
Blackwater guys refer to it as their Alamo .
It 's unclear how many people were killed that day , but they were firing off so many rounds , the Blackwater guys and this Marine , that they had to stop every fifteen minutes to let their weapons cool .
Lonnie Young , that Marine , say
that Marine , says hundreds of people were killed that day .
The US government would say that there were about twenty to thirty .
JEREMY SCAHILL : Blackwater showed up in New Orleans without a contract right after Hurricane Katrina hit , beat most federal agencies to the hurricane zone , within days was hired up by the Department of Homeland Security .
Blackwater paid its men , they told me , $ 350 a day .
They billed the federal government $ 950 a day per Blackwater man .
At one point , they had 600 men stretched from Texas all the way to Mississippi through the Gulf .
Blackwater was raking in sometimes $ 240,000 a day .

Sorry to mess up your " I hate Dems ! " rant , but no Democrats agreed to the deal .
Subpoenas are full speed ahead .
The vote in the House Judiciary Committee to subpoena Rove , Miers , and three others is tomorrow .
The vote in the Senate , which was scheduled last week , is Thursday .
Try to hold off on accusations of capitulation until then , if you can .

Did you get that ? " " " " “ I ’ve come not to destroy the Pentagon , but to liberate it .

And then literally the next day the Pentagon would be attacked . " " " " " " ... also , Rumsfeld said on 9/10 , that $ 2.3 trillion was missing from the Pentagon budget ...hmmmmm ... and the Pentagon was hit the next day , and I guess it took out all the computers to audit the $ 2.3 trillion !
Well , THAT 's lucky , eh ???
Cynthia McKinney got e-voted out of congress for grilling Rumsfeld about the missing $ 2.3 trillion , remember that ???
Lost to Hank " Hack " Johnson .
What 's HE been up to since ?
“ Seven pro-Israel PACs gave to Johnson on Tuesday : MOPAC in Michigan , Washington PAC in D.C. , SUNPAC and National Action Committee PAC in Florida , CITYPAC in Chicago , Mid-Manhattan PAC in New York and Louisiana for American Security PAC . "
Seems these pro-Israeli PAC's had interest in premominately black Dekalb County , Ga . http://www.democracynow.....pl?sid=06/08/04/1419200
Remember the questionable runoff , covered by Brad Blog , in which " Hackin ' Hank " got something like 5,000 votes to ZERO , from the primary to the runoff , vs. McKinney ???
Which proves my theory that Dem primaries are hacked , too .

Bushes latest offing : sacrifice .
Whose sacrifice ?
The struggling middle class , giving up their taxes for generations to come .
The struggling middle class , sacrificing their families for cannon fodder , for generations to
come .
Yet , bushes - corporate - war - for - profit cronies make no sacrifice .
WE THE PEOPLE
sacrifice all , Bushes pals : arms dealers , weapons manufacturers and mercenaries , ca n’t rake it in fast enough .
You call that sacrifice ?
The only way to end this war and end the immoral canker known as war profiteering , is a 100 % war profits tax .

You could not be more uninformed .
A shut - down in government will happen to some degree .
In his speech yesterday , upholding Gonzales , Bush might as well have said " terrorists would benefit if Rove and Miers have to tell the truth " .
But since nobody would buy it anymore , and he knows it , he has to do a James Cagney " come and get me coppa " routine .
It came across as a spoiled brat tantrum , rather than a principled stand .
Shameful nixonian criminality pure and simple .

Faith :
How have the richest sacrificed for this war , by getting a tax cut ?
What was THEIR sacrifice ?
WHO is Bush asking to " sacrifice " , US again ?
With more social program cuts ?
But more tax cuts for the rich ?
The social program $ $$ is being cut , and directly subsidizing the elite 's tax cuts and more military spending ... along with " borrowing " , which is ANOTHER tax increase for our children and grandchildren .

Hubbabubba # 12 Frustration noted and shared .
Compare the years of republican oversite with only a few months of democratic oversite , and one can't help notice the change of reality .
Bush never had to throw a temper tantrum during the rubber stamp 109th republican led congress , but already a couple of months into the 110th democratic led congress he is throwing temper tantrums .
He is feeling the heat because they are truly generating heat .
This is good because the people are now seeing what they suspected .
Seeing is believing .

There is a documentary that I saw in October or so about the issues with the no-bid contracts that were given to all the companies and the problems about war profiteering .
You can see the address at www.iraqforsale.org, its a must see movie , it really opened my eyes to the connections of the administration and the companies that are " rebuilding " Iraq at our expense .
I 'm glad to finally see the dems in the house finally doing something about it .
Bush needs to realize that he 's not above the law .

The evidence is a result of a three year investigation
The evidence was shown in a report by Shane O'Sullivan , broadcast on BBC Newsnight .
It reveals that the operatives and four unidentified associates were at the Ambassador Hotel , Los Angeles in the moments before and after the shooting on 5 June , 1968 .
The CIA had no domestic jurisdiction and some of the officers were based in South - East Asia at the time , with no reason to be in Los Angeles .
' Decoy '
Kennedy had just won the California Democratic primary on an anti-War ticket and was set to challenge Nixon for the White House when he was shot in a kitchen pantry .
THE CIA CONNECTION
Are you convinced by the evidence in the report ?
However , even under hypnosis , he has never been able to remember the shooting and defence psychiatrists concluded he was in a trance at the time .
Witnesses placed Sirhan 's gun several feet in front of Kennedy but the autopsy showed the fatal shot came from one inch behind .
Dr Herbert Spiegel , a world authority on hypnosis at Columbia University , believes Sirhan may have been hypnotically programmed to act as a decoy for the real assassin .
Evidence
The report is the result of a three - year investigation by filmmaker Shane O'Sullivan .
He reveals new video and photographs showing three senior CIA operatives at the hotel .
What were they doing there ?
It 's our obligation as friends of Bob Kennedy to investigate this
Paul Schrade
David Morales was Chief of Operations and once told friends :
" I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard . "
Gordon Campbell was Chief of Maritime Operations and George Joannides was Chief of Psychological Warfare Operations .
Joannides was called out of retirement in 1978 to act as the CIA liaison to the Congressional investigation into the JFK assassination .
Now , we see him at the Ambassador Hotel the night a second Kennedy is assassinated .
Memory
There have been calls for a fresh investigation into the shooting
Paul Schrade , a key figure behind the school project , was walking behind Robert Kennedy that night and was shot in the head .
He believes this new evidence merits fresh investigation :
" It seems very strange to me that these guys would be at a Kennedy celebration .
What were they doing there ?
And why were they there ?
It 's our obligation as friends of Bob Kennedy to investigate this . "
Ed Lopez , a former Congressional investigator who worked with Joannides in 1978 , says :
" I think the key people at the CIA need to go back to anybody who might have been around back then , bring them in and interview them , and ask - is this Gordon Campbell ?
Is this George Joannides ? "
This report was shown on Newsnight on Monday , 20 November , 2006 .

In response to my post about reddit and digg , and my wish for something similar focussing on local news , someone emailed me ( unfortunately not leaving their name ) with details of something they hacked together .
I ’m glad someone beat me to it , and I do n’t have another itch to stratch .
It ’s called Muti .
Check it out , and let me know what you think .
I have n’t yet had more than a superficial look at it , but I ’ll hopefully have something more to say after using it a while .
Here ’s what they sent me :
Hi
After reading your comments about wanting to see South African content on the Reddit site and seeing as how many people were coming up with Reddit / Dig like clones I got inspired one weekend and did my own .
Its currently up in Beta ( and may never be more than just an experiement ) at http://nrn.python-hosted.com
( This will hopefully get its own domain name soon )
It ’s no where near as sophisticated as Reddit as I hacked it up in a few hours but I am very keen to develop it further if there is enough interest .
I am a south african myself although I have lived outside the country for the past 13 years ( currently in California ) but I have strong ties to the country .
Please let me know what you think !
Regards

Omar Bakri Mohammed is one of three who may be prosecuted
Lord Goldsmith and the Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald have discussed action against three individuals , a spokeswoman said .
The Crown Prosecution Service 's head of anti-terrorism will meet Scotland Yard officers in the next few days .
Omar Bakri Mohammed , Abu Izzadeen and Abu Uzair are all expected to come under scrutiny .
' No decision '
The spokeswoman for the Attorney - General 's Office said it was not clear at this stage whether there was enough evidence to bring charges .
Officials will be looking at broadcast and published comments as well as speeches and sermons made by the trip to followers .
" No decision on charges has been made yet .
The CPS will be looking at it to see if any offences have been committed , " she said .
For Muslims there , they have a duty to fight occupiers , whether they are British soldiers or American soldiers
Omar Bakri Mohammed
Profile : Bakri Mohammed
Possible charges which will be considered include the common law offences of treason and incitement to treason .
Omar Bakri Mohammed is a London - based cleric for the al - Muhajiroun group .
On Friday while announcing new measures to clamp down on extremism , Prime Minister Tony Blair said that this group 's successor organisation , the Saviour Sect , would be outlawed .
Mr Bakri caused controversy when he said he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack in the UK .
He also expressed support for Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq .
" For Muslims there , they have a duty to fight occupiers , whether they are British soldiers or American soldiers , " he told Channel 4 News .
' Smell the coffee '
British - born Abu Izzadeen , a spokesman for the group al - Ghurabaa ( the Strangers ) has declined to condemn the 7 July London bombings .
He told BBC2's Newsnight the bombings were " mujahideen activity " which would make people " wake up and smell the coffee " .
Abu Uzair , a former member of al - Muhajiroun , told the same programme that the September 11 attacks in the US were " magnificent " .
He said Muslims had previously accepted a " covenant of security " which meant they should not resort to violence in the UK because they were not under threat there .
" We do n't live in peace with you any more , which means the covenant of security no longer exists , " he said .
The new Swiss Army knife contains 85 devices , weighs 2lb and costs nearly £ 500 .
But can you actually use it for anything ?
Andrew Martin puts the ultimate tool to the test
Swiss
Army knives are obviously good things to own .
They 're standard equipment for Nasa 's astronauts , and feature in the Museum of Modern Art in New York as an example of outstanding functional design .
When Chris Bonnington headed a Himalayan expedition in 1970 , he used every one of the blades in his Swiss Army knife except the fish scaler ; as he apologetically pointed out to the manufacturers , there are no fish on the south face of Annapurna .
In 1989 Professor John Ross , a doctor in rural Uganda , wrote that he had used the saw blade attachment to perform six emergency amputations , his surgical saw having been stolen .
I myself have brought many a seemingly desperate situation to a happy conclusion by the employment of the corkscrew on my own Swiss Army knife .
The only downside to owning one is running into somebody whose model features more implements than your own .
If , for example , I owned the Swiss Army knife called a Scout , humbly equipped as it is with only a can- opener , a large blade , a nail file and nail cleaner , a cruciform Phillips screwdriver , a reamer , another screwdriver , a cap lifter , a wire bender , a toothpick , tweezers and a keyring loop , and I went on a camping holiday with a man who owned the Engineer , which incorporates everything in the Scout knife plus tag clamp , wire cutter and pliers ...
If that happened , then I 'd probably pretend that I did n't have a Swiss Army knife at all , rather than be revealed as someone who could bend wire all day long but not actually cut it , and who was completely unable to tag any clamps - or clamp any tags , as the case may be .
Just as you can't be too rich or too thin , I 'd always thought , so you can't have too many tools on your Swiss Army knife - but that was before I took delivery of the new Giant Swiss Army knife .
Grotesque , if superbly engineered , the Giant weighs nearly a kilogram and features 85 devices in all .
Unload this mother into the plastic tray as you walk through security at Heathrow and just see what happens .
The Giant is supposed to feature every blade that has ever been incorporated into Swiss Army knives as made by Wenger , one of the two firms that make them .
" We 've sold 20 to retailers so far , and we can't get them in fast enough , " says Garry Woodhouse of Whitby and Co , sole importer of Wenger knives into Britain .
" They 're assembled by hand in Switzerland , and I 'm told that the man doing it is working his fingers to the bone . "
This might explain why my version of the Giant seems to have its tools arranged in a different order from the listing on the Wenger website , so that I am in danger of mistaking the reamer for the golf - club face cleaner , or committing the faux pas of attempting to use the fish - hook disgorger to tighten my bicycle spokes .
And I admit that I just can't find some of the devices that I know are definitely in there : the mysterious " special key " , for example , or the elusive " 12/20 gauge choke tube tool " .
None the less , I have successfully employed the cigar cutter , the flashlight , the laser pointer with 300 ft range , the mineral crystal magnifying glass ( rather beautiful , the way such an apparently delicate instrument is honed at its end into yet another screwdriver ) , the tyre - tread gauge measurer and the corkscrew .
It took a mere four minutes to remove the cork with the Giant , incidentally - a matter of holding the bottle between my feet , leaving both hands free to revolve the cumbrous contraption .
The Giant is a real product , available for the very real price of £ 495 , but it is aimed at completists and collectors .
One gadget website correspondent has balefully written , " I envision this monstrosity being presented as a rare ' salesman 's sample ' on 2310 's version of The Antiques Roadshow . "
Wenger admit that its practicality is limited , and that its purpose is partly to promote the company .
Wenger was not the first company to make Swiss Army knives .
That was Victorinox , founded by the Swiss cutler Karl Elsener , who was appalled to discover that the Swiss army was supplied with knives by Germany .
He began making knives for his country 's armed forces , and from 1893 faced competition from another Swiss firm - the one that later became Wenger .
In 1908 , the Swiss government brokered a deal whereby the army would take half its knives from Victorinox and half from Wenger .
Victorinox would be allowed to claim that they made " the original Swiss Army Knife " , while Wenger would be allowed to call theirs " the genuine Swiss Army Knife " .
This gentlemanly disbursement of epithets will no doubt strike some as irritating : " Bloody Swiss .
Always so bloody reasonable ! "
Such people will be further irritated to learn that when , in 2005 , Wenger overextended itself with an ambitious product launch , Victorinox intervened in brotherly fashion , to acquire the company , preserve the brand and stop it falling into foreign hands .
But although Swiss rationality and neutrality are often mistaken for wimpishness , Swiss mercenaries were long considered the most reliably vicious in Europe .
The infantrymen of the Swiss Confederation were particularly skilled in the use of very nasty - looking pointy things , including crossbow bolts and the 18ft pikes with which they fought off the Habsburgs at the Battle of Morgarten in 1315 .
( The pikes carried by the Papal Swiss Guard are an echo of this battle . )
Even George Bush might think twice about invading Switzerland , where every man is required to do regular stints of military service , and keeps his kit , including his gun and his knife , at home in between .
The version of the knife that is actually issued to the Swiss army , by the way , does not feature a corkscrew .
Versions with bottle openers , however , were particularly popular with American GIs , and today 50 % of Swiss Army knives are sold to America .
I 'll bet that most Americans who own a gun also own a Swiss Army knife .
It off ers the same fantasy - ever more attractive in our apocalyptic age - of self - reliance in extremis .
The very chunkiness of the Giant knife points up the liberating portability and specifi city of most other versions , even the " white collar " knives such as the Ambassador , which features a toothpick ( for the reflective aftermath of all those banquets ) but not , of course , a can opener ; or the Manager , which features an orange peeler for those craven lunches taken at the desk rather than down the pub with the workers .
The Giant does , by its grandiosity , court churlish responses .
My 10 - year - old son looked at it sceptically for a while , and said , " I 'll bet it has n't got a spirit level . "
But a more grievous omission on the face of it is the lack of any implement for taking the stones out of horse 's hooves , which surely is the classic Swiss Army knife tool .
Imagine paying out £ 495 for the giant knife , and to be sauntering down the road with it - or staggering under its weight - only to encounter a man with a horse with a stone in its hoof .
" Sorry , mate , I can't help you , " you 'd have to say , " unless you think a golf divot repair tool might do the job . "
In fact , the stone - removing device is mythological , so the completist owner of the Giant need not be embarrassed .
However , if you put to him - and of course it will be a him - the suggestion that his fingernails could do with trimming , he will probably change the subject pretty quickly .
The Giant was conceived too late to feature the new Wenger fingernail - clipping tool , and a new extra-big Giant may eventually be produced that does include it .
Meanwhile , all other presents for practically minded men are going to look pretty skimpy this Christmas .

A FEW days before Vladimir Putin 's state - of - the nation address on May 10th , a strange , seemingly unrelated apparition presented itself in a Moscow park : some 50 Africans , plus the odd Afghan and Iraqi , carrying rakes .
They came to perform a subbotnik — an old Soviet tradition of voluntary civic work .
They headed for a wooded glade favoured by barbecuing Muscovites , and began clearing leaves and rubbish .
“ Good on them , ” said an elderly Russian park cleaner .
“ Friendship between the nations is very important . ”
Unfortunately , the idea of international friendship , like the near - defunct tradition of the subbotnik , is less popular in Russia than it was .
At the annual Victory Day parade in Red Square on March 9th , Mr Putin attacked “ those who ... try to sow racial hatred , extremism , and xenophobia . ”
Well he might : his country is experiencing a plague of racist murder and violence , often committed by neo -Nazi gangs .
“ The drunks just beat you , ” says Romeo , from Cameroon .
“ The skinheads kill you . ”
He and his fellow leaf - rakers wanted to underline their contribution to city life .
Most have stories of beatings ; all avoid the Moscow metro , even in daytime .
Scant consolation though it might be , there are other victims — including Russia 's ancient scapegoat , the Jews .
Nine were stabbed in January in an attack on a Moscow synagogue .
People from the Caucasus and immigrants from Central Asia are also frequent targets , in what is now a nationwide phenomenon .
The latest foreign fatality in Voronezh , a university town in central Russia , was a Peruvian ( foreign students are drawn to Russia by cheap university fees , but are increasingly taking fright ) .
Two people were killed when an armed gang attacked a Roma camp in the Volgograd region last month .
Beautiful St Petersburg , where Mr Putin will host world leaders at the G8 summit in July , rivals Moscow as the capital of race hatred .
A Senegalese student was shot there last month — “ the clean - up of the city continues , ” crowed an extremist website .
Anti-racist campaigners and homosexuals have also been attacked .
A Russian Orthodox priest recently blessed agitators outside a Moscow gay club .
Some see the viciousness as the reincarnation of old Russian neuroses that a combination of internationalist rhetoric and strong security services had managed to suppress during Soviet times .
Oscar , from Burundi , studied in Moscow in the Brezhnev era and says discipline was the difference .
“ If I hate you , and nobody is protecting you , ” he says , “ I can attack you . ”
But others see the street violence as an extreme manifestation of a newer , broader trend — one evident , in a different way , in Mr Putin 's state address .
Victory Day was not the first time that Mr Putin has publicly denounced racism and xenophobia .
Yet , as a recent report by Amnesty International catalogued , police , prosecutors and courts remain too slow to recognise racist crimes and too lenient in their punishment .
Typically , the killers of a nine - year - old Tajik girl in St Petersburg were recently adjudged to have been motivated by “ hooliganism ” rather than racism ( another nine - year - old , the daughter of a Malian , was stabbed in the throat in St Petersburg , but lived ) .
A racist attack on an official from Russia 's north Caucasus in Moscow last month was also classified as hooliganism , until officials were shamed into thinking again .
The devil you know
One plausible explanation for this reticence is an old - fashioned reluctance to admit problems , especially , in a country that justly regards itself as Nazism 's vanquisher , the growth of fascism .
Dmitry Dubrovsky , of the European University of St Petersburg , says that some officials in his city detect a conspiracy by outsiders to shame St Petersburg .
But another theory , endorsed by Vladimir Lukin , Russia 's human - rights ombudsman , is that many in the security services secretly sympathise with the skinheads ( Mr Dubrovsky agrees that this is true in St Petersburg of many ordinary officers ) .
The police themselves harass ethnic minorities , often to extort money : ten Africans were said to have been detained at a metro station on their way to the Moscow subbotnik .
Attitudes in the security services are not unusual .
At the last count , 52 % of those polled by the Levada centre supported the idea of “ Russia for the [ ethnic ] Russians ” ; large numbers confess to hostile feelings to Chechens , Roma and others .
“ Go into the metro , ” says Ma from Guinea - Bissau , “ and even the children call you nigger . ”
Russian children , she says , will not play with hers .
A nationalist tendency is evident in attitudes to the rest of the world , too : friendliness towards America and western Europe is declining .
It is an odd moment for Russia to assume the ministerial presidency of the Council of Europe — which is , moreover , about to publish a critical report on the country .
A new hostility to the West is not surprising , given the Kremlin 's foreign - policy tone .
Meddling foreign powers and spying human - rights workers have been reviled .
Relations with several neighbours — Georgia and Ukraine , but also Poland — were poisonous , and those with America strained , even before Dick Cheney 's critical speech in Vilnius last week ( greeted by the Moscow media as a harbinger of a new cold war , but also as evidence that Mr Putin 's policies were working ) .
“ We see what 's happening in the world , ” Mr Putin said cryptically on May 10th , in a speech otherwise focused heavily on the declining birthrate .
“ As the saying goes , comrade wolf knows who to eat and he eats without listening to others . ”
Less cryptically , he said the arms race was still on .
The relationship between this rhetoric , the Kremlin 's bid to revive national pride using tsarist and Soviet symbols , and the hate on Russia 's streets , is murky .
Alexander Verkhovsky of the SOVA Centre , a Moscow think - tank , sees all of them as different manifestations of feelings of imperial nostalgia .
Others think Mr Putin is deliberately tolerating , even cultivating , radical nationalism as a political tactic .
Vladimir Ryzhkov , an independent member of parliament , says that Mr Putin may see himself as an emperor , but not as a Führer .
Grigory Yavlinsky , a liberal politician , argues that the Kremlin is trying to appeal to nationalist instincts but also to portray itself as the country 's only defence against them .
The security services seem more concerned by leftist groups than rightist ones ( some of which profess loyalty to the Kremlin ) .
Meanwhile , liberal politicians are often labelled “ fascists . ”
From the pogroms of the 19th century to the intermittent racism of the Soviet Union , Russian rulers have tried to manipulate nationalism for their own ends .
If that is the Kremlin 's game , it is a risky one , and not just for the beleaguered immigrants — as the Kremlin may already have discovered .
The Motherland party is widely thought to have been created by the Kremlin in order to drain votes away from the Communists in the parliamentary election of 2003 .
It was banned from participating in December 's local election in Moscow after it ran an anti-immigrant advertisement with the slogan , “ Let 's rid our city of rubbish . ”
But Motherland 's real crime , many thought , was not being too offensive — but becoming too popular .
It was 7 years ago today that I left a great job at AltaVista to join Napster , this tiny little startup that virtually no one had heard of .
My wife thought I was crazy .
No argument there .
I was crazy ... and still am .
I am reminded of Paul Simon 's song " Still crazy after all these years " .
Here is a look back , 7 years later .
Shawn Fanning created Napster in his dorm room at Northeastern .
It was the fastest - growing application in the history of the Internet .
We changed the world but failed to achieve business success .
Here is a glimpse into the inside story of Napster , and at the end , some lessons learned for entrepreneurs .
I was VP of product development at Napster back in the wild days of 2000 .
We went from just a million users to over 50 million users in about 7 months time .
At the time it was the fastest growing application in the history of the internet .
I could write a book about all the wild and wacky times at Napster , the artists who secretly supported us , the visits from Metallica who did not , and other fun facts , but this story will focus on the key business issues .
Napster started out as a free download tool but the goal was to make it into a real business in partnership with the record labels .
At first Napster was too small and unknown to get a meeting with the major labels .
The record labels , and most of the rest of the world , had never heard of Napster and did n’t know what it was .
That changed in a hurry … in fact too fast .
Napster went from being an unknown underground technology to the biggest threat the record labels had ever seen , all in the span of less than six months .
At this point the record labels wanted us dead .
The goal at Napster was to be the online distribution channel for the record labels , much like iTunes and the * new * Napster is today .
There were several offers made to the labels that would have given them the vast majority of all of the revenue .
The numbers were staggering .
We had over 50 million users , many of whom were willing to pay $ 5 per month or $ 1 per download for digital music .
That translates to about $ 250 M a month or $ 3B per year .
Even if Napster kept just 10 % of the revenue that would be $ 300 M per year against expenses of less than $ 10 M .
At the stock market multiples of the day that would have been a $ 15B IPO .
The economics of the record industry are puzzling and their accounting methods are very creative .
At the time CD ’s were sold for about $ 17 at retail .
The retailer and distributor took more than half of the price as their mark - up .
The manufacturing costs took another couple bucks .
The promotional costs of advertising , music video , payola to radio stations , and other PR typically ate up all the rest of the revenue .
Only the most successful artists made any money from recording contracts , and even then only $ 1 or so per CD .
The vast majority of music groups never make any money for themselves , and barely cover costs for the labels .
Cost is a flexible term in the music business , and the way those costs get allocated can be creative indeed .
The successful artists cover some of the costs of the less successful artists .
The record business only drops about 10 % to the bottom line in good years .
The promise of Napster was simple .
Napster offered a pure profit channel with no manufacturing costs and no wholesale / retail channel costs .
Napster would have provided a huge new revenue channel that would be extremely profitable .
Napster could also target niche music markets .
We could easily find the 400,000 people who loved a particular brand of new age techno , or 100,000 that like Irish folk music .
We could introduce new artists to their specific market quickly , precisely , and cheaply , making them profitable without needing a platinum record .
More artists would make more money and the record labels could avoid much of the manufacturing , promotion , and sales channel expenses .
They would make more money on more artists at lower volumes .
But the labels would hear nothing of it .
They wanted us dead because they felt Napster ’s digital distribution business would kill the CD business .
In retrospect , the reality was that they could n’t have made a deal with us even if they wanted to .
The record labels existing contracts with the artists had no provisions for digital distribution of individual songs .
The payments to artists were all based on CD sales through the normal channels .
It took them several years to rewrite their contracts with artists to get to the point where today you can buy a single song via digital distribution .
Things looked promising for a while .
Hummer Winblad made a significant first round investment in Napster and installed Hank Barry as interim CEO .
Hank was a former entertainment lawyer at Wilson Sonsini .
He knew a lot of people in the music business and was determined to get a deal done with the labels .
Hank hired several music industry veterans in an effort to prepare Napster for a real business relationship with the labels .
We had a plan .
We just did n’t get a chance to make it work .
Later BMG ( Bertelsmann Music Group ) made a significant investment in Napster .
The CEO of BMG at the time was Thomas Middlehoff .
Mr. Middlehoff made a name for himself at BMG by doing a joint venture with AOL to create AOL Europe .
That deal made hundreds of millions for BMG and established Mr. Middlehoff as an internet visionary .
He thought Napster would be the next big thing and that he could broker business deals with the other record labels .
Things were looking good .
Then the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) sued Napster on behalf of the major record labels .
Napster hired David Boies , probably the best trial lawyer in the country .
Mr. Boies put together a very credible case and was confident we could win .
Unfortunately we ran into a judge on the 9th circuit who did n’t see it that way at all .
We lost the case in the first round , but won a “ stay ” which allowed us to continue operating until an appeal was heard by a three judge panel .
We still felt that a business deal would get done , but that the labels had the upper hand in the negotiations .
Well , as you know it did n’t turn out that way .
We made one last effort to convince the labels that they should do a deal with us .
A little known underground product called Gnutella had just surfaced .
It was a P2P file sharing program that required no central server and no company to operate it .
Gnutella was an open source program and we were already seeing new variants of it emerge .
We told the record labels that we ( Napster ) had a loyal audience of over 50 M users .
We had servers that could control distribution .
If they did n’t do a deal with us and put us out of business then Gnutella and its derivatives would become unstoppable .
There would be no company to sue and no server to shut down .
If we worked together now we could convert the market to a paying subscription or per download model .
If we did n’t do a deal chaos would ensue .
They did n’t believe us and did n’t really understand what this Gnutella threat was .
The RIAA succeeded in shutting down Napster , but lost billions in potential revenue over the next several years to Gnutella , Grokster , Morpheus , Kazaa and others .
There are still lots of P2P download systems out there , and new ones popping up all the time .
Good luck to the RIAA is trying to shut them all down .
Roxio bought the Napster name and logo in a bankruptcy auction .
They later changed their corporate name to Napster and sell music online as we had once planned to do .
Where are they now ?
The founders of Napster have gone off in many different directions .
Shawn Fanning and Ali Aydar started a company called Snocap , ironically to identify copyrighted music for the record labels .
Jordan Ritter founded CloudMark a spam protection and security company .
Sean Parker was president of Plaxo , then went to FaceBook , and is now in the VC business with Founders Fund .
Hank briefly went back to being a VC at Hummer Winblad , but is now a lawyer at Howard Rice .
Eddie Kessler , the VP of engineering is now an engineering manager at Google .
Liz Brooks , our VP of Marketing went back to the music business .
Milt Olin , our COO started a private law practice in Los Angeles .
I went on to two more start - ups ; Bowstreet and Groove Networks , and am now working with the Emerging Business Team at Microsoft .
What lessons can be learned from this experience ?
Never get too far ahead of the market .
Creating new markets , new business models , and value propositions is very difficult and takes lots of time and money .
Pioneers are usually unsuccessful , the fast followers make most of the money .
Understand who your customer is , what problem you solve , and how much they are willing to pay for it .
Sounds simple enough but you would be surprised how many start - ups get excited about their technology innovations and forget about the basic business proposition .
Never start a business focused on solving a big company ’s problem .
They do n’t know they have a problem …and they are probably right .
That is how they got to be so big in the first place .
The record labels did n’t know they had a digital distribution problem and were not interested in our solution to it .
Test your assumptions before spending lots of money .
Interview your potential customers .
Understand what their top 10 problems are .
Do n’t try to convince them that you have a solution to a problem they do n’t know they have .
Take a survey of 100 potential customers .
Ask them to list their top 10 problems , without prompting from you .
If you do n’t see your problem area listed … move on to another problem .
Marketing and image matter .
Provocative challenges make good headlines but do n't make good business .
Napster changed the world .
Millions of people rediscovered their love of music through Napster , and created a whole new way to enjoy it .
We made mistakes , but we learned valuable business lessons .
The business lesson of the Internet is that you can attract a much larger audience , and generate more revenue , with a “ try it for free , and buy it if you like it ” approach .
Seven years later , the music industry is still struggling .

Recent comments in response to posts on Dangerous Intersection have led me to write this screed .
Screed is to be the operative word for this , for it has been born out impatience and anger .
The biggest danger we face in the long run is the basic ignorance people bring to the political discourse .
If we lose our freedoms , it will not be to some tyrannical coup pulled off by a malicious politician , but because we ourselves collectively will no longer know what the hell we ’re about .
Remembering my own school days , I cannot say that the situation presently is worse –we all have a tendency to misremember our youth , claim it to be better or worse , but the only thing we can say about it is that it was differently oriented –because most of my peers did not care a bit for history then .
They plodded through their classes , primary interest focused on their own immediate desires and needs , and who cared what happened before they were born ?
What has changed is that as the world shrinks and becomes daily more pressing , the buffers that protected us in our ignorance no longer operate as efficiently or even in the same way .
One of the things that makes modern foreign entanglements more significant for the individual is that the cause and effect loop is faster , more immediate , and more threatening .
Therefore , when something begs for understanding and we look to the past for examples and counterexamples , it will not do to simply trust our leaders .
Nor will it do to have merely a Hollywood understanding of the past .
I expect this will change nothing .
But I am annoyed .
World War II is used often as a touchstone for military adventurism and the necessity of strong foreing policy .
It is also used to excuse present - day actions , to make comparisons of situations then and now , and to validate decisions taken which seem to bear some resemblence to the past .
But the people who do this the most seem rarely to know what they ’re talking about .
The world was in fact very different and America substantially so .
Let me go down a list of why comparisons –specifically between the present Middle East conflict and WWII –are simply not supportable .
One : the entire globe was struggling to emerge from economic depression .
We personalize the Great Depression here .
An American calamity .
It was bad here , very bad , but our hagiography about our nation ’s past tends to blind us to the fact that entire planet was screwed up then .
The world was in depression in the aftermath of the first world war .
The emergence of the facsist states was directly related to this central fact .
They were in many ways economic movements .
They did n’t work , they depended on pillage , hence the expansionist aspect to all the fascist regimes with the exception of Spain , which was only partly facsist in the economic sense .
One thing this meant for America at the time is that we enjoyed no clear superiority economically to any other nation .
We did , in fact , have more potential , and the fundamental vitality of our economic prior to 1929 softened–yes , softened –the onset of depression somewhat , but it hamstrung us in ways that make comparisons to the present - day situation absurd .
Furthermore , no one was sure then that capitalism would survive .
We really forget this one .
The global depression put that in doubt in ways we ca n’t imagine now .
Two :
Along with all the other problems , we had no significant military .
Not even here .
We forget today that one of the central tenets of America since the revolution was a profound distrust of standing armies of any kind .
After WWI , we stood down .
The fleet was aging , infantry were poorly trained an equipped , and numbers were low .
WWI resulted in no occupation by us of anything significant .
Three :
There was no CIA .
Or anything even close to it .
We had embassies and some embassies employed spies , usually locals , and there were a few spies employed by the government , but this was also antithetical to our vision of ourselves .
Spying grew during WWI , but Calvin Coolidge shut it down .
His secretary of state –I forget his name–closed down Room 14 with the famous saying “ Gentlemen do n’t read other people ’s mail . ”
The branches of the military had small intelligence units , but there was NOTHING like today ’s CIA , NIA , or other intelligence organizaitons .
We did not have the information - gathering capacity in any way shape or form , and even if we did , there was little we could have done with any of it .
The so - called “ super powers ” of the day were Britain , France , Russia to some extent ( although they were rabidly isolationist modern myths to the contrary –the Soviet threat we came to know and love developed after WWII ) , and the U.S. , but Britain pretty much dominated the international scene .
Four :
The technology of the day was , with certain exceptions , 19th Century .
Gasoline and diesel power had replaced coal in many ways ( for shipping , that is ) but by and large , WWII started out as a 19th Century war .
It also started out as a war among relative equals .
I could go on , but just those fundamental differences should show that comparisons cannot be made but in the most careful ways , and generally not at all .
WWII was a kind of war which we may never see again .
Saddam Hussein was not Hitler .
The closest thing we have to that kind of dictator today is in North Korea , and he is incapable of doing much more than rattle his chains , his much discussed nuclear program notwithstanding .
The social and political and economic circumstances that to the emergence of Nazi Germany and Imperialist Japan no longer pertain .
It ’s both simpler and more complex than that , but in any event it is different .
An Osama Bin Laden could not have done then what he has done today , just as an emergent Hitler could not do today what he did then .
This is important , because we have a habit in this country of eulogizing and sacrilizing the past in such a way as to argue current policy points with the underlying assumption that what we did then cna apply now .
Sometimes it can , but for the most part things have changed too much for valid comparisons .
It leads us to presume before understanding , and that has led us into a horrid mess which bears virtually no comparison to anything we did in the past or had to face .
We need to get over that habit if we ’re going to find viable solutions to future problems , and that means we better stop treating history –collectively –like a font of sacred text or that boring stuff about dead people .
End of screed .

Tom Pike : Question : Does Google support pages sent as application / xhtml+xml ?
No .
Call this anecdotal if you like , but a few days ago I mentioned two products which have been widely reviewed , and yet my entry appears fairly high on the search results .
Pleasingly , traffic is starting to flow to that post , particularly when these proct names are combined with the word “ Ubuntu ” .
I hope that these people found something that they consider useful .
The next day , I nixed content negotiation for my home page .
The day after that , I referenced a new tool created by Morten Frederiksen .
Echoes of my post were picked up by Google , but the original was not .
Joe ’s post ( served as faux XHTML to Google ) , however , does rank highly — what ’s up with that ? .
It is my belief that the W3C could learn a lot from the way the Python 3000 effort is being planned , and in particular the plans to back - port changes to Python 2.6 ( and 2.7 ! ) that will ease the transition .
But mostly what will drive the transition to Python 3 K is that people will start writing code that only works w/ Python 3.0 .
I do n’t begin to presume that I have enough clout to move the mighty Google to action , but perhaps if the folks at the W3C who authored or supported the XHTML standard had created enough meaningful content and served it with the proper media type , Google ( and Microsoft ! ) might have put XHTML support a bit higher on the priority list .
Update : now my post is top of the search results .
Manual intervention ?

I count at least five different ways the New York Times discusses how Alberto Gonzales did n't tell the truth .
They 're running out of ways to call him a liar without just saying it .
Word is that reporters are averse to using the word " liar " unless there is proof to show actual intent .
Hmmm .
How much more intent do they need ?
Rove and the Bush gang know the media wo n't call them on their lies .
So they do it over and over and over :
An accumulating body of evidence is at odds with the statements of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales ...
The conflicts between the documentary record and Mr. Gonzales ’s version of events have contributed to an erosion of support for him in Congress ...
The disparities are giving Democrats in Congress a rationale ...
As attorney general , Mr. Gonzales has become a central figure , and increasingly , critics say , the emblem of ineptitude , in the swirl of contradictions , memory lapses and conflicting testimony that has defined the unfolding story behind the removal of the prosecutors .
Mr. Gonzales also said , more explicitly : “ I never saw documents .
We never had a discussion about where things stood . ”
This directly conflicts with documents released late Friday ...
One thing to keep in mind -- Alberto Gonzales , the liar , is also the nation 's chief law enforcement official .
But Middle East experts can provide a long list of reasons why a survival - of - the - fittest theory might not necessarily be the best way to conduct American foreign policy in Iraq .
First , they say , it ’s always dangerous to take sides in a civil war .
Second , siding with the Shiites in a Shiite - Sunni war is particularly dangerous since most of the Arab world is Sunni and America ’s major Arab allies are Sunni .
Besides Iraq , Shiites form a large majority only in Iran , and , well , enough said there .
If America has problems now with Muslim extremists around the world , those would likely worsen if the United States was believed to have aided the uprooting or extermination of Iraq ’s Sunni population .
On Monday , a group of prominent Saudi clerics called on Sunni Muslims everywhere to mobilize against Shiites in Iraq , complaining that Sunnis were being murdered and marginalized by Shiites .
So , where is the Darwin Principle coming from ?
Well , there ’s no proof Mr. Cheney really even backs it .
Unnamed government officials with knowledge in the matter say the proposal comes from his office , but they stop short of saying it comes from Mr. Cheney himself .
Other top officials say it is highly unlikely that the administration would pursue such a radical course .
( Of course , the radical nature of the Darwin Principle is all the more reason to assume it comes from Mr. Cheney himself . )
But it is difficult to imagine the administration actually publicly announcing such a course even if it decided on it .
Can you just hear President Bush ’s speech to the nation ?
“ My Fellow Americans , the United States has decided that there are more Shiites than Sunnis in Iraq , so we are therefore going to side with the people most likely to win a fight to the death .
We ’ll figure out how to deal with the rest of the Arab world , where there are more Sunnis than Shiites , later . ”
Still , somewhere deep inside the Beltway , someone has laid out the intellectual basis for the Shiite option .
So some people with knowledge of the thinking behind the proposal were asked to explain it .
None agreed to be identified , citing an administration edict against talking about President Bush ’s change - of - strategy in Iraq before the president articulates exactly what that change will be .
But here ’s what they said :
America abandoned the Shiites in 1991 and look where that got us .
Mr. Cheney has argued that America ca n’t repeat what it did after the Persian Gulf war , when it called on the Shiites to rise up against Saddam Hussein , then left them to be slaughtered when they did .
The result was 12 more years of the Iraqi dictator ’s iron - fisted rule , which ended up leading to war anyway .

Amidst the usual video game champions on Amazon 's Best Sellers List : Video Games , you might find something out of the ordinary .
If you head south to around number 17 , you 'll see what I mean .

It appears that everyone 's old video game flame known as the SNES is outselling Sony 's Playstation 3 on Amazon.com .
Wonder why ?
Here 's my take :
People are n't that interested in PS3s .
Virtual Console games are giving people major cases of nostalgia .
People are so frantic for the Wii that they 'll get their hands on the closest thing .
Someone is throwing a Mario Kart tourney and ordered a metric ton of units .
Hell has frozen over .
In all seriousness though , this probably has more to do with the fact that there are ten times as many used , yellow - tinted SNES consoles floating around , but still an interesting sight nevertheless .

Note :
The list has been updated , and the PS3 has dropped to number 20 , now behind Guitar Hero II and Oblivion .

これは 、Ruby on Railsに対する実に的確な批判だと思う。だが、これによって逆にRailsの意味が見えてきたような気がする。
( このエントリ、入口はソフトのやや専門的な話ですが、例によって大風呂敷で、そこから" The World is Flat " の話につながっていくので、できればプログラマ以外の方もおつきあい下さい )
Railsというソフト開発ツールの良さは、単に便利とかフルスタック(必要な全ての機能盛合せ)ということではなく、実践的な仕事の流れが背後に想定されていることだ。頭をひねってツールを使いこなすというより、ツール(が想定しているソフト開発手順)に「乗る」という感覚で開発を進めることができる(まさに
On Rails ) 。
だから 、Railsの個々の機能の過不足を問題にするのはあまり意味が無い。仮に不足があったとしても、オープンソースなんだから、そういう問題点はたくさんの人が使っていくうちに自然とフィードバックによって直っていく。
id:habuakihiroさんは、Railsというソフト自体ではなく、それが想定している開発の手順に致命的な欠陥があると主張されているのだと思う。その欠陥とは、データベースの設計という工程が含まれていないことだ。
Railsによるソフト開発のライフサイクルは、まずデータベースのテーブルを定義することから始まる。テーブルとは、業務のデータを抽象化したもので、ソフト開発が始まった時点で誰にも自明に見えているものではない。業務分析からテーブル定義という作業では、多少なりとも形式化された作業手順が必要となるが、その手順がRailsには含まれていない。外付けである。外付けであるから好きなものを持ってきて組合せればよいかと言うと、普通の開発ツールならそれでよいのだけど、Railsの場合は、外付けの手順とRailsが想定している手順の間にギャップが発生してしまう。
「 使う」ツールであれば単体の機能をツールが提供して、足りないものは外付けで、開発者がそれらを組合せて開発プロセスを組み立てていく。Railsのように「乗る」ツールは、暗黙に提供された開発プロセスに開発者が乗って行く、身をゆだねる必要があるので、そこに不足があることは致命的で、たった一つの不足によってツールの良さが大きく損なわれる。
ただし、 「開発プロセスが前提とされている」と言っても、それは、幅の狭い一本道ではなく、アジャイルでいかようにも拡張できる柔軟なプロセスである。窮屈なプロセスではないので、不足があるにしても他のものならなんとかなるかもしれない。だが、欠けているものが「データベース設計」であるということはかなり致命的だ。
データベースのモデリングは業務分析と深く関わりあっていて、アルゴリズムのような純粋にコンピュータ技術的なものではなく、「業務」をいかに抽象化するかという話だ。これをきちんとやれば、スッキリとした見通しがよいソフトウエアができて、ここで手を抜くと、使い勝手が悪いシステムができる。特に、最初はうまく動いたとしても、業務の中で継続的に使っていくうちにボロが出て来る。
たとえて言えば、モデリングは業務ソフトの骨であって、骨の設計によって手や足の動く方向が決定してしまう。手足が曲がる方向と曲がらない方向が正しければ柔軟で使いやすいソフトウエアができる。モデリングが間違っていたら、業務がソフトの関節を逆方向にねじり上げるようなことになるのでので、ソフトが骨折してギブアップするか、「俺の手はこっちには曲がるけど、そういうふうには曲がらないんじゃ」とソフトが逆切れして業務を放り投げてしまい、システムが破綻する。
だから、業務分析とモデリングは直感でなくきちんと手順に添ってやるべき。DB設計重要。
しか しRailsは、「データベース設計は直感でやれ」と言っているに等しい。ブログとかブクマのようなものであれば直感でパッパッとできるかもしれないが、普通の業務はそうはいかない。
これはどういうことなのか？Railsは普通の業務には使えないのだろうか。
そうです。実はそうなんです。
Railsは普通の業務には使えないんです。
誰がそう言ったのか ？
他ならぬDHHのボスが、そう言っているのだから、間違いない。
世の中にはたくさんの問題がある。難しい問題は他社にまかせて、単純な問題を単純に解こう。
More Constraints
I said I ’d discuss five things you need less of , but there is one thing you need more of : Constraints .
All this less is really about more constraints .
That ’s where you ’re forced to be creative .
That ’s where you ’re squeezed to make better use of your money , your people , your time .
And out of this squeeze will come better software , more satisfying software , and simpler solutions .
直感でテーブル設計をするということは、Railsを使う上で、非常に大きな制約になる。簡単な問題では大きく生産性が向上するとしても、あるレベル以上の難しい問題は解けない。
でも、これは仕様だと思う。 「 制約は多い方がいい」と言うJason Friedはそういうツールを欲しがっていて、まさにボスのお望み通りのものをDHHはこしらえたのだと思う。
実際、業務ソフトは典型的な80:20の法則であって、80%は単純なものだ。80%でよければ銀行のオンラインなんて単なる足し算と引き算だ。誰がやってもすぐできる。しかし、これを90%にすると何千万円になって、99.99%にすると何十億円になる。もし、「難しい問題は他社にまかせて」なんてボスが言ってくれるならば、DB設計は直感的にちょちょいのちょいでできる。
あー、DHHはいいボスがいてよかったね。ボクにはそんなボスはいないよ。「難しい問題は他社にまかせて」なんて言われたことないよ。残り20%の為にたくさん苦労してきたし、これからも苦労するよ。Railsって面白いけど、別世界の話だ。仕事で使うことなんてないさ。地球の裏側に面白いこと言う二人組がいたというだけの話さ。楽しい夢の話をありがとう。とても楽しかった。
さて、そろそろボクは仕事に戻ろう。
と思ったら、そこにもう一人仲間が現れたんです。
The World * IS * Flatの中でフリードマンさんが、 「 世界のフラット化した10の力 」の一つとして「インソーシング」なんてことを言っている。たとえば、UPSが東芝のパソコンの修理を請け負うという話。UPSの物流センターのハブの空港の中に、東芝の修理工場を作ってしまう。そして、故障したパソコンをハブに運び、直し、ハブから客の所に戻し、代金を受け取る。そういう一連の業務を東芝の看板でUPSの社員が行なう。
宅急便の代引とか 、Amazon e託販売サービスみたいなことを、もっと大規模に総合的に行なうということのようだ。
インソーシングとは物流や在庫だけでなく、代金回収や売上分析からクレーム対応からその周辺にある業務を全部飲みこんでしまうことらしい。こういうことを地球規模で行う会社が、これからの流行りになると、 "
The World IS Flat " のフリードマンさんが言っている。巨大な企業が80:20の20を肩代わりするということだ。
コイツが 、DHH やJason Friedの一味だとボクが思うのは、
「難しい問題は他社にまかせて」系の話をしているからだ。
インソーサーに頼るならば、「業務」はずいぶん単純になるような気がする。そして、インソーサーというインフラが確立することで、特定の狭いジャンルに特化した企業が増えるから、そういう会社向けの単純な仕事が増えるのかもしれない。それが、不可避の流れだとしたら、「単純な仕事をスッキリこなす」系のツールの適用範囲は、今見える範囲より随分広がっていくだろう。
もちろん、残り20%の仕事は消えてなくなるわけじゃない。インソーサーの中には、これまで以上の巨大な複雑さが増殖していく。彼らは規模の経済によって、きめ細かく地道にそれをこなしていくだろう。id:habuakihiroさんクラスの技術者ならば、そこでいくらでも活躍の場がある。でも、そういうインフラ系の企業は、地球全体で二つか三つに集約されていくだろう。そこではとてつもない規模のシステムが開発され続け、巨大なソフト需要を生み続けるだろう。
それはそうなんだけど、そういう会社は地球全体で業種ごとに二つか三つ。
DHH とJason Friedのような人が特殊だと思っていて、ボクの方が普通だと思っていたけど、ボクの言う「普通」は地球全体で業種ごとに二つか三つに集約されていくとしたら、いったい全体、「普通」とはどっちなんだろう。単純なことを単純にこなす中小企業の単純なシステムを開発するソフトウエア技術者か、巨大なインソーサーの巨大で複雑なシステムを開発するソフトウエア技術者か。
「逆効果」とまでは思わないけど、この主張は理解できます。何より、ここでid:habuakihiroさんが、暗黙にイメージされているであろう「業務」というものの性質について、私は共感します。
ただ、上に上げた三人の主張を自分なりに合成してしまうと、現在の「業務」に対する全体最適化は、「フラット化」された世界においては部分最適化になるということです。
「 直感 的DB設計 + アジャイル( テストファースト)による進化」で対応できる複雑さは、Rubyという言語の柔軟性とRailsとフレームワークの筋の良さによってかなり向上していると思います。しかし、向上しているとは言っても、私が今持っている「業務」のレベルの複雑さに対応できるものではない。ただ、そこにある「複雑さの限界」は、「インソーサー」という存在を前提とした業務の平均的複雑さにちょうどよく対応しているように、私には思えます。
「 フラット化」された世界の「インソーサ」の外にあるシステムには、Railsはちょうどいいのかもしれません。もちろん疑問はたくさんあります。
経済の問題として、80:20の80に特化し20を切り落し「複雑な問題は他社にまかせて」連携する小規模な企業が、本当に経済の主流となるかどうか?
ソフトウエア開発の問題として、80:20の80に特化することが許されるとしたら、最適なソフトウエア開発プロセスはどのように変化していくか?
複雑さに金が落ちる時代は本当に終わるのか？
ということで 、Ruby
On Rails の提起している問題は、ソフトウエアの世界に留まらない、非常に大きな射程を持っているように思うのですが、楽々ERDレッスン ( CodeZine BOOKS ) を注文しつつ、自作のテンプレートライブラリをRails対応にする作業をしている私は、完全に日和ってます。
DIGG THIS
More than three years ago , George Bush unleashed the dogs of war on Iraq , perhaps hoping that he would take his place among the “ great ” war presidents .
It ’s strange how these guys imagine themselves written about in history books in the manner of Washington , Lincoln , and FDR , rather than Truman , Johnson , and Nixon .
It ’s been more than 50 years since war immortalized a president , and yet they keep trying .
The dogs of war did n’t build freedom and democracy in Iraq , or bring justice or peace .
Rather , they came right back and ravaged the Republican Party in the election of 2006 .
This election has probably sealed Bush ’s place in history as a failed war president who used a period of national anxiety about terrorism for his own personal aggrandizement and the enrichment of his coterie .
That was n’t part of the plan .
The loss of the House and perhaps the Senate is all the more extraordinary considering that the failed ( no longer any dispute about that ) war on Iraq was the decisive issue at every level .
Think about this .
We ’ve grown accustomed to believing that economic interest alone dictates voter habits .
From that point of view , voters have little to complain about on the surface .
Unemployment is low , stocks are up , inflation is mixed but under control , and growth is not brilliant but creditable .
The Iraq War is in the news constantly but it has little impact on most American voters .
The draft is threatened but not likely .
The war debt is high but hidden .
What do regular Americans care whether we were lied into war or that Iraq suffers under military occupation that is driving the country into the hands of fanatical Islamic theocrats ?
Well , apparently many voters do care , even those who do n’t have family members fighting and dying .
Many people voted based on what might otherwise seem to be an abstraction .
Bush undertook this war with arrogance and claims of god - like power .
The result has been catastrophic .
And apparently this amazing failure of government had an impact on the vote .
How very 19th century !
How very extraordinary !
It seems that a certain impulse toward idealism still can make the margin of difference .
It ’s not only about economic interest .
Issues of peace and justice and truthfulness really do matter , even now .
Ideas and not interests alone can still change the course of history , even in an age of cynical democracy in which buying and selling votes is said to be what matters .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that the party that has failed has also taken down some good ideas , among which is that vast increases in the minimum wage are bad for working people .
The Republicans campaigned against the many ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage .
Six states approved increases in the minimum wage .
None of the increases will be devastating to the economies of these states , since they are still low in real terms .
But one can only be aghast at the economic ignorance behind such ballots , which are pushed by unionized , high - wage workers precisely to block low - wage workers from entering into job competition .
I suppose we should be glad that these are taking place on the state level instead of nationwide .
That ’s some consolation .
But they might also be harbingers of the essential struggle to come : whether the economy ought to be controlled and regimented or be permitted to be governed by free - market exchange alone .
These are the sorts of debates a normal country has .
With war out of the picture , who ca n ’t but welcome such a debate ?
As bad as these socialistic ideas are , Republican economic interventions such as Sarbanes - Oxley are to some degree worse than a minimum - wage increase .
And consider too the Republican Medicare expansions .
Who would you rather have ruling you ?
Social democrats or fascists ?
It ’s a pathetic fact that the Republican Party squandered yet another opportunity to make a difference for the good in this country .
They forever promise freedom but forever deliver despotism .
They might have shrunk government , really cut taxes , balanced the budget , reformed money , freed up trade , or decentralized government .
Instead , they threw it all away to defend an indefensible war .
If the Democrats inch us closer to socialism at home , the Republicans must share in the blame for having attempted socialist - style planning on the international level , and more welfare and economic controls at home , not to mention an expansion of the police state .
Let there be no more talk of the good guys and bad guys in the mainstream of American political life .
The state in all its forms is the enemy , and both parties are part of the problem .
You think it ca n’t happen ?
That there are too many interest groups dedicated to the permanence of power and planning ?
The election of 2006 shows that short - term economic interests alone do not always dictate the political future .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
One accused him of misunderstanding the advice he had been given on the issue at a Downing Street summit .
Black community leaders reacted after Mr Blair said the recent violence should not be treated as part of a general crime wave , but as specific to black youth .
He said people had to drop their political correctness and recognise that the violence would not be stopped " by pretending it is not young black kids doing it " .
It needed to be addressed by a tailored counter - attack in the same way as football hooliganism was reined in by producing measures aimed at the specific problem , rather than general lawlessness .
Mr Blair 's remarks are at odds with those of the Home Office minister Lady Scotland , who told the home affairs select committee last month that the disproportionate number of black youths in the criminal justice system was a function of their disproportionate poverty , and not to do with a distinctive black culture .
Giving the Callaghan lecture in Cardiff , the prime minister admitted he had been " lurching into total frankness " in the final weeks of his premiership .
He called on black people to lead the fight against knife crime .
He said that " the black community - the vast majority of whom in these communities are decent , law abiding people horrified at what is happening - need to be mobilised in denunciation of this gang culture that is killing innocent young black kids " .
Mr Blair said he had been moved to make his controversial remarks after speaking to a black pastor of a London church at a Downing Street knife crime summit , who said : " When are we going to start saying this is a problem amongst a section of the black community and not , for reasons of political correctness , pretend that this is nothing to do with it ? "
Mr Blair said there needed to be an " intense police focus " on the minority of young black Britons behind the gun and knife attacks .
The laws on knife and gun gangs needed to be toughened and the ringleaders " taken out of circulation " .
Last night , British African - Caribbean figures leading the fight against gang culture condemned Mr Blair 's speech .
The Rev Nims Obunge , chief executive of the Peace Alliance , one of the main organisations working against gang crime , denounced the prime minister .
Mr Obunge , who attended the Downing Street summit chaired by Mr Blair in February , said he had been cited by the prime minister : " He makes it look like I said it 's the black community doing it .
What I said is it 's making the black community more vulnerable and they need more support and funding for the work they 're doing .
...
He has taken what I said out of context .
We came for support and he has failed and has come back with more police powers to use against our black children . "
Keith Jarrett , chair of the National Black Police Association , whose members work with vulnerable youngsters , said : " Social deprivation and delinquency go hand in hand and we need to tackle both .
It is curious that the prime minister does not mention deprivation in his speech . "
Lee Jasper , adviser on policing to London 's mayor , said : " For years we have said this is an issue the black community has to deal with .
The PM is spectacularly ill - informed if he thinks otherwise .
" Every home secretary from [ David ]
Blunkett onwards has been pressed on tackling the growing phenomenon of gun and gang crime in deprived black communities , and government has failed to respond to what has been a clear demand for additional resources to tackle youth alienation and disaffection " .
The Home Office has already announced it is looking at the possibility of banning membership of gangs , tougher enforcement of the supposed mandatory five - year sentences for possession of illegal firearms , and lowering the age from 21 to 18 for this mandatory sentence .
Answering questions later Mr Blair said : " Economic inequality is a factor and we should deal with that , but I do n't think it 's the thing that is producing the most violent expression of this social alienation .
" I think that is to do with the fact that particular youngsters are being brought up in a setting that has no rules , no discipline , no proper framework around them . "
Some people working with children knew at the age of five whether they were going to be in " real trouble " later , he said .
Mr Blair is known to believe the tendency for many black boys to be raised in families without a father leads to a lack of appropriate role models .
He said : " We need to stop thinking of this as a society that has gone wrong - it has not - but of specific groups that for specific reasons have gone outside of the proper lines of respect and good conduct towards others and need by specific measures to be brought back into the fold . "
The Commission for Racial Equality broadly backed Mr Blair , saying people " should n't be afraid to talk about this issue for fear of sounding prejudiced " .
Mr Blair spoke out as a second teenager was due to appear in court charged with the murder of 14 - year - old Paul Erhahon , stabbed to death in east London on Friday .
He was the seventh Londoner under 16 to be murdered since the end of January , and his 15 - year - old friend , who was also stabbed , remains in hospital .

It is striking at both low and high resolution , and the image detail is awesome .
It makes me want to go north even though I 've had enough of the damned snow already .
A picture like this is not easy to take !
I 've seen this from the cockpit window of a 747 over Hudson 's Bay -- spectacular !
Fantastic !
Love the earth .
a beautiful picture .
Beautiful composition and unusually good photo of aurora
A fantastic image of the aurora
Far above the rest .
Beyond compare .
has to get my vote , since Wikinews used it
This is a really nice picture .
I 've always been fond of the Northern Lights .
Beautiful shot
wOw ( Capital " O " )
simply stunning ...
I really like the colours reflecting back in the snow
Very rare .
Gives people a distant and mysterious feeling .
Excellent .
Earth , our only home , an inconvenient truth .
absolutely beautiful pic , I hope to see it myself some day .
If I had to pic one thing I 'd like to see , I 'd go with that .
Stunning .
Truly amazing , awesome colours , makes me want to move to the Arctic !
beautiful and valuable
Love it , very deserving .
Definitely caught my attention .
Loved it .
Very beautiful picture of the Northern Lights ( I wish it was this visible in MN )
I 've been on that very road , and for some reason it always produces the best lights .

Probably the most informative , and certainly one of the best - composed pictures on the Commons .
This picture is creepy ...
that 's not a picture , that 's a whole story
amazing composition .
I 've always liked this pic
The shot is composed beautifully and the lighting is superb .
Great pic , perfect colours and lots of personality !
Beautiful .
Brilliant and intelligent
Easy to overlook in the thumbnails , but it is a portrait not just a " snapshot . "
Unbelievably realistic .
Not only a fantastic photograph , but it conveys something more than the rest .
they 're all brilliant and beautiful , but this one is very powerful .
compelling shot , composition , lighting , everything .
Absolutely beautiful .
carries information , not only effects
real life
Beautiful picture .
The light , tone and grainy quality compliment the subject matter perfectly .
Great photos tell a story , which this one does
A moving picture telling a human story .
The biggest richness ; joy of living , even in the poverty
It says so much .
I just hope someone renames the picture .
These are all well done informational images , but this is the only photo here that has something to say beyond that .
A stark and dramatic presentation of the bland .
Very striking .
This one truly hits a nerve for me .
I wonder how he would feel about this photograph …
wonder if he 's seen it ..
Pour l'amour de l'humanité ...
Amazing detail .
I like great colors , but the subject matter of this one has my vote .
because it 's probably the best scene .
It took guts to compose this so carefully .
Brutally beautiful .
Birds and different views all are verry nice , but pic 2 tells not only about the depicted person , but also about the condition of a western society .
It needs courage and knowledge al well making such a portrait .
This is n't the most beautiful picture , but it is the most important .
It 's stark beauty , and inherent poetical nature make it stand out among the other works .
The muted colors add to the overall effect producing an image of instant emotional and critical response .
Incredible .
Captivating .

it 's just too cute !
So much precise detail in the plumage , the bit of frost on the beak , and the feet .
exceptionnel !!! : très esthétique ( magnifique oiseau dans ce décors de neige , le givre sur le bout du bec ... ) , pédagogique : on voit avec précision l'organisation extérieur du plumage , des couleurs , la texture du bec , la concitution des pattes , on voit la rétine de l'oeil ... ; elle témoigne de la spécificité de la force contributive de l'art photographique à la connaissance : impossible pour la plupart d'entre nous d'approcher d'aussi près et de façon statique un oiseau et pouvoir observer ainsi dans les détails son aspect extérieur !
Cette photo est une richesse exptionnelle pour le projet wikipédia !
excellent , exceptional , brilliant .
My favorite , using it as wallpaper .
no visible artifacts and crystal clear !
informative and simple .
Unbelievable clarity ... love the snow on the tip of the beak !

The snow on the Jay 's beak seals the deal for me .

Beauty and superb technique too .
it 's amazing .
Combines all that the POTY should represent .
I like the natural theme of this one .
My favorite since i've seen it first time .

Sex sells , especially if it 's captured in a photograph like this .

High enough resolution , suberb composition , fascinating
It is technically maybe not the most perfect .
But it has a great atmosphere ...
Very beautiful image .
A stunning comment on the relationship of our technological society with the rest of the planet .
You do n't see something like that every day .
A haunting photo , looks like a raised Titanic !
this is my favorite considering encyclopedic use and " loveliness "
Simply a great shot enriching commons .

Half a ship due to simply the force of nature .
Amazing pic of the ship , I must say .
Very nice picture .
Plus bonus points for geotagging !
Apocalypse now ...
Great shot , strongly evocative !
Really nice detail and color .
Wonderful narrative image .
This looks so unreal ; pale colors ( I use the same camera , so I know almost all pics are pale as this one :) ) add to this feel , and it's as if the ship has come to its grave .
The big , old , heavy , unnatural , rusty ship and the unforgiving sea .
Beautifully symbolic . :)
it 's an unrepeatable shot documenting an encyclopedic event .

taking a bunch of PD images and making an informative PD animation out of it is truly inspiring .
Talented creator , smooth animation , incredibly beautiful and fascinating
great work
Who could not like the moo-oon ?
educational and a large amount of preparation work .
Motion picture !
I 've always wanted to see the moon in this aspect .
Beautiful , informative , illuminating .
It represents the values of wikipedia perfectly
the animation sold me .
this is also the most useful , imho , for leading to knowledge of a concept .
I heart moon
I chose this one because I think that it is the most educational of the bunch , as fitting for an encyclopedia .
A marvelous illustration of an otherwise difficult to visualize phenomenon .
wonderful picture !
Very informative .
All of the pictures are outstanding , but in the Wiki spirit I have to vote for number 4 because I 've actually shown it to a family member to explain the concept .
Impressive animation
For its encyclopedic value and clarity
because of its beauty , uniqueness and importance as an illustration .
It is rare for a single picture to convey so much in so simple a fashion
Makes a difficult concept clear .
All images are extremely good , however this one shows a lot of imagination .
that must have been a real challenge not just skill ( and i bet it took a lot ) but luck on on the weather also .
Great astronomy animation , congratulations !
I like that it teaches you and is pretty too !
Just great .

As the production from Saudi Arabia continues to lag , even if transiently , Russian production and exports become more critical to world supply .
And so we exchange the problems of getting oil from the sandy wastes of the Empty Quarter , with those of production from the icy wastes of Siberia .
There are a couple of small issues , that I thought could be discussed , relative to this .
The first of these relates to gas supplies from that part of the world .
It was interesting to note , in light of a number of comments made on this site about Gazprom ’s acquisition of Western European pipeline company shares , that they now appear to be similarly interested in those of Portugal , as their strategy to control gas flows throughout Europe continues to succeed .
The benefits , to them , of this policy are clear , for example in the negotiations over Kovykta , a field with 2 tcf of natural gas and over half a billion barrels of condensate .
The plans were to sell some 2 bcf , largely locally , and then to expand deliveries through pipeline networks .
Unfortunately BP has noted :
TNK - BP cannot sell gas from its vast east Siberian Kovykta field or its smaller Rospan unit in western Siberia without Gazprom because of the Russian gas giant 's monopoly control over Russia 's pipeline network .
And here it has a problem , since the local market is not large enough to absorb the gas that the field can produce ...

Converting Pi to binary : DON'T DO IT sasdvp@unx.sas.com ( David Phillips )

[ Forwarded from comp.risks , written by Keith F. Lynch < kfl@keithlynch.net > , posted with his permission - ed. ]
WARNING : Do NOT calculate Pi in binary .
It is conjectured that this number is normal , meaning that it contains ALL finite bit strings .
If you compute it , you will be guilty of :

Which IS illegal -- just ask Keith Henson .

In fact , all of the nastiest POSSIBLE computer viruses .
Some of the files on my PC are intensely personal , and I for one do n't want you snooping through a copy of them .
You might get away with computing just a few digits , but why risk it ?
There 's no telling how far into Pi you can go without finding the secret documents about the JFK assassination , a photograph of your neighbor 's six year old daughter doing the nasty with the family dog , or a complete copy of the not - yet - released Pearl Harbor movie .
So just do n't do it .
The same warning applies to e , the square root of 2 , Euler 's constant , Phi , the cosine of any non-zero algebraic number , and the vast majority of all other real numbers .
There 's a reason why these numbers are always computed and shown in decimal , after all .

Non-Terrorist Embarrassment in Boston
The story is almost too funny to write about seriously .
To advertise the Cartoon Network show “ Aqua Teen Hunger Force , ” the network put up 38 blinking signs ( kind of like Lite Brites ) around the Boston area .
The Boston police decided — with absolutely no supporting evidence — that these were bombs and shut down parts of the city .
Now the police look stupid , but they ’re trying really not hard not to act humiliated :
Governor Deval Patrick told the Associated Press : “ It ’s a hoax — and it ’s not funny . ”
Unfortunately , it is funny .
What is n’t funny is now the Boston government is trying to prosecute the artist and the network instead of owning up to their own stupidity .
The police now claim that they were “ hoax ” explosive devices .
I do n’t think you can claim they are hoax explosive devices unless they were intended to look like explosive devices , which merely a cursory look at any of them shows that they were n’t .
But it ’s much easier to blame others than to admit that you were wrong :
“ It is outrageous , in a post 9/11 world , that a company would use this type of marketing scheme , ” Mayor Thomas Menino said .
“ I am prepared to take any and all legal action against Turner Broadcasting and its affiliates for any and all expenses incurred . ”
And :
Rep . Ed Markey , a Boston - area congressman , said , “ Whoever thought this up needs to find another job . ”
“ Scaring an entire region , tying up the T and major roadways , and forcing first responders to spend 12 hours chasing down trinkets instead of terrorists is marketing run amok , ” Markey , a Democrat , said in a written statement .
“ It would be hard to dream up a more appalling publicity stunt . ”
And :
“ It had a very sinister appearance , ” [ Massachusetts Attorney General Martha ]
Coakley told reporters .
“ It had a battery behind it , and wires . ”
For heavens sake , do n’t let her inside a Radio Shack .
I like this comment :
They consisted of magnetic signs with blinking lights in the shape of a cartoon character .
And everyone knows that bombs have blinking lights on ‘ em .
Every single movie bomb you ’ve ever seen has a blinking light .
Triumph for Homeland Security , guys .
And this one :
“ It ’s almost too easy to be a terrorist these days , ” said Jennifer Mason , 26 .
“ You stick a box on a corner and you can shut down a city . ”
And this one , by one of the artists who installed the signs :
“ I find it kind of ridiculous that they ’re making these statements on TV that we must not be safe from terrorism , because they were up there for three weeks and no one noticed .
It ’s pretty commonsensical to look at them and say this is a piece of art and installation , ” he said .
Right .
If this was n’t a ridiculous overreaction to a non-existent threat , then how come the devices were in place for weeks without anyone noticing them ?
What does that say about the Boston police ?
Maybe if the Boston police stopped wasting time and money searching bags on subways ….
Of the 2,449 inspections between Oct. 10 and Dec. 31 , the bags of 27 riders tested positive in the initial screening for explosives , prompting further searches , the Globe found in an analysis of daily inspection reports obtained under the state ’s Freedom of Information Act .
In the additional screening , 11 passengers had their bags checked by explosive - sniffing dogs , and 16 underwent a physical search .
Nothing was found .
These blinking signs have been up for weeks in ten cities — Boston , New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Atlanta , Seattle , Portland , Austin , San Francisco , and Philadelphia — and no one else has managed to panic so completely .
Refuse to be terrorized , people !
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/2 ) :
Here ’s some good information about whether the stunt broke the law or not .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/3 ) : This is 100 % right :
Let ’s get a few facts straight on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force sign fiasco : 1 . Attorney General Martha Coakley needs to shut up and stop using the word “ hoax . ”
There was no hoax .
Hoax implies Turner Networks and the ATHF people were trying to defraud or confuse people as to what they were doing .
Hoax implies they were trying to make their signs look like bombs .
They were n’t .
They made Lite - Brite signs of a cartoon character giving the finger .
2 . It bears repeating again that Turner , and especially Berdovsky , did absolutely nothing illegal .
The devices were not bombs .
They did not look like bombs .
They were all placed in public spaces and caused no obstruction to traffic or commerce .
At most , Berdovsky is guilty of littering or illegal flyering .
3 . The “ devices ” were placed in ten cities , and have been there for over two weeks .
No other city managed to freak out and commit an entire platoon of police officers to scaring their own city claiming they might be bombs .
No other mayor agreed to talk to Fox News with any statement beyond “ no comment ” when spending the day asking if this was a “ terrorist dry run . ”
4 . There is nothing , not a single thing , remotely suggesting that Turner or the guerilla marketing firm they hired intended to cause a public disturbance .
Many have claimed the signs were “ like saying ‘ fire ’ in a crowded theater . ”
Wrong .
This was like taping a picture of a fire to the wall of a theater and someone freaked out and called the fire department .
And this is also worth reading .

[ Python - 3000 ]
Refactoring tool available ( work in progress )
In the sandbox I 've been working on a refactoring tool , which could form the basis for a Python 2.x -> 3.0 conversion tool .
I 'd like to invite folks here to give it a try and give me a hand .
It certainly needs more work , but I think that the basic infrastructure is sound .
Check out sandbox / 2to3 / : http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/2to3/.
This message is to invite feedback , and to encourage contributions .
It would be great if people tried their hands at writing new transformations !
A brief description of how it works :
We start with a slightly modified version of tokenize .py .
The tokens are passed to a parsing engine ( the Python re-implementation of pgen that I wrote at Elemental ) , also slightly modified , which builds up a concrete parse tree .
Through some simple tricks ( this is what I had to modify tokenize . py for ) , the parse tree contains annotations that hold on to all comments and whitespace between tokens .
This allows us to reconstruct the original source * exactly * .
( I tested this on all .py files in the Python distribution and every single file got reconstructed exactly . )
Once we 've build a parse tree for a file we can start refactoring .
This is done by traversing the parse tree looking for nodes that match a given pattern ; for matching nodes , we invoke a transformation method that returns a replacement node ( or None if further inspection shows we can't actually do it despite the pattern matching ) ; then this node is grafted into the tree in place of the originally matching node .
Originally I created matching patterns by constructing a little tree of " pattern nodes " .
This quickly got tedious , and I designed a simple language for creating patterns ( inspired by the language used to describe Python 's grammar ) .
The transformation routine is still just Python code ; I would like to be able to use a more compact notation for this too , but it 's more complicated since ( in practice ) there is a lot of ad - hoc testing that goes on .
Well , have a look at the three example transformations in the code ( in the " fixes " subdirectory ) .
There 's a driver program ( refactor.py ) that lets you repeat this process for any number of files or for all Python files in a given directory tree , with command line switches to select which transformations to apply and whether to actually write back the transformed files or just show the diffs that * would * be applied ( the default ) .
Let me describe how the " apply " transformation works , from a high level .
This should change apply ( f , x , y ) into f(*x , **y ) ( and similar if y is missing ) .
The pattern looks like this , in first approximation : power < ' apply ' trailer < ' ( ' arglist < any ' , ' any [ ' , ' any ] > ' ) ' > >
This references the following rules from the Python grammar ( I 'm only showing the parts that matter for this example ) : power : atom trailer * ['**' factor ] atom : NAME | ... trailer : '. ' NAME | ' [ ' subscriptlist ' ] ' | ' (' [ arglist ] ' ) ' arglist : argument ( ' , ' argument ) *
In the pattern language , " power < ... > " means " match a node of type ' power ' whose subnodes match ... " .
In this example , the ... is ' apply ' trailer < ...> ; then those ... are filled in with ' (' arglist <...> ' ) ' and finally those ... are : any ' , ' any [ ' , ' any ] .
Here ' any ' is a special token that matches every possible node , and [...] indicates an optional part .
Stuff in quotes of course means literal tokens ; we use this to match specific keywords , identifiers or operators .
Patterns match only the formal grammar ; they completely ignore the whitespace and comments that are included in the parse tree as annotations .
The pattern language has an additional useful feature : you can associate names with subpatterns , and the pattern matching process ( if successful ) will return a dictionary that maps those names to the tree nodes that matched those subpatterns .
The syntax for this is currently to prefix the subpattern with " NAME= " ;
I 'm not sure if this is the most readable syntax but it's the best I could come up with .
The final pattern language feature is negative look - ahead matches ; something like ( not xyzzy ) forces the match to fail if the pattern xyzzy matches at this point .
( I wanted the syntax to be ! xyzzy but tokenizer .
py does n't like that because !
is n't a valid Python delimiter . )
So now we have identified a node that matches the pattern .
The transformation extracts the subnodes corresponding to f , x and y ( if present ) , and then constructs a new node of the form f( * x , **y ) .
There 's one complication worth mentioning : when the original code is apply ( f+y , a , b ) then the transformation must be ( f+y ) ( a , b ) .
We add the parentheses only when really needed though .
There are some unsolved problems .
First of all , we do n't have a symbol table .
If apply is redefined in a particular scope , we do n't notice this and still apply the transformation .
And of course apply is a relatively simple case ( being a free variable ) ; has_key is more complicated , e.g. imagine x.y.z.has_key(a ) .
Second , the transformations can sometimes lose comments .
For example , if the input looks something like ( x.has_key # blah ( y ) ) the # blah comment is lost , since there is no good place to put it in the translation " (y in x ) " .
Part of this problem is solvable by making the transformations preserve comments more carefully ; but sometimes there just is n't a good place to put them .
Maybe this is rare enough in practice that we could just leave such cases untranslated , instead flagging them as code that requires manual conversion .
I also expect to run into problems with transformations for things like . keys ( ) ; right now the best solution I can think of is to translate xxx.keys ( ) into list ( xxx.keys ( ) ) and translate xxx.iterkeys ( ) into iter ( xxx.keys ( ) ) .
That 's ugly ; but I can't think of anything better without doing a ton of whole - program analysis , which I 'd like to avoid .
The .keys ( ) transformation is also likely to make the tool non-idempotent ; that 's perhaps unavoidable , but still unfortunate , since it means you have to keep track of which files already have received which transformations .
Finally , I have a dream : a GUI that will let you do this interactively , sort of like query - replace in Emacs .
But this message is already too long , so I 'll stop for now .
Thanks for reading this far .

As severall people , I run into issue with some spammer using my comment system to spam , and post backlinks .
( Even using some funny stuffs )
I ‘m already using a good email spam filter : SpamBayes , so I decided to test bayesian filtering for the spam on this blog too .
I decided to give Reverend a try :
from reverend .
thomas import Bayes SPAM_DB='spam.bayes ' guesser = Bayes ( ) # load the spam DB try : guesser.load( SPAM_DB ) except IOError : print " Creating a new spam filter database " guesser.save( SPAM_DB ) def train_spam ( text ) : guesser.train ( ' spam ' , text ) guesser.save( SPAM_DB ) def train_ham ( text ) : guesser.train ( 'ham ' , text ) guesser.save( SPAM_DB ) # try to guess the spam / ham ratio of a text def guess ( text ) : spam = 0 ham = 0 value = guesser.guess ( text ) for o in value : if o[ 0 ] == ' ham ' : ham = o [ 1 ] if o[ 0 ] == ' spam ' : spam = o [ 1 ] return ( ham , spam )
Small , and really simple module no ?
The next step , simply add a ‘ spam ’ and ‘ ham ’ attributes on your comment post .
And add two methods to train the comment as a spam or a ham ..
And of course , only display comments which have a good ratio ( > 1 ) ham / spam .
This took me about 1 hour to implement …
After a week , of train , this is working very fine , not a single false positive , and it filter every spam since the first trains .
As I get around 20 spams post per day , this is quite a good news ;)
Enjoy Bayesian ?

Dr Hwang has been hailed as a hero in South Korea
At least nine of 11 stem cell colonies used in a landmark research paper by Dr Hwang Woo - suk were faked , said Roh Sung - il , who collaborated on the paper .
Dr Hwang wants the US journal Science to withdraw his paper on stem cell cloning , Mr Roh said .
Dr Hwang , who is reported to be receiving hospital treatment for stress , was not available for comment .
Science could not confirm whether it had received a request to retract the paper .
Dr Hwang 's paper had been hailed as a breakthrough , opening the possibility of cures for degenerative diseases .
QUICK GUIDE

Resignation
Last month , Dr Hwang resigned from his main post as head of the World Stem Cell Hub , after it emerged that some of the eggs used in his research were donated by his staff - in contravention of international guidelines .
Now it is some of the research itself which is being called into question .
Hwang Woo -suk successfully cloned a puppy , called Snuppy
" Professor Hwang admitted to fabrication , " Mr Roh told South Korea 's MBC television network after visiting him in hospital .
Dr Hwang 's paper claimed to have produced 11 stem cell lines from cloned human embryos .
But Mr Roh has said that a scientist working in Dr Hwang 's laboratory was pressured into doctoring results to make the embryos look like clones .
Transatlantic doubts
Mr Roh 's comments came shortly after the lead US author of the published paper appealed for his name to be removed from the paper , citing doubts over the accuracy of the work .
University of Pittsburgh biologist Gerald Schatten said he recommended that Dr Hwang and all other co-authors ask for a formal retraction .
In a statement , Science said that all authors of a paper would need to agree to make a retraction possible .
The BBC's Charles Scanlon in Seoul says the revelations have sparked a furious debate in the South Korean media .
Leading companies have pulled their advertisements from the television station that first revealed the reported problems with Dr Hwang 's work .
Many commentators said it was unpatriotic to challenge someone who had given the country a lead in such a promising new area .
The stem cell technique being pioneered by Dr Hwang could lead to possible cures for diseases including diabetes and Parkinson's .

Unfortunately , we ’ve just given it one , thus making this whole first paragraph redundant .
On the plus
IN 1994 , Calvin Klein designed a fragrance that embodied , in its flat little screw - top bottle , the disaffected , sexually ambivalent grunge youth of the moment .
CK
One , with its unconventional black and white advertisements filled with moping , androgynous models , was arguably the most perfectly tailored fragrance ever pitched to one market , breaking industry rules and records , selling 20 bottles per minute at its peak .
A unisex brand that became the olfactory talisman of Generation X , CK One was so authentically grunge it was carried in record stores alongside albums by Nirvana .
Next month , Calvin Klein Inc. and Coty , its fragrance licensee , will introduce a sequel to CK
One for a new generation , the so - called millennials , and in doing so , they will attempt to capture lightning in a bottle for a second time .
Calvin Klein , now without its namesake designer , hopes to rejuvenate a fragrance embodying the essence of hip 20 - somethings — even at the risk that such a notion is as outdated as a Prince song about partying like it ’s 1999 .
There are reasons to ask whether the Calvin Klein company can repeat its CK One success .
The beauty industry has been in a slump for several years , facing a decline that is in part the result of young consumers spending more money on electronics than on fashion and fragrances .
CK
One offshoots — CK
Be , introduced in 1996 ; several limited - edition bottle designs since 2000 ; and a fruitier CK
One remix from the summer of 2004 — served as little more than stopgaps in the decline of a brand that , to today ’s young adults , is as antiquated as shopping for music in a record store .
CK One , which had annual sales of about $ 90 million in the mid-1990s , now sells about $ 30 million in the United States , its reign having ended around the time Mr. Klein sold his company to Phillips - Van Heusen in 2002 and stepped back from daily involvement .
Added to its other challenges , the Calvin Klein company is trying to develop a hit fragrance without the era-defining instincts Mr. Klein displayed in the days when he hired Brooke Shields to sell bluejeans .
The only major figure to carry over from the creation of the original scent is Ann Gottlieb , a fragrance consultant and the nose of Calvin Klein since the designer started making scents in 1985 .
She described the concepts of CK One and its sequel “ as different as red and yellow . ”

Die acht Schritte zum Spießertum - Eine Anleitung
Viele Jugendliche entscheiden sich heute für ein wertekonservatives Leben .
Das bringt Souveränität und Sicherheit in allen Lebenslagen und das gute Gefühl , von der Mehrheit der Menschen anerkannt und respektiert zu sein .
Doch ein kontrolliertes und an Werten ausgerichtetes Leben will gelernt sein .
Nur scheinbar konservative Jugendliche , die Frack und häusliche Ordnung als Mode begreifen , haben die Vorstellung vom deutschen Benimm verwässert .
Der ZUENDER veröffentlicht eine Anleitung zum spießigen Lebenswandel für sie und ihn .
Dieser Artikel wird hier diskutiert
1. Schritt : Logiksystem  Denken Sie einfach !
Voraussetzung für ein aufgeräumtes Leben sind Grundsätze , die Ihr Leben durchwirken .
Dazu zählen die wichtigen Werte und die  Reduktion .
Die wichtigen Werte bedingen Handlungsentscheidungen .
Es gibt zehn wichtige Werte , sie lauten :  Treue , Höflichkeit , Präzision , Fleiß , Sparsamkeit , Ehrlichkeit , Voraussicht , Standhaftigkeit , Bescheidenheit , Disziplin .
Bei Anwendung ergänzen sie sich wie ein geschlossenes System .
Zur Reduktion : Besinnen
Sie sich auf konservative , volkstümliche Kultur .
Verinnerlichen
Sie , dass es immer nur einen Zweck gibt .
Die Arbeit ist für die Erwirtschaftung von Lebensgrundlagen da , die Freizeit zur Erholung , die Familie für den Fortbestand der Gene .
Achten Sie im Alltag auch darauf , dass die Natur der Untertan des Menschen bleibt .
Auf gepflegte Grünflächen sollte jede Ortsverwaltung achten .
Bei Nachlässigkeit in diesem Punkt reichen Sie eine Beschwerde beim entsprechenden Verantwortlichen ein .
2. Schritt : Beherrschung des Ichs  Unterlassen Sie auffälliges Aussehen und Verhalten !
Kontrollieren Sie Ihr Äußeres und Ihr Benehmen .
Ein dezentes beherrschtes Auftreten wird die erwünschte Integration in die Gesellschaft fördern .
Natürlich ist man nicht von Geburt an fehlerfrei .
Aber mit ein wenig Disziplin kann man Makel am eigenen Wesen bereinigen .
Achten Sie zuerst auf Ihre Körperhygiene .
Putzen
Sie sich täglich dreimal je fünfminütig die Zähne , waschen Sie sich den ganzen Körper gründlich mit Seife und tragen Sie kurze saubere Hand - und Fußnägel .
Das Haupthaar sollte immer sauber , gut geschnitten und gekämmt sein .
Frisieren
Sie sich generell so unauffällig wie möglich .
Frauen tragen zur Frisurvorbereitung Lockenwickler und Frisierhaube nur daheim .
Männer haben weder übertriebene Bartkoteletten noch extravagante Barttrachten , sind immer gut rasiert und entfernen wucherndes Altershaar aus Ohr und Nase .
Hygiene sollte jedoch nie zu Körperkult ausarten : Eitelkeit ist kein Ideal .
Die Hygiene , aber auch die Ernährung bedingen die körperliche Gesundheit und das Aussehen .
Deutsche Hausmannskost ist ideal .
Ein gesunder , abwechslungsreicher Abendbrottisch beinhaltet Brot , frische Gemüse , herzhaften Brotbelag , pikante Beilagen und Getränke .
Vollkornbrot wird wahlweise mit Käse , Schinken oder Wurst belegt .
Tipp : Zu Wurst passen gut aufgeschnittene kleine Gewürzgurken " Moskauer Art " .
An Tomate , Radieschen oder Gurke sollte es nie fehlen .
Als Getränk eignen sich für den Mann ein kräftiges Bier , für Frau und Kinder ein Glas Milch .
Natürlich können auch Reste vom Vortag gereicht werden .
Ein wenig frühmorgendliche Gymnastik rundet Fitnessprogramm für Ihren Körper ab .
Stehen
Sie hierfür um sechs
Uhr auf .
Führen Sie folgende Übungen durch : Kniebeugen , Arme kreisen , Hampelmann , Liegestütze .
3. Schritt : Ordnung  Suchen Sie sich Ihren Platz !
Es ist essenziell , jederzeit im Alltag von Strukturen umgeben zu sein .
Bei Ihrer Zeugung wurde Ihnen ein Geschlecht zu Eigen .
Diese Tatsache allein teilt Ihnen schon die erste Ordnungseinheit zu , nämlich die der Frau oder des Mannes .
Entsprechende Wirkungsbereiche sind die Familie und die Gesellschaft .
Merken
Sie sich , dass der Mann das Familienoberhaupt ist und nach außen wirkt , also von der Familie hin zur Gesellschaft .
Der Mann hat die Aufgabe , einerseits durch seinen Beruf für den Unterhalt der Familie zu sorgen und andererseits die Gesellschaft mitzugestalten .
Die Ergreifung einer Anstellung im Staatsdienst oder eine kaufmännische Tätigkeit unterstützt diese Funktion am besten .
Die Frau wirkt nach Innen , Sie kümmert sich um das Wohl von Ehemann und Kinder .
Eines der wichtigsten Aufgabengebiete für die Frau ist die Sauberkeit .
Denn was die Hygiene für den Körper ist , bedeutet die Sauberkeit für das Zuhause .

How to Get Cash Now in the US with Payday Loans
Whether you refer to them as instant cash loans , payday loans , or same day loans , the outcome is the same .
These sources of credit give you a way to pay crucial bills when there are no other alternatives available .
If you do n’t have anyone to turn to that you can simply borrow money from until your next payday comes around , a same day loan is the next best thing .
However , it ’s worth noting that the rules and regulations around these loans can be a little complicated .
In the USA , there are different laws linked to payday loans depending on where you live .
For instance , in Washington DC , same day loan providers can only give you a payday loan if it has an APR rate of 24 % or less .
Additionally , in Virginia , there ’s a limit on how many loans you can apply for in the course of a year .
In 9 states , there are caps on the number of cash advance loans that you can have at the same time , and lenders will need to check whether you ’re eligible to take out another loan before they can give you the money that you need .
To improve your chances of being successfully approved for a payday loan , it ’s generally a good idea to check the rules and regulations of your state before you begin comparing vendors .
Once you ’re fully informed , you ’ll be able to visit a store that offers payday loans or apply for your credit online through a digital form .
The amount of money that you will be able to borrow will depend on the company you borrow from , and the state you live in .
Usually , loans of around $ 500 are the most common .
Keep in mind that payday lenders will need to abide by both state and federal laws , which should put your mind at rest when you ’re applying to borrow money .
The Truth in Lending
Act requires payday lenders to disclose the exact dollar amount of their APR in writing .
Additionally , the CFPB implements federal regulations around payday lending , including the payday rules .
These regulations ensure that strict restrictions are imposed upon payday lenders .
Who Can Apply for a Payday Loan ?
You will need to be an adult to apply , have a valid form of identification , and your own checking account .
Your lender will also request that you prove you have a consistent source of income .
One benefit of quick payday loans is that you wo n’t always have to have your credit checked before you get the money you apply for .
Even if your lender decides to look at your credit history with something called a “ soft credit check , ” this wo n’t necessarily stop you from getting the loan .
Very few same day loan providers that allow you to get cash now make decisions around eligibility based on your credit history .
If you visit a payday lender in person to get cash now , most of the time , you ’ll be required to write a check to the business for the amount that you want to borrow , including their fee .
The lender will typically add a fee to the amount that you borrow for transferring the funds to your bank account .
This fee will not include any interest rates .
Once you ’ve written your check , your funds will be deposited quite quickly into your bank account .
The time you ’ll have to pay off your loan will depend on a number of factors .
Most same day loans need to be repaid within a period of two to four weeks .
If you can pay back the money that you owe on that date , your debt will be over and done with .
If you ca n’t pay back the money that you borrowed , then you might be able to request that the lender rolls the debt over for another week or two .
In certain states , you may be able to renew the loan according to the same terms that you agreed to when you first borrowed the money .
However , you may need to pay an additional fee for the privilege of extending your time .

A small lending amount :
The loans designed for people who want to get cash now are usually for small amounts .
Most states also impose limits on the size of a payday loan .
$ 500 is a common amount although it ’s possible to apply for numbers above and below this .

Post - dated checks :
Most of the time , when you successfully apply for a same day loan to get cash now , you ’ll be asked to write out a post - dated check for the balance you ’re borrowing , plus fees .

This will allow the lender to take back the money that you owe when your term is over .
Your credit rating wo n’t be important :
More often than not , your credit history and score wo n’t be the most important thing to a lender giving you a same day loan .
They will simply want to know that you can pay back the cash you owe .
This means checking whether you have a regular source of income .
Additionally , some loan providers will allow you to get cash now by giving you the money you need in your hand while you ’re in - store .
Other providers will deposit the money into your account .
Some companies can allow you to roll over your loan if you need additional time to pay off your debts too .
How to Improve Your Chances of Being Approved
When you ’re eager to get cash now for an emergency situation , you do n’t have the time to deal with a complicated application process .
That ’s one of the reasons why same day loans are so appealing .
Generally , you ’ll be able to apply for your loan with relative ease , and most people will be approved , regardless of their credit history or background .
Of course , it ’s worth noting that allow your loan provider wo n’t necessarily place much weight on your credit history ; there are still things you can do to improve your chances of being approved as quickly as possible .
For instance , you can make sure that you meet the basic criteria for taking out the loan before you apply .
Remember that you will need a US current account , and you ’ll have to be a local citizen in the state that you ’re applying for a loan in .
Other steps you can take include :
Checking the affordability criteria :
Most of the time , instead of looking at your credit score , a payday or same day loan provider will check your affordability instead .
This means examining your regular income to see whether you can afford the money that you ’re borrowing .
Certain companies have specific demands on the amount of money you need to have left over each month after you ’ve paid your bills to apply for a loan .

Making sure you know how long you need the money for :
It ’s much easier to simply request a payday loan for the right length of time than it is to apply for a rollover .
Some states do n’t allow for loans to be rolled over either , so it ’s best to figure things out before you make an application .
Determine how much cash you need before you begin your application , and how many weeks it will take to pay the money back .
Typically , you should n’t expect to borrow money for longer than 2 months .

Fill out all the forms truthfully :
Most payday loan and same day loan providers will only ask you to fill out one form .
After all , they know that you need to get cash now and you do n’t have a lot of time to waste .
Make sure that you fill out the forms that are given to you completely and include all of the correct information .
If you do n’t finish the process , then you might not be approved .
Make sure that you spend some time checking out the website of the company that you ’re considering borrowing money from too .
Remember that different states have their own rules , and you may be able to find out more about the regulations that will be used to consider your loan by checking the website .
You ’ll also be able to make a list of any contact details you ’ll need to ask questions if you ’re confused at any point during the application process .
The Benefits of Loans Where You Can Get Cash Now
Although same day loans and payday loans can come with a slightly higher interest rate than some of their counterparts , it ’s important to remember that you ’re only borrowing money for a short amount of time .
That means that you wo n’t have as much to pay back in the long - term .
A payday or same day loan that allows you to get cash now when you ’re facing an emergency ensures that you do n’t end up in a difficult situation when the going gets tough .
If you would otherwise have to allow your bank account to go into its overdraft , or risk not paying essential bills , then a same day loan can be a lifesaver .
On top of that , it ’s worth noting that a same day loan gives you speed and convenience when you ’re struck by an emergency .
There ’s no need to spend weeks waiting for a bank to approve the money you want to borrow .
Instead , you can apply for the cash that you need and get it either directly into your hand or your bank account within the same day .
A few other benefits to consider when you ’re applying for these kinds of short - term loan include :
Anyone can be approved :
Whether you have terrible credit or not , it ’s still possible to apply to get cash now from a short - term or payday loan .
Most of the time , as long as you can pay back the money you borrow with a regular source of income like a permanent job , you should be approved .
This is excellent news for anyone who has faced problems getting approved for loans in the past because of a bad history with debts .

This is excellent news for anyone who has faced problems getting approved for loans in the past because of a bad history with debts .
Simple and quick to apply :
It does n’t take hours , or days to apply for a loan with a payday loan .
You can get through the application process in a matter of minutes , and once you do , your cash will be deposited into your account within 24 hours .
Some companies can even deliver cash to your bank within an hour of your application .

Very few restrictions :
Often , when you apply for a loan with a traditional bank , you ’ll have to explain what you want to use the money for .
This is n’t the case when you want to get cash now with a payday or same day loan .
You can use the money however you see fit with no restrictions .
There ’s also no need to show your lender any receipts or bank statements after you ’ve retrieved the cash that you ’ve applied for .

Protect your credit :
When you apply for a standard loan , you will have to have a hard credit check done into your credit history .
This process leaves a mark on your credit report that can haunt you as you apply for other loans .
The good news is that there are no marks like that when you ’re applying for a payday loan .
Most providers will approve your application with nothing more than a “ soft check . ”
Additionally , because you ’ll be able to prove that you are capable of paying your loans off on time , you might notice that your credit rating starts to improve after you ’ve taken out your loan too !

Start to build your credit rating again :
As mentioned above , there are few better ways to start building your credit rating than with a loan .
Paying off a loan according to the terms that you agree to shows that you can be responsible with your money .
Within very little time , your loan can help you to build up a score that makes it easier to apply for other kinds of cash advances in the future .
How Much Will It Cost to Get Cash Now ?
If you want to get cash now , then you need to expect to pay a little more than you would with a standard loan .
After all , with a typical loan , your bank or lender would earn money back from your payments over a long period .
Every time you made a payment each month , you ’d be a little interest that would contribute to the total APR of the loan .
However , with a short - term loan .
You ’ll be borrowing money for only a couple of weeks .
This means that there are fewer benefits involved for the bank .
However , that does n’t mean that you should have to pay more than necessary .
Bear in mind that many states laws apply caps on the amount that you will have to pay for your payday loan fees .
This means that you should n’t have to worry about paying excessive fees if you do your research in advance .
In comparison , you may have to pay much larger fees if you are spending money on a maxed - out credit card or overdraft .
The most important thing to remember is that the rules regarding short - term loans can vary from one state to the next .
That ’s why it ’s so important to learn as much as you can about the rules and regulations in your area before you apply for anything .
Doing your research will mean that you know what to prepare for when you ’re comparing different payday loan providers online .
What to Look at When Comparing Providers
Like any other kind of loan or cash product you can get today , it ’s possible to compare the lenders that provide payday and same day loans online to check what kind of deals are best for you .
You ’ll need to look at a number of different things to make sure that you ’re making a good choice .
For instance , ensure that the provider can give you a term that ’s long enough for you to repay your debts .
Also , you ’ll need to check that the company is capable of lending you enough money to pay for whatever emergency you need to cover .
Other points to look at include :

The Ariane 5 - ECA got away from Kourou at the second attempt
The spacecraft is part of a £ 3.6 bn system that will deliver secure , high - bandwidth communications for UK and allied forces .
Sunday 's lift - off came 24 hours after a first attempt was thwarted by a technical glitch in ground equipment .
Skynet rode atop an Ariane 5 - ECA rocket , which left the ground at 1903 local time ( 2203 GMT ) .
" It was an incredibly nerve - racking but also an amazing experience to participate in the countdown and launch of an Ariane 5 , " said Patrick Wood , who has led the development of the Skynet spacecraft for manufacturer EADS Astrium .
" We 've already received telemetry from it .
In fact , we had a ground station see it just 10 minutes after separation .
We 've even sent commands to Skynet .
It 's behaving itself perfectly , " he told BBC News shortly after the launch .
Every piece of satellite bandwidth is valuable and the military is always hungry for more
Bill Sweetman , Jane 's Information Group
" Skynet 's going to provide two - and - a - half times the capacity that the previous system provided , and allow the military to do things they just have n't been able to do in the past , " Mr Wood explained .
' Information warfare '
Skynet 5A matches the capability of the best modern satellite platforms - on which the world depends for much of its telephone , TV , and internet traffic - but has been specially prepared for military use .
The Skynet system brings an increase in power and bandwidth
Enlarge Image
Its technologies have also been designed to resist any interference - attempts to disable or take control of the spacecraft - and any efforts to eavesdrop on sensitive communications .
An advanced receive antenna allows the spacecraft to selectively listen to signals and filter out attempts to " jam " it .
" As far as we know , this is the most sophisticated technology of its type - certainly in Europe , " said Mr Wood .
" It allows you to produce peaks of reception across the surface of the Earth , and to change that antenna pattern in extremely rapid time . "
Skynet 5 replaces Skynet 4 .
The new spacecraft system is bigger and much more powerful .
The high traffic rates are in both directions .
Naval vessels have been re-equipped to use Skynet 5
" Modern warfare is all about information , " said Bill Sweetman , the technology and aerospace editor for Jane 's Information Group .
" Every piece of satellite bandwidth is valuable and the military is always hungry for more .
" The practice is to offload mundane traffic on to commercial satellites and then to use a complementary , secure proprietary system for the traffic that has to be protected .
" Take for example the capability of unmanned air vehicles .
These generate a lot of imagery and that has to be passed over a secure communications link .
Modern warfare involves passing around a lot of data , and that puts a premium on satellite capacity . "
' Physical assurance '
The whole Skynet 5 constellation has been funded through the largest Private Finance Initiative ( PFI ) signed by the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
The MoD does not own the hardware ; it merely buys the services run over it .
Initially agreed in 2003 , the PFI saw Paradigm Secure Communications , which is a subsidiary of EADS Astrium , take over and operate the UK 's military satellite coms network .
UK forces have seen a steady upgrade in all their coms systems
Paradigm gets an annual fee for providing this service .
It can also earn money by selling excess bandwidth - expected to be about 50 % on each spacecraft - to Nato and other friendly countries .
The cost to the British taxpayer of the PFI jumped by several hundred million pounds in 2005 , principally because of a decision to go for the " physical assurance " of building a spare spacecraft rather than a straightforward insurance policy that would pay out in the event of a launch failure or breakdown in orbit .
Even so , the MoD says , the Paradigm contract should save many millions of pounds over the 18 years of the deal , compared with a more conventional procurement arrangement .
Skynet 5A was released from the Ariane 5 rocket some 30 minutes into Sunday 's flight .
It will take about a week for the satellite to achieve its final geostationary orbit .
The 5B platform will be launched towards the end of this year , with 5C due in orbit in 2008 .
Skynet 5A 's co-passenger on the rocket - the Indian TV satellite Insat 4B - also made it into orbit successfully .
THE SKYNET 5 MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
The satellites are ' hardened ' against interference .
A special receive antenna ( 1 ) can resist attempts at jamming Each spacecraft has four steerable antennas ( 2 ) that can concentrate bandwidth on to particular regions
The system gives global coverage ( 3 ) , providing 2.5 times the capacity afforded by the previous system Each spacecraft ( 4 ) is a 3x4x4.5 m box and weighs just under 5 tonnes ; the solar wings once unfurled measure 34 m tip to tip Improved technologies , including a solar ' sail ' ( 5 ) , lengthen the platforms ' operational lives to at least 15 years

Smoke - free bars and public houses will attract more female customers and could fuel the rise in binge drinking among women , a report warns .
It points out that as bars and pubs become more appealing venues to women , female customers are more likely to consume larger amounts of alcoholic drinks than before .
And because women are marrying later , they are spending more time in pubs and other venues that serve alcohol , where they are more likely to meet men .
The rise in alcohol consumption among women is causing serious concern for the Government .
Doctors say liver disease is now being seen in younger people .
Prof Moira Plant , a specialist in alcohol studies based at the University of West of England , said : " There are now young women in their late teens and early twenties developing liver damage that in the past was not being seen until the age of 60 or 70 . "
Alcohol abuse was also linked with stomach ulcers and damage to the oesophagus and brain , she said .
A spokesman for the campaign group Alcohol Concern said : " Recent trends in women 's drinking are certainly cause for concern .
Drinking too much alcohol over a long period can cause serious health problems . "
Today 's report by Datamonitor , the consumer analysts , says Britons are already the biggest binge drinkers in Europe .
The average British drinker consumes the equivalent of 2.2 pints of lager on each visit to the pub , compared with just 1.1 pints in Sweden .
Generally , people are cutting down on their consumption of alcoholic drinks outside the home and are more likely to be enjoying cheaper beer and wine in front of the television .
But the report says women are catching up with men in pub drinking and predicts that the smoking ban will boost the number of females frequenting bars .
John Band , of Datamonitor , said the average European man drank just over 2.5 times as much alcohol as the average European woman .
The gap was a little smaller than average in Britain , with the average man only drinking 2.1 times as much alcohol as the average woman when going out .
However , the gap is narrowing .
Between 2005 and 2010 , women 's share of drinks consumption in Europe will grow 1.5 per cent a year .
In Britain , women will account for 38 per cent of all drinking by 2010 , up from 32 per cent in 2005 .
Germany will see a similar change .
Mr Band said : " Getting married or having a family restricts ' going - out ' opportunities , but women in Europe are increasingly doing this at a later age .
" At the same time , pubs and drinks companies are working hard to provide attractive drinking experiences to female drinkers . "
He said female - friendly bars appealed to single men as a more hospitable venue for dating compared with music - oriented nightclubs or traditional pubs .
Mr Band added : " The compulsory banning of smoking in pubs will serve to make venues more attractive to faster - growing consumer groups such as women and middle - aged consumers . "
A recent survey estimated that up to a quarter of adults in Britain are binge drinkers .
The poll of 2,000 people found that almost one in three men and one in five women drank at least double the recommended daily limit .

Saturday , July 23  Ullrich , the ' Infernal Second ' PARIS  Poor Jan Ullrich .
Another year , another disappointment .
By Laurent Emmanuel , AP Jan Ullrich is comforted by a team trainer after placing second in the 20th stage .
Second to Lance in the time trial and probably third overall .
" I 'm dead , I 'm completely dead , " he said after yet another defeat by Lance Armstrong .
Der Kaiser is the German version of Raymond Poulidor , the " Eternal Second " and lovable loser of French cycling lore .
Poulidor came in second three times and third thrice .
Ullrich has now finished second five times , three of those to Lance .
He was injured in 1999 and suspended for recreational drug use in 2002 .
No wonder why he was taking ecstasy .
He would be another Poulidor except for the fact that he actually won the Tour in 1997 , when Lance was making a comeback from cancer .
Poulidor 's nickname is " Poo - Poo . "
They have a similar moniker for Ullrich now in Germany , but it 's not as cute .
Perhaps we should call Ullrich the " Infernal Second , " for there must be a special Hell on Earth for his luck in coming into his peak years just as Lance was reaching cosmic highs .
Lance even offered Ullrich a little advice for 2006 : Show up in shape , lose a few pounds .
Ach !
I saw this statue just off the Avenue de Charles de Gaulle in the Paris neighborhood of Neuilly .
It is Sisyphus , the poor sap of Greek mythology who was fated to forever roll a boulder up a mountain , only to have it roll back down just as he reached the top .
It made me think of Ullrich .
Maybe now that Lance is retiring , Ullrich can finally get that rock to a mountaintop finish .
Friday , July 22  Crow finds her way in cycling world CLERMONT FERRAND , France  Sheryl Crow has become the feminine face of American cycling at the 2005 Tour .
Lance 's rock star girlfriend has taken to the sport , and the sport is really quite taken with her .
By Sal Ruibal , USA TODAY Sheryl Crow works the crowd at the Discovery Channel Team bus before a stage begins .
At the daily scrum around the Discovery Team bus at the start area , Sheryl is there answering reporters ' questions , waving hello to the many friends who are following the Tour , signing autographs , chatting strategy with team director Johan Bruyneel and making last - minute contact with her man before he jumps on his bike and goes to work .
European TV reporters have no qualms about asking her technical questions , perhaps testing her cycling knowledge .
She 's smart and has absorbed quite a bit of expertise from Lance and his posse .
Fitness is important to her , so she also goes for long runs in the Tour towns , an iPod providing the soundtrack .
At 43 , she could easily be mistaken for a twentysomething athlete .
When the race started in Agde , I asked if she was going riding that day .
" We 're going , for sure , " she said .
" To the top ! "
She may be the most glamorous grimpeur to scale the 21 switchbacks of the Alpe d'Huez .
She rides a custom
Trek with special gearing that lets her climb like Lance while singing all the way ... to the top .
Thursday , July 21  Regions use
Tour to market themselves MENDE , France  The Tour de France is many things : a bike race , a cultural and gastronomic adventure and a global television series .
It is also an economic development project .
Because the Tour is seen by more than a billion people around the planet , the race coverage becomes a great platform for regions seeking to market themselves to international corporations and tourists .
The last week of the Tour is showcasing the Massif Central area , which is somewhat like the USA 's southern Appalachian region .
By Sal Ruibal , USA TODAY Toulouse is known as the Space City .
The ideal French space mission would be a trip to the moon to bring back green cheese .
This region was featured early in last year 's race , as well .
Regional governments as well as localities paid the Tour to come to their area , as do almost all of the host towns .
The Massif Central promotion is also being helped by the French national government , which has improved roads and other infrastructure .
The modern and beautiful A75 superhighway now links this area with the northern Paris area and the southern Mediterranean cities .
Before the A75 , magnificent towns such as St. Cloud and Mende were hard to reach .
In the same way U.S. federal spending on Interstate highways and national parks in our southern Appalachians has spurred economic development in those areas , the Massif Central is beginning to blossom .
I like the Massif Central because it is relatively unspoiled , with large rolling hills and small mountains , which are dramatic in their own way .
For cyclists , the Massif Central is much more rideable than the Alps or Pyrenees .
Depending on the route , riders of all fitness levels can have fun riding over or around these pine - covered ridges , many of which are topped with ancient castle ruins and fortifications .
.
Provence is drop - dead gorgeous , but also overpriced and overrun by summer visitors ;
The Alps are amazing , but the roads are steep and sometimes dangerous ; the Massif Central is just waiting to be discovered and the French government thinks the Tour is the perfect venue for encouraging that development .
Wednesday , July 20  Fine art at a French truck stop REVEL , France 
There 's no doubt that France has the most beautiful truck stops in the world .
There are always very clean restrooms , lots of parking , espresso for a Euro - buck a cup and sometimes even cool art .
By Sal Ruibal , USA TODAY
This three - story - high sculpture is a roadside attraction on the Tour route near Pau .
The " Aire " ( as they 're called here ) sell Ferarri race jackets , a wonderful selection of fresh sandwiches , cell - phone rechargers , bug spray , peanuts , Pringles , Pepsi and four kinds of Orangina .
This year I found one that sold wine from three of Beaujolais ' finest village appellations .
You do n't get that kind of service at the Sheetz in Haymarket , Virginia .
There are always big , highly detailed maps which come in handy if you are lost , which for me is often .
The artwork is local in theme and origin .
Today I got to check out the huge " Tour de France in the Pyrenees " sculpture just outside Pau .
You can see it from a mile away and it looks like someone created a shiny aluminum roller - coaster for giants on bicycles .
A 20 - foot - tall guy on a bike is quite impressive .
Would n't want to go against him in a sprint .
Leave it to the French to take something as commonplace as a truck stop and give it style , taste , culture and food for the mind as well as the stomach .
But I do miss those little cinnamon rolls they sell at Sheetz .
Tuesday , July 19  Getting out among the real race fans PAU , France 
Want to know a dirty little secret about covering the Tour ?
The press does n't have great seats to watch the action .
If you 're on a press motorcycle , you can get up close and just a bit too personal , especially when it comes to the various bodily fluids emitted by riders during the race .
Do n't ask .
By Sal Ruibal , USA TODAY
View from a bridge : A chase group passes the four - kilometer - to - go mark in Tuesday 's stage .
Most of the reporters watch the race in the press center near the finish line .
When the peloton approaches , there 's a mass exodus to get quotes that come out on tape like heavy breathing with a few ... words ... like ... this .
The stage winner and Lance , er , the overall leader , give more bodily fluids to the doping control folks , then give quick press conferences  by video link .
Sights , sounds but no smells .
Sometimes the Discovery media folks come in with an i-Pod and two tiny speakers , which they set up in the press center .
Everyone crowds around and tries to record the pre-recorded quotes from Lance .
Maybe next year they 'll just put them in iTunes and we 'll have to pay a buck to download them online .
The key is to get away from the press center and watch the race with the real fans .
You have to be a real fan to drive a camper to the top of a mountain a week before the stage begins to see your heroes pass by in a three - second blur .
Allez !
Allez !
Bye - bye !
Once in a while you find just the right spot .
In 2003 , I found a perch on a cliff overlooking the final steep kilometers of the famous Luz Ardiden stage .
I saw Lance come out of the mist and climb , climb , climb .
It was an amazing spot from which to witness one of the greatest stages in Tour history .
Today I walked a few hundred yards from the press center to a bridge I scoped out earlier in the day .
I took out my digital camera just as the leaders passed beneath me .
I even shot a little video of the peloton .
That 's when I feel like a reporter and not an educated television viewer in a stuffy press tent .
That 's when I really love my job .
SysinternalsというWebサイトをご存じだろうか？
何となくそこにたくさんのツールがあるのは知っていても、Webサイトが英語版しかないので全部読む気がしない。また、いくつかのツールは使っているけど、ほかにどういったユーティリティが提供されているのか細かく見ていないという人がいるのではないだろうか。
筆者もそ の1人で、「 Process Explorer」などの有名なツールは使っていたが、全ぼうは把握していなかった。
Windowsを使っているシステム管理者や技術者の方ならば、Sysinternalsという名前を知っている方は多いはずだ。SysinternalsはWindows標準のツールでは管理できないシステム情報などを扱うツールを数多く提供している。
このSysinternals は 、Mark Russinovich氏 とBryce Cogswell氏 が1996年に設立し たWinternals Softwareが提供するWebサイトで、現在はMicrosoftに買収されている。そして、2006年11月からMicrosoft TechNetで 「 Windows Sysinternals」というWebサイトで提供されている。
これらのツールではセキュリティカテゴリとして登録されているものもあり、PC上で動いているプロセスをさらに細かく表示するツールや、rootkit的動作をする可能性が含まれるレジストリを表示するものなど、不正なプロセスや挙動がないかを把握することも可能だ。今回はこのツール群から、システムのチェックに必要なもの、運用管理に便利なものをいくつかピックアップして紹介しよう。
多機能なプロセス管理ツール ：Process Explorer

The project was inspired by work on the Archimedes Palimpsest
The firm 's open source team is working on ways to physically transfer huge data sets up to 120 terabytes in size .
" We have started collecting these data sets and shipping them out to other scientists who want them , " said Google 's Chris DiBona .
Google sends scientists a hard drive system and then copies it before passing it on to other researchers .
Data delays
It hopes that one day the data it helps to swap will be available to the public .
Mr DiBona , open source program manager at Google , said the team was inspired by work done by Microsoft researcher Jim Gray , who delivered copies of the Terraserver mapping data to people around the world .
The one terabyte of image data in the set was too large to send over a computer network .
" I wished people were doing that for biology , genetic research and antiquities research , " said Mr DiBona .
The team was spurred into action after speaking to the research group re-constructing The Archimedes Palimpsest , a medieval parchment manuscript containing seven treatises by the Greek scientist .
Because the parchment had been over - written several times by different authors , scientists have been reconstructing the original work by uncovering the layers using advanced imaging techniques .
DiBona : Networks are not big enough to ship terabytes of data
" The networks are n't basically big enough and you do n't want to ship the data in this manner , you want to ship it fast .
" You want to ship it sometimes on a hard drive .
What if you have these huge data sets - 120 terabytes - how do you get them from point A to point B for these scientists ? "
Google has worked with the Archimedes group - and subsequent institutions - to give them a hard drive recording system .
" We have a number of machines about the size of brick blocks , filled with hard drives .
" We send them out to people who copy the data on them and ship them back to us .
We dump them on to one of our data systems and ship it out to people . "
Google keeps a copy and the data is always in an open format , or in the public domain or perhaps covered by a creative commons license .
The program is currently informal and not open to the general public .
Google either approaches bodies that it knows has large data sets or is contacted by scientists themselves .
One of the largest data sets copied and distributed was data from the Hubble telescope - 120 terabytes of data .
One terabyte is equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes .
Mr DiBona said he hoped that Google could one day make the data available to the public .
" We have got those systems in development but we are not yet ready to launch to the public .
In the mean time we are useful and we need to do this for more groups . "
Mr DiBona 's team has the job of helping the development of open source projects around the world as well as building internal projects .
" My mission is also to release a lot of code and we 've released over a million lines of open source code between web tool kits and other things . "
Code curriculum
Google also helps by offering funding to open source projects around the world and by offering engineering time .
More than $ 1.5 m was spent last year in donations to projects , said Mr DiBona .
It also runs a program to place student developers with open source teams , called the Summer of Code .
Google ships out hard drives to hold the huge amounts of data
" The founders of Google are passionate about open source .
They see Google as a net beneficiary of open source technology .
" They want to make sure that these people whose software we use everyday remain vital . "
Google 's infrastructure relies on a lot of open source software , including using a version of Linux as the desktop operating system for developers .
" A lot of Googlers come out of this community - we are open source people . "
Some have questioned why Google has not done even more - such as releasing an open source operating system or opening up more of its software to the open source community .
Mr Dibona , who is a long - standing Linux evangelist , said : " I am comfortable with where Google is operating .
People are often upset and feel we should be releasing more .
" And I agree ; I would love to release more .
It 's more a function of engineering time , than it is a function of desire . "

Become an Objectivist
in Ten Easy Steps
( with illustrations )
by
Ayndrej Bauer
Do you want to become an Objectivist but do not have enough time and patience to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged ?
Now you can join the fun in just ten easy steps !
Step 1 : Axioms
Step 2 : Reason and Logic
Step 3 : Identity
Step 4 : Concept
Step 5 : Context
Step 6 : Man as a Rational Animal
Step 7 : Egoism
Step 8 : Capitalism
Step 9 : Art and Æsthetics
Step 10 : Objectivism in Practice
See responses to this document .
Step 1 : Axioms Axioms are the most obvious statements from which everything else follows .
The Objectivist axioms are set up in such a way that they are irrefutable .
Anyone trying to object to them must implicitly assume them even before he or she can formulate a counter - argument .
Axiom of Identity :
A is A .
Axiom of Subject :
I am aware of something .
Axiom of Object :
I am aware of something .
The first axiom is pretty much self explanatory .
It will be discussed further in the section about Identity .
It may appear at a first glance that the Axiom of Subject and the Axiom of Object are the same .
However , they are really like two sides of the same coin .
The Axiom of Subject puts emphasis on the word I , whereas the Axiom of Object stresses the word something .
Their apparent similarity reminds me of the fact that I can not be aware without being aware of something .
Exercise :
Read out loud the Axioms of Subject and Object with proper emphasis .
For extra credit , do it in front of a mirror .
Exercise :
Give examples of the Axiom of Identity by instantiating the variable A with pieces of furniture that you see around yourself .
Exercise :
Refute the so - called Universal Refutation of Philosophy invented by Raymond Smullyan :
That 's what you say !
Hint : derive the three Objectivist axioms from the Universal Refutation .
For extra credit , derive the Axioms of Subject and Object in essentially different ways .
Step 2 : Reason and Logic I identify the method by which true knowledge is acquired .
Knowledge is awareness of reality , i.e. , of what there is .
I have knowledge when I am aware of something real .
But since it is logically impossible for me to be aware of anything unreal , it follows that the proper way to acquire knowledge is to use logic .
Put in another way , my capacity to use logic is called reason .
When I am reasoning in accordance with reality , I acquire new knowledge .
Logic is that method of thinking which is in accordance with reality .
Exercise :
Demonstrate the power of logic and thinking in accordance with reality by proving the following elementary theorem in geometry :
In a triangle the inscribed circle touches the circle that passes through the midpoints of the sides .
Figure 1 : Using reason Ayn Rand discovered this theorem in 1936 ,
but the editor of Acta Mathematica refused to publish her discovery .
Exercise :
Use reason to establish the following syllogism , first postulated by Aristotle , the greatest philosopher of all time :
If all A are B ,
and all A are C ,
then some B are C .
Step 3 : Identity The Axiom of Identity can be rephrased by saying that things quite simply are what they are .
A chair is a chair , and not a table .
In philosophical language we say that a thing has identity .
This also means that a thing is identical with its properties and characteristics .
The most important consequences of this realization are explained through the following exercises .
Exercise :
Explain in lay terms the following passage from Ayn Rand 's unpublished Secret Diary of Howard Roark :
November 18 , 1998 Today was her 21st birthday .
We got drunk together and she tried to convince me that I did n't take our relationship seriously .
I kept telling her that relationships had a secondary epistemological status , anyway , because they were generated by predicates [ emphasis added ] .
She was shouting that I was a selfish son of a bitch .
I tried to explain to her that that followed logically from A is A , but she would n't listen .
I do n't know anymore what to do .
I love her , but if she does not get her identity straight soon , things could get pretty nasty between her and me .
Extra credit : Eliminate all relations from the last sentence in the above passage by replacing them with combinations of predicates .
Exercise :
Fill in the details in the following argument which swiftly dispenses with all forms of skepticism .
Things are what they are .
There is only one reality , namely the way things are .
Knowledge is obtained by reasoning in accordance with how things are .
Man has capacity to reason and use logic .
Knowledge is objective and attainable by man .
Exercise :
Show that relativity theory and quantum mechanics are based on corrupt philosophies because they violate the principle of identity .
In particular , relativity theory denies objectivity of knowledge ( see previous exercise ) , and quantum theory denies identity itself ( particles do not have definite properties ) .
Step 4 : Concept
We take a modern phenomenological explanation of concepts from an article [ CENSORED ] by [ CENSORED ] .
This is one of the best concise explanations of Objectivist concepts -- it is ironic that [ CENSORED ] himself is very much opposed to Objectivism .
A famous philosopher and admirer of Ayn Rand wrote in his Philosophical Investigations once that " we see visual sense - data through our eyes , we hear aural sense - data through our ears , and we grasp concepts through our reason . "
A typical example of a concept is what you think of when you are thinking of a chair .
Even though you cannot define a chair , you recognize one when you see it .
An example of a more abstract concept is furniture .
Exercise :
Find the original article [ CENSORED ] by [ CENSORED ] and read it .
It was published in [ CENSORED ] , [ CENSORED ] .
Criticize the article from the Objectivist point of view .
Exercise :
Refute the following argument :
Concepts are unnecessary constructs of a suspicious mental nature .
It is better to avoid concepts and talk about language only .
She took off her nightgown , stepped to the window , sighed deeply and said : " The mind is the origin of all meaning .
I mean what I say .
Words in themselves are empty . "
He lit a cigarette and admired her naked body which was illuminated by silver moonlight .
Step 5 : Context
Similarly , people grasp the same concept differently .
For example , a group of people will mostly agree on what a chair is , but they will disagree in a small proportion of cases .
This is because their minds grasp the concept of a chair from different contexts .
It should not be argued that every mind somehow grasps its personal copy of a concept .
Instead , the differences are accounted for in the differences of contexts .
Neither is it correct to say that when the context changes the concepts change with it , but rather that the same concepts are understood in a different way .
Exercise :
Find a friend and discuss with him or her the differences in your understanding of the following concepts : set , cricket , glass , cricket , poker , down .
Step 6 : Man as Rational Animal
First we contemplate on the nature of man .
What makes a man a man ( the technical expression is " man qua man " ) ?
In accordance with the method of integration and differentiation , a proper definition of man identifies man as a member of a larger category by differentiating it from other members of that category .
Clearly , the larger category is animal , and the distinguishing characteristic of man is reason .
Thus , we arrive at the conclusion that
Man qua man is a rational animal .
Exercise :
Demonstrate that there are no rational ants .
Argue as follows :
A rational consciousness has identity .
Identity of a rational consciousness manifests itself in its ability to reason independently of other consciousnesses .
In other words , rational consciousness cannot have identity without being independent of other consciousnesses .
An independent consciousness cannot exist in a society in which its existence depends vitally on the actions of other consciousnesses .
The defining characteristic of an ant hill is the existential inter-dependence of its members .
Extra credit : Does it follow that Darwin 's theory of evolution is flawed , since his theory in principle allows existence of rational ants ?
Exercise :
Use the ideas from the previous exercise to show that the definition of man as rational social animal is unacceptable because freedom is an essential characteristic of a rational consciousness .
Step 7 : Egoism
We quote Rand 's proof of her famous theorem " Egoism as rational moral value of identity " from Formal Objectivism :
( 1) |- man(x ) < == > animal( x ) & rational ( x ) [ definition ] ( 2 ) |- man(y ) [ hypothesis ] ( 3 ) |- y = y [ by Axiom of Identity ] ( 4 ) |- rational (y ) [ by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ]
( 5 ) |- knows (y , y=y ) [ by ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ] ( 6 ) |- rational (y ) & value(y , v ) ==> v [ Rational Value Theorem ] ( 7 ) |- egoist ( x ) < == > value( x , x = x ) [ definition of egoism ] ( 8 ) |- not ( egoist (y ) ) ==> not ( value(y , y = y ) ) [ from ( 7 ) instantiating x = y ] ( 9 ) |- not ( egoist (y ) ) ==> value(y , not (y = y ) ) [ by not - propagation ] ( 10 ) |- not ( egoist (y ) ) ==> not(y = y ) [ by ( 9 ) and ( 6 ) ] ( 11 ) |- not ( egoist (y ) ) ==> false [ by ( 10 ) and ( 3 ) ] ( 12 ) |- egoist (y ) [ by ( 11 ) ad absurdum ] ( 13 ) |- man(y ) ==> egoist (y ) [ by ( 2 ) and ( 12 ) by == > introduction ]
Note : the Rational Value Theorem asserts that whatever values a rational consciousness holds , they are true , because a consciousness which holds false values is not rational .
Observe that in step ( 7 ) egoism is defined as holding ones own identity as moral value .
The Ayn Rand Institute explains the Objectivist moral values as follows :
Ethics
" Reason is man 's only proper judge of values and his only proper guide to action .
The proper standard of ethics is : man 's survival qua man-- i.e. , that which is required by man 's nature for his survival as a rational being ( not his momentary physical survival as a mindless brute ) .
Rationality is man 's basic virtue , and his three fundamental values are : reason , purpose , self - esteem .
Man --every man-- is an end in himself , not a means to the ends of others ; he must live for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself ; he must work for his rational self - interest , with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life . "
Thus Objectivism rejects any form of altruism -- the claim that morality consists in living for others or for society .
Exercise :
Explain Rand 's proof in ordinary language .
Exercise :
Scientists are puzzled over step ( 5 ) in Rand 's proof since it never gets used .
Speculate on a reason why Rand might have included it in her proof .
Was it only her Italian heritage which spurred a superstitious belief in the lucky number 13 ?
Step 8 : Capitalism
This means that the government must not limit activities of men for any reason other than to protect their freedom .
This is the basic principle of capitalism .
Exercise :
Socialist ideology characterizes capitalism as the system which institutionalizes exploitation of man by man .
Show that this is false , and that in capitalism the roles of exploiter and exploitee are actually reversed .
Exercise :
Demonstrate superiority of Objectivist understanding of economic and political forces by becoming rich .
( Hint : take an 8x8 sheet of gold and cut it into pieces as in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 : 8x8 sheet of gold , total area is 64 .
Then rearrange the pieces as in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 : 5x13 sheet of gold , total area 65 .
You have now profited 1x1 square of gold .
This method was suggested by epistemological research of L. Peikoff and perfected by A. Greenspan . )
Step 9 : Art and Æsthetics
Ayn Rand described her own approach to art as " Realistic Romanticism " : " I am a Romantic in the sense that I present men as they ought to be .
I am Realistic in the sense that I place them here and now and on this earth . "
Exercise :
Surf the web and visit Essentials of Objectivism at the Ayn Rand Institute .
Read the part about Esthetics and discuss it with your friends .
Exercise :
Andy Warhol , the notorious founder of pop art , made a portrait of Ayn Rand , but she denounced him after she realized that he did not respect her Objectivist principles of art and æsthetics .
Criticize Andy Warhol 's painting " A Sixpack of Ayns " from the Objectivist point of view .
Figure 4 : Andy Warhol , A Sixpack of Ayns , 1963 ,
silkscreen print on canvas ( 236 " x 157 " )
Step 10 : Objectivism in Practice
" Nature , to be commanded , must be obeyed . "
" You ca n't eat your cake and have it too . "
" Man is an end in himself . "
" Give me liberty or give me death . "
And live your life by the words of one of Ayn Rand 's heroes :
" Experience without theory is blind , but theory without experience is mere intellectual play . "
Exercise :
Which hero of Ayn Rand said that ?
Exercise :
Ayn Rand once said :
" Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life . "
Apply this to your sexual preferences .
What metaphysics can you deduce from sexual desires of your female or male sexual partner of the opposite sex ?
Exercise :
From now on you are on your own , but if you ever need help buy something from the The Objectivist Store .
Your final task is to follow the words of the famous Objectivist , psychologist and radio talk - show hostess Dr. Laura Schlessinger :
Go take on the day !

This was a cool find for me for various reasons .
One of the biggest being that the subject of the shot ( kinda creepy , I know ) is my daughter .
Finding out that she was on this poster was a big deal to her .
She immediately started calling and texting her friends .
This made me smile .
Another reason is that I shot this image back in 2006 before I began taking stock photography seriously .
This was not intended to be a “ stock ” shot , but rather was simply taken while I was playing around in some leaves with my daughters .
I uploaded the shot to iStock half expecting it to be rejected for “ over filtering ” .
But it obviously was accepted .
Upon seeing what the designer did with my original image ( kinda creepy , I know ) , it took me a second to even verify that it was my shot .
The enhancements that were made to the image , especially the face , are fantastic .
Here is the original un-edited image as they purchased it on iStock :
I do n’t usually go out of my way to get copies of my work in use , but I made an exception with this one .
I sent a few emails to the contact information from the film and distribution company ’s websites .
To my surprise , I soon received a response and they are sending me a few posters .
Do n’t be surprised if you ever drop by my little studio and see this image ( kinda creepy , I know ) framed on the wall .

I wrote this about four years ago , originally as an ebook .
I figured the idea might spread and then the problem would go away–we ’d no longer see thousands of hours wasted , every single day , by boring PowerPoint presentations filled with bullets .
Not only has it not gone away , it ’s gotten a lot worse .
Last week I got a template from a conference organizer .
It seems they want every single presenter to not only use bullets for their presentations , but for all of us to use the same format !
Shudder .
So , for posterity , and in the vain hope it might work , here we go again :
Really Bad Powerpoint
It does n’t matter whether you ’re trying to champion at a church or a school or a Fortune 100 company , you ’re probably going to use PowerPoint .
Powerpoint was developed by engineers as a tool to help them communicate with the marketing department — and vice versa .
It ’s a remarkable tool because it allows very dense verbal communication .
Yes , you could send a memo , but no one reads anymore .
As our companies are getting faster and faster , we need a way to communicate ideas from one group to another .
Enter Powerpoint .
Powerpoint could be the most powerful tool on your computer .
But it ’s not .
Countless innovations fail because their champions use PowerPoint the way Microsoft wants them to , instead of the right way .
Communication is the transfer of emotion .
Communication is about getting others to adopt your point of view , to help them understand why you ’re excited ( or sad , or optimistic or whatever else you are . )
If all you want to do is create a file of facts and figures , then cancel the meeting and send in a report .
Our brains have two sides .
The right side is emotional , musical and moody .
The left side is focused on dexterity , facts and hard data .
When you show up to give a presentation , people want to use both parts of their brain .
So they use the right side to judge the way you talk , the way you dress and your body language .
Often , people come to a conclusion about your presentation by the time you ’re on the second slide .
After that , it ’s often too late for your bullet points to do you much good .
You can wreck a communication process with lousy logic or unsupported facts , but you ca n’t complete it without emotion .
Logic is not enough .
Champions must sell — to internal audiences and to the outside world .
If everyone in the room agreed with you , you would n’t need to do a presentation , would you ?
You could save a lot of time by printing out a one - page project report and delivering it to each person .
No , the reason we do presentations is to make a point , to sell one or more ideas .
If you believe in your idea , sell it .
Make your point as hard as you can and get what you came for .
Your audience will thank you for it , because deep down , we all want to be sold .
Four Components To A Great Presentation
First , make yourself cue cards .
Do n’t put them on the screen .
Put them in your hand .
Now , you can use the cue cards you made to make sure you ’re saying what you came to say .
Second , make slides that reinforce your words , not repeat them .
Create slides that demonstrate , with emotional proof , that what you ’re saying is true not just accurate .
Talking about pollution in Houston ?
Instead of giving me four bullet points of EPA data , why not read me the stats but show me a photo of a bunch of dead birds , some smog and even a diseased lung ?
This is cheating !
It ’s unfair !
It works .
Third , create a written document .
A leave - behind .
Put in as many footnotes or details as you like .
Then , when you start your presentation , tell the audience that you ’re going to give them all the details of your presentation after it ’s over , and they do n’t have to write down everything you say .
Remember , the presentation is to make an emotional sale .
The document is the proof that helps the intellectuals in your audience accept the idea that you ’ve sold them on emotionally .
IMPORTANT : Do n’t hand out the written stuff at the beginning !
If you do , people will read the memo while you ’re talking and ignore you .
Instead , your goal is to get them to sit back , trust you and take in the emotional and intellectual points of your presentation .
Fourth , create a feedback cycle .
If your presentation is for a project approval , hand people a project approval form and get them to approve it , so there ’s no ambiguity at all about what you ’ve all agreed to .
The reason you give a presentation is to make a sale .
So make it .
Do n’t leave without a “ yes , ” or at the very least , a commitment to a date or to future deliverables .
Bullets Are For the NRA
Here are the five rules you need to remember to create amazing Powerpoint presentations :
No more than six words on a slide .
EVER .
There is no presentation so complex that this rule needs to be broken .
No cheesy images .
Use professional stock photo images .
No dissolves , spins or other transitions .
Sound effects can be used a few times per presentation , but never use the sound effects that are built in to the program .
Instead , rip sounds and music from CDs and leverage the Proustian effect this can have .
If people start bouncing up and down to the Grateful Dead , you ’ve kept them from falling asleep , and you ’ve reminded them that this is n’t a typical meeting you ’re running .
Do n’t hand out print - outs of your slides .
They do n’t work without you there .
The home run is easy to describe :
You put up a slide .
It triggers an emotional reaction in the audience .
They sit up and want to know what you ’re going to say that fits in with that image .
Then , if you do it right , every time they think of what you said , they ’ll see the image ( and vice versa ) .
1
Sure , this is different from the way everyone else does it .
But everyone else is busy defending the status quo ( which is easy ) and you ’re busy championing brave new innovations , which is difficult .
The astronomer Galileo Galilei observed in 1623 that the entire universe " is written in the language of mathematics " , and indeed it is remarkable the extent to which science and society are governed by mathematical ideas .
It is perhaps even more surprising that music , with all its passion and emotion , is also based upon mathematical relationships .
Such musical notions as octaves , chords , scales , and keys can all be demystified and understood logically using simple mathematics .
Pitch :
Wave frequencies
Music appears to be transmitted by magic , escaping from your expensive stereo - or a loudly passing car radio , or a guitar - strumming maestro - and accosting your eardrums in one fell swoop .
In fact , sound progresses as a wave through the air , and sound cannot be produced without an atmosphere .
( Or , as the horror movies would say : in space no one can hear you scream . )
A sound wave creates minute pockets of higher and lower air pressure , and all the sounds we hear are caused by these pressure changes .
With music , the frequency at which these pockets strike your ear controls the pitch that you hear .
For example , consider the note called " Middle C " ( usually the first note learned in piano lessons ) .
This note has a frequency of about 262 Hertz .
That means that when Middle C is played , 262 pockets of higher air pressure pound against your ear each second .
Equivalently , the pockets of air arrive so quickly that one pocket strikes your ear every 0.00382 seconds .
We can draw a graph by putting an X at every time when a pocket of air arrives :
This graph provides a sort of " picture " of Middle C .
By itself , it does not tell us much .
However , such graphs provide a new perspective on the relationships between different musical notes .
A basic rule is that higher - pitched notes have a higher frequency , corresponding to more frequent air pocket arrivals .
For example , the note Middle G ( seven semi - tones higher than Middle C ) has a frequency of about 392 Hertz , corresponding to 392 air pockets per second , or a time period of 0.00255 of a second between arrivals :
With the higher note ( Middle G ) , the air pockets arrive more frequently - corresponding to a higher frequency , and thus to more X's in the graph .
If you listen carefully to an ambulance siren or a train whistle , you will notice that the noise sounds higher while the vehicle is approaching , and lower after the vehicle has passed by .
This is because the approaching movement compresses the X's together , making them arrive more frequently and produce a higher pitch , while the departing movement stretches out the X's and produces a lower pitch .
This is musical frequency in action .
So how does this help us ?
Well , by using knowledge of sound frequencies carefully , such musical mysteries as octaves and chords can be unraveled .
Double the fun : Octaves
No musical notes fit together better than those which are exactly one octave apart .
Pairs of notes like Middle C and High C. Or Middle G and High G. Such pairs arise constantly in popular music , as in the first two notes of the classic Somewhere over the rainbow , or the initial " I 'm sing ... " of Singing in the rain - or the first two notes of the third line of Happy Birthday .
Often in a symphony , one instrument ( like a violin ) plays a note one octave above that of another instrument ( like a double bass ) .
Piano arrangements inevitably include the same note at different octaves .
When improvising in blues or jazz music , it hardly matters which octave you choose to play , just which notes within the octave you choose to play .
Notes which are one octave apart sound almost like the same note , or at least a new variation on the same note .
What is it that makes notes one octave apart fit together so well ?
Consider High C , the note which is exactly one octave above Middle C .
For High C , the air pockets arrive once every 0.00191 seconds .
This is precisely half the time period ( or twice the frequency ) of Middle C .
The arrivals of High C are not random , or arbitrary , or picked out of a hat .
Rather , they are precisely twice as frequent as the arrivals for Middle C .
This is a universal truth of octaves .
Going up one octave is always the same as doubling the frequency .
Just as the frequency of High C is twice that of Middle C , so the frequency of High D is twice that of Middle D , and so on .
Notes one octave apart are always bound together by this basic relationship .
If we play both Middle C and High C at the same time , then their air pockets fit together in a certain pattern :
Since the frequency of High C is exactly twice that of Middle C , the two notes line up perfectly .
Every two air pocket arrivals for High C correspond perfectly to one arrival for Middle C . The X's for the two notes match up exactly .
That is why the two notes fit together so well , and indeed sound almost the same .
Their high pressure air pockets arrive in perfect synchronisation .
Similarly , that is why High D fits in so well with Middle D , and indeed why any note fits in so well with the note one octave above or below .
In every case , the frequency of one note is exactly twice the frequency of the other , leading to a perfect fit .
One easy way to see this is on a guitar .
There , pressing a guitar string at the twelfth fret cuts the string precisely in half .
This makes it vibrate precisely twice as quickly .
This leads to a frequency which is twice as high , and thus corresponds to a note one octave higher .
For example , the first string of a guitar is normally tuned to Middle E. Playing that same string with the twelfth fret pressed produces a High E - a note one octave higher , with frequency twice as high .
The same pattern continues as we increase the octaves .
The note two octaves above Middle C ( sometimes called High High C ) has a frequency four times that of Middle C .
And the note an octave above that one , has a frequency eight times that of Middle C .
In principle , we could keep increasing the octaves , and doubling the frequencies , forever - but after a certain point , the notes would be so high that only dogs could hear them .
In perfect harmony
Notes an octave apart do indeed fit together well .
In a sense , they fit together too well .
If you play Middle C and High C together , then there is no discordance at all .
However , the result sounds sort of hollow , or even boring .
More interesting combinations like chords result if we bring in other notes , too .
But which notes sound good together , and which ones do n't ?
Consider the notes Middle C and Middle G. In fact , these notes form a " fifth " interval and fit together well .
But why is this ?
Well , let 's examine their wave graphs together :
We see that every second arrival for Middle C , lines up almost perfectly with every third arrival for Middle G . Once again , the two wave patterns fit well together .
The two notes complement each other , rather than clashing .
That is why lots of music involves the notes C and G - from the first two notes of the chorus of the traditional song Land of the silver birch , to the first two notes of the Star Wars musical theme .
Since 3 time periods for Middle G correspond to 2 time periods for Middle C , we can also say that the frequency of Middle G is about 3/2 times as large as that of Middle C. Since 3/ 2 is a nice , simple fraction , that is why C and G sound good together .
By contrast , the notes C and F - Sharp do not fit together well .
If those two notes are combined , they do n't sound quite right .
They rarely appear as a pair in musical compositions or songs of any kind , at least not in a sustained way .
A look at their graphs explains why :
This time , the X's just do n't line up well .
They have no simple relation to each other .
The fit just is n't there .
( Well , it is true that five time periods for C is n't so far off from seven periods of F - Sharp .
But it is n't so close either , and anyway , seven is too large a number of time periods to have to wait . )
So , combining C with F - Sharp is n't so great , but combining C with G works well .
These fundamental truths apply regardless of your favourite musical style .
Striking a chord
Combining the notes C and G produces a sound which is fine , but not very exciting .
To get a really pleasing sound , let 's add a third note - E. Middle E is four semi-tones ( a " major third " ) above Middle C , and three semi-tones ( a " minor third " ) below Middle G.
When all three notes are played together , they form the " C major chord " , which is a sweetly harmonious , happy sound , like a barbershop quartet .
It is the basis for music as diverse as Row , row , row your boat , and the symphonies in C Major of Mozart and Beethoven and Schubert .
Why do these three notes - C , E , and G - sound so sweet together ?
Let 's have a look .
We see that certain of the X's line up almost perfectly .
Indeed , 4 time periods for Middle C , and 5 time periods for Middle E , and 6 time periods for Middle G , are all practically equal .
So , about once every 0.015 seconds , the X's all line up .
So , even though certain of the X's do not line up for these three notes , quite a number of them do .
This combination of variety and consistency is just what is required to produce the C Major chord - one of the most pleasing sounds known to humanity , and the basis of multitudes of tunes from Mendelssohn to Metallica .
So , humanity 's quest for beautiful music amounts to finding creative and interesting ways to line up the air pocket X's of different musical notes .
Temper , temper
So why is it that the notes C and G fit together well , but the notes C and F - Sharp do not ?
Who decides which notes will have their X's line up well , and which notes will not ?
The answer is , mathematics decides !
Remember that High C has a frequency which is twice as large as Middle C .
On the other hand , High C is twelve semi-tones above Middle C .
There are eleven other notes - C - Sharp , D , D - Sharp , E , and so on - squeezed in between Middle C and High C. What are their frequencies ?
How do they fit in ?
Early musicians - as far back as the Greek mathematician and musician Pythagoras of the sixth century B.C.E. - tuned musical instruments specially for each key .
For example , when playing in the key of C , the note Middle G would be tuned so that its frequency was exactly 3/2 times that of Middle C .
This would make the X's line up perfectly , so the notes would fit together exactly right .
However , this system required different tunings depending on which notes you were planning to play , or in which key your music was written .
Over the last couple of hundred years , a more universal system has been used instead .
This system - called equal tempering , a version of well tempering - spaces all twelve notes of the octave equally .
In this way , a single tuning can be used regardless of the key being chosen , or the music being played .
Equal tempering is a system for breaking up each octave into twelve equal semi-tones .
Since each octave represents multiplying the frequency by a factor of 2 , each semi- tone represents multiplying the frequency by the twelfth root of 2 - a number which produces two when twelve copies are all multiplied together .
This number is about 1.059463 , because twelve copies of 1.059463 , all multiplied together , is equal to 2 .
So what does this mean ?
If we start with Middle C as a base , then Middle C- Sharp , one semi - tone above Middle C , has a frequency which is 1.059463 times as large as Middle C. Then Middle D , two semi-tones above Middle C , has a frequency which is 1.059463 multiplied by 1.059463 , or 1.122462 , times as large .
Continuing in this way , we eventually reach Middle G , seven semi-tones above Middle C . The frequency of Middle G is 1.498307 times that of Middle C .
But wait .
1.498307 is almost exactly the same as 1.5 , or 3/2 .
This explains why every three time periods for Middle G , correspond to two time periods for Middle C .
The two frequencies have a nice simple ratio , 3/2 , and that is why they fit together so well .
Similarly , the frequency of Middle E is 1.259921 times that of Middle C .
This ratio is very close to 1.25 , or 5/4 , and explains why every five time periods for Middle E correspond to four time periods for Middle C. Hence , like G , the note E also fits in well with C .
Another good example is the note Middle F , whose frequency is 1.334840 times that of Middle C. This is very close to 1.333333 , or 4/3 .
And , indeed , C and F also fit well together ( their interval is called a " fourth " ) .
On the other hand , Middle F - Sharp has a frequency which is 1.414214 times that of Middle C . The number 1.414214 is n't too close to any nice simple fraction ( it is n't too far away from 1.4 , or 7/5 , but numbers like 7 are too large to be of much help ) .
That is why the notes F - Sharp and C do not fit well together .
So , to figure out which notes fit well together , we do n't need to guess , or use trial and error , or study musical theory for years .
We just need to remember the equal - tempering principle , and multiply copies of 1.059463 together to see whether or not we get a simple ratio of frequencies .
Unlocking the key
Experienced musicians are always discussing what key to play in .
There is no cooler moment for a jazz musician than , when asked if they can play I got rhythm , to be able to reply , " Sure , dude .
What key ? "
Changing a song 's key raises or lowers all the notes by the same amount .
This change might make the song more convenient to play on a particular musical instrument , or more comfortable for a vocalist to accompany .
If done properly , the key change should have essentially no effect on the way the song " sounds " - it should be just as recognisable , just as lovely , and just as catchy , in the new key as in the old .
Indeed , it should be exactly the same song , just performed at a higher or lower pitch .
How can this be ?
How can a song be the same , but different ?
How can we change the pitch without changing the tune ?
From our understanding of frequencies , the answer is clear .
To make the notes higher ( say ) , we make their frequencies faster , i.e. make the X's closer together .
But to make the song sound the same , we leave the relationships between the X's just as they were before .
We compress each row of X's by exactly the same factor .
Equivalently , we raise each note by exactly the same number of semi-tones .
For example , suppose you are playing a song in the key of C , and are using a C Major chord , with the notes C , E , and G as before .
You then want to change to the key of E , and use an E Major chord instead .
How do you do this ?
Well , to change Middle C to Middle E , you have to raise the note by four semi-tones , or equivalently multiply the frequency by 1.259921 .
So , to preserve the sound of the chord , you have to do exactly the same thing with the other two notes .
Middle E also gets raised by four semi-tones , with frequency multiplied by 1.259921 , to turn into Middle G - Sharp .
And , Middle G gets raised by four semi-tones to High B .
The resulting air pocket arrivals look like this :
We have thus created a chord E Major , which is just like C Major , except four semi-tones ( or a factor of 1.259921 ) higher .
The E Major chord sounds just as sweet , just as pleasing , as the C Major chord we saw earlier .
The only difference is , the E Major chord has a somewhat higher pitch .
We have successfully switched keys , from C to E .
There are many similarities between this E Major chord ( consisting of E , G - Sharp , and B ) and the previous C Major chord ( consisting of C , E , and G ) .
In each of them , every four spacings in the top row , and every five spacings in the middle row , and every six spacings in the bottom row , all line up well .
So , every little while , the X's for all three rows are practically on top of each other .
This is why the two chords have the same pleasing sound .
On the other hand , for E Major this confluence happens faster .
While for C Major the X's line up about once every 0.015 seconds , for E Major they line up about once every 0.012 seconds .
That is why E Major - while sounding similar to C Major in every other respect - also sounds somewhat higher , a fact the vocalist might well appreciate .
So the next time you are accompanying a beautiful starlet in her triumphant performance of her new jazz hit , and she turns to you and says with a wink , " Let 's do it in the key of E instead of C this time " , do n't panic .
Simply raise all of your frequencies by a factor of 1.259921 , and wait for the audience 's wild applause .

A series of tests run by Chinese scientists on an experimental thermonuclear reactor have found " the artificial sun " is a reliable energy generating process .
Designed to replicate the sun 's energy generating process , the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak fusion reactor recently garnered positive results in tests being conducting at China 's Institute of Plasma Physics , the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported .
" The new tests show the reactor is very reliable , and we can repeat the experiments , " institute official Wu Songtao said .
With tests set to continue until Feb. 10 , the experiments will reveal exactly how far the project is from its final goal of creating plasma that can last for 1,000 seconds while giving off its own energy .
While many have disputed the project 's ability to create such an energy source , Xinhua said many scientists maintain such a fusion reactor could lesson China 's energy crisis by providing cleaner endless energy at a significantly lower cost .

Licht aus , Ventilator aus , Kühlschrank aus : Stromausfall in Kampala , das ist ein fast tägliches Übel in der 1,5 - Millionen - Stadt .
Doch während die Ugander auf schlechtes Strommanagement schimpfen , weist Präsident Yoweri Museveni alle Schuld von sich .
Seine Regierung habe Dämme bauen wollen , gleich drei seien geplant , aber die internationale Gebergemeinschaft wolle nur einen finanzieren .
" Die Energie - Krise ist nur ein weiteres Beispiel für die Einmischung von Ausländern in unsere inneren Angelegenheiten " , schimpft er . " Sei es Energie oder Straßenbau oder Sicherheit :
Wir werden darüber mit niemandem diskutieren .
Wenn uns die ausländischen Organisationen Hilfe geben wollen , dann sollen sie das tun .
Aber zu unseren Bedingungen .
Wenn nicht , dann bauen wir diese Dämme selber . "
Ganz so unabhängig ist Museveni allerdings nicht .
Fast die Hälfte des Staatshaushalts wird von außen finanziert .
Aber Museveni will Stärke beweisen , gerade in Zeiten , in denen der Druck von den Gebern großer wird .
Längst schon gilt Museveni nicht mehr als Musterkandidat unter den afrikanischen Staatsführern - ein Renommee , das er sich mit erfolgreicher Anhebung des Wirtschaftswachstums und drastischer Absenkung der HIV - Infizierungsraten erkämpft hatte .
Gegenkandidat angeklagt
Erst kürzlich haben mehrere europäische Länder ihre Finanzhilfen gekürzt .
Auslöser dafür war der Prozess gegen Musevenis stärksten politischen Gegenkandidaten , Kizza Besigye .
Wegen Landesverrats , Verschwörung und Vergewaltigung muss sich Besigye seit seiner Rückkehr aus dem Exil im vergangenen Jahr vor ugandischen Gerichten verantworten .
Besigye ist der einzige von Musevenis vier Konkurrenten , dem bei der Präsidentschaftswahl , die am Donnerstag ( 23.2.2006 ) ohne die befürchteten Ausschreitungen stattfand , Chancen eingeräumt werden .
Schon vor Öffnung der Wahllokale bildeten sich lange Warteschlangen .
Erstmals fand zeitgleich mit der Präsidenten - auch die Parlamentswahl statt .
Mit Ergebnissen ist bis Ende Februar zu rechnen .
Musevenis Kandidatur widerspricht früheren Zusagen , die Macht in diesem Jahr abzugeben .
Seiner Beliebtheit tut das jedoch keinen Abbruch .
Große Menschenmengen strömten zu seinen Auftritten , der Staat war mit Soldaten und Polizei präsent .
Die Situation eskalierte kürzlich als zwei Anhänger Besigyes von Sicherheitskräften erschossen wurden .
Das habe sich die Opposition selbst zuzuschreiben , so Museveni .
" Die Gewalt wird allein von diesen Gruppen ausgelöst , die Opposition genannt wird .
Viele von ihnen haben enge Verbindungen zu terroristischen Gruppen " , lautet seine Erklärung .
Vorwürfe von Menschenrechtlern
Poster Kizza Besigye
Für Kizza Besigye sind derartige Beschuldigungen das Zähnefletschen eines korrupten Regimes .
Schon bei der Wahl vor fünf Jahren war der ehemalige Wegbegleiter und Leibarzt Musevenis als unabhängiger Kandidat angetreten und hatte trotz Wahlfälschungsvorwürfen an die Regierung knapp 30 Prozent der Stimmen bekommen .
Auch diesmal sei die Ungerechtigkeit vorprogrammiert , so Besigye : " Wir sind zwar eine Partei , aber wir treten nicht gegen andere , gleichberechtigte Parteien an .
Denn Musevenis ' Bewegung ' ( NRM ) ist beides : Partei und Regierung .
Wenn wir verlieren , dann wissen wir , dass wir bei einer
Wahl verlieren , die nicht fair ist . "
Ähnlich beschreibt die Sprecherin von Human Rights Watch , Georgette Gagnyon , das Dilemma der Abstimmung .
Von Fairness könne keine Rede sein .
" Die Wahl in Uganda ist eine Mehrparteienwahl in einem Einparteien - Staat .
Die Regierungspartei hat ungehinderten Zugang zu Regierungsgeldern , sie benutzt Staatsbestände , wie etwa Autos , für ihre Wahlkampagne und ist sechs Mal so viel in den Medien präsent wie die Opposition . "
Unterstützung auf dem Land
Präsident Yoweri Museveni
Human Rights Watch wirft der Museveni- Regierung auch Bedrohung und Einschüchterung der Opposition vor .
Aber auch ohne diese Methoden haben es die Oppositionsparteien schwer , sich einen guten Namen zu machen .
Die letzten Mehrparteienwahlen liegen immerhin 26 Jahre zurück .
Es folgten sechs Jahre Bürgerkrieg .
Dann übernahm der Guerillakämpfer Museveni die Macht und versuchte das Land mit einem Ein-Parteien - Regime von der Gewalt zu kurieren .
Jeder Ugander wurde von Geburt an Mitglied seiner Nationalen Verteidigungsbewegung , kurz " Die Bewegung " genannt , Parteien wurden als Grund allen Übels verteufelt .
Die Strategie ging fast auf .
Heute noch schwelt der Bürgerkrieg mit der " Lord 's Resistance Army " im Norden Ugandas , wo sich die Menschen im Stich gelassen fühlen .
Ansonsten aber sei Musevenis Unterstützung aber fest in der Landbevölkerung verwurzelt , sagt Wolfgang Hilberer , Leiter des Büros der Konrad - Adenauer - Stiftung in Kampala .
" Das ist das Wählerreservoir , aus dem das herrschende ' Movement ' schöpfen wird . "
Und da die Landbevölkerung die Mehrheit ausmacht , rechnen die politischen Beobachter mit einem sicheren Sieg für Museveni .
Diese
Wahl ist jedoch erst der erste Schritt in einem langen Demokratisierungsprozess für Wähler und Politiker .
In my Human Factors in API Design presentation at Architecture & Design World this past week , I claimed that classic optimization is rarely necessary .
Pulling operations outside of loops or reducing the number of operations in a method rarely has any noticeable effect on performance .*
Most real performance problems come from doing too many fundamentally slow operations ; for instance , writing to the disk or reading from the network .
For example , you do n’t want to open and close a database connection for every operation .
Even on a LAN , that can easily hit you with one or two seconds ( not milliseconds but seconds ) of overhead per call .
Do that a few hundred times and suddenly you ’ve got an unusably slow application .
Instead you need to :
Cache and reuse the database connection (s ) rather than constantly opening and closing new connections .
Figure out how to reduce the number of database queries your application makes .
1
Most programmers who write database facing applications already know all this .
There are numerous frameworks designed to make this sort of optimization automatically .
That ’s what a lot of middleware is about .
Programmers who work with databases have either learned this lesson or involuntarily changed careers .
It ’s that important .
However , recently I ’ve realized that another field has just as big a problem with network overhead as do database apps .
However in this field the lesson does not seem to have been as widely learned .
That field is backup software .
The problem , I suspect , is that much ( not all ) backup software was originally designed for local devices only .
Thus there ’s an implicit assumption that device access is pretty fast .
In particular , disks are fast .
Some optimization is done for tape drives , but very little for disks .
Network backup is added as an afterthought .
However , the network disks are treated as just local disks ; and that ’s what kills performance .
This software makes the classic mistake of abstracting out the network .
It assumes you can pretend that a network mounted disk is just the same as a local disk , and that is n’t true .
While you can get away with this simplification in programs that do n’t do a lot of network transfer , backup software moves gigabytes of data and hundreds of thousands of files .
It needs to understand and optimize for what it ’s doing .
In particular it needs to do two things :
Cache and reuse the network sockets rather than constantly opening and closing new connections .
Figure out how to reduce the number of network queries the application makes .
Sound familiar ?
Making efficient use of finite bandwidth
The importance of number 1 depends heavily on how the network disks are mounted .
For instance , NFS uses UDP rather than TCP and is thus more efficient for large operations over reliable LANs .
However it ’s still not an ideal protocol for the transfer of large volumes of data .
Neither are FTP , HTTP , or most other common network protocols that are designed to transfer a few files at a time .
If you ’re going transfer the entire contents of disks , then you need to start thinking about buying , borrowing , or inventing a network protocol designed to do exactly that .
You ca n’t just piggyback on top of the operating system ’s built - in file sharing and expect decent performance .
You need something that ’s going to run close to the network ’s theoretical maximum speed , not a protocol that ’s going to get tied up in setting up and tearing down connections .
Because protocols like this are n’t built into most operating systems , you must install software on both ends of the connection .
A backup server alone is insufficient .
You need to run the backup protocol on both the clients and the server .
Any backup software that is only installed on one end of the connection is guaranteed to be much slower than it could be .
Reducing network connections
The second task is to reduce the number of network queries the application makes .
The first thing this means is that you reuse sockets where possible .
Do n’t open a new socket for each file .
( Better yet : do n’t use sockets at all .
UDP is probably the better protocol for this purpose , at least if you ’re planning to backup over a LAN .
Over the public Internet , TCP may perform better . )
Most importantly do n’t open a new socket for every bit of metadata you collect , be it file name , directory contents , file modification dates , or anything else .
All necessary metadata about the client should be collected on the client , bundled up into a single document , and sent to the server with one network connection .
2
Also very important is to perform everything as locally as possible .
Do not transfer data you do n’t have to .
For example , critical backups need to be verified .
The data in the backup should be compared to the data in the source file .
The user should be warned of any differences .
Most backup software offers this option , but most backup software does it by comparing the files bit - by - bit .
This means the entire file contents have to be transferred twice : once for the backup and once for the verification .
This doubles the network traffic .
Not good .
The right way to do network verification is to have the client calculate a checksum for its files locally , and send only the checksum to the server .
The server can compare that checksum to what it sees on its local disks , and request a resend of the file or alert the user only if the checksums do n’t match .
For the vast majority of the cases where the file was transferred and stored sucessfully , the file is only sent once .
Now notice : this only applies to network backups .
When you ’re backing up local files to local devices , there ’s no major reason to do this ; but it ’s critical for network backups .
It ’s a clear example of a case where abstracting out the network , and pretending network and local files are the same kills performance .
Some software does get this right .
Usually this is the high end stuff .
For instance , Dantz ’s Retrospect operates this way .
However , a lot of backup software does n’t .
In particular , you need to be wary of any software that uses the operating system ’s built - in network mount points .
That ’s just not good enough , and no software that does that can perform adequately .
Multithreading
There is a third optimization that backup software can use , though this is really more of a user perception trick than a true speed up .
Nonetheless this may be important , especially for synchronization software such as Chronologic .
Do n’t use multistage backups .
Most software operates in this order :
Figure out which files need to be backed up Back them up Verify them
For large backups , step one alone can take several minutes to an hour or more .
If either the server or the client shuts down or goes to sleep before the initial scanning is complete , nothing has been accomplished .
To some extent , this reflects the linear access of traditional tape drives .
However , relatively few of us are still backing up to tape .
Random access backups to disk are much more common .
In this case , it makes sense to interleave these three tasks .
As soon as the software notices a file needs to be backed up , it should back it up .
Then it should verify it .
Usually you can run these three tasks in separate threads .
Since the backup thread is network - bound and the other two threads are disk bound , there ’s enough CPU speed to go around ; and this might even be an absolute increase in performance .
However , even if it ’s not , there ’s still a visible improvement in user perceived performance .
In conclusion
Network backups are a slow and painful process .
Programmers of backup software should do everything they can to alleviate users ’ pain , and thus encourage more frequent backups .
In particular programmers should not put their own convenience ahead of the users ’ .
Network mounted file systems are not the same as local file systems , and should not be treated as such .
When writing software that transfers gigabytes of data and hundred of thousands of files , do n’t reuse protocols that were never designed to handle this .
Distinguish between network and local backups , and optimize the software to perform well with the task it ’s given .

「日本について」の記事をいくつか書いていたようだ．

興味深いのは ，" part 2 " ( 上記リンクの一番上 ) で書かれている，来日中のパネルディスカッションで彼が受けた「ソフトウェア業界が，抜本的な品質向上の為に行う必要がある，3つの最も重要な改善点は?」という質問について．
彼の回答は ，
My three proposals for improving the overall state of software quality focused on these areas : politics , collaboration , and negotiating tradeoffs .
つまり， 「政治 」 「協調 」 「 交渉トレードオフ」だというのだ．
まーったくソフトウェア工学っぽくないところが，さすが (? ) 「 デスマーチ」の提唱者といったところだろうか．
ところがこれらの言葉が与える印象と，実際の内容は若干ニュアンスが違うようだ．
詳細については元記事を読んで頂くとして，各々についての彼の主張を要約すると，
( 政治 )
どの分野においてもソフトウェアの位置付けが重要になってきているのに，企業のトップは財務やマーケティングなど，ソフトウェア以外の出身であることが多い．我々はもっとソフトのことが分かっているマネージメントを持つべきだ．
( 協調 )
「 協調」という話は ，Web 2.0の世界では良く聞くが，昔ながらの企業ではそれほど浸透しておらず，少なくとも品質と一緒に語られることは無い．これまでの組織論は通用しなくなってきている．もっとオープンにするべきだ．
( 交渉トレードオフ )
機能，時間，工数，コスト，品質のトレードオフは非線型である．マネージャーや顧客はこの現実を理解していないどころか，そもそもトレードオフがあることすら認めようとしない．建設的なトレードオフの議論をするには，モデルやツールを使って，論理的に分析するべきである．
ということだ ．
つまり，そのまま 「政治・協調・トレードオフ」と直訳してしまうと，「社内政治・チームワーク・妥協」のように聞こえてしまうが，中身をよく読んでみると，それぞれ「ソフトのことを分かっている人が企業の舵取りをするべき」「 Linux や Wikipedia のように，群集の叡智を開発に持ち込むべき 」
「モデルやツールを積極的に利用し，それによる論理的な分析を行うべき」というのが言いたかったことのようだ．
It happened to Brangelina , and now Britney says it 's happened to her too : Stolen vacation snaps .
It happened to Brangelina , and now Britney says it 's happened to her too : Stolen vacation snaps .
Britney Spears is claiming that pictures of her family on vacation that appeared in a celebrity glossy last week were " stolen by an unknown perpetrator , " according to a statement released by her record label .
Jive Records released a statement on Saturday saying that " personal vacation photos " belonging to the Spears - Federlines were stolen , and that the couple is " outraged and saddened " about the theft and are having the matter investigated .
The snaps , which appeared in Us Weekly and on various Internet gossip sites , show the happy family – Brit , K - Fed , and young Sean Preston – mugging for a camera on a private jet and playing in a hotel room , as well as a somewhat startled - looking Sean sitting in a stroller with his parents flanking him .
The Spears ' allegation comes not a week after police recovered photos of the Namibian baby shower of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie from a home in Westfield , Mass . , as TMZ first reported last week .
As of this morning , Us Weekly could n't be reached for comment .
Meanwhile , Britney has managed to derail the career of one of the co-stars of her sister Jamie Lynn 's show " Zoey 101 . "
According to Page Six , Britney told Alexa Nikolas she would " never work in this town again " back in November after she and Jamie Lynn , the show 's star , got into a spat on the set of the Nickelodeon series .
It now seems that Nikolas ' character meets with a " bad accident , " according to a Page Six source who 's seen the script for the show 's new season , and that because the character , named Nicole , is popular with the show 's kids ' audience , the sisters Spears are trying to keep the incident on the down - low .
Reps for the show and for the Spears did n't return phone calls for comment .
Jess ' Toughs Allegedly Rough Up Photographer
Jessica Simpson 's bodyguards had an alleged run-in with a newspaper photographer at a club in the Hamptons over the weekend .
John Roca , a lensman for the New York Daily News , claims that four of Jessica 's bodyguards " jumped on me like a chicken on a June bug " when he tried to take pictures of her at the Pink Elephant nightclub in Southampton .
Roca said that he asked to photograph Simpson , who was wearing a " plunging bustier , miniskirt , and iridescent heels " while lounging on a divan , perhaps celebrating her first weekend as an officially single woman .
The bodyguards then grabbed his camera and ripped the memory card from Roca 's pants .
Simpson spokesman Rob Shuter says that the security was from the club , but Pink Elephant sources disagree , claiming that the heavies were employees of Jessica .
Is Brandy the Next Star ?
Singer - acress Brandy is filling in for the fired Star Jones on " The View " this coming week , fuelling speculation that she could be on the short list to be a permanent co-host .
The starlet is currently occupying a judge 's chair on the NBC show " America 's Got Talent " next to David Hasselhoff and Piers Morgan but will be appearing on the ABC morning show Wednesday and Friday , according to PEOPLE magazine .
" These tryouts are for consideration for the permanent gig , " says the magazine 's source .
Last week , " One Life To Live " star Renee Goldsberry filled in at the last minute , and veteran soap actress Susan Lucci will be at the table with Barbara , Joy , and Elisabeth on Thursday .
Ebert Has Emergency Operation , Thumbs Up for Recovery
Film critic Roger Ebert was " doing well " this morning after emergency surgery to correct complications from previous surgery for cancer , and was in serious but stable condition at Chicago 's Northwestern Memorial Hospital .
A blood vessel near a cancerous growth on Ebert 's salivary gland burst on Saturday and he was rushed to the hospital to repair the rupture .
The condition is not considered life - threatening and the Chicago Sun - Times critic is expected to make a full recovery .
Ebert has had cancer surgery three times previously .
Matthew Perry and Darren Star in Seat - Saving Row
Sitcom star Matthew Perry and sitcom creator extraordinaire Darren Star had a little tiff over the weekend over some saved seats at a movie theater .
Page Six reports that Star went with a friend and the friend 's niece and nephew to the Century City multiplex to watch " Superman Returns " and found four seats blocked off with tape , as is the custom at a film 's premiere - except that this was n't a premiere .
When Star asked why the seats were reserved , cinema employees said it was for Matthew Perry , who Star subsequently confronted in the theater 's lobby about the seat - saving .
Perry would n't budge , so Star had to move his group .

Business 2.0 : The best business ideas in the world How Australia got hot for solar power Down under , they 're all over alternative energy - starting with a 1,600 - foot - tall " solar tower " that can power a small city .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) --
The editors have identified the Best business ideas in the world , which will appear here in a series throughout the next month .
Check back daily for updates .
Rattling down a red dirt road on the edge of the Australian outback , Roger Davey hits the brakes and hops out of a rented Corolla .
With a sweep of his arm , he surveys his domain - 24,000 acres of emptiness stretching toward the horizon , the landscape bare but for clumps of scrubby eucalyptus trees and an occasional sheep .

Electrifying exports Energetech Technology : Wave - powered electricity
There 's no shortage of surf in Australia , so it 's only natural that Sydney startup Energetech has developed an offshore power plant that generates electricity from ocean waves .
A parabolic wall magnifies the energy of incoming waves , which force air into a hollow chamber .
The air activates a turbine that powers a generator .
The first plant is expected to produce enough energy to power 1,500 homes or desalinate nearly 800,000 gallons of water per day .
Pulse Energy Technology : Biomass power generation
This Brisbane company uses rotary kiln technology licensed from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to generate green electricity by incinerating sugarcane waste and other low - grade fuels .
Pulse is building 10 - megawatt power plants in southern China , one of the world 's biggest sugarcane - growing regions .
" At the moment they burn sugarcane waste in the fields .
Six months out of the year , you can't even see the sky , " says Pulse executive Damien Weis .
" We 're able to capture the energy and bag up the pollutants . "
Pulse has also struck a deal to study the feasibility of building plants in China powered by rice husks .
Roaring 40s Technology : Wind turbine arrays A spinoff of state - run utility Hydro Tasmania , Roaring 40s operates state - of - the - art turbines in some of the world 's windiest latitudes .
But its most important innovation is its business model : exporting large - scale renewable - energy projects to developing countries .
One of Asia 's largest power companies , CLP of Hong Kong , bought a 50 percent ownership stake , providing the cash and contacts needed to fuel expansion into China .
Next up : India .
Windlab Systems
Technology : Wind farm simulations
It usually costs big money to assess the viability of potential wind farm sites .
Windlab Systems , a Canberra startup spun out of CSIRO , reduces that risk for its investment bank clients with its sophisticated virtual wind - farm software .
The technology creates an information - rich map of a wind farm site , detailing everything from weather patterns to the impact of the terrain on airflows and identifying local transmission grids , roadways , and land ownership patterns .
" As we keep adding layers to the data , '' says Windlab 's Keith Ayotte , " we eventually get to a point where bankers can assess the risks sufficiently enough to wade into the fray . "
It 's a dead - calm antipodean winter 's day , the silence of this vast ranch called Tapio Station broken only by the cry of a currawong bird .
Davey , chief executive of Melbourne renewable - energy company EnviroMission , aims to break ground here early next year on the world 's first commercial " solar tower " power station .
" The tower will be over there , " Davey says , pointing to a spot a mile distant where a 1,600 - foot structure will rise from the ocher - colored earth .
Picture a 260 - foot - diameter cylinder taller than the Sears Tower encircled by a two - mile - diameter transparent canopy at ground level .
About 8 feet tall at the perimeter , where Davey has his feet planted , the solar collector will gradually slope up to a height of 50 to 60 feet at the tower 's base .
Acting as a giant greenhouse , the solar collector will superheat the air with radiation from the sun .
Hot air rises , naturally , and the tower will operate as a giant vacuum .
As the air is sucked into the tower , it will produce wind to power an array of turbine generators clustered around the structure .
The result : enough clean , green electricity to power some 100,000 homes without producing a particle of pollution or a wisp of planet - warming gases .
" We 're aiming to be competitive with the coal people , " says Davey , 60 .
" We 're filling a gap in the renewable - energy market that has never been able to be filled before . "
And although its final dimensions are still being tweaked , the 50 - megawatt Tapio Station plant is just the small model :
A half - mile - tall version is in the works for China , and EnviroMission is scouting sites in the American Southwest for other possible skyscraping power plants .
Tower of power
The solar tower is the most audacious of a host of renewable - energy projects under way in Australia that are making the country the global hotbed of alternative - energy entrepreneurship .
Among the sea of slick suits crowding the Qantas Club at Melbourne Airport just after dawn on a clear June morning , Davey , stands out in his brown - checked sports jacket .
EnviroMission communications director Kim Fort� leans over and whispers to Davey ; she thinks she spots a familiar face amid the preflight caffeinating : a government bureaucrat involved in dispensing $ 370 million to low - emission energy projects .
EnviroMission has applied for a $ 75 million piece of that pie , and a decision is imminent .
It 's a crucial time in Davey 's eight - year quest to turn the space - age images on EnviroMission 's website into steel and glass .
Secure the cash from the feds and a third of the cost of the solar tower 's construction is in the bank .
That in turn will likely open the wallets of Australian investment banks .
So today Davey and Fort� are taking a 36 - seater prop plane to Mildura - " Gateway to the Outback " - to rally support in the rural towns near the tower site .
Energy without the mess
With a solar tower , there 's no fuel to dig out of the ground , transport , or dispose of , no smog , no scarred landscapes from open - pit mining .
The sun rises every day and is not subject to embargoes , geopolitics , or commodity markets .
And once the solar tower 's capital costs are paid off , the price of producing electricity should drop dramatically , as operating and maintenance costs are expected to be minimal .
Despite its monolithic scale , the technology behind the tower is based on an elemental scientific truth :
Hot air rises .

" Hello ?
Yes , mate .
2:30 at your office .
Done .
Thanks , mate . "
On the line was an executive with AGL , one of Australia 's largest utilities .
Early on , EnviroMission locked up a deal to provide AGL with electricity produced by the solar tower .
Davey has also secured the services of Macquarie Bank , one of the country 's most prominent investment banks and a financier of major infrastructure projects in Australia and overseas .
In 2002 executives at Xiang Jiang Industrial , a Shanghai developer and construction company , stumbled across press mentions of Davey 's project .
Xiang Jiang subsequently became EnviroMission 's second - largest shareholder and has created a joint venture with the company to build and operate solar towers in China .
At some point , almost everyone who comes across Davey and his tower ends up asking the same question :
Is this for real ?
As far as Davey has come in his quest , many hurdles do remain .
But out at Tapio Station , Davey insists that the solar tower will be built whether or not the government gives EnviroMission $ 75 million .
" This used to be a dream , " he says , staring out at the horizon where the tower will rise .
" Then it became a concept .
Now it 's becoming reality . "

LONDON – Israel , Iran and the United States were the countries with the most negative image in a globe - spanning survey of attitudes toward 12 major nations .
Canada and Japan came out best in the poll , released Tuesday .
The survey for the British Broadcasting Corp .'s World Service asked more than 28,000 people to rate 12 countries – Britain , Canada , China , France , India , Iran , Israel , Japan , North Korea , Russia , the United States and Venezuela – as having a positive or negative influence on the world .
Israel was viewed negatively by 56 per cent of respondents and positively by 17 per cent ; for Iran , the figures were 54 per cent and 18 per cent .
The United States had the third - highest negative ranking , with 51 per cent citing it as a bad influence and 30 per cent as a good one .
Next was North Korea , which was viewed negatively by 48 per cent and positively by 19 per cent .
Canada had the most positive rating in the survey , with 54 per cent viewing it positively and 14 per cent negatively .
It was followed by Japan and France .
Respondents were also asked their views of the 27 - member European Union ; 53 per cent saw it as positive and 19 per cent as negative .
Britain , China and India were viewed more positively than negatively , while Russia had more negative than positive responses .
Opinion on Venezuela was evenly split .
" It appears that people around the world tend to look negatively on countries whose profile is marked by the pursuit of military power , " said Steven Kull , director of the University of Maryland 's Program on International Policy Attitudes , which conducted the research along with pollster GlobeScan .
" Countries that relate to the world primarily through soft power , like France and Japan and the EU in general , tend to be viewed positively , " he added .
Pollsters questioned about 1,000 people in 27 different countries , including the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , Russia , China , India , Brazil , Mexico and Australia ; as well as four predominantly Muslim countries : Egypt , Turkey , the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia ; and two countries with large Muslim populations : Lebanon and Nigeria .
The respondents were interviewed in person and over the phone from November to mid-January .
The margin of error ranges from 3.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent , depending on the country .
If you think Britain is intolerably crowded today , you might well want to brace yourself before reading the next sentence .
Because this country is going to become much , much more densely populated over the course of this century as millions of people flee the uninhabitable desert that mainland Europe is doomed to turn into .
Such at least is James Lovelock 's fear .
The esteemed - if controversial - environmentalist and futurologist ( he prefers to be called a planetary physician ) also believes that by the middle of this century , the America - sized chunk of floating ice that currently covers the Arctic will melt .
As a result , the current habitat of polar bears will eventually be the place where we , or our probably very fed - up descendants , live out their pitiful existences .
" Most life will move up to the Arctic basin because only it and a few islands will remain habitable , " says Lovelock , who is most famous for coming up with the so - called Gaia hypothesis - the idea that the Earth functions as some kind of living super - organism .
Lovelock is now seriously concerned about said super - organism .
Humanity 's vast output of carbon dioxide over the past two centuries has prompted the deserts to spread towards the poles at an alarming rate , he says .
" The Sahara is heading north .
So where 's the food going to come from ?
Not from the European mainland .
Even here things are changing : there are in Britain now scorpions and snails hitherto only seen in the Mediterranean .
Recently I saw hawk moths .
Something terrible is happening . "
On the plus side , hawk moths are very pretty , I suggest .
" That 's not really the point , " says Lovelock .
" I think people forget that the whole world is going to be affected , " he goes on .
" Climate change will affect China and the US . "
Indeed , Lovelock envisages that the Chinese people will press to live in a newly lush Siberia before the century is out .
" No wonder Putin is arming like mad .
In fact , Putin is one of the more far - sighted of global leaders . "
In the US , even now , distinguished academics are contemplating moving north , Lovelock says .
" I gave a talk at Stanford [ the Californian Ivy League university ] a few months ago .
Professors , including Nobel prize winners , were coming up to me asking where in Canada they should buy real estate because they believed me when I said much of the US will be uninhabitable . "
Are they right to think that way ?
" Absolutely ... we should be scared stiff .
If you speak to any senior climatologists , the summer of 2003 [ in which thousands of Europeans , many of them elderly , perished in the heat ] will be the norm by 2050 .
Old people might have air conditioning , but that wo n't help the plants which we need to regulate temperatures .
It will become a desert climate . "
But what of Britain ?
Is this green and sometimes pleasant land doomed to become desert too ?
Lovelock thinks not .
" We 'll be a bloody lifeboat for Europe .
It will be their right to come here too . "
Why ?
" Because we 're all members of the European community . "
Good point , but one tends to forget such footling matters as the rights that go with EU membership when one is staring global catastrophe in the face .
Lovelock reckons that the British Isles will be among the few island oases in a world given over to desert , scrub and oceans devoid of life : " Everybody in Europe will be wanting to come here . "
Even people who live in currently delightful spots such as Cap d'Antibes and Siena .
They are n't going to like Milton Keynes or Cumbernauld one bit .
But then Lovelock reckons we need some radical rethinking in the way we organise Britain .
Only with greater population density in urban areas can it be divided up in the way he believes to be sustainable : one third for cities , industries , ports , airports and roads ; the second third for intensive farming , though only enough for the population 's needs ; and the final third left entirely to the natural world .
Lovelock may sound extreme to some , but although he is regarded as a sort of dotty uncle figure by some scientists , and his Gaia hypothesis has been criticised by the likes of Richard Dawkins , others hold him in high regard .
His fans include biologist Lewis Wolpert , green thinker Jonathan Porrit , geo - grapher Jared Diamond , and philosopher John Gray .
The environmentalist Fred Pearce once said Lovelock was to science what Gandhi was to politics ; Prospect magazine included him in its list of the world 's top 100 intellectuals .
Why , you might well ask , will the British Isles be spared the desert fate predicted for much of continental Europe ?
Because global warming will be , in our blissful case , cancelled out by a fall in temperature caused by the failure of the Gulf Stream .
The suggestion comes from Lovelock 's latest book The Revenge of Gaia : Why the Earth Is Fighting Back and How We Can Still Save Humanity .
If , as Lovelock forecasts , the Arctic ice melts as a consequence of global warming , the Gulf Stream - the flow that moves warm water towards northern Europe from the Caribbean - will cease .
This possibility has long been the subject of science fiction , with writers imagining the return of an ice age to the British Isles and the east coast of North America .
Lovelock now thinks that possibility is less likely because any such cooling effect will be cancelled out by global warming .
I walk out with Lovelock into the unseasonably mild air , for a turn around Kensington Gardens in west London , where crocuses press their charms weeks too soon .
As we stroll , the 87 - year - old scientist says : " Not only is the world turning and fearfully , but everything is happening very quickly . "
He points out that carbon dioxide emissions warm the planet and in so doing destroy some of the regulatory systems - such as the reflective powers of the poles ' icy wastes - that have kept the earth cool despite the increasing heat of the sun .
" Things are changing all the time , but because we live in towns we do n't see it .
We modulate the temperature .
We do n't want to notice the big disturbing picture , we want to see the next episode of the soap opera .
There are children , " he says ruefully , shaking his head , " who live in cities and have never seen the Milky Way . "
Where did we go wrong ?
" If we were hunter - gatherers and this was a bigger planet we would be all right .
But we 're not : we 're farmers and that 's what 's screwed us up .
There are just too many of us living the way we do .
Our wrongdoing has been to take energy hundreds of times faster than it is made naturally available . "
How can we reduce human population to more sustainable levels ?
" We can't solve the problem .
There 's no human way of cutting numbers .
You can empower women and persuade them to have fewer children butwe do n't have the time for that . "
His diagnosis may be grim , but Lovelock 's prognosis is much more bleak .
He suggests that the current population of six billion humans will be cut to a more ecologically sustainable half - to - one billion people .
" How will this mass cull happen ?
" It 'll be worse than Hitler - Gaia 's going to do it , " says Lovelock .
He writes about this chillingly at the outset of the Revenge of Gaia , where he considers the December 2004 tsunami .
" That awful event starkly revealed the power of the earth to kill .
The planet we live on has merely to shrug to take some fraction of a million people to their deaths .
But that is nothing compared with what may soon may happen ; we are now so abusing the Earth that it may rise and move back to the hot state it was in 55 million years ago , and if it does , most of us , and our descendants , will die . "
Lovelock first came up with the idea of Gaia 40 years ago to try to account for his view that the planet 's chemistry , climate and veneer of life worked together as a self - sustaining organism .
It was widely ridiculed by scientists .
" One even called it an evil religion , " he says with a giggle , " but they later admitted not having read my books . "
He maintains that no academic scientist would have been able to come up with such a radical idea as Gaia .
" I hate academia .
Most of the scientists who work there are not free men any more and they can't speak out .
That 's no way to do science . "
He believes the increasing specialisation of university science departments has made academic scientists unlikely to have the overview necessary to envisage the Earth as a self - regulating organic system .
As we walk , Lovelock talks about Gaia .
" She 's an old lady who has lived for three and a half billion years but she only has half a billion to one billion to go , " he says .
" She 's a bit like me - near the end of her life .
I 'm pretty unlikely to live beyond 100 .
She will die the same way as me . "
How ?
" Your ability to resist perturbations gets less as you get older . "
Looking at the dead red landscape of Mars , as he did during his years as an independent scientist , gave him a premonition of what Earth might become like if global warming continues .
" Vast tracts of it will become like Mars - uninhabitable for humans . "
His suggestion is that all we can do is minimise humanity 's impact on Gaia .
" We have got into this mess by burning carbon .
We should n't have burned things in the atmosphere to get energy .
We should n't have burned forests to drive out animals as a cheap way of hunting , because Gaia demands that the forests are kept in order to regulate her temperature and health . "
I suggest to Lovelock there are many sceptics about global warming .
For instance , Michael Crichton , in his novel State of Fear , suggested that global warming was a fiction , while Mother Theresa said in 1988 that the fate of the planet was not humanity 's concern , adding : " God will take care of the Earth . "
Recently Newsweek columnist George F
Will wrote that the central tenets of the global warming thesis are all unproven , and that the benefits of trying to reverse it will far exceed the costs .
" Maybe they 're right , " says Lovelock , sarcastically .
He goes on : " There are several things we can and should do to make the situation better , but they will only be like dialysis machines are for a kidney patient .
It 's not going to cure you . "
His suggestions for ameliorating global warming are intriguing .
Among them are massive terrestrial or space - mounted sun shades to cool ourselves back to pre-industrial temperatures .
He also supports the idea of the artificial production of clouds across large areas of the sky in order to reduce the input of solar radiation .
His book also calls for sailing ships and even giant sailing airships for sustainable long - distance travel .
Lovelock , who is pro nuclear power , derides renewable energy , such as wind power .
" It 's gesture stuff .
I 'm not anti-wind turbines .
You need 5 - 10 - megawatt ones on oil platforms in the sea because the wind is more reliable at sea .
Planting thousands of them in the country - side is not going to solve the problem . "
Nor does he like biofuels .
Indeed , he is suspicious of any policy that results in more land being used in cultivation .
" Gaia needs at least a third of the land for self - regulation . "
Before we part , I ask Lovelock , who lives in Cornwall , if he is utterly gloomy about the future .
" No !
Humans have gone through seven major climactic changes in the million years we 've been around .
Even those changes - ice ages - were ones we adjusted to .
Admittedly , those adjustments usually took place over thousands of years , and ours will involve an adjustment in little more than two centuries , but we are flexible as a species . "
He draws a parallel with his wartime experiences in London : " I was here for much of the war and when it happened it was n't as bad as we had thought it would be .
If people are honest , they rather enjoyed it .
It could well be similar in the next few decades .
Life will become a little more interesting than it was before . "

Three nights of skywatching by an Australian astronomer have confirmed predictions that an asteroid almost half - a- kilometre wide will miss the Earth on Monday by 430,000 kilometres .
However , it would still be " one of the largest objects to be observed to pass this close to the earth " , said Rob McNaught , an astronomer at Siding Spring , near Coonabarabran .
If the predictions had been wrong , and the asteroid , dubbed 2004 XP14 , hit the Earth , " you would be talking about very serious consequences " , he said .
The astronomer and his colleague , Gordon Garradd , run the southern hemisphere 's only search for asteroids that pose a threat to life on earth .
WASHINGTON , March 9 — The F.B.I. has improperly used provisions of the USA Patriot Act to obtain thousands of telephone , business and financial records without prior judicial approval , the Justice Department ’s inspector general said today in a report that embarrassed the F.B.I. and ignited outrage on Capitol Hill .
The report found that the bureau lacked sufficient controls to make sure that its agents were acting properly when they obtained records using administrative subpoenas , which do not require a judge ’s prior approval .
And the report found that the bureau does not follow some of the rules it does have on the matter .
Robert S. Mueller III , the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , called a news conference today to accept responsibility for the lapses , and to pledge his best efforts to see that they are not repeated .
“ How could this happen ? ” Mr. Mueller asked rhetorically .
“ Who is to be held accountable ?
And the answer to that is , I am to be held accountable . ”
The conflict has raged at some women ’s colleges and has been explored in academic articles , in magazines for lesbians and in alternative publications , with some — oversimplifying the issue for effect — headlined with the question , “ Is Lesbianism Dead ? ”
It has been a subtext of gay politics in San Francisco , the only city in the country that covers employees ’ sex - change medical expenses .
And it bubbles to the surface every summer at the Michigan Womyn ’s Music Festival , a lesbian gathering to which only “ women born as women and living as women ” are invited — a ban on transgendered people of either sex .
Barbara Price , a former festival producer , said the uneasiness has been “ a big topic among lesbians for quite some time . ”
“ There are many people who look at what these young women are doing , and say to themselves , ‘ Hey , by turning yourselves into men , do n’t you realize you ’re going over to the other side ? ’ ” she said .
“ We thought we were all supposed to be in this together . ”
Beyond the political implications , the sense of loss is felt most keenly in personal relationships .
“ I am a lesbian because I am attracted to women , and not to men , " said a 33 - year - old woman who broke up with her partner of seven years , Sharon Caya , when Sharon became Shane .
The woman , who asked to be identified only as Natasha , to protect family members who are unaware of her lifestyle , said that she was ultimately faced with the reality of her sexual orientation and identity .
“ I decided I could n’t be in a romantic relationship with a man . ”

Adplacement is very important .
Advertisers pay more for their ads to be shown " above the fold " - that is , on the top half of a newspaper , or in theimmediately - viewed part of a web page .
How much would you pay foryour ad to be shown " above the atmosphere " - at the edge of space ?
Itturns out that there is a company that can do just that .
JP Aerospace is currentlylining up customers for their next flight in April .
Your advertisement will becarried aloft to 100,000 feet - and photographed against the boundary betweenthe Earth and outer space .
JP Aerospace has thetechnology ; they flew a series of " PongSat " missions that provided an opportunity for thousands of students to create tiny ping - pongball - sized experiments .
To date , more than 1800 PongSats have flown to theedge of space .
The USAF has also worked with them to explore the idea of near - spacemaneuvering vehicles .
You might be disappointed , however , to learn that your " space billboard " is only the size of abusiness card .
Photographed properly , it still looks like space tourists mightsee it on the way up .
Science fiction writershave worked with the idea of advertisements carried aloft , or projected on toclouds , so they could be seen by millions .
Jules Verne wrote about atmosphericadvertising , ads reflected from the clouds , in 1889 .
On a lighter note , sciencefiction writer Alan Nelson wrote about the perils of having full - sizeadvertisements that could actually be flown high , and still be seen from Earth .
In his 1953 short story Soap Opera , he created the idea of a kind ofpermanent sky - writing .
Unfortunately , the letters did n't stay up as long as youmight hope :
Automatically Spurgle gazed up too .
The letters , still firm , still strong and perfectlyformed , seemed to be settling earthward , undisturbed by the brisk breeze thatscudded across the field ...
Silently the three walkedover to the slogan .

So , relations between Islam and the rest of the world have taken another dip in the last week .
If nothing else , this is quite an effective demonstration of one of Murphy ’s Laws “ No matter how bad things get , it ’s always possible for them to get worse . ”
I honestly feel for the intelligent and / or moderate Muslims who any rational person would acknowledge obviously make up the vast majority of the Muslim faith .
They may make up the majority of the religion but they sure do n’t make up the public face .
A quick , logical explanation for anyone who thinks I ’ve been fooled by the “ religion of peace ” propaganda .
A couple of billion people who were all homicidal maniacs would have wiped out all opposition a long time ago .
A small minority of homicidal maniacs can inflict quite a bit of pain and suffering .
Political and religious leaders who seem to consistently spout intolerance can do the same .
And lying , opportunistic , grandstanding politicians and media in non-Muslim nations can also do the same .
The point of this post is to explain why all Muslims have accept the burden of the words and actions of any particular Muslim .
Some might argue that if the majority are peaceful , why are n’t I judged by this peaceful majority ?
Ha !
Nice try Achmed !
Others might say why are n’t all Christians judged by the violent actions or words of a minority of Christians ?
You wish , Abdul !
Others still will argue that scripture is being twisted and perverted by extremists and you play into the hands of radicals by marginalising all Muslims .
Not good enough … ummm … damn , I ’ve run out of generic Arab sounding names .
Wait , Osama !
Yes , I should have used that one first .
Not good enough , Osama !
So the Pope opened a speech by saying “ I read in this one book that all Muslims shag their sisters ” and now every single Muslim in the world is acting all crazy about it .
The proof that all Muslims are crazy is that some Muslims in response attacked some Christian churches and a nun may have been murdered by Muslims .
Case closed .
Besides which the Pope never said he reckoned all Muslims were bad , he just repeated what he read in a book .
Which is the same as saying he does n’t agree .
True , he did n’t actually say he did n’t agree and repeating a negative assertion without explicitly disclaiming it could be seen as endorsing it , but you ’re forgetting one thing .
He ’s white .
The thing you have to realise is no matter how much you as a Muslim may protest your innocence , you ca n’t get away from the fact that you are n’t white .
This makes you automatically suspect .
Unless you are a white convert .
That makes you a traitor .
I know there ’s a danger in revealing this secret bit of white people ’s business , but the truth of the matter is that no matter how exemplary your life , no matter how accepted you feel , white folks are just waiting for you to reveal your true colours .
A minor mis-step for a white person ( say drunk driving , hitting a pedestrian and running from the cops ) does n’t taint other whites but it is seen as proof of the failings of a non-white ethnicity in totality .
In Australia , the leading members of the federal government have made it clear that all Muslims need to denounce terrorism specifically and extremism generally .
All the time .
Saying “ We already did that ” is n’t good enough .
Look , Muslims can handle a call to prayer several times a day .
They should be able to handle saying “ I denounce terrorism and the killing of innocents , it is expressly forbidden by the Koran and its perpetrators are a disgrace to all true Muslims .
By the way , mateship is totally ace . ” .
Three times a day should be fine .
After that , work on losing your accent .
And those funny clothes are n’t doing you any favours .
A brief note for the irony challenged ( not to mention the intellectually challenged ) :
In my wacky world view I condemn all extremism .
If you advocate the criminalising , sterilising , jailing or execution of any particular group you go into my broad category of Not Nice People .
I understand that many people regard a range of things , words , people as “ sacred ” and get really pissed off if anyone disrespects that .
I just care more about freedom of expression .
My response to anyone who wants to restrict artistic freedom or expression in the name of ANY religios or political sensibility is “ fuck you ” .
I know that “ Piss Christ ” is a pretty crap piece of art and it ’s far more about cheap sensationalism than artistic expression but if you want destroy it or threaten the life of the artist , I think you ’re a moron .
And I really do think getting worked by some cartoons , no matter how deliberately inflammatory they were , is the height of stupidity .
I deeply believe no amount of words or images , no matter how deeply hateful and hurtful , justify a violent response .
EVER .
It does n’t matter to me what your level of melanin is .
I do n’t care if you are Muslim , Christian , Jewish , Hindu or Shintoist , I do n’t base my judgements on your religion .
Unless you ’re a Buddhist .
Fuck those smug bastards .
Acting like you have more inner peace than me .
Someone ought to roll right into those Buddhist ’s headquarters and kick them out on their meditating arses .
But nobody ’s got the guts to take on the Buddhists .
Unexpectedly Intriguing !
Economically speaking , of all the ways to transport people between cities , rail is perhaps the stupidest .
Nowhere else do we see the confluence of extraordinarily high infrastructure costs ( land , construction , equipment , facilities , etc. ) and extraordinarily high operating costs ( labor , maintenance , fuel , utilities , overhead , etc. ) combine with extraordinarily low demand by commuters to produce such little tangible benefit .
That 's why the recent report by the Associated Press ' Catherine Tsai of plans by a Denver group seeking to build a high - speed commuter rail line from Wyoming to New Mexico should light up big , bright , neon , flashing " WARNING " signs to responsible public officials who would be asked to contribute tax money to support the boondoggle .
The group , Front Range Commuter Rail , led by former Colorado state representative Bob Briggs is advocating connecting the cities of Cheyenne , Wyoming , Denver , Colorado and Albuquerque , New Mexico with high - speed passenger rail service .
Trains would travel over a 602 mile long route at speeds of 110 miles per hour in the group 's plan .
The plan is being pushed forward to exploit the perceived good graces of Denver - area voters who voted last November to expand rail service in Denver 's metropolitan area .
The plan also has the support of Cheyenne LEADS , a private corporation that supports economic development in that city .
Tsai 's report notes that the group has gained support from several members of Colorado 's delegation to the U.S. Congress ( links added ) :
This political support is necessary for the advancement of the project , since the rail lines that the group would seek to convert from freight to high - speed rail service would need to be designated as a high - speed rail corridor in order to obtain federal funding for the project .
Initially , the funding would be used to conduct a study of the feasibility of the project , and later the conversion of the line from freight to high - speed passenger rail service .
The conversion of the existing freight rail lines to high - speed rail lines would be expensive , costing roughly $ 3 to $ 4 million dollars per mile .
Assuming that all 602 miles of rail line would need to be converted puts the minimum cost of just installing the high - speed rail tracks at $ 1.8 to $ 2.4 billion dollars .
Tsai summarizes the group 's goals for ridership :
The grand plan is to have a line offering one trip per hour , 18 hours a day , carrying 3.5 million to 4 million people a year , Briggs said .
Using these numbers , assuming 260 working days per year and 18 trips per day , Briggs is counting on moving an average 13,462 and 15,385 people per day , or between 748 to 855 people per trip .
By contrast , Amtrak presently carries roughly 64,000 passengers a day over its entire nationwide system .
Chris Suellentrop of Slate provides additional numbers for comparison :
Amtrak carries about 64,000 passengers a day .
That compares to 1.8 million passengers daily for domestic airlines and 984,000 passengers daily for intercity buses .
That 's right , more than 15 times as many Americans use intercity buses than use Amtrak .
And those are just the mass - transit options for intercity travel .
More people drive between cities than take a plane .
Unless the group is prepared to remove Interstate 25 from the western landscape , it 's highly unlikely it would ever see anything close to these figures .
Anyone with any opportunity to vote against this boondoggle should do so , especially in light of greater , real needs following Hurricane Katrina .

Efficiency vs Productivity
" Make It Work , Make It Right , Make It Fast . " - Donald Knuth , CAR Hoare , Edsger Dijkstra , Mark Twain , take your pick
[ Note : Another old draft finding the light of day ]
( Why organizations who are worried about performance should be worried about productivity instead )
No wonder we programmers often can't relate to our customers .
To them ' efficient ' means human producitivty .
To us it refers to computer resources -- its time to alter our perspective .
A while back [ Note : this said ' recently ' when I drafted this ]
Alan Francis linked to an illustrative example of how an algorithm in Java looks when implemented in Ruby .
The case for Ruby productivity is pretty compelling ( at least in that example ) .
Such examples typically launch ' discussions ' on why this may or may not be true .
I want to talk about why it is n't more compelling .
I showed the example to someone who is not a programmer ( but has a decent understanding of programming ) and she said : " The Ruby code looks a lot more efficient . "
My pedantic response was that it likely less efficient , but more productive .
She insisted that efficient was the better term .
On reflection , I believe her definition of efficiency is better than mine .
I never did much C programming ( and have n't used C++ much in the past couple of years ) , yet I have a lingering sense of the " efficiency is king " mindset : a nagging concern that there is something inherently bad about being inefficient ( from a programming perspective ) that compels me to apologize " but its OK if we 're more productive " whenever I suggest a language like Ruby .
This seems a common sentiment among programmers advocating such languages , but its not a compelling argument for some .
They do n't hear " Its a joy to use because you are so productive ! " , they hear : " You should try Ruby , because it trades computer efficiency for human efficiency . "
Many of us do n't want to hear that because we have a long and glorious history of defending our favorite languages on precisely this ground .
And IT managers are an even less likely to want to hear this because performance issues are a common problem that gets them called to the carpet .
But here 's the thing : we really can't trade performance for productivity anyway .
Sure , if we compare two algorithimic implementations we can certainly see the tradoff : if we measured the time it takes to implement each one , compared their respective clock ticks , memory footprint , ability to crunch numbers , and so forth , we 'd end up with a ratio ( seconds saved programming over clock ticks ) .
This is the kind of experiment that could easily be crafted in a Computer Science class room , published , used to smack down attempts to use Ruby et al. -- and yet be totally misleading .
I believe this calculation is done unconciously by those programmers and IT managers who hear " we 're trading efficiency for productivity . "
Its why they are reluctant to take a serious look at higher - level languages .
A one - time productivity hit to get faster run-time performance certainly seems like a good trade - off , but the flaw in the argument is that productivity measurement is not reset with each task .
It 's cumulative .
Unlike a programming assignment ( " Implement Quick Sort Please " ) , productivity is measured across an entire solution ( whether a build script or a trading system ) -- and not just the first writing of the code , but throughout its useful lifetime ( the vast majority of coding time is spent changing , or maintaining existing code ) .
In the real world , its not " write once , run forever " , its " write a bit , run a bit , change a bit , run a bit " , and so on .
I am not saying that run -time efficiency is n't important .
It is .
What I am saying is that the best way to compare run-time efficiency and programmer productivity is not at the micro level , but at the macro level .
In the typical multi-client , data driven CRUD application found in typical IT shops there is n't going to be much choke - point code relative to the entire system , and yet notions of micro - level efficiency drive many such shops to adopt Java , .NET -- even C++ and C -- in an effort to get " performance . "
More than once , I 've heard organizations say " Java sucks !
Its too slow !
We 're switching to C++! "
Only to find that the real problem is that their programmers are not proficient in Java and / or their development practices put a premium on working code ( instead of correct code ) .
Unless they happen to be proficient C++ programmers the probability that they will be able to use C++ effectively is even less likely , but they make the switch anyway , because " C++ is more efficient ! "
In short , they seem to conclude : " We 'll just ' Make It Work ' ( using this ' Fast ' language ) because there wo n't be time to go back and tune . "
Unfortunately for their customers , ' Make It Right ' seems to get lost in the shuffle .
Of course , simply substituting Ruby for C++ , Java or C# in such an environment would be a disaster .
The culture equates ' done ' with ' working ' , and so good programmers accustomed to working in such environments tune everything knowing they 'll never get a chance to go back once they say its working .
They 're under constant pressure to get it working because the schedule 's been compressed so badly .
The schedule is compressed ( in part ) because they are using a low - level language to implement API wrappers and data - munging .
A vicious cycle if there ever was one .
The irony is that the end - user ( the one who needs it to be fast ) is unwittingly trading their functional requirements for performance ( " Well its buggy , but at least I get an answer quickly ! " ) .
Too often , they believe this is how it must be , that it is inherent to software development process .
And we programmers sell them on this idea when we tell them we have to use some low - level language to build a web application !
This is inefficiency in business terms -- what ultimately matters to nearly all professional development efforts .
We programmers need to get away from the idea that efficiency should be measured in clock ticks , and start thinking about efficicency like our customers : in time and money .
In summary , I am not suggesting everyone switch all their development to Ruby ( e.g . I do n't expect ( or encourage ) my team to stop using C# any time soon ) , I am merely suggesting that our first thoughts of efficiency should be about people effort , not computer effort .
It was once true that the computer 's time was more valuable than people time -- those days are over .
People time ( both programmer 's and end - user 's ) is the most expensive commodity today .
Optimize the programmer 's time and they can build a system that optimizes the end - users time more quickly and more efficiently -- leaving plenty of time for tuning the computer 's efficiency when it needs it .

A sure way to start a flamebait in any Lisp forum is to ask what ’s better , Scheme or Common Lisp , or , as a poster did today at comp.lang .
scheme , whether Scheme is geared towards academics and CL to real world applications .
Fortunately , one can always count on the good sense of lispers like Ray “ Bear ” Dillinger , who answered with this long , informed and very interesting post : recommended reading .
( To me , the answer is crystal - clear : both . )
Piggly Wiggly is a grocery store chain located in the midwestern United States .
If you have ever shopped there , they are definetely a hometown style store , the kind that makes you feel at home from the second you walk in the door .
They are also one of the least technological chain of grocery stores in the US .
Well , they were until recently .
Piggly Wiggly is the first chain to roll out biometric payment pads to their entire corporation .
The idea behind the biometric pads is that you can link your fingerprint to either a checking account or credit card and when you are ready to pay for your groceries by simply pressing your thumb on the pad and away you go .
Shoppers can also link their fingerprint to their " store loyalty cards " so they do n't have to carry their cards anymore ( do n't get me started on how annoying and pointless those store loyalty cards are ...
I hope Safeway enjoys tracking Ehjeet MaDrawers ' shopping habits . )
There are obviously some security concerns that the original article did n't address .
Sure , the likelihood of someone stealing your fingerprint is next to null , but there is still a central database of credit card / checking account numbers that has to be maintained .
There was no mention of who the maintainer was , but there is a high chance that it is either maintained by Pay By Touch ( The company behind the product Piggy Wiggly is using ) , or the Automated Clearing House network , the payment transfer service used by Pay By Touch .
The problem , as I see it , is that if the database is indeed maintained by Pay By Touch that leaves yet another company , with no public security record , with access to your financial information .
The security concerns do n't seem to be stopping people from signing up for the service .
15 - 20 % percent of Piggly Wiggly 's noncash customers are now using Pay By Touch , only weeks after the rollout was completed .
Apparently a good number of the early adopters are from a demographic that is considered to be afraid of technology : senior citizens .
The explanation behind the willingness of seniors to switch is that a lot of the seniors were as concerned with offline ( good ol ' fashioned beat you over the head ) theft as they were identity theft .
The seniors said that they were thankful for a system that allowed them to leave their checks and credit cards at home .
Piggly Wiggly 's employees were quick to adopt the system as well because it made it easier for them to grab a quick drink or bite to eat while on break without having to dig out their wallet .
According to loyalty card reports , customers that have adopted Pay By Touch are getting through the line quicker and coming back more often .

WSGI middleware is hazardous to your API ’s health .
There , I said it .
It ’s not the actual idea of WSGI middleware I have a problem with , but what a lot of people seem to think the idea of WSGI middleware is .
Unfortunately , the way I wrote the part of PEP 333 that talks about how maybe frameworks can someday become middleware , has produced an entire school of thought that ’s taken this to mean that middleware should be used to create protocols for extending WSGI itself !
More precisely , people seem to think that if you ’re going to offer a service via middleware , you have to stick the API for that service into the WSGI environment .
Apparently , they think that because WSGI puts things in the environment , and because servers are allowed to provide extension APIs via the environment , that it makes sense to have middleware whose sole purpose is to put APIs into the environment .
But this does n’t make any sense .
If your application requires that API to be present , then it ’s not middleware any more !
Middleware , you see , exists in order to wrap applications with additional behavior .
If you ca n’t arbitrarily decide whether to stick it in front of an application , it ’s not middleware any more .
It ’s part of the application .
And if it ’s part of the application , trying to put it on the outside of the application is a complete freaking waste of time !
Meanwhile , you then have to pull stuff out of the environment in order to use it , doing crap like environ [ ' some.session.service ']. whatever ( ) in order to do something that could ’ve been written more clearly as SomeSessionService ( environ ) .
whatever ( ) , and does n’t require you to stack a bunch of so - called “ middleware ” on top of your application object .
So please , end the madness now .
If you are tempted to put something into the environment using middleware , so that an application can pull it out later by direct access to the environment , please , just do n’t .
Instead , write library functions or classes that do whatever needs to be done , and which ( maybe ) store data in the environment , using library - specific keys .
Do not make users of your library access these keys directly ; instead , give them functions or methods that do useful things with this private data .
Do not make users wrap their application with your so - called “ middleware ” , when a callback or decorator will do .
Yes , technically that ’s still middleware , but practically it ’s a lot easier to use middleware expressed via a decorator or by passing a callback to a library function , rather than having to configure a complex middleware stack at the server deployment level .
Reserve such true middleware … i.e. , deployment middleware , for tools that are not specific to the application .
Tools like testers , debuggers , loggers , proxies , routers , caches , compressors , and so on .
There are many , many legitimate applications for deployment - stack middleware like this , and almost without exception they are tools that do n’t care what application they ’re used with , and neither does the application know they exist .
But application “ middleware ” , while being WSGI middleware in a technical sense , should not be forced into the deployment stack , where it ’s harder to deploy .
Give your users a real API , for crying out loud , and let them use it inside their application .
Okay .
’ nuff said .
</rant >
P.S. One more reason to avoid implementing APIs as middleware , is that it ’s extremely difficult to write correct , WSGI - compliant middleware , and very easy to do some very stupid things in the process .
Always test your middleware using wsgiref.validate on both sides of the middleware .
That is , wrap a validator around not only the middleware itself , but also the application the middleware is wrapping !
If you do n’t do that , you ’ll miss all kinds of compliance bugs .
P.P.S. Notice that this means WSGI 1.0 has failed in its goal of making middleware “ both simple and robust ” .
I have some ideas for a WSGI 2.0 that would drastically simplify both applications and middleware , but at the cost of eliminating the write ( ) callable for unbuffered streaming .
My idea for 2.0 would allow WSGI 1.0 apps to be called from a 2.0 server ( using 2.x middleware , of course ) , but write ( ) operations could only be streamed if the middleware used greenlets or threads or some other async mechanism .
Here ’s what a WSGI 2.0 application could look like :
def simple_app ( environ ) : " " " Simplest possible WSGI 2.0 application object " " " return ( ' 200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / plain ' ) ] , [ ' Hello world !
' ] )
The alarm clock goes off , buzzing insistently until I reach out a hand and groggily slap at the button to silence the sound .
I roll out of bed , pause for a few minutes , then head for the shower .
After breakfast , I head down to the office .
I ’ve got several different projects in flight .
The new Macintosh has arrived , sporting a new operating system revision .
Apple ’s finally broken the silly fixed memory limit for applications , but the new OS still ca n’t multitask worth a damn .
Apple ’s number one market share — about fifteen percent of the PC market — make it a little complacent .
Of course , it helps that Apple is unified , and that the other 85 % are running a variety of different operating systems .
I fire up the Macintosh I use as my office system and log onto the Internet using the latest AppleWeb , which is at least graphical , based on the Mosaic code .
It beat out the line - mode graphics browsers on most of the CP / M machines littering my office .
I could afford the resources for a graphical browser because I had an ISDN link running into the office .
I ’d talked to various phone companies about bringing in faster service , but they kept telling me there just were too many varieties of PCs with a confusing array of networking capabilities to really make high - speed access affordable for most homes .
Which brings me to one of my other projects — benchmark development .
The multiple flavors of CP / M 2005 and Unix versions , make performance testing a headache .
The good news these days is that developers are all writing relatively portable code , so most systems run the same — or at least similar — applications .
I sometimes wonder why anyone would be interested in owning a PC .
It ’s not so much the hardware , which has steadily gotten cheaper .
You can buy a decent 32 - bit system based on an Intel , Motorola , or Zilog processor for only a couple thousand dollars these days .
But the software costs are stunning .
WordStar 2005 still runs several hundred dollars , though WordPerfect ’s pricing strategies since Borland bought the company has helped keep it more affordable .
Lotus still has a lock on the spreadsheet market , and $ 695 is too much for most users .
The bottom line is that developing meaningful benchmarks for different operating systems is pretty painful .
Then there ’s Apple and Commodore , who keep pressing us for graphics benchmarks , while IBM suggests that “ real ” graphical interfaces are still years away .
Of course , Commodore has n’t been the same since it was bought by Hewlett - Packard , but at least HP had the good sense to keep it fairly independent of the rest of HP .
It was a classic HP move , though , to buy a PC company that had a dedicated following , but was n’t really mainstream .
Still , HP ’s engineering has improved the Amiga ’s reliability over the years .

Your task is to combine a number of Adobe PDF files into one and to number all pages consecutively .
As additional obstacle , not all pages have the same page size and some pages already contain old page numbers , in various places .
Your time starts running ... now !
I glued together multiple PDFs with PDFTK , but did not find a suitable tool to remove page numbers and draw new ones on the resulting file .
Until I looked at Marc Battyani 's neat cl- pdf library , which seemed to have all the ingredients needed .
The initial version was developed completely in the REPL , basically in no time , which means I could report back to my boss in time for him to leave and catch the train .
Instant local wizard status awarded , too .
Some small amount of glue code later ( pdf- page - numbers.lisp ) , removing the old centered page numbers at coordinates ( 308,148 ) and adding new ones in the same place is now as easy as :
( pdf:with - existing - document ( #p " old.pdf " ) ( with - existing - pages ( ) ( pdf:insert- original - page - content ) ( clear - page - numbers 308 148 : font " Times - Bold " : font - size 10.0 ) ( page - numbers 308 148 : font " Times - Bold " : font - size 10.0 ) ) ( pdf:write - document #p " new.pdf " ) )
Of course , this looks like it could be packaged into a nice function as well .
However , in real life we have to deal with all kinds of nastiness ( see above ) which would render such a function not very useful .
I used the following snippet eventually :
It 's not a bug - it 's a gotcha .
A " gotcha " is a feature or function which works as advertised - but not as expected .
When working with the MySQL ™ database server I have repeatedly encountered situations where the results of various actions have been unexpected and / or contrary to the behaviour generally expected of an SQL relational database .
The cause can usually be traced to implementation details which are documented in the manual .
I have created this list in order to further a better understanding of the MySQL database server and hopefully save others unnecessary headscratching .
( For known bugs see this page in the MySQL documentation : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Open_bugs.html).
The MySQL database server is being continually improved .
Some gotchas described here are no longer relevant for the latest versions ; in these cases the version numbers affected are noted at the top of each section .
As a rule gotchas have been tested against the most recent stable versions from the 3.23.x , 4.0.x and 4.1.x series .
Corrections , suggestions and comments are welcome : < db-gotchas0711@sql-info.de > .
Note : this document contains many examples as they would appear in the MySQL command line client mysql ( " mysql monitor " ) .
For convenience , where statements are more than one line , the continuation prompt -> has been omitted , so the statement can be copied directly from this page .
1. General SQL
1.1. NULL , or when NULL IS NOT NULL In SQL NULL represents the the absence of a value .
In MySQL an explicit NULL may also represent the next value of a pseudo - sequence and an implicit NULL may represent an implicit default value ( a zero or empty string ) determined by MySQL .
Example 1 .
When NULL is not NULL CREATE TABLE null_1 (
id INT NOT NULL ,
text1 VARCHAR ( 32 ) NOT NULL ,
text2 VARCHAR ( 32 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT ' foo '
) ;
INSERT INTO null_1 ( id ) VALUES ( 1 ) ;
INSERT INTO null_1 ( text1 ) VALUES ( ' test ' ) ;
mysql > SELECT * FROM null_1 ;
+----+-------+-------+
| id | text1 | text2 |
+----+-------+-------+
| 1 | | foo |
| 0 | test | foo |
+----+-------+-------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Here MySQL has inserted an empty string into column text1 on the first row , and zero into column id on the second row , even though each column is defined as NOT NULL with no default value .
As no value was provided in the INSERT statements , these can be considered an attempt to insert implicit NULL s into theses columns , which should normally cause the statements to fail .
...
If no DEFAULT value is specified for a column , MySQL automatically assigns one , as follows .
If the column may take NULL as a value , the default value is NULL .
If the column is declared as NOT NULL , the default value depends on the column type : ... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/CREATE_TABLE.html
Another example of NULL being used to trigger the insertion of an non- NULL is with the TIMESTAMP datatype , where NULL causes the field to be set to the current time : Example 2 . NULL and TIMESTAMP mysql > CREATE TABLE timestamp (
id INT ,
ts1 TIMESTAMP(8 ) NOT NULL ,
ts2 TIMESTAMP( 8 )
) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO timestamp VALUES ( 1 , NULL , NULL ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO timestamp ( id , ts1 ) VALUES ( 2 , NULL ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO timestamp ( id , ts2 ) VALUES ( 3 , NULL ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM timestamp ;
+------+----------+----------+
| id | ts1 | ts2 |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1 | 20030625 | 20030625 |
| 2 | 20030625 | 00000000 |
| 3 | 20030625 | 20030625 |
+------+----------+----------+
3 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note that in every case , even though ts1 has no default value , and even when no value was provided in the INSERT statement , the current timestamp was inserted into the column .
The manual explains this behaviour thus : ...
The TIMESTAMP column type provides a type that you can use to automatically mark INSERT or UPDATE operations with the current date and time .
If you have multiple TIMESTAMP columns , only the first one is updated automatically .
... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/DATETIME.html
Presumably this is a way around the limitation that columns could not be defined with a default of NOW ( ) in MySQL versions prior to 4.1 .
See also Section 1.5 and Section 1.7 .
Note : this behaviour can be changed from version 4.1.1 : ...
When MySQL is running in MAXDB mode , TIMESTAMP behaves like DATETIME .
No automatic updating of TIMESTAMP columns occurs , as described in the following paragraphs .
MySQL can be run in MAXDB mode as of version 4.1.1 . ... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/DATETIME.html
Example 3 . Accessing pseudo - sequences with NULL CREATE TABLE null_2 (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
text1 VARCHAR ( 32 ) NOT NULL
) ;
INSERT INTO null_2 VALUES ( ) ;
INSERT INTO null_2 ( id ) VALUES ( NULL ) ;
mysql > select * from null_2 ;
+----+-------+
| id | text1 |
+----+-------+
| 1 | |
| 2 | |
+----+-------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
In MySQL this behaviour is necessary , as it is the only way of accessing the AUTO_INCREMENT pseudo - sequence .
It is still an odd notion though that inserting a NULL on a NOT NULL column can have this kind of effect .
See below for more fun with AUTO_INCREMENT Continuing from the previous example : Example 4 .
Is NULL an integer ?
mysql > INSERT INTO null_2 ( ) VALUES ( NULL , ' This should be id 3 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.01 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM null_2 WHERE id IS NULL ;
+----+---------------------+
| id | text1 |
+----+---------------------+
| 3 | This should be id 3 |
+----+---------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
The first person to spot a NULL value in the result set will receive a stuffed toy dolphin from the author .
There is an explanation though : ...
For the benefit of some ODBC applications ( at least Delphi and Access ) , the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row : ... SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL ; -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/ODBC_and_last_insert_id.html
All further executions of the same statement provide the expected result : mysql > SELECT * FROM null_2 WHERE id IS NULL ;
Empty set ( 0.00 sec )
1.2. AUTO_INCREMENT
The previous gotcha leads us to this interesting problem , which is possibly the proof that 0 equals 1 : CREATE TABLE exmpl3 (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
val TEXT
) ;
INSERT INTO exmpl3 VALUES ( 0 , ' test ' ) ;
mysql > select * from exmpl3 ;
+----+------+
| id | val |
+----+------+
| 1 | test |
+----+------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Is n't this fun ?
Now let 's get ambitious : CREATE TABLE exmpl4 (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
val TEXT
) ;
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl4 VALUES ( - 1 , ' test ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl4 VALUES ( 0 , ' test ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.01 sec )
and then : mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl4 VALUES ( 1 , ' test ' ) ;
ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry ' 1 ' for key 1
mysql > SELECT * FROM exmpl4 ;
+----+------+
| id | val |
+----+------+
| - 1 | test |
| 1 | test |
+----+------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
The probable explanation for this is : ...
The behaviour of auto - increment is not defined if a user gives a negative value to the column or if the value becomes bigger than the maximum integer that can be stored in the specified integer type .
... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/InnoDB_auto-increment_column.html
The problem here is not the restriction itself , but the combintation of undefined behaviour and the absence of any warnings after inserting a negative value leading to unexpected errors .
Note Several readers have asked why I would ever want negative values in an AUTO_INCREMENT column .
As it happens , the table that caused the discovery of the above oddities did n't actually need an AUTO_INCREMENT column , as the primary key values were to be limited to between - 2 and 2 ( enforced by a foreign key relation , of course ) .
One was added anyway , probably through force of habit .
The problem occurred while loading data with predefined values from a script , which caused a primary key exception , even though the ID values were defined explicitly and the data itself was correct .
It 's MySQLs habit of discretely altering input , and only ( coincidentally ) barfing on the side - effects - instead of immediately throwing an error on data it does n't know what to do with - which is causing me to compose lists like this .
Personally I 've not yet ever needed sequences which start with negative values .
If you do , you 'll probably need to look at another database .
( And if you 're thinking " implement them in the application " , you do n't need a relational database ) .
One way of changing the value of the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence is with ALTER TABLE ...
AUTO_INCREMENT=value .
With InnoDB tables however the statement appears to succeed , does not have any effect .
Use the syntax SET INSERT_ID=value instead : mysql > CREATE TABLE exmpl5 (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
val TEXT
) TYPE=InnoDB ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl5 VALUES ( NULL , ' test1 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl5 VALUES ( NULL , ' test2 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > ALTER TABLE exmpl5 AUTO_INCREMENT=4 ;
Query OK , 2 rows affected ( 0.01 sec )
Records : 2 Duplicates : 0 Warnings : 0
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl5 VALUES ( NULL , ' test4 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM exmpl5 ;
+----+-------+
| id | val |
+----+-------+
| 1 | test1 |
| 2 | test2 |
| 3 | test4 |
+----+-------+
3 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SET INSERT_ID=5 ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO exmpl5 VALUES ( NULL , ' test5 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.01 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM exmpl5 ;
+----+-------+
| id | val |
+----+-------+
| 1 | test1 |
| 2 | test2 |
| 3 | test4 |
| 5 | test5 |
+----+-------+
4 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
1.3 . ENUM
An interesting and amusing mistake the author has often made is to forget that ENUM can only contain character values : mysql > CREATE TABLE enum_exmpl (
id INT ,
whatever ENUM ( 0,1 )
) ;
ERROR 1064 : You have an error in your SQL syntax near ' 0,1 )
) ' at line 3
Oops , my mistake , try again : mysql > CREATE TABLE enum_exmpl (
id INT ,
whatever ENUM ( '0 ' , ' 1 ' )
) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
By the time data is ready to be inserted amnesia has set in : INSERT INTO enum_exmpl VALUES ( 1,0 ) ;
INSERT INTO enum_exmpl VALUES ( 2,1 ) ;
INSERT INTO enum_exmpl VALUES ( 3,2 ) ;
INSERT INTO enum_exmpl VALUES ( 4,3 ) ;
mysql > SELECT * FROM enum_exmpl ;
+------+----------+
| id | whatever |
+------+----------+
| 1 | |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | |
+------+----------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Two things are happening here : when an integer is inserted , the enumeration member corresponding to the index value of that integer is inserted .
This is the case with id s 2 and 3 in the above example , where the integer 1 is the first value of the ENUM index ( ' 0 ' ) and 2 is the second value ( ' 1 ' ) .
s and in the above example , where the integer is the first value of the index ( ) and is the second value ( ) . when ENUM receives an invalid value , an empty string is inserted ; this is the case with id s 0 and 4 , where the inserted integers had no corresponding index value .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/ENUM.html for further details .
As MySQL does not have a true boolean datatype it is tempting to use ENUM like this : mysql > CREATE TABLE enum_exmpl2 (
id INT ,
whatever ENUM ( '0 ' , '1 ' ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
) ;
ERROR 1067 : Invalid default value for ' whatever '
Once again , my mistake .
But what if I want the default value to be true ?
mysql > CREATE TABLE enum_exmpl2 (
id INT ,
whatever ENUM ( '0 ' , '1 ' ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
Syntax OK , looks good , but : mysql > INSERT INTO enum_exmpl2 ( id ) VALUES ( 99 ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM enum_exmpl2 ;
+------+----------+
| id | whatever |
+------+----------+
| 99 | 0 |
+------+----------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Again , MySQL is performing to specification ; to avoid this kind of mistake - DEFAULT 1 instead of DEFAULT ' 1 ' , be sure to perform all ENUM operations including table creation with character values and not integers .
Note that ENUM also accepts insertion of NULL in columns defined as NOT NULL and as with other datatypes will insert the default value , if defined , or the first value in the ENUM index .
1.4 . Case sensitivity in CHAR / VARCHAR fields
Try this : mysql > CREATE TABLE casetest (
id INT ,
string VARCHAR ( 32 )
) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO casetest VALUES ( 1 , ' foo ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.01 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM casetest WHERE string = ' FOO ' ;
+------+--------+
| id | string |
+------+--------+
| 1 | foo |
+------+--------+
1 row in set ( 0.02 sec )
To prevent this happening , the table should be defined like this : CREATE TABLE casetest (
id INT ,
string VARCHAR ( 32 ) BINARY
)
The manual says : ... Values in CHAR and VARCHAR columns are sorted and compared in case - insensitive fashion , unless the BINARY attribute was specified when the table was created .
The BINARY attribute means that column values are sorted and compared in case - sensitive fashion according to the ASCII order of the machine where the MySQL server is running .
BINARY does n't affect how the column is stored or retrieved .
... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/CHAR.html
Note that MySQL 's behaviour in this regard is the diametrical opposite of the default behaviour of most other databases .
( Tested : DB2 8.1 , Firebird 1.5.1 , Oracle 8.1.7 and PostgreSQL 7.4.3 , details of other databases welcome ) .
1.5 . VARCHAR limited to 255 characters MySQL limits VARCHAR ( aka CHARACTER VARYING ) columns to a column length of 255 .
A future MySQL version will remove this restriction :
Add true VARCHAR support ( column lengths longer than 255 , ... ) .
There is already support for this in the MyISAM storage engine , but it is not yet available at the user level .
-- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/TODO_MySQL_5.0.html
1.6 . VARCHAR 's trailing blank allergy
In the MySQL world VARCHAR columns are the opposite of CHAR : instead of being padded , any trailing blanks are stripped .
mysql > CREATE TABLE vtest ( id INT , val VARCHAR ( 32 ) ) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO vtest VALUES ( 1 , ' Watch this space -> ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT concat( val , ' | ' ) FROM vtest ;
+----------------------+
| concat( val , ' | ' ) |
+----------------------+
| Watch this space ->| |
+----------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
This is documented , and is not a bug : ...
However , in contrast to CHAR , VARCHAR values are stored using only as many characters as are needed , plus one byte to record the length .
Values are not padded ; instead , trailing spaces are removed when values are stored .
( This space removal differs from the SQL - 99 specification . ) ... -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/CHAR.html
Use BLOB or TEXT types to store values with trailing blanks .
Update : Apparently this behaviour will be corrected in the planned 5.0 release ( see : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/TODO_MySQL_5.0.html).
1.7 . DEFAULT NOW () Affects : MySQL < 4.1
It is not possible to create a column with a default value which is a function or expression , such as NOW ( ) : mysql > CREATE TABLE timestamp_now (
id INT ,
timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW ( )
) ;
ERROR 1064 : You have an error in your SQL syntax .
Check the manual that
corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near
' NOW ( ) ) ' at line 3
Occasionally you may see the advice to put NOW ( ) in single quotes : CREATE TABLE timestamp_now (
id INT ,
timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT ' NOW ( ) '
)
This syntax is accepted and even appears to work : mysql > INSERT INTO timestamp_now( id ) VALUES ( 1 ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM timestamp_now ;
+------+----------------+
| id | timestamp |
+------+----------------+
| 1 | 20030625154717 |
+------+----------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
but this is merely MySQL 's automagical " first TIMESTAMP column rule " coming into play , where the first TIMESTAMP column is filled with the current timestamp on each INSERT or UPDATE : mysql > update timestamp_now SET id=2 WHERE id=1 ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.05 sec )
Rows matched : 1 Changed : 1 Warnings : 0
mysql > select * from timestamp_now ;
+------+----------------+
| id | timestamp |
+------+----------------+
| 2 | 20030625154826 |
+------+----------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Note how the timestamp value has changed ; the defined default column value has no effect .
If this default is defined for any other column value , ' NOW ( ) ' is interpreted as a literal string which cannot be cast to a TIMESTAMP or other date type , and which MySQL in its infinite wisdom silently converts to a zero value .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/DATETIME.html for MySQL 's take on the matter .
1.8 . INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... Affects : MySQL <= 3.23.58 ; MySQL <= 4.0.13 INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... does not work in MySQL if source and target tables are the same .
CREATE TABLE insert_test (
id INT ,
txt VARCHAR ( 32 )
) ;
INSERT INTO insert_test VALUES ( 1 , ' foo ' ) ;
INSERT INTO insert_test VALUES ( 2 , ' bar ' ) ;
mysql > INSERT INTO insert_test SELECT 3 , txt FROM insert_test WHERE id=2 ;
ERROR 1066 : Not unique table / alias : ' insert_test '
The manual says about this :
The target table of the INSERT statement cannot appear in the FROM clause of the SELECT part of the query .
( The problem is that the SELECT possibly would find records that were inserted earlier during the same run .
When using subquery clauses , the situation could easily be very confusing . ) -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/INSERT_SELECT.html
Other databases tested have no problem with the same construction .
The only exception found is Firebird 1.02 , which went into an infinite loop ; this problem seems to be fixed in Firebird 1.5 .
( Note : earlier versions of the MySQL manual implied this behaviour was SQL - conform , though not which version of the standard ; MySQL tells me the version referred to was SQL - 89 ) .
A further idiosyncracy seems to be this behaviour : CREATE TABLE insert_test2 (
id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ,
txt VARCHAR ( 32 )
) ;
INSERT INTO insert_test2 VALUES ( 1 , ' foo ' ) ;
INSERT INTO insert_test2 VALUES ( 2 , ' bar ' ) ;
Now watch this : mysql > INSERT INTO insert_test2 VALUES ( 1 , ' bar ' ) ;
ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry ' 1 ' for key 1
Correct behaviour ... now watch this : mysql > INSERT INTO insert_test2 ( id , txt ) SELECT i.id , i.txt FROM insert_test i WHERE i.id=1 ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
Records : 1 Duplicates : 1 Warnings : 0
mysql > SELECT * FROM insert_test2 ;
+----+------+
| id | txt |
+----+------+
| 1 | foo |
| 2 | bar |
+----+------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
Expected behaviour would be for this statement to fail with the same error as above ; instead it appears that the statement was successful , with only the Duplicates : 1 notice indicating the statement was effectively ignored .
Update : in version 4.0.20 , and possibly previous versions , this statement returns the expected error message .
Note also that the syntax : INSERT INTO insert_test SELECT 3 , ' fubar ' ;
is not supported , although I am not sure whether this is standard SQL .
Note :
This is documented by MySQL thus : Prior to MySQL 4.0.14 , the target table of the INSERT statement cannot appear in the FROM clause of the SELECT part of the query .
This limitation is lifted in 4.0.14 . -- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/INSERT_SELECT.html
1.9 . Comments beginning with -- MySQL is slightly allergic to comments beginning with a double dash : -- and requires that a space is inserted between the -- and the following comment , e.g. : mysql > select 1 , -- comment
-> 2 ;
ERROR 1054 : Unknown column ' comment ' in ' field list '
mysql > select 1 , -- comment
-> 2 ;
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
1 row in set ( 0.01 sec )
Note :
In recent MySQL versions the error message is returned with the code 1064 .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/ANSI_diff_comments.html for further information .
1.10 . UNION and literal values Affects : MySQL <= 3.23.58 ; MySQL <= 4.0.21
If the first SELECT in a UNION join contains literal values , i.e. values not derived from a column , values from subsequent SELECT statements will be truncated to the length of the literal columns : mysql > CREATE TABLE union_test (
id INT ,
val1 VARCHAR ( 10 ) ,
val2 VARCHAR ( 10 )
) ;
mysql > INSERT INTO union_test VALUES ( 1 , ' abcdef ' , '123456 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.01 sec )
mysql > SELECT ' abc ' AS c1 , ' 123 ' AS c2
UNION ALL
SELECT val1 AS c1 , val2 AS c2 FROM union_test ;
+------+------+
| c1 | c2 |
+------+------+
| abc | 123 |
| abc | 123 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
No reason for this behaviour could be found .
In September 2003 this was confirmed to me by someone from MySQL as a bug .
It has been fixed in the 4.1.x series , but remains in earlier versions .
Other databases tested ( DB2 8.1 , Firebird 1.5rc4 , Oracle 8.1.7 and PostgreSQL 7.3 ) displayed the query results as expected with no truncation .
A more serious consequence of this behaviour is this : mysql > SELECT ' abc ' AS c1 , ' 123 ' AS c2
UNION
SELECT val1 AS c1 , val2 AS c2 FROM union_test ;
+------+------+
| c1 | c2 |
+------+------+
| abc | 123 |
+------+------+
1 row in set ( 0.20 sec )
where ALL is ommitted from the UNION clause .
Even though each row contains different values MySQL treats them as being identical - which is clearly not the case .
Note that the UNION clause is supported in MySQL beginning with version 4.0 ( see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/UNION.html).
1.11 . Division by zero mysql > SELECT 1/0 ;
+------+
| 1/0 |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
1 row in set ( 0.02 sec )
Other databases ( tested : DB2 8.1 , Firebird 1.5rc4 , Oracle 8.1.7 , PostgreSQL 7.3.4 ) all raise a " division by zero " error when performing the same calculation .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Arithmetic_functions.html
1.12 . ' concatenation ' || ' or '
In MySQL || is translated as a logical OR and not as a concatenation operator : mysql > select ' a ' || 'b ' ;
+------------+
| 'a ' || ' b ' |
+------------+
| 0 |
+------------+
1 row in set ( 0.01 sec )
The expected result would be : ab .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Logical_Operators.html.
To perform concatenation in MySQL use CONCAT ( ) ( see : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/String_functions.html).
To force || to be used as a string concatenation operator rather than a synonym for OR , MySQL must be started in ANSI mode .
See : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/ANSI_mode.html.
1.13 .
What goes in - is n't ( always ) what comes out So - your app messed up .
It tried to insert an invalid value into a column .
There are two options here : 1 ) the database throws an error and your app either deals with it gracefully or fails .
2 ) The database truncates the value , or takes a guess at what might be an alternative value and silently inserts it without giving you the teensiest hint that what you put in is different to what you 'll get out .
mysql > CREATE TABLE bounds_test (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
price NUMERIC ( 4,2 ) ,
code VARCHAR ( 8 ) ,
numbers_only INT
) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.06 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO bounds_test VALUES (
99999999999999 ,
21474.83 ,
' ABCDEFGHIJK ' ,
' A quick brown dolphin ...'
) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.03 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM bounds_test ;
+------------+--------+----------+--------------+
| id | price | code | numbers_only |
+------------+--------+----------+--------------+
| 2147483647 | 999.99 | ABCDEFGH | 0 |
+------------+--------+----------+--------------+
1 row in set ( 0.01 sec )
( Note : in MySQL 4.1.x , the presence of warnings is notified on the query status line ; executing SHOW WARNINGS after the INSERT displays Data truncated messages for each column ) .
As a nice extra touch note that although the price was defined with a precision of 4 digits , MySQL inserted a number containing 5 .
Possibly this is because MySQL internally adds an extra " digit " to store a minus sign , and because the storage space is there uses it with positive numbers to pack an extra digit in , if the explanation here :
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Numeric_types.html is anything to go by .
Other databases ( tested : Firebird 1.5rc4 , Oracle 8.1.7 and PostgreSQL 7.4 ) raised errors with the same data .
On a column defined as NUMERIC ( 4,2 ) the highest value accepted in all databases was the expected 99.99 .
For another reason why this is seriously bad database mojo see section 3.5
1.14 . February 31st
Throughout history many different calendar systems have been developed around the world .
Although the way of counting years still varies , most countries and regions have adopted the Roman - Nordic system of months and weekdays - except , ironically enough , a small corner of Scandinavia with a high dolphin population ;-) . mysql > CREATE TABLE datetest ( id INT , a_date DATE ) ;
Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > INSERT INTO datetest VALUES ( 1 , ' 2003-02-31 ' ) ;
Query OK , 1 row affected ( 0.00 sec )
mysql > SELECT * FROM datetest ;
+------+------------+
| id | a_date |
+------+------------+
| 1 | 2003-02-31 |
+------+------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
So , what 's the day before February 31st ?
mysql > SELECT DATE_SUB ( ' 2003-02-31 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) ;
+----------------------------------------+
| DATE_SUB ( '2003-02-31 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) |
+----------------------------------------+
| 2003-03-02 |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Which is of course two days before the day after February 31st : mysql > SELECT DATE_ADD ( ' 2003-02-31 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) ;
+----------------------------------------+
| DATE_ADD ( ' 2003-02-31 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) |
+----------------------------------------+
| 2003-03-04 |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
So what kind of checking does MySQL do on date values ?
A hint :
If you use really malformed dates , the result is NULL .
-- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Date_and_time_functions.html
Obviously , the 31st of February is not malformed enough .
Let 's try again : mysql > SELECT DATE_ADD ( '2003-02 -!!!!!!31 !!!!!' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) ;
+---------------------------------------------------+
| DATE_ADD ( '2003-02 -!!!!!!31 !!!!!' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| 2003-03-04 |
+---------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec )
Nope. mysql > SELECT DATE_ADD ( '2003-02-99 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) ;
+----------------------------------------+
| DATE_ADD ( '2003-02-99 ' , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) |
+----------------------------------------+
| NULL |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set ( 0.00 sec
Hmmm .
A pattern emerges ...
The MySQL server only performs basic checking on the validity of a date : days 00 - 31 , months 00 - 12 , years 1000 - 9999 .
Any date not within this range will revert to 0000 - 00 - 00 .
Please note that this still allows you to store invalid dates such as 2002 - 04 - 31 .
It allows web applications to store data from a form without further checking .
To ensure a date is valid , perform a check in your application .
-- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/DATETIME.html
Makes you wonder why they bother ...
Addendum : future MySQL versions are scheduled to contain server options which enable sane data checks , although the need to retain backwards - compatibility means these will probably not be enabled by default .
ALAMEDA COUNTY / Blind student sues Target over firm 's
Web site /
It lacks software that allows access to visually impaired
A blind UC Berkeley student is suing Target Corp. , saying the retailer is violating the civil rights of those who cannot see because its
Web site is inaccessible to them .
Although it might seem odd that the blind would use a Web site like www.target.com, advocates for the blind said Wednesday that computer software and coding embedded in Web sites makes surfing the Internet as easy for those who cannot see as it is for those who can .
But Target 's Web site , according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Alameda County Superior Court , does not support such software , making the site useless to the blind -- a violation of the Americans With Disabilities
Act and various state laws .
" Target thus excludes the blind from full and equal participation in the growing Internet economy that is increasingly a fundamental part of daily life , " said the suit , which seeks class action certification .
Advocates for the blind said the lawsuit is a shot across the bow for retailers , newspapers and other businesses that have Web sites the blind cannot use .
They chose Target because of its popularity and because of a large number of complaints by blind patrons .
" What I hope is that Target and other online merchants will realize how important it is to reach 1.3 million people in this nation and the growing Baby Boomer population who will also be losing vision , " said Bruce Sexton Jr. , 24 , the blind third - year Cal student who filed the suit .
In a statement Wednesday , Target said it had n't been served with the suit and could n't comment .
" However , we strive to make our goods and services available to all of our guests , including those with disabilities , " the company said .
Sexton , president of the California Association of Blind Students , said making Target 's
Web site accessible to the blind would also make it more navigable by those without vision problems .
Marc Maurer , president of the National Federation of the Blind in Baltimore , an advocacy group that 's also a plaintiff in the suit , said Wednesday that the complaint is based on the theory that the online portals of " brick - and - mortar stores " must be equally accessible .
Too often , he said , such is not the case .
" Target is one of the biggest companies in the country , " Maurer said .
" One of the things we 're trying to do is change the way this is done . "
Blind people access
Web sites using keyboards and screen - reading software that vocalizes the information others see on a computer screen .
But Target 's site lacks " alt - text , " an invisible code embedded beneath images on the Web site that screen - reading software uses to provide descriptions to the blind , the suit said .
The Web site also has inaccessible image maps , the suit said .
Image maps , when clicked on by sighted users , allow the patron to jump to other parts of the Web site .
Without image maps , visitors to www.target.com must use a mouse to complete transactions -- preventing blind patrons from surfing the site or making online purchases , the suit said .
Some companies , like Wells Fargo & Co. , have Web sites accessible to the blind , said Mazen Basrawi , an attorney with Disability Rights Advocates of Berkeley , which represents the plaintiffs .
In 2003 , Wells Fargo was the first financial institution to have its Web site certified by Maurer 's group , bank spokesman Chris Hammond said .
Basrawi said the plaintiffs began negotiating with Target after writing to the retailer in May 2005 .
But talks broke down last month , and the company , which the attorney described as " one of the biggest offenders , " declined to modify its Web site .
" Blind people have complained about ( Target 's Web site ) in particular , " Basrawi said .
" That one 's gotten a lot of complaints , especially because it 's completely unusable .
A blind person cannot make a purchase independently on target.com . "
Target has 1,400 stores in 47 states , including 205 in California , and reported $ 46 billion in revenue in 2004 .

Watch The Contraption Videos :
March 5 , 2007
Two years ago , we wrote about the “ time - shifting ” drug , Modafinil that enables you to stay awake for 40 + hours with close to full mental capacity and with few side effects .
The drug is a eugeroic and offers improved memory , mood enhancement , improved alertness and cognitive powers , and has a much smoother feel than amphetamines because they work differently .
Popular Science is now reporting that we ’re just about to see new forms of super eugeroic called armodafinil ( Modafinil ’s creator Cephalon is awaiting FDA approval for the drug ) , and a drug code - named CX717 from Cortex .
Both drugs promise even longer periods of wakefulness , and in experiments with Ampakine CX717 , sleep - deprived rhesus monkeys on the drug often outperformed their own well - rested but undrugged best efforts on mental - performance tests .
While these drugs will be marketed to assist people with sleep disorders like narcolepsy , it ’s their potential as recreational and workplace performance - enhancing drugs that make them worth watching .
The times they are a changing …
Cortex Pharmaceuticals and DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) tested Ampakine CX717 in an attempt to reverse the effects of sleep deprivation in non-human primates .
They measured decrements in cognitive performance and reaction time in rhesus macaque monkeys .
Under carefully controlled conditions and constant medical monitoring , the monkeys were individually sleep - deprived for 30 - 36 hours and re-tested at that time .
When monkeys are sleep deprived their performance accuracy is reduced by 15 - 25 % , and their reaction times slow by at least 50 % .
A dose of 0.8 mg/kg of CX717 completely reversed the performance deficits associated with sleep - deprivation .
In addition , specific brain EEG changes that occur after sleep deprivation were returned to the non-sleep - deprived state in the CX717 group , but not in the control group .
Thus , CX717 counteracted the effects of periods of prolonged sleep deprivation when given immediately before testing .
Use functional programming techniques to write elegant JavaScript
Functional programming languages have been in academia for quite some time , but historically they do not have extensive tools and libraries available .
With the advent of Haskell in the .NET platform , functional programming is becoming more popular .
Some traditional programming languages , such as C++ and JavaScript , import constructs and features from functional programming .
In many cases , repetitive code in JavaScript leads to clumsy coding .
You can avoid all that if you use functional programming .
Also , you can write more elegantl callbacks with a functional programming style .
Functional programming Functional programming describes only the operations to be performed on the inputs to the programs , without use of temporary variables to store intermediate results .
The emphasis is to capture " what and why " rather than the " how . "
It emphasizes the definition of functions rather than the implementation of state machines , in contrast to procedural programming , which emphasizes execution of sequential commands .
Large scale knowledge management applications benefit greatly from using a functional programming style as it simplifies development .
Because functional programming encompasses a very different way of composing programs , programmers who are used to the imperative paradigm can find it difficult to learn .
In this article you 'll see examples of how to write good , elegant code in JavaScript in a functional style .
I 'll discuss :
Functional programming concepts , including anonymous functions , different ways to call functions , and how to pass functions as arguments to other functions .
Use of functional concepts , with examples of : extending array sort ; elegant code for dynamic HTML generation ; and application of a sequence of functions .
Functional programming concepts
Many developers know how to code in languages where you specify the method of solving a problem by describing " how . "
For example , to code a function to compute a factorial , I describe the program by coding a loop or using recursion to find the product of all the numbers .
In both cases , the procedure for the computation is detailed in the program .
Listing 1 shows possible C code for a factorial .
Listing 1 . Factorial in procedural style
int factorial ( int n ) { if ( n <= 0 ) return 1 ; else return n * factorial ( n - 1 ) ; }
Such languages are also called procedural programming languages because they define the procedure to solve the problem .
Functional programming is markedly different from that philosophy .
In functional programming , you need to describe the " what " of the problem .
Functional programming languages are also called declarative .
The same program computing factorial would be written as a product of all the numbers up to n .
A typical functional program for a factorial looks like the example in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Factorial in functional style
factorial n , where n <= 0 := 1 factorial n := foldr * 1 take n [ 1 .. ]
The second statement instructs you to take a list of first n numbers starting from 1 ( take n [ 1.. ] ) , then find their product with 1 as the identity .
This definition does not have the loop , or recursion , as with the earlier case .
It is like the mathematical definition of the factorial function .
Once you know the meaning of the library functions ( take and foldr ) , and the notation ( list notation [ ] ) , it is very easy to code and also very readable .
You can write a routine to process each element of an n-ary tree using breadth - first or depth - first traversal , depending on a parameter , where the elements could be of any generic type , in just three lines of Miranda code .
Historically , functional programming languages have not been very popular for various reasons .
Recently , however , a few of these languages are entering the computer industry .
One example is Haskell in the .NET platform .
In other cases , some of the existing languages borrow concepts from functional programming languages .
Iterators and continuations show up in some implementations of C++ and some functional constructs provided in JavaScript .
However , by borrowing functional constructs , the overall programming paradigm of the language does not change .
JavaScript has not become a functional programming language because of the addition of the functional constructs .
I will now discuss the various niceties of the functional constructs in JavaScript , and ways to use them in our day - to - day coding and work .
You 'll start with some basic capabilities , then use them to see some of the more interesting applications .
Anonymous functions
In JavaScript , you have the ability to write anonymous functions , or functions without a name .
Why would you need that ?
Keep reading , but first you 'll learn how to write one .
If you had the following JavaScript function :
Listing 3 . A typical function
function sum( x , y, z ) { return ( x+y+z ) ; }
Then the corresponding anonymous function would look like :
Listing 4 .
An anonymous Function
function ( x , y, z ) { return ( x+y+z ) ; }
To use it , you write the following :
Listing 5 . Applying an anonymous function
var sum = function ( x , y, z ) { return ( x+y+z ) ; }( 1,2,3 ) ; alert ( sum ) ;
Using functions as values
You could also use functions as values .
You could have variables with functions as values assigned to them .
In the last example , you could also do the following :
Listing 6 . Using function assignment
var sum = function ( x , y, z ) { return ( x+y+z ) ; } alert ( sum ( 1, 2,3 ) ) ;
In the example in Listing 6 above , the variable sum is assigned the function definition itself .
Therefore , sum is a function and called anywhere you want .
Different ways of calling functions
JavaScript allows you to call a function in two ways , as shown in Listings 7 and 8 .
Listing 7 . Typical function application
alert ( â  Hello , World ! " ) ;
Or
Listing 8 .
Using function as an expression
( alert ) ( â  Hello , World ! " ) ;
Therefore you can also write the following :
Listing 9 . Function application just after definition
( function ( x , y, z ) { return ( x+y+z ) } ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ;
You might write a function expression in parentheses and then pass arguments to get them evaluated .
Though in the example in Listing 8 , with a function name directly enclosed in parentheses , this need not be the case while using it as shown in Listing 9 .
Passing functions as arguments to other functions
You can also pass functions as argument to other functions .
Though this is not a new concept , it is used in the subsequent examples extensively .
You can pass function arguments as shown in Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Passing function as a parameter and applying it
var passFunAndApply = function ( fn , x , y , z ) { return fn( x , y , z ) ; } ; var sum = function ( x , y, z ) { return x+y+z ; } ; alert ( passFunAndApply ( sum , 3,4,5 ) ) ; // 12
Execution of the last alert statement prints the value 12 .
Using functional concepts
The previous section showed some programming concepts using the functional style .
The examples are by no means complete coverage of all the concepts , nor are they in any order of importance , but are the relevant concepts for this discussion .
To quickly summarize , with the functional style in JavaScript :
Functions need not have names all the time .
Functions can be assigned to variables like other values .
A function expression cqn be written and enclosed in parentheses for application later .
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions .
This section shows some examples of how you can use the concepts effectively to write good and elegant code in JavaScript .
( Using a functional style of JavaScript , you can do many other things that are out of the scope of this discussion . )
Extending array sort
Let 's plan to write a sort method that can sort the array elements according to their date .
Writing this is very simple in JavaScript .
The sort method of array objects takes an optional parameter that is the comparison function .
In this case , you need the comparison function in Listing 11 .
Listing 11 .
Comparison function function ( x , y ) { return x.date â y.date ; } To get the required function , use the example in Listing 12 .
Listing 12 .
Extension of the sort function arr.sort ( function ( x , y ) { return x.date â y.date ; } ) ;
Where arr is an object of type array .
This will sort all the objects in arr according to their respective dates .
The comparison function , along with its definition , is passed to the sort function to complete the sort operation .
With this function : Each JavaScript object has a date property .
The sort function of array type in JavaScript takes an optional parameter , which is the comparison function used for sorting .
This is similar to the qsort function in the C library .
Elegant code for dynamic HTML generation
In this example , you 'll see how to write elegant code to generate dynamic HTML from arrays .
You can generate tables from the values obtained from an array .
Or , you might generate ordered and unordered lists using the contents of an array .
You can also generate vertical or horizontal menu items .
The coding style in Listing 13 is commonly used to generate dynamic HTML from arrays .
Listing 13 .
Normal code for generating dynamic HTML var str= ' '; for ( var i=0 ;i< arr.length ; i++ ) { var element=arr [ i ] ; str+=... HTML generation code ... } document.write ( str ) ;
You can replace this code using the code in Listing 14 .
Listing 14 .
Generic way of generating dynamic HTML Array.prototype.fold=function(templateFn ) { var len=this.length ; var str= ' '; for ( var i=0 ; i<len ; i++) str+=templateFn( this [i ] ) ; return str ; } function templateInstance ( element ) { return ... HTML generation code ... } document.write(arr.fold( templateInstance ) ) ; I 've used the prototype property of Array type to define the new function fold .
You can now use this function in any of the arrays that are defined later .
Application of a sequence of functions Consider the case where you want to use a set of functions as the callback function .
For this purpose you 'll use a window.
setTimeout function , which has two parameters .
The first parameter is the function to be called after the number of milliseconds indicated by the second parameter .
Listing 15 shows one way to do this .
Listing 15 .
Calling a set of functions in a callback window.setTimeout ( function ( ) {alert( â  First!â ) ; alert(â Second!â ) ;} , 5000 ) ; Listing 16 shows the more elegant way of doing it .
Listing 16 .
Elegant way of calling a sequence of functions Function.prototype.sequence=function(g ) { var f=this ; return function ( ) { f( ) ; g( ) ; } } ; function alertFrst ( ) { alert ( â  First!â ) ; } function alertSec ( ) { alert ( â  Second!â ) ; } setTimeout ( alertFrst.sequence(alertSec ) , 5000 ) ; You can also use an extension of the code in Listing 16 if you want to call one callback after calling another while handling an event .
Perhaps that is an exercise for you to pursue , now that your interest is sparked .
In conclusion
In many areas , you can apply functional programming concepts in JavaScript to accomplish day - to - day activities in an elegant way .
The examples in this article show only a few of the cases .
If you identify the right scenarios for functional programming , and apply the concepts , you 'll make a lot of sense and can increase your elegance level .

There was a time that I could fly .
I jutted my right fist into the air , and launched into the sky .
My stomach dropped with the sensation of breaking gravity ’s bond , and the summer air cooled as I reached higher .
When the roads were so far below as to be an indistinct ashen blur , I halted and curled my legs under me as I was pelted by icy crystals of clouds , and surveyed all below .
There was a moment of idle indecision , but in the end it mattered not at all .
I picked a direction and dove .
The experience was one of my many brushes with Lucid Dreaming .
It is a phenomenon that many discredit , naming it a hoax and naturalist mythology despite the fact that it has strong scientific evidence supporting it as a real occurrence .
With a devoted training regimen , most anyone can learn to harness their own subconscious to experience surrealistic events and places .
In a controlled dream , one can pursue anything from the cessation of nightmares , to investigating problems , to engaging in sexual fantasies , to my personal choice⁠⁠ — jetting around the skies like Superman .
A lucid dream is one wherein the dreamer is aware they are dreaming without waking up , allowing them to deliberately participate in the dream ’s events .
Despite the stigma of being a new age fantasy , there is a historical record of lucid dreams dating back to the 5th century .
In the year 415 AD Saint Augustine , a Christian priest and philosopher , wrote of the dream of a man who was preoccupied with concerns of the afterlife and what it was like .
This man , Gennadius , dreamed that he was visited by a youth “ of remarkable appearance and commanding presence ” .
Gennadius followed the person , and was taken to a site that rang of singing that was “ so exquisitely sweet ” that it surpassed any in his experience .
St Augustine of Hippo
Gennadius woke , and figured the experience for merely a dream , possibly caused by indigestion .
The very next night , however , Gennadius dreamed again , and was again visited by the ( apparently ) androgynous young guide .
The guide asked if he was remembered , to which Gennadius replied “ Certainly ! ”
The young guide then asked Gennadius if their meeting had occurred in sleep or in wakefulness , and Gennadius replied , “ In sleep . ”
His guide told him , “ You remember it well ; it is true that you saw these things in sleep , but I would have you know that even now you are seeing in sleep . ”
The guide continued , “ Where is your body now ? ” And Gennadius answered “ in my bed . ”
Gennadius was therefore lucid⁠⁠ — aware that he was indeed dreaming , though there is no hint that he was controlling the dream .
Even without asserting his will on the dream state , Gennadius found answers to the problems plaguing his mind , and was satisfied with what he learned .
The eighth century saw the rise of the monastic order that devised The Tibetan Book of the Dead .
Some maintain that this group knew more about dreams and controlling them than we do today , but if that is the case , their book is woefully incomplete .
The book describes that when one dies , he will face experiences that result from his “ inner manifestations ” ⁠— things akin to dreams .
When one is faced with these experiences , to know that they are dreamlike grants the deceased an advantage in reaching enlightenment , and thus , hopefully , avoids rebirth .
To aid in this end , the monks developed a form of Yoga to help in understanding the death or dream phenomenon .
In 1867 a popular scientist named Marquis d’Hervey de Saint - Denys published his book Dreams and How to Guide Them , effectively demonstrating how anyone could learn the skills of lucid and controlled dreaming ⁠⁠— though that moniker did n’t emerge until 1912 .
One of our era ’s most popular discourses on lucid dreaming comes from the books by Jane Roberts , who created a series of books collectively titled The Seth Material .
Purportedly , it was created when Jane channeled a spirit named Seth , who spent his time returned to the corporeal world lecturing on dreams and death .
There seems little wonder that lucid dreaming has been labeled hopelessly new - agey .
Save for the work of Stephen LaBerge , the phenomenon of lucid dreams may have been condemned to remain in obscurity .
It was the year 1980 when LaBerge received his PhD in Psychophysiology from Stanford , but his interest in dreams and altered states of consciousness began in his childhood .
LaBerge had some lucid dreams of his own , and found it to be an interesting experience .
Armed with the knowledge that when a person dreams of a ping - pong game , his eyes will trace back and forth as if watching the ball , LaBerge went to sleep , and allocated the actual work to his trusty research assistant .
Before LaBerge began his doze , however , he and the assistant agreed on a signal that LaBerge would convey with his eyes .
The research assistant observed LaBerge ’s sleep , and verified that he had indeed entered a dream state , and then awaited the agreed upon signal .
After receiving the signal and having the polygraph record it a number of times , LaBerge took his results to the academic world .
At first there was general resistance to his theories .
One fellow scientist said “ there is no evidence that would make me believe [ in lucid dreams ] . ”
After noting the scientific irony in that statement , however , resistance slowly diminished , and experiments reproduced the same results around the country and the world .
Most everyone ’s had that one dream they want to go back to .
Those who are aware of their dreams can avoid nightmares , and those who control their dreams can do most anything .
Participants in scientific studies report an enhanced sense of accomplishment and general betterment of mood .
Some even call it life - changing .
There are several techniques that one can employ to achieve lucid or controlled dreaming , but broken down , there are really two basic schools .
Both require one to be able to recall his dreams fairly well , and in both cases children take to it easier than their adult counterparts .
The first is analogous to making a “ controlled entry ” into the dream , and is called the WILD ( wake - initiated lucid dream ) method .
In this technique one approaches dreams from a meditative state , and tries to hold to lucidity while slipping into the realms of the unconscious .
Most agree that this method is both more difficult and more frightening ; it is not uncommon to have feelings of floating above one ’s own body or sinking into the black depths of the mattress .
There can be bursts of vertigo or dizziness , and can seem somewhat akin to descriptions of Near Death Experiences .
The more widely accepted method is to come at the dream from the other end⁠⁠ — to engulf one ’s self in the dream , then try to gain lucidity .
This is done through the use of “ reality checks ” , and is called the MILD ( mnemonic induction of lucid dreams ) method .
Dreams diverge from reality in many ways , and many of them are fairly predictable .
One must get into habits in waking life that would highlight such differences .
If one gets into the habit of checking his watch twice in quick succession , in the waking world the time will be the same , whereas in dreams the time will generally be radically different .
Some pinch their noses and try to breathe through it ; the flesh nose will be unable to , but the dream nose can breathe unhindered .
The trick I made use of in my experiments was to several times a day ask : “ am I dreaming now ? ”
On the rare occasion that I decided I was dreaming , I would immediately take to the sky .
Some worry that there are dangers inherent to lucid dreaming , though there are none evident .
One can avoid unwanted dreams , practice that dreaded speech in a mental crowd , or play the guitar like a god , among other things .
Despite the axiom that “ one who dies in a dream dies in true life , ” there ’s nothing to fear⁠⁠ — if everyone who died in their dreams never awoke , who would there be to deliver these warnings to us ?
A little bit of normality returns to the French Quarter
Officials said the final death toll was 972 - substantially smaller than the 10,000 victims some feared .
The death toll in Mississippi remained at 221 , according to the authorities in the state .
Louisiana officials said more searches would be conducted by a private company hired by the state if someone reported seeing a body .
" There might still be bodies found .
For instance , if a house was locked and nobody able to go into it " , said a spokesman with the state 's Department of Health and Hospitals .
Back to school
Meanwhile , New Orleans is coming back to life .
School children went back to classes on Monday .
Thousands of people have return to the city in recent days , after the parts least affected by flooding from Katrina reopened .
New Orleans was devastated by the impact of Hurricane Katrina
The mayor , Ray Nagin , has established a commission to draft a rebuilding plan for New Orleans and has asked for tax breaks to help revive it .
The governor of Louisiana , Kathleen Blanco , urged President George W Bush and Congress to allow federal funding to help pay the regular salaries of city and county employees during the emergency period .
" Our local governments are recovering , but many are on the verge of financial collapse " , she told the press .
I recently wrote an article or two about distributed version control systems .
I ’ve been using Darcs since 2005 .
I switched to Darcs , in fact , 10 days after the simultaneous founding announcements of git and Mercurial .
Overall , I have been happy .
I continue to believe that it is the most distributed of the distributed VCSs , which is a Good Thing .
However , I have lately started having trouble with Darcs hanging while working on my Debian packages .
My post to the Darcs user list drew out a few other people whith this problem , which is a design flaw of Darcs .
So I revisited the VCS landscape .
I re-examined git , Mercurial , and bzr .
I eventually decided to give Mercurial a try .
I avoided git because I write some code that is portable to Windows , and git is n’t ( or is n’t very well ) .
Also , git is complex to pick up for me , and I certainly do n’t want to force something complex onto my contributors .
bzr seemed to still have some strange behaviors that it ’s had for awhile , and I could n’t find even one advantage of it over Mercurial .
So off I went with Mercurial .
I quickly learned a bit of a philosophical difference from Darcs to Mercurial .
Darcs avoids conflicts at all costs .
Mercurial makes handling conflict easy and , in many cases , automatic .
It is exactly this Darcs behavior that permits both is excellent “ darcs send ” feature ( still unmatched in any other VCS ) , but also causes its hang problems .
I found Mercurial quite pleasant to work with , and * fast * .
It seems to be edging out git in speed tests sometimes these days .
It is easy to get started with Mercurial .
The mq system — similar to quilt or other patch - management programs — is really quite an amazing hybrid between patch management and version control .
I frankly do n’t see any need for other patch - management tools anymore .
Mercurial has a “ patchbomb ” feature where you can select a range of changesets to send off , and it will generate nice emails with one changeset per email , and send them to your selected destination , optionally with an introductory message .
The normal way of interacting with other Mercurial users is via the hg export / import commands , which send around simple unified diffs plus some additional header information , optionally in the git extended diff format .
I am happy with Mercurial and am in the process of converting my Debian repositories from Darcs to Mercurial .
I ’m going to keep my personal code in Darcs for the moment because “ darcs send ” is still easier than “ hg email ” , but that may change before long , depending on how my experience goes .
I ’d encourage others to give Mercurial a try .
The community is also very nice and helpful .
I have contributed patches to Tailor to make it make exact copies of Darcs repos into Mercurial , which are now in its Darcs repo .
There is also a thread on the Mercurial list with some of my initial questions / concerns coming from a Darcs perspective .

Code coverage analysis is the process of :
Finding areas of a program not exercised by a set of test cases ,
Creating additional test cases to increase coverage , and
Determining a quantitative measure of code coverage , which is an indirect measure of quality .
An optional aspect of code coverage analysis is :
Identifying redundant test cases that do not increase coverage .
A code coverage analyzer automates this process .
You use coverage analysis to assure quality of your set of tests , not the quality of the actual product .
You do not generally use a coverage analyzer when running your set of tests through your release candidate .
Coverage analysis requires access to test program source code and often requires recompiling it with a special command .
This paper discusses the details you should consider when planning to add coverage analysis to your test plan .
Coverage analysis has certain strengths and weaknesses .
You must choose from a range of measurement methods .
You should establish a minimum percentage of coverage , to determine when to stop analyzing coverage .
Coverage analysis is one of many testing techniques ; you should not rely on it alone .
Code coverage analysis is sometimes called test coverage analysis .
The two terms are synonymous .
The academic world more often uses the term " test coverage " while practitioners more often use " code coverage " .
Likewise , a coverage analyzer is sometimes called a coverage monitor .
I prefer the practitioner terms .
Code coverage analysis is a structural testing technique ( AKA glass box testing and white box testing ) .
Structural testing compares test program behavior against the apparent intention of the source code .
This contrasts with functional testing ( AKA black - box testing ) , which compares test program behavior against a requirements specification .
Structural testing examines how the program works , taking into account possible pitfalls in the structure and logic .
Functional testing examines what the program accomplishes , without regard to how it works internally .
Structural testing is also called path testing since you choose test cases that cause paths to be taken through the structure of the program .
Do not confuse path testing with the path coverage metric , explained later .
At first glance , structural testing seems unsafe .
Structural testing cannot find errors of omission .
However , requirements specifications sometimes do not exist , and are rarely complete .
This is especially true near the end of the product development time line when the requirements specification is updated less frequently and the product itself begins to take over the role of the specification .
The difference between functional and structural testing blurs near release time .
The basic assumptions behind coverage analysis tell us about the strengths and limitations of this testing technique .
Some fundamental assumptions are listed below .
Bugs relate to control flow and you can expose Bugs by varying the control flow [ Beizer1990 p.60 ] .
For example , a programmer wrote " if ( c ) " rather than " if ( ! c ) " .
" rather than " " .
You can look for failures without knowing what failures might occur and all tests are reliable , in that successful test runs imply program correctness [ Morell1990 ] .
The tester understands what a correct version of the program would do and can identify differences from the correct behavior .
Other assumptions include achievable specifications , no errors of omission , and no unreachable code .
Clearly , these assumptions do not always hold .
Coverage analysis exposes some plausible bugs but does not come close to exposing all classes of bugs .
Coverage analysis provides more benefit when applied to an application that makes a lot of decisions rather than data - centric applications , such as a database application .
A large variety of coverage metrics exist .
This section contains a summary of some fundamental metrics and their strengths , weaknesses and issues .
The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has formal requirements for structural coverage in the certification of safety - critical airborne systems [ DO - 178C ] .
Few other organizations have such requirements , so the FAA is influential in the definitions of these metrics .
This metric reports whether each executable statement is encountered .
Declarative statements that generate executable code are considered executable statements .
Control - flow statements , such as if , for , and switch are covered if the expression controlling the flow is covered as well as all the contained statements .
Implicit statements , such as an omitted return , are not subject to statement coverage .
Also known as : line coverage , segment coverage [ Ntafos1988 ] , C1 [ Beizer1990 p.75 ] and basic block coverage .
Basic block coverage is the same as statement coverage except the unit of code measured is each sequence of non-branching statements .
I highly discourage using the non-descriptive name C1 .
People sometimes incorrectly use the name C1 to identify decision coverage .
Therefore this term has become ambiguous .
The chief advantage of this metric is that it can be applied directly to object code and does not require processing source code .
Performance profilers commonly implement this metric .
The chief disadvantage of statement coverage is that it is insensitive to some control structures .
For example , consider the following C/C++ code fragment :
int* p = NULL ; if ( condition ) p = &variable ; *p = 123 ;
Without a test case that causes condition to evaluate false , statement coverage rates this code fully covered .
In fact , if condition ever evaluates false , this code fails .
This is the most serious shortcoming of statement coverage .
If - statements are very common .
Statement coverage does not report whether loops reach their termination condition - only whether the loop body was executed .
With C , C++ , and Java , this limitation affects loops that contain break statements .
Since do - while loops always execute at least once , statement coverage considers them the same rank as non-branching statements .
Statement coverage is completely insensitive to the logical operators ( || and && ) .
Statement coverage cannot distinguish consecutive switch labels .
Test cases generally correlate more to decisions than to statements .
You probably would not have 10 separate test cases for a sequence of 10 non-branching statements ; you would have only one test case .
For example , consider an if - else statement containing one statement in the then - clause and 99 statements in the else - clause .
After exercising one of the two possible paths , statement coverage gives extreme results : either 1 % or 99 % coverage .
Basic block coverage eliminates this problem .
One argument in favor of statement coverage over other metrics is that bugs are evenly distributed through code ; therefore the percentage of executable statements covered reflects the percentage of faults discovered .
However , one of our fundamental assumptions is that faults are related to control flow , not computations .
Additionally , we could reasonably expect that programmers strive for a relatively constant ratio of branches to statements .
In summary , this metric is affected more by computational statements than by decisions .
This metric reports whether Boolean expressions tested in control structures ( such as the if - statement and while - statement ) evaluated to both true and false .
The entire Boolean expression is considered one true - or - false predicate regardless of whether it contains logical - and or logical - or operators .
Additionally , this metric includes coverage of switch - statement cases , exception handlers , and all points of entry and exit .
Constant expressions controlling the flow are ignored .
Also known as : branch coverage , all - edges coverage [ Roper1994 p.58 ] , C2 [ Beizer1990 p.75 ] , decision - decision - path testing [ Roper1994 p.39 ] .
I discourage using the non-descriptive name C2 because of the confusion with the term C1 .
The FAA makes a distinction between branch coverage and decision coverage , with branch coverage weaker than decision coverage [ SVTAS2007 ] .
The FAA definition of a decision is , in part , " A Boolean expression composed of conditions and zero or more Boolean operators . "
So the FAA definition of decision coverage requires all Boolean expressions to evaluate to both true and false , even those that do not affect control flow .
There is no precise definition of " Boolean expression . "
Some languages , especially C , allow mixing integer and Boolean expressions and do not require Boolean variables be declared as Boolean .
The FAA suggests using context to identify Boolean expressions , including whether expressions are used as operands to Boolean operators or tested to control flow .
The suggested definition of " Boolean operator " is a built - in ( not user - defined ) operator with operands and result of Boolean type .
The logical - not operator is exempted due to its simplicity .
The C conditional operator ( ? : ) is considered a Boolean operator if all three operands are Boolean expressions .
This metric has the advantage of simplicity without the problems of statement coverage .
A disadvantage is that this metric ignores branches within Boolean expressions which occur due to short - circuit operators .
For example , consider the following C/C++/ Java code fragment :
if ( condition1 && ( condition2 || function1 ( ) ) ) statement1 ; else statement2 ;
This metric could consider the control structure completely exercised without a call to function1 .
The test expression is true when condition1 is true and condition2 is true , and the test expression is false when condition1 is false .
In this instance , the short - circuit operators preclude a call to function1 .
The FAA suggests that for the purposes of measuring decision coverage , the operands of short - circuit operators ( including the C conditional operator ) be interpreted as decisions [ SVTAS2007 ] .
Condition coverage reports the true or false outcome of each condition .
A condition is an operand of a logical operator that does not contain logical operators .
Condition coverage measures the conditions independently of each other .
This metric is similar to decision coverage but has better sensitivity to the control flow .
However , full condition coverage does not guarantee full decision coverage .
For example , consider the following C++/ Java fragment .
bool f( bool e ) { return false ; } bool a [ 2 ] = { false , false } ; if ( f( a && b ) ) ... if ( a[ int ( a && b ) ] ) ... if ( ( a && b ) ? false : false ) ...
All three of the if - statements above branch false regardless of the values of a and b .
However if you exercise this code with a and b having all possible combinations of values , condition coverage reports full coverage .
Multiple condition coverage reports whether every possible combination of conditions occurs .
The test cases required for full multiple condition coverage of a decision are given by the logical operator truth table for the decision .
For languages with short circuit operators such as C , C++ , and Java , an advantage of multiple condition coverage is that it requires very thorough testing .
For these languages , multiple condition coverage is very similar to condition coverage .
A disadvantage of this metric is that it can be tedious to determine the minimum set of test cases required , especially for very complex Boolean expressions .
An additional disadvantage of this metric is that the number of test cases required could vary substantially among conditions that have similar complexity .
For example , consider the following two C/C++/ Java conditions .
a && b && ( c || ( d && e ) ) ( ( a || b ) && ( c || d ) ) && e
To achieve full multiple condition coverage , the first condition requires 6 test cases while the second requires 11 .
Both conditions have the same number of operands and operators .
The test cases are listed below .
a && b && ( c || ( d && e ) ) 1 . F - - - - 2 . T F - - - 3 . T T F F - 4 . T T F T F 5 . T T F T T 6 . T T T - - ( ( a || b ) && ( c || d ) ) && e 1 .
F F - - - 2 . F T F F - 3 . F T F T F 4 . F T F T T 5 . F T T - F 6 . F T T - T 7 . T - F F - 8 . T - F T F 9 . T - F T T 10 .
T - T - F 11 .
T - T - T
As with condition coverage , multiple condition coverage does not include decision coverage .
For languages without short circuit operators such as Visual Basic and Pascal , multiple condition coverage is effectively path coverage ( described below ) for logical expressions , with the same advantages and disadvantages .
Consider the following Visual Basic code fragment .
If a And b Then ...
Multiple condition coverage requires four test cases , for each of the combinations of a and b both true and false .
As with path coverage each additional logical operator doubles the number of test cases required .
Condition / Decision Coverage is a hybrid metric composed by the union of condition coverage and decision coverage .
It has the advantage of simplicity but without the shortcomings of its component metrics .
BullseyeCoverage measures condition / decision coverage .
The formal definition of modified condition / decision coverage is :
Every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once , every condition in a decision has taken all possible outcomes at least once , every decision in the program has taken all possible outcomes at least once , and each condition in a decision has been shown to independently affect that decision 's outcome .
A condition is shown to independently affect a decision 's outcome by : ( 1 ) varying just that condition while holding fixed all other possible conditions , or ( 2 ) varying just that condition while holding fixed all other possible conditions that could affect the outcome .
[ DO - 178C ] .
Also known as MC / DC and MCDC .
This metric is stronger than condition / decision coverage , requiring more test cases for full coverage .
This metric is specified for safety critical aviation software by RCTA / DO - 178C and has been the subject of much study , debate and clarification for many years .
Two difficult issues with MCDC are :
short circuit operators
multiple occurrences of a condition
There are two competing ideas of how to handle short - circuit operators .
One idea is to relax the requirement that conditions be held constant if those conditions are not evaluated due to a short - circuit operator [ Chilenski1994 ] .
The other is to consider the condition operands of short - circuit operators as separate decisions [ DO - 248C ] .
A condition may occur more than once in a decision .
In the expression " A or ( not A and B ) " , the conditions " A " and " not A " are coupled - they cannot be varied independently as required by clause ( 1 ) in the definition of MCDC .
Clause ( 1 ) is known as unique - cause MC / DC .
Clause ( 2 ) relaxes the independence requirement , and is known as masking MC / DC .
These two different versions of MC / DC are defined in more detail below .
For unique - cause MC / DC , a condition is shown to independently affect a decisions outcome by varying just that condition while holding fixed all other possible conditions .
For masking MC / DC , a condition is shown to independently affect a decisions outcome by applying principles of Boolean logic to assure that no other condition influences the outcome ( even though more than one condition in the decision may change value ) [ CAST - 6 ] .
This metric reports whether each of the possible paths in each function have been followed .
A path is a unique sequence of branches from the function entry to the exit .
Also known as predicate coverage .
Predicate coverage views paths as possible combinations of logical conditions [ Beizer1990 p.98 ] .
Since loops introduce an unbounded number of paths , this metric considers only a limited number of looping possibilities .
A large number of variations of this metric exist to cope with loops .
Boundary - interior path testing considers two possibilities for loops : zero repetitions and more than zero repetitions [ Ntafos1988 ] .
For do - while loops , the two possibilities are one iteration and more than one iteration .
Path coverage has the advantage of requiring very thorough testing .
Path coverage has two severe disadvantages .
The first is that the number of paths is exponential to the number of branches .
For example , a function containing 10 if - statements has 1024 paths to test .
Adding just one more if - statement doubles the count to 2048 .
The second disadvantage is that many paths are impossible to exercise due to relationships of data .
For example , consider the following C/C++ code fragment :
if ( success ) statement1 ; statement2 ; if ( success ) statement3 ;
Path coverage considers this fragment to contain 4 paths .
In fact , only two are feasible : success=false and success=true .
Researchers have invented many variations of path coverage to deal with the large number of paths .
For example , n- length sub - path coverage reports whether you exercised each path of length n branches .
Basis path testing selects paths that achieve decision coverage , with each path containing at least one decision outcome differing from the other paths [ Roper1994 p.48 ] .
Others variations include linear code sequence and jump ( LCSAJ ) coverage and data flow coverage .
Here is a description of some variations of the fundamental metrics and some less commonly use metrics .
This metric reports whether you invoked each function or procedure .
It is useful during preliminary testing to assure at least some coverage in all areas of the software .
Broad , shallow testing finds gross deficiencies in a test suite quickly .
BullseyeCoverage measures function coverage .
This metric reports whether you executed each function call .
The hypothesis is that bugs commonly occur in interfaces between modules .
Also known as call pair coverage .
This variation of path coverage considers only sub-paths that can easily be represented in the program source code , without requiring a flow graph [ Woodward1980 ] .
An LCSAJ is a sequence of source code lines executed in sequence .
This " linear " sequence can contain decisions as long as the control flow actually continues from one line to the next at run-time .
Sub-paths are constructed by concatenating LCSAJs .
Researchers refer to the coverage ratio of paths of length n LCSAJs as the test effectiveness ratio ( TER ) n+2 .
The advantage of this metric is that it is more thorough than decision coverage yet avoids the exponential difficulty of path coverage .
The disadvantage is that it does not avoid infeasible paths .
This variation of path coverage considers only the sub- paths from variable assignments to subsequent references of the variables .
The advantage of this metric is the paths reported have direct relevance to the way the program handles data .
One disadvantage is that this metric does not include decision coverage .
Another disadvantage is complexity .
Researchers have proposed numerous variations , all of which increase the complexity of this metric .
For example , variations distinguish between the use of a variable in a computation versus a use in a decision , and between local and global variables .
As with data flow analysis for code optimization , pointers also present problems .
This metric reports whether each machine language conditional branch instruction both took the branch and fell through .
This metric gives results that depend on the compiler rather than on the program structure since compiler code generation and optimization techniques can create object code that bears little similarity to the original source code structure .
Since branches disrupt the instruction pipeline , compilers sometimes avoid generating a branch and instead generate an equivalent sequence of non-branching instructions .
Compilers often expand the body of a function inline to save the cost of a function call .
If such functions contain branches , the number of machine language branches increases dramatically relative to the original source code .
You are better off testing the original source code since it relates to program requirements better than the object code .
This metric reports whether you executed each loop body zero times , exactly once , and more than once ( consecutively ) .
For do - while loops , loop coverage reports whether you executed the body exactly once , and more than once .
The valuable aspect of this metric is determining whether while - loops and for - loops execute more than once , information not reported by other metrics .
As far as I know , only GCT implements this metric .
This metric reports whether multiple threads execute the same code at the same time .
It helps detect failure to synchronize access to resources .
It is useful for testing multi- threaded programs such as in an operating system .
As far as I know , only GCT implements this metric .
This metric reports whether boundary situations occur with relational operators ( < , <= , > , >= ) .
The hypothesis is that boundary test cases find off - by - one mistakes and uses of the wrong relational operators such as < instead of <= .
For example , consider the following C/C++ code fragment :
if ( a < b ) statement ;
Relational operator coverage reports whether the situation a==b occurs .
If a==b occurs and the program behaves correctly , you can assume the relational operator is not suppose to be <= .
As far as I know , only GCT implements this metric .
This metric is similar to relational operator coverage but much more general [ Howden1982 ] .
It reports whether test cases occur which would expose the use of wrong operators and also wrong operands .
It works by reporting coverage of conditions derived by substituting ( mutating ) the program 's expressions with alternate operators , such as " - " substituted for " + " , and with alternate variables substituted .
This metric interests the academic world mainly .
Caveats are many ; programs must meet special requirements to enable measurement .
As far as I know , only GCT implements this metric .
This metric indicates whether each entry in a particular array has been referenced .
This is useful for programs that are controlled by a finite state machine .
You can compare relative strengths when a stronger metric includes a weaker metric .
Academia says the stronger metric subsumes the weaker metric .
Coverage metrics cannot be compared quantitatively .
Each project must choose a minimum percent coverage for release criteria based on available testing resources and the importance of preventing post - release failures .
Clearly , safety - critical software should have a high goal .
You might set a higher coverage goal for unit testing than for system testing since a failure in lower - level code may affect multiple high - level callers .
Using statement coverage , decision coverage , or condition / decision coverage you generally want to attain 80% - 90 % coverage or more before releasing .
Some people feel that setting any goal less than 100 % coverage does not assure quality .
However , you expend a lot of effort attaining coverage approaching 100 % .
The same effort might find more bugs in a different testing activity , such as formal technical review .
Avoid setting a goal lower than 80 % .
Choosing good intermediate coverage goals can greatly increase testing productivity .
Your highest level of testing productivity occurs when you find the most failures with the least effort .
Effort is measured by the time required to create test cases , add them to your test suite and run them .
It follows that you should use a coverage analysis strategy that increases coverage as fast as possible .
This gives you the greatest probability of finding failures sooner rather than later .
Figure 1 illustrates the coverage rates for high and low productivity .
Figure 2 shows the corresponding failure discovery rates .
One strategy that usually increases coverage quickly is to first attain some coverage throughout the entire test program before striving for high coverage in any particular area .
By briefly visiting each of the test program features , you are likely to find obvious or gross failures early .
For example , suppose your application prints several types of documents , and a bug exists which completely prevents printing one ( and only one ) of the document types .
If you first try printing one document of each type , you probably find this bug sooner than if you thoroughly test each document type one at a time by printing many documents of that type before moving on to the next type .
The idea is to first look for failures that are easily found by minimal testing .
The sequence of coverage goals listed below illustrates a possible implementation of this strategy .
Invoke at least one function in 90 % of the source files ( or classes ) .
Invoke 90 % of the functions .
Attain 90 % condition / decision coverage in each function .
Attain 100 % condition / decision coverage .
Notice we do not require 100 % coverage in any of the initial goals .
This allows you to defer testing the most difficult areas .
This is crucial to maintaining high testing productivity ; achieve maximum results with minimum effort .
Avoid using a weaker metric for an intermediate goal combined with a stronger metric for your release goal .
Effectively , this allows the weaknesses in the weaker metric to decide which test cases to defer .
Instead , use the stronger metric for all goals and allow the difficulty of the individual test cases help you decide whether to defer them .
Coverage analysis is a structural testing technique that helps eliminate gaps in a test suite .
It helps most in the absence of a detailed , up - to - date requirements specification .
Condition / decision coverage is the best general - purpose metric for C , C++ , and Java .
Setting an intermediate goal of 100 % coverage ( of any type ) can impede testing productivity .
Before releasing , strive for 80 % - 90 % or more coverage of statements , branches , or conditions .

The entire Bible would be more than 30,000 messages
" In da Bginnin God cre8d da heavens & da earth , " it begins .
The entire 31,173 verses can be downloaded for free and sent by mobile phone , said a spokesman for The Bible Society in Australia , Michael Chant .
" The old days when the Bible was only available within a sombre black cover with a cross on it are long gone , " Mr Chant said .
The Bible Society in Australia scripture director George Rodriguez said only the spelling of the Bible had been changed for the project , not the language .
" It 's a logical step .
Our aim at the Bible Society is to get the Bible out there among the people and this is a very effective way of doing it , " he told the French news agency AFP .
His son Michael spent six weeks translating the Bible into text messages .
There have been several attempts to make the Bible more accessible in recent years , including another Australian version which referred to the Virgin Mary as a " pretty special Sheila " , and one launched in the UK two weeks ago which its author claims can be read in less than two hours .
Lisp Operating System , Abstraction Kernel [ LOSAK ]
LOSAK is a Lisp operating system kernel implemented as a compiler .
LOSAK is also the name of the dialect of Lisp used .
This project is comprised of two parts : the LOSAK language , and an example operating system that is built on top of LOSAK .
The sample OS provides a multitasking read - eval - print loop .
The current release consists of this environment on a bootable CD image , along with all of the source code used to build the image .
Status
The LOSAK compiler / kernel is now feature complete , but may still warrant some performance improvements .
It provides pre-emptive multitasking , strict seperation of processes with per-process memory limits , real - time garbage collection , and a small standard library .
The example OS built on top of the LOSAK kernel is currently little more than a proof of concept .
Getting Started
Download the latest release from the the project page , and extract the iso image .
This is a bootable CD image suitable for running under qemu or bochs ( Or writing to an actual CD ROM ) .
So , for instance if you have qemu installed on Gnu / Linux , you can cd to the appropriate directory and run this command :
qemu - cdrom losak.iso
This will launch the OS inside an emulator window .
The release branch of the code is included on the CD image under the " src " directory .
You can also fetch the code from our source repository :
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/losak/code losak
You can then bootstrap the compiler from the source directory using the default target from the Makefile :
make
make tests
make bin/ kImage
qemu - kernel bin/ kImage

The US has launched air strikes against Islamists in southern Somalia , confirming the country 's status as a new frontline in Washington 's war on terror .
An AC130 warplane strafed the village of Hayo near the Kenyan border late yesterday afternoon , leaving " many dead " , according to the Somali government .
Ras Kamboni , on the country 's southernmost tip , was also said to have been hit .
Another air strike killed up to 31 people this morning near the town of Afmadow , 220 miles southwest of the capital , Mogadishu , according to local witnesses and officials .
The US attack helicopters were trying to kill Islamist militants , a Somali defence ministry official said .
The Associated Press cited witnesses as saying 31 civilians , including two newlyweds , had been killed in the strike , by two US helicopter gunships .
Reuters cited a local witness as saying between 22 and 27 people had been killed .
According to Pentagon officials , yesterday 's US targets included several alleged al - Qaida members suspected of organising the attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 .
It is not known whether Abu Taha al - Sudan - a Sudanese explosives expert who is thought to head al - Qaida operations in east Africa , and to have been the primary target - was among the dead , or whether there were significant civilian casualties .
The Somali government , whose legitimacy was challenged by the rise of the Islamic courts movement in June last year , said it supported the strikes .
The US had " a right to bombard terrorist suspects who attacked its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , " the Somali president , Abdullahi Yusuf , told journalists in Mogadishu .
Though the US has been mounting covert operations in Somalia in recent years , the attacks amount to its first direct involvement since the disastrous " Black Hawk Down " operation during the early 1990s .
After the strikes , the US navy confirmed it had moved the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower to join three other warships patrolling the Somali coast to prevent Islamist fighters from escaping by sea .
US planes were conducting " intelligence - gathering missions " over Somalia , a navy spokesman said .
The Islamists of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts ( SCIC ) , who took control of most of south and central Somalia during the latter half of 2006 , bringing in law and order for the first time in 15 years , were routed from their urban strongholds , including Mogadishu , by Ethiopian troops at the end of December .
Many fighters fled into the bush in the far south of the country .
The US tracked the Islamists ' retreat from its Combined Task Force headquarters in Djibouti , which was established as a counter - terrorism base after the September 11 2001 attacks .
Like Ethiopia , Washington accuses the Islamist leaders of both harbouring and being influenced by al - Qaida members - a view many analysts believed is exaggerated .
Besides Abu Taha al - Sudan , the US believes that Fazul Abdullah Mohammed , a Comorian , and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , a Kenyan - both of whom are both accused of terror attacks in Kenya - have been hiding in Somalia .
Initially the US tried to capture the men with the help of warlords who ruled Mogadishu from 1991 until the SCIC took control last year .
In 2005 , secret service agents paid the hated warlords several hundred thousand dollars as an incentive to apprehend the suspects who , according to Washington , were being sheltered by the Islamic courts that had been set up to dispense justice in the absence of a central authority .
But as news of the US operation leaked to the streets , residents took the side of the Islamists , and helped drive the warlords from the capital .
When Ethiopia sent thousands of troops in to back Somalia 's weak government against the Islamists at the end of last year , the US gave its tacit approval , but remained in the background .
Matt Bryden , a consultant to the International Crisis Group , based in Nairobi , said the US might now have decided to act directly because the Ethiopians were having trouble picking off the " last bubbles of Islamist resistance " near the Kenyan border , which is closed .
" They [ the Americans ] must have believed they knew where the al - Qaida suspects were .
It seems they decided to kill everything within a certain grid square and then find out what they had hit , " he said
He said reaction to the strikes within Somalia - a moderate Muslim country where many people resent outside interference - would depend on who had been killed .
" If no foreigners died , this will just be the latest element in a comedy of errors by the US and a step towards the new Iraq of Africa , " said Mr Bryden .
" But if there is proof of foreign al - Qaida members being killed , the US can say ' We told you so ' and Somalis may be OK with it . "
The AC130 plane that carried out the strikes , is understood to have flown from Djibouti , where 1,500 soldiers are based .
Unlike the unmanned Predator drone that killed an al - Qaida operative in Yemen - across the Gulf of Aden from Somalia - in 2002 , the gunship is not designed for surgical strikes .
First used in Vietnam , where it was nicknamed Puff the Magic Dragon , the converted cargo plane uses sensors to guide its heavy cannons .
Richard Cornwell , a senior research fellow at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria , said the strikes showed that cooperation between Ethiopia and the US over the Somalia incursion had been far closer than suspected , and was critical of the manner of the attack .
" The AC130 is an appallingly blunt instrument and I very much doubt it can be used to target individuals , " he said .
" To kill alleged terrorists regardless of collateral damage is highly hypocritical . "

Artists held back " not just because it was a bad career move , but because it would n't get any attention to buck the tide .
The tide turned when it was obvious the mission was n't accomplished , reasons proffered for war were proven false and casualties started mounting .
It is n't that it became safe ( to speak out ) , but the general mood in the country changed . "
Even if anti-war sentiment swells , Wendell doubts that one song will captivate the masses .

" The country was going to hell and nobody was saying anything , " Ament says .

Justin Sane of Anti-Flag says his snarling anti-war invective on For Blood and Empire is " speaking truth to power " and results from a strong belief in democracy , the Constitution and the duty to identify and confront injustice .
Airplay for Anti-Flag's The Press Corpse , a modern - rock hit , " would have surprised me two years ago , " Sane says , " but as more body bags come home and as people decide Bush is not telling the truth , I 'm not surprised .
People who supported the invasion three years ago are feeling frustrated . "
Anti-Flag felt pressure to retreat after 9/11 , when " there was a litany of insults , people told us to shut up , change our name , " Sane says , " Fear has been the best ally of this regime .
So very few artists put their necks on the line after the right - wing talk - show network made an example of the Dixie Chicks .
I feel honored to be part of a group that was unwilling to be bullied . "
The band , which registered 10,000 voters during the 2004 Warped tour , pushes its message on and off stage .
Its recently launched Military Free Zone helps high school students opt out of government - imposed recruitment drives permitted under the No Child Left Behind Act .
What does this have to do with music ?
Everything , Sane says .
" I got involved in activism after listening to bands like The Clash , " he says .
" Kids at our shows say they never cared about issues until they heard our band .
Music can be an effective tool in the political arena . "
Political music helped shape his world view , and Sane is certain the band 's songs have swayed fans , including soldiers .
Iraq is a high priority , largely because he feels impressionable youth are victimized .
" It 's simple logic for me , " he says .
" If this war was not about WMD , then what was it about ?
Follow the money and you 'll see war profiteering like never before .
I can't see young kids fighting for the benefit of a few very powerful individuals . "
Longtime musician / activist Michael Franti says he also felt the sea change of 9/11 , " when the whole nation had the wind knocked out of it , and a few in the government used this fear and pain to give us an ultimatum : ' You 're either with us or with the terrorists .
I thought , ' Ca n't there be somewhere in between those vast polar opposites before we go marching off to war ? '
Those who tried to say that were pounded down like a nail . "
The anxiety plaguing artists began abating " after Katrina , " Franti says .
" It lifted the wool off of the wolf .
People said , ' Wait , why are they literally starving in New Orleans when all the helicopters and resources are in Iraq ? '
I do n't think it 's the responsibility of any artist to make political art .
The responsibility is to make great art , and to find some truth .
If you look at the truth today , you can't be quiet . "
Two years ago , Franti went to Iraq , Israel and the Palestinian territories with a guitar and a video camera , a trip captured in a documentary , I Know I 'm Not Alone , and Yell Fire ! , an album of politically charged reggae , rock , rap and soul , both due July 25 .
The music is pointedly anti-war " but also lets people know they 're not alone , " Franti says .
" When I went to Iraq , I thought I 'd come back with a whole notebook of stop - the - war protest songs , but what I found from every person I met over there was that they wanted to hear songs that got them dancing or tender songs about a person they loved . "
Franti does n't expect his songs to bring home the troops .
" I do n't know if music can change the world overnight , " he says , " but I know it can help us make it through a difficult night , and sometimes that 's what we need to keep up the tenacity to make large shifts happen . "
Any good anti-war song has to be a good song first , says Paul Simon , whose mournful Wartime Prayers steers clear of headlines .
" The songs that last have to do with some universal theme , " he says .
" Those are always compassion , love , loss , sorrow , deep things that occur in the course of a lifetime .
Really topical songs have their moment in time in proximity to the event , but after a while , as the event recedes , so do those songs . "

US Politics Third Parties Fight for American Democracy
The time is long overdue for Americans to stop voting for candidates that can win , and start voting for those that should win .
By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published November 23 , 2006
A great democracy offers citizens sharp political choices .
That 's what gives political freedom meaning .
With two - party control of America 's political system , political options and discourse are stifled .
We badly need more visible third - parties that can fully participate and reach the public with information about their platforms and candidates .
In a nation that so worships competition it is hypocritical that there is so little political competition .
In truth , the Democratic - Republican partnership opposes competition .
They have convinced Americans that votes for third party candidates are " wasted . "
Yet the biggest wasted vote is for a Democrat or Republican that is almost certain to win or lose , and takes your vote for granted .
This year , even in the face of enormous public dissatisfaction with the two major parties , and a widespread belief that both are hopelessly corrupted by big money from corporate and other special interests , too many voters sheepishly picked from column D or R , even for sure winners or losers .
In this remarkable year of attention to many hot issues , especially political corruption and the Iraq war , voter turnout was just over 40 percent , no better than the previous midterm election .
One valid view of why 60 percent of eligible voters did not vote is that they saw little difference between the two major parties and , therefore , that their votes do not matter .
It 's a " they 're all a bunch of crooks and liars " belief , bolstered this year with so much evidence of crooks in congress and liars in the Bush administration .
Where supporters of Republicans or Democrats see different positions on issues , cynical citizens see nothing but campaign propaganda and civic distraction through divisive issues .
So they do not vote their conscience or for lesser - evil candidates .
Most have too little information about third party candidates to vote for them .
The untold statistical story is that a minor party could achieve political victory if half of the huge block of nonvoters chose its candidates , because major party winners typically have just a little more than half of the smaller voting block .
Major party candidates are cowards .
They do n't want to take stands that might cost them votes , but they do n't want to be publicly outed as the walking blobs of Silly Putty they are , either .
So , they erect difficult ballot access barriers to keep third party candidates out altogether , and when that fails they collude with their fellow Silly Puttians to , as best possible , exclude their third party opponents from the public discussion .
The Democratic and Republican Parties take no chances .
They have used their muscle to keep third party candidates out of public campaign venues , notably televised debates , and to create rules that make it difficult fort them to get on ballots .
As Tom Knapp correctly observed :
The two - party duopoly prefers lesser - evil voters , people considered as independents , moderates or swing voters that can be influenced by aggressive and generally misleading advertising to choose the least worse Republican or Democratic candidates .
Nor do the two majors really want a large voter turnout across the entire spectrum of political views .
They prefer to have well defined niche categories of voters that they can target .
Here is a wonderful perspective about third parties by Rick Gaber :
They give the otherwise ignored , used , abused , betrayed , disgusted , disappointed , frustrated , victimized , insulted , and / or outraged voter a chance to cast a vote without feeling dirty afterwards , a reason to go to the polls at all in the first place , and maybe even to come out of the voting booth feeling great !
In contrast to lesser - evil voters , third party voters proudly vote their conscience .
They know that the odds are totally against their choices winning .
Yet they do not stay home .
They are true believers in American democracy .
Their votes are strong messages .
They are more strategic voters with long term hopefulness about political reform , as compared to tactical lesser - evil voters hoping against reality that when the two - party pendulum swings to the other side something really good happens .
The 2006 Elections
The 2006 midterm elections showed the importance of votes for third party candidates who keep fighting for a place in the American political system , despite being intentionally disadvantaged by very little money and media coverage .
Consider the Democratic majority in the Senate .
Votes for third party candidates in three states were critical .
Much media attention went to Democrat Jim Webb 's win in Virginia by a relatively small number of votes , less than 9,000 .
As always , the media drummed up business by creating visions of a tight race between the two major party candidates , and ignored the third party candidate Gail Parker of the Independent Grassroots Party .
As an independent fiscal conservative she received over three times the number of votes that gave Webb the victory over Republican George Allen .
If just over one - third of those conservative voters had voted for Allen , the Democrats would not have a Senate majority .
As elsewhere , some conservative voters rebelled against the Republican Party .
The Montana senate race was also featured .
Democrat Jim Tester won over Republican Conrad Burns with less than a 3,000 vote margin .
The Libertarian Party candidate , Stan Jones , received over three times that margin .
So , if about one - third of those voters had gone Republican , the Democrats would not have a Senate Majority .
Generally , Libertarian candidates take votes away from Republicans , and certainly that was justified this year .
In Missouri , Democrat Claire McCaskill beat Republican Jim Talent with a margin of about 46,000 votes .
Frank Gilmour from the Libertarian Party received more than that .
He and Lydia Lewis from the Progressive Party of Missouri received some 66,000 votes .
So , if two - thirds of those voters had gone Republican , the Democrats would not have a Senate majority .
Frank Gilmour said this about his candidacy :
For far too long , our votes have been taken for granted ; we either vote for the lesser of the two evils or we do not vote at all .
My candidacy offers you a choice other than the two main parties .
I 'm not on the extreme left or the extreme right .
I live in the middle , and I believe that most of you feel the same way .
Our politicians give us partisan bickering instead of legitimate debate .
If you vote for me it will send a message to the two main parties that enough is enough !
Democrats owe a lot to those third party candidates and voters in those three states .
Republicans deserved what they got .
These three cases , as many other races in previous years , demonstrate that votes for third party candidates are not " wasted . "
Nor should such candidates be falsely labeled as " spoilers . "
The implication is that they intentionally want to toss the race to one of the major party candidates .
In truth , third party candidates believe in their mission to raise things neglected by the major parties .
They can attract people who would not otherwise vote .
They add integrity to our democracy .
If anything , their current underdog status provides a constant reminder of just how unfair the political playing field is .
They are not the problem .
Our status quo political system is the problem , because two - party rule has " spoiled " our democracy .
Libertarian candidate Garrett Michael
Hayes smartly put down the spoiler accusation this way ; " I 'm in this to win .
Whether or not that 's a realistic goal , I do n't care .
This country was founded by people whose goals sounded unrealistic at first . "
Though Democratic control of the House was a clearer victory , it should be noted that there were six races where votes for third party candidates exceeded the margin of victory .
In five of the six , the Republican candidate won .
Looking at a larger scale , how many Americans voted for third party and independent candidates in the Senate and House races ?
In the House races almost 1.6 million Americans went outside the two - party choices , and in the Senate races the total was almost 1.3 million conscience voters .
These numbers are typical of past elections .
Even though a majority of Americans expressed dissatisfaction with both major parties in many opinion surveys this year , they did not vote at all , were very motivated to get rid of Republican control by voting for Democrats , or did not know enough about minor party candidates .
Of the 33 Senate races , 26 had third party and independent candidates , or nearly 79 percent , with Libertarian Party ( the nation 's largest minor party ) candidates in 16 states and Green Party candidates in 9 cases .
In the 435 House races there were third party and independent candidates in 193 of them , or just over 44 percent .
Libertarian Party candidates were in 112 races and Green Party candidates were in 37 races .
Unsurprisingly , there was no winner .
Obscene Money Defeats Heartfelt Money
Shamefully , obscene amounts of money go to the two major parties , maintaining their grip on the system .
Paltry amounts go to third party candidates , mostly small contributions from individuals and financing from candidates themselves .
This makes it incredibly difficult for them to inform citizens about their positions and qualifications .
Usually , for senate races , major party candidates spend millions , while third party candidates spend in the low thousands .
In Montana , Jones spent less than $ 2,000 on his campaign , compared to $ 3.8 million spent by the winner Tester .
In Virginia , Parker raised just $ 1,200 in donations and financed much of her campaign through an $ 18,472 personal loan , compared to over $ 12 million raised by the loser Allen .
In California , Todd Chretien , a losing Green Party Senate candidate , raised $ 58,000 .
Recall that nearly $ 3 billion were spent by the two major parties on the congressional races this year .
In contrast , the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics found that the 74 federal third party candidates still in the running this election cycle raised a total of just $ 3.1 million , according to campaign finance data available Oct. 19 .
( This includes only those candidates who would be new to Congress and who have reported raising at least some money to the Federal Election Commission .
It excludes pseudo - third party candidate Joe Lieberman who raised about $ 15 million . )
That $ 3.1 million amounts to just one - tenth of one percent of what the major parties spent .
Those 74 candidates received 39 percent of their contributions from individuals , compared to less than 1 percent from PACs and 58 percent from their own pockets .
Note that Federal rules require candidates to file detailed reports of their contributions and expenditures if their campaign raises or spends $ 5,000 or more , which many third party candidates do not exceed .
Michael Badnarik , a Libertarian House candidate in Texas noted : " In order to win an election , not only do I have to convince voters I 'm the best candidate , I have to let them know I 'm a candidate at all . "
He raised more than $ 393,000 , the second - largest third party fundraiser remaining in the midterm elections .
In first place was Bruce Guthrie , a candidate for the Washington Senate seat , with $ 1.2 million , mostly his own money .
That leaves about $ 1.5 million for the other 72 candidates nationwide .
Into the Future
Despite the enormous challenges facing third - parties , there are two newer energetic efforts that merit attention .
One is the Populist Party of America .
Here is its general statement of purpose :
The Populist Party promotes , and strives for , Common Sense solutions ; Democracy as a tool to reign in the power of the federal government and ensure a greater responsibility of all public servants to the People .
Populism , as espoused by the Populist Party , is a federal system of government where the final check and balance on the power of the politicians is directly in the hands of the people ; with the Constitution and Bill of Rights serving as legal boundaries to protect the rights and liberties of all citizens .
The other effort is the Centrist Party .
Here is its mission statement :
To achieve common sense solutions that have at their heart , a tone of balance and fairness .
To create a strong foundation for mainstream America that is not prone to undue influence from left / right arguments .
To move away from character assassinations and toward solution oriented campaigns .
To empower people , and the vote , with a strong position not confused by one - sided agendas , or special interests .
To formulate policies and solutions that regard short , medium and long term considerations at all levels .
If more established third - parties have not attracted you , for whatever reason , you may want to look into these newer efforts .
What is really needed by third parties is a shift away from all the usual issues that the majors talk about .
Instead , what would resonate with the public is an emphasis on structural or systemic political and policy reforms to revitalize our democracy .
This requires acknowledgement that our system is broken , has become a plutocracy , and no longer serves ordinary people .
Something the majors can't admit , because they broke it .
Why fix a system that they control ?
Also , some collaboration among third - parties would be useful , such as working together at times to back a candidate to create a better chance of success .
This year , for example , Kevin Zeese was listed in many places as a Green Party candidate for the Senate from Maryland .
In fact , he also was backed by the Libertarian and Populist Parties and ran a " unity for change " campaign .
He reportedly had only about $ 60,000 to compete against the intense multi-million dollar campaigns of his Democratic and Republican opponents , so his message never reached many people .
This is how Zeese summarized the merits of having the backing of three parties and showed how they were not mutually exclusive but complemented each other :
The Populist Party stands for economic fairness for working families and recognizes how the U.S. has rigged our tax laws , finance system and corporate welfare to help the wealthiest while shrinking the middle class and undermining those whose work makes our country great .
The Libertarian Party emphasizes the central value of liberty - freedom - which is under attack in the United States with laws like the Patriot Act , eminent domain and a government that intrudes into private life .
We need to consider the question of liberty in every action the government takes because it is our basic freedoms that unleash the creativity , entrepreneurship and greatness of Americans .
The Green Party 's ten key values are a common sense outline of where our country needs to go .
These values include : grassroots democracy , social justice , ecological wisdom , non-violence , decentralization , community - based economics , feminism , diversity , responsibility and future focus .
What should the American public demand from the federal government ?
Besides a number of electoral reforms , the issue of money is critical .
We need a federal Clean Money / Clean Elections program .
It would provide competitive government financing of campaigns for candidates that voluntarily agree to take no other funds , except small contributions from individuals .
This approach has been successfully used in several states .
It not only opens up races to third party candidates .
It helps remove the corrupting influence of big money from corporate and other special interests , because honest major party candidates can also participate .
Now , third - parties are fighting a losing battle to improve the quality of our democracy and government .
For the good of our nation , they need our support .
A little publicized nationwide poll this past April by Princeton Survey / Pew Research Center reported that 53 percent agreed that we should have a third major political party .
What a worthy goal !
If the Democrats now in control of the Congress want to demonstrate their commitment to fighting political corruption and providing more incentives for Americans to vote , then Clean Money / Clean Elections should be aggressively pursued .
Will they voluntarily loosen their grip on our political system ?
Or do they fear stronger competition ?
The time is long overdue for Americans to stop voting for candidates that can win , and start voting for those that should win .
What lesser - evil voting has produced is entrenched two - party evil .
We can do better .
If we open our political marketplace to more competition .

Steve Jones has a blog post entitled Want to be cool ?
Learn REST .
Want a career ?
Learn WS where he writes
Out in the big wide world of the great employed of IT there are four dominant software players , these people represent probably the majority of IT spend in themselves and influence probably a good 95 % of the total IT strategy out there on planet earth .
Those four companies are SAP , Oracle , IBM and Microsoft .
These are the companies who your CIO goes to visit and sits through dinners and presentations on their product strategy , and what they are pushing is WS -* in all its ugly glory .
This means that in 3 years time you 100 % will have WS -* in your company , in a company you work with , or in a company you want to work with .
Sure you can argue that its harder and more difficult than REST , in the same way as you can argue that Eiffel , PHP or Ruby are more productive languages .
Some people will get to use these language commercially , some people will get to use REST commercially .
Everyone will have to use WS -* commercially if they want to interact with systems from the major software vendors .
I 'm not saying its right , just that its reality .
The best technology is n't the technical purest , the most productive or the easiest , its the one that the most people use and which has the widest acceptance and adoption .
For shifting data across the internet this means its what SAP , Oracle , IBM & Microsoft say , its also what the various vertical standards ( who the big boys aim to implement " out of the box " ) who have also all gone for WS -*.
The technical discussion is pointless , the commercial discussion is mute .
But hey lets continue having the discussion on REST v WS because it makes us feel cool and trendy .
Its about time that IT people realised that we need to have discussions based on commercial realities not on technical fantasies .
There 's a lot to disagree with in that short block of text .
I 'll go by the numbers
Contrary to what Steve Jones claims , folks at Microsoft are very interested in REST .
On the one hand , you have people like Yaron Goland who is driving the Web Services story for the Windows Live platform who has shown a lot of interest in RESTful Web services and even JSON as a data format in posts such as Thoughts On Creating An Infoset For Windows Live Services Platform .
You also have folks like Omri Gazitt who runs the group that is responsible for the Windows Communications Foundation ( aka Indigo ) looking at RESTful APIs like GData in his post XML -->
JSON Conversion in Google Data API and Doug Purdy who 's also in the WCF team who 's spending his downtime after shipping WCF v1.0 implementing the Atom Publishing Protocol which is a RESTful API .
Why would all these people at Microsoft be spending time looking at REST if they did n't think it was a worth investigating and adopting ?
Steve Jones 's post gives the impression that developers will need to " learn " WS -* because it may be deployed in their enterprise .
That seems quite unnecessary to me .
The WS -* family of technologies are intentionally so complex that developers are best served by knowing how their Web Services toolkit works instead of the gory details of how that particular Web services stack selectively or just plain incorrectly implements SOAP , WSDL , XML Schema , and the rest of the WS -* stack .
If you are a .NET developer then you just need to know how ASP .
NET Web Services and now WCF works .
If you are one of those poor souls who'll have to get disparate Web Services toolkits to interoperate with each other then stick to whatever the WS - I compliant mode is in your toolkit of choice when exposing services and pray that whoever exposes the services you have to consume has done the same .
I also disagree with the implication that the technologies with the widest acceptance and adoption for moving data across the Internet will be WS -* based .
Come on , the most popular Web service on the Web today is RSS / Atom feeds and that is as RESTful as it gets .
In fact , perusing a list of Web APIs exposed by companies I seem to see a lot more RESTful or Plain Old XML over HTTP APIs than I see APIs based on WS -*.
Perhaps Steve Jones meant to write intranet instead of internet ?
Finally , even if your company has drank the WS -* kool aid it does n't mean that RESTful APIs are anathema .
I 'm pretty sure that no one has drank the WS -* kool aid more than Microsoft but I still see a lot of AJAX [ client side Javascript calling back to RESTful or POX APIs ] and RSS feeds coming out of the company .
A lot more than I see SOAP APIs now that I think about it . :)
I recently saw the movie The Secret , a pseudo - documentary that explains The Law of Attraction .
There are things in this movie that need a rebuttal and I have n’t found one elsewhere – so here ’s mine .
The arguments and explanations put forward in The Secret are generally unscientific , mystical , nonsensical or just plain wrong .
But first , what is The Law of Attraction ( TLoA ) ?
Let ’s say you ’re poor and really want to be rich .
Instead of always complaining about being poor and always focusing on what you do n’t have , TLoA says that you should visualize yourself as rich .
See yourself in this situation .
Feel what you would feel if you were in that situation .
Then , somehow , money will come to you .
Simply stated , it is the belief that what you focus on is what you get ( or create for yourself ) , and there is some truth to that - but not for any of the mystical reasons claimed in this terrible movie .
These are my major beefs with the movie :
1 : The movie claims that famous people knew “ the secret ”
The movie indicates that a number of famous people knew “ the secret ” , including Einstein , Plato , Newton and Edison .
However , the movie offers no proof that any of these people knew of , agreed with or used the law of attraction .
2 : The movie claims that TLoA is kept secret
The movie also claims that the people in power in society and business have long known of this law and worked to keep it from the rest of us .
Scenes are shown of people being persecuted for trying to steal the secret and ( I assume ) bring it out to the rest of us .
No proof of this is offered and to the best of my knowledge , no conscious effort has ever been made to keep TLoA secret .
3 : The movie talks about electromagnetic waves / vibrations as the explanation for TLoA
The movie claims that since thoughts are electromagnetic waves , every thought we have spreads to and affects our surroundings , and this is why our thinking affects the universe .
The movie repeatedly shows people who , as they visualize their goals , generate a wave or signal that emanates from their heads .
In some of the cases , this wave is seen to spread over the entire Earth .
There are many things wrong with this assertion , primarily the fact that while thoughts are , at least in part , electromagnetic waves , there is no scientific indication that our brain waves alter the world around us in any meaningful way .
4 : The movie uses quantum flapdoodle .
Badly .
The movie also offers explanations from quantum physics as evidence of why TLoA works .
I happen to have studied a lot of quantum physics at university , and I can safely say that the explanations offered in the movie are a prime example of what Murray Gell - Mann called quantum flapdoodle , i.e. “ hijacking the terminology of modern science without understanding the underlying concepts or employing any of the intellectual rigour intrinsic to scientific inquiry ” .
5 : The movie claims that the universe will provide
But my greatest beef with the movie is the claim that whatever you sit down and imagine in this way , the universe will provide .
Almost as if the universe is a big vending machine : Insert sincere wish here , pull out cold coke ( or shiny new Ferrari ) here .
That seems to me to be a very mechanical , shallow , self - serving description of the universe .
The upshot
I believe that TLoA is sort of real .
But this is my point : Changing your thinking changes nothing out there , in the vast universe surrounding you .
It changes something inside of you .
Changing your perception , your focus , your emotions and your thinking from negative to positive ( from what you lack to what you want ) has an effect on your internal state – your motivation , energy and creativity and that ’s why you may then be more efficient working towards your goals .
It ’s that simple .
No electromagnetic waves emanate from your head , magically transforming the universe .
No mystical vibrations affect your surroundings .
Changing your thinking does not change the quantum states of objects around you in any reliable , useful way .
The universe does n’t stand ready to grant your every wish .
Rather , you change yourself and THEN you change your circumstances .
It works through a combination of entirely non-mystical , psychological and rational mechanisms , including confirmation bias and optimism .
The Secret offers precisely zero evidence that it could ever be otherwise , and instead proposes a number of mystical , unscientific and entirely unproved explanations .
That ’s why looking to this movie for explanations and insight will weaken your understanding of the TLoA and reduce your ability to successfully employ it .
So , while the law of attraction is real ( ish ) , “ The Secret ” , quite simply , is fake !
PS .
And do n’t get me started on What the Bleep do We Know – that one is even worse :o )
UPDATE :
I ’ve disabled comments on this blog post because I kept getting personal attacks from fans of The Secret .
If you ’re a believer in The Secret and you disagree vehemently with this post , I suggest you simply sit down and visualize a world where this article does n’t exist :)

They say money talks , and a new report suggests Canadian currency is indeed chatting , at least electronically , on behalf of shadowy spies .
Canadian coins containing tiny transmitters have mysteriously turned up in the pockets of at least three American contractors who visited Canada , says a branch of the U.S. Department of Defence .
Security experts believe the miniature devices could be used to track the movements of defence industry personnel dealing in sensitive military technology .
" You might want to know where the individual is going , what meetings the individual might be having and , above all , with whom , " said David Harris , a former CSIS officer who consults on security matters .
" The more covert or clandestine the activity in which somebody might be involved , the more significant this kind of information could be . "
The counter - intelligence office of the U.S. Defence Security Service cites the currency caper as an example of the methods international spies have recently tried to illicitly acquire military technology .
Nearly 1,000 ' suspicious ' contacts
The service 's report , Technology Collection Trends in the U.S. Defence Industry , says foreign - hosted conventions , seminars and exhibits are popular venues for pilfering secrets .
The report is based on an analysis of 971 " suspicious contact reports " submitted in fiscal 2005 by security - cleared defence contractors and various official personnel .
" On at least three separate occasions between October 2005 and January 2006 , cleared defence contractors ' employees travelling through Canada have discovered radio frequency transmitters embedded in Canadian coins placed on their persons , " the report says .
The report did not indicate what kinds of coins were involved .
A service spokeswoman said details of the incidents were classified .
As a result , the type of transmitter in play — and its ultimate purpose — remain a mystery .
However , tiny tracking tags , known as RFIDs , are commonly placed in everything from clothing to key chains to help retailers track inventory .
Each tag contains a miniature antenna that beams a unique ID code to an electronic reader .
The information can then be transferred by the reader into a computerized database .
Makes no sense
The likely need for such a reading device means the doctored coins could be used to track people only in a controlled setting , not over long distances , said Chris Mathers , a security consultant and former undercover RCMP officer .
" From a technology perspective , it makes no sense , " he said .
" To me it 's very strange . "
Then there 's the obvious problem : what if the coin holder plunks the device into a pop machine ?
" You give the guy something with a transmitter that he 's going to spend — I mean , he might have it for an hour , " Mathers said with a chuckle .
Harris speculates recent leaps in miniaturization could allow for a sophisticated transmitter capable of monitoring a target 's extensive travels .
" I think we can be pretty darn confident that the technology is there for the sorts of micro-units that would be required to embed these things in a coin , " he said .
" It 's a brave new world , and greatly concerning on so many levels . "
Passing the coin to an unwitting contractor , particularly in strife - torn countries , could mark the person for kidnapping or assassination , Harris said .
" You could almost , by handing a coin to somebody , achieve the equivalent of the Mafiosi 's last kiss on the cheek . "
The Defence Security Service report says employees of U.S. contractors reported suspicious contacts from individuals , firms or governments of more than 100 countries during the year .
Technologies that generated the most interest were information systems , lasers and optics , aeronautics and sensors .
A foreign approach often meant a simple request for information from the contractor .
Can contain built - in scanners
But the report also underscores clandestine means of acquiring secrets from U.S. employees , particularly those travelling abroad .
" It is important to recognize copiers and shredders can contain built - in scanners to copy the data . "
Other common methods include placing listening devices in rooms , searching hotel rooms , inspecting electronic equipment and eavesdropping on conversations .
The report , which first came to light in a U.S. newspaper , has since been posted on the website of the Federation of American Scientists , an organization that tracks the intelligence world and promotes government openness .
Judiciary Chairman Conyers to probe signing statements
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday February 1 , 2007
" Asserting that President Bushs frequent use of ' signing statements ' to interpret federal laws have allowed the executive branch to effectively thwart Congressional intent , House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) said Wednesday that his panel will launch a formal investigation into the practice , " the paid - restricted Roll Call reports Wednesday .
Excerpts :
#
The Michigan lawmaker said the investigation would include both Democratic and Republican staff and will focus on the approximately 150 signing statements issued by Bush , which the American Bar Association estimates have affected more than 1,100 provisions of federal law .
House Democrats have criticized the use of such statements , arguing that they not only undermine the separation of powers of the legislative and executive branches but also threaten legislative authority .
 All too often , the administration has engaged in these practices under a veil of secrecy .
This is a constitutional issue that no self - respecting federal legislature should tolerate ,  Conyers said .

Called Superbots , these robots are made up of identical modular units that plug into one another to create robots that can stand , crawl , wiggle and roll .
The robots are being developed mainly to carry out multiple complex tasks , such as assembly , inspection , maintenance , habitat construction , surface landing , and exploration in space and on planet surfaces .
Perhaps their paramount feature is flexibility :
The different modules can be connected to let a robot handle a variety of tasks , rather than have that robot dedicated to a single task .
The traditional approach of building separate robots for separate tasks is no longer adequate for affordable space exploration , researchers said .
In a statement Thursday , one of the Superbot developers , Wei-Min Shen of the University of Southern California 's Information Sciences Institute , said , " Each module is a complete robotic system and has a power supply , microcontrollers , sensors , communication , three degrees of freedom , and six connecting faces ( front , back , left , right , up and down ) to dynamically connect to other modules .
" This design allows flexible bending , docking , and continuous rotation .
A single module can move forward , back , left , right ; flip over ; and rotate as a wheel .
Modules can communicate with each other for totally distributed control , and can support arbitrary module - reshuffling during their operation . "
The Superbot project will be built on the first spiral of the development completed in the last decade with small - scale , earth oriented , self - reconfigurable prototype robots by the proposing team , with total support of more than US $ 8 million from DARPA , the Air Force Office of Scientific Research , the National Science Foundation and NASA .
Another goal of the Superbot is to let NASA reuse robotic components to reduce costs and simplify operations and the logistics trail .
The interchangeability of the robots ' components will decrease the need for redundant parts , thus reducing payload mass , and enhance mission reliability and safety by allowing robust reconfigurability in times of failure , said Shen in a white paper .
This story , " Super Robots Gear Up for Space " was originally published by Network World .
A US government - funded institute specialising in the analysis of security threats has found that rail tunnels connecting Manhattan to mainland NewJersey could be flooded within hours if they were attacked by even relatively small bombs .
The analysis , based on work by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and leaked to the New York Times , suggested that the network of tunnels was more vulnerable than had been thought .
A bomb that could be carried easily on to a train could make a 50 sq ft ( about 4.6 sq metre ) hole in the side of the tunnels and potentially breach both sides , the analysis found .
More than 1 m gallons of water would enter the tunnel every minute , putting at risk the lives of up to 900 passengers - the capacity of a crowded train .
About 230,000 people travel every day through four train tunnels that lie along the bed of the Hudson river .
The concerns over the fragility of these tunnels are thought to apply equally to several rail tunnels that connect Manhattan to Brooklyn and Queens under the East River .
According to the analysis , the tunnels are largely made of cast iron without further protective lining .
Only about a quarter of the length is reinforced with concrete or brick .
The New York Times said the report was leaked by an official who was anxious that not enough was being done to respond to its findings .
The threat of an attack on the underwater tunnels has been high on the agenda of security agencies for many years .
In July a plot to flood the system with the use of backpack bombs was allegedly uncovered and arrests were made in Lebanon .
The FBI said the plot was the " real thing " and that it had been intercepted by monitoring internet chat rooms .
The plan , according to investigators , was to place up to 20 suicide bombers in a single carriage of a train for maximum effect .
BREATHTAKING …. You have to give the hawks credit .
Here is Robert Kaplan on why George Bush will have trouble getting support for a war with Iran :
Though they may not admit it , the political elites beyond loyal administration circles , and particularly in Europe , simply do not trust Bush ’s ability to wage another war .
Here is where the real problem lies ; by delegitimizing his ability to wage war , they delegitimize his right to wage war .
That ’s a helluva triple gainer , is n’t it ?
The problem , apparently , lies not in the actual fact that Bush has prosecuted the Iraq war with astonishing incompetence , but in the fact that non-Republican “ political elites ” have peevishly decided to take note of Bush ’s performance .
Wow .
Believe it or not , though , it gets worse later on in the piece :
As someone who supported the invasion of Iraq , I know that the problem with grand assumptions is that they ’re nice when they succeed ; otherwise you require a Plan B .
The idea that there is no alternative to diplomacy in dealing with Iran , even after it achieves nuclear status , is another grand assumption , but without a Plan B .
The president and his hawkish enablers are rather plainly trying to maneuver the country into a position where military force will be the only plausible option available to us against Iran .
Not only do they have no Plan B , but they ’re actively trying to close off even the possibility of a Plan B in the future .
Is this a problem ?
You ’d think so , but in a breathtaking piece of table - turning chutzpah Kaplan declares that the real problem lies with those who are trying to keep our options open .
Apparently they suffer from the unforgivable stain of having been right about Iraq .
The plain fact is that military action is always a Plan B .
The Pentagon has multiple contingency plans for war against Iran , and those plans will continue to be updated and available to whoever is sitting in the Oval Office .
If , in the end , we truly feel that we have no other choice , military force will always be an option .
That ’s not a problem .
It ’s preemptively closing off all the other avenues that ’s the problem .
Hey There Stranger !
This post was written in 2007 , and contains some advice that may no longer apply .
This is my post popular article ever and has been viewed by more than a quarter of a million people .
Please stick around and visit the This post was written in 2007 , and contains some advice that may no longer apply .
This is my post popular article ever and has been viewed by more than a quarter of a million people .
Please stick around and visit the home page to see my new posts related to web design and tech .
I ’ve compiled a small list ( or rant ) of some very basic and fundamental rules that all webmasters must learn and respect when developing a website that needs to make actual money .
This list can also be used by companies looking to hire a web development firm or to evaluate an already deployed website project .
I ’ll start off slow and easy …
1. DO NOT resize the user ’s browser window , EVER .
I know you can , I know you feel really cool when you put that little Javacrap on your page and like a little miracle the browser window resizes to your wishes , but NO .
You see this atrocious web technique mostly with spam sites and when “ designers ” design websites .
That is , someone in the photo / video / art industry who “ also makes websites ” ( see # 6 for more on that ) , but in reality has no idea how to make a successful ecommerce website .
2 . If your website requires the visitor to load your home page , and then “ launch ” your real website in a pop up , YOU LOSE .
Pack it up , send it home , start over .
If your website does n’t load immediately on your home page and deliver your message within a couple of seconds it ’s pretty damn hard to keep people along for the show ( not matter how cool and Flashtacular it is ) .
I see this technique mostly with Flash web developers , who for some reason think all flash websites must load in a pop up window ( assuming it can get past pop up blockers ) , and have 30 second loading sequences and look curiously like 2advanced.net
3 . If your website asks the user which version they ’d like , high bandwidth or low , HTML or Flash , you ALSO LOSE .
See above for the explanation on this one as they ’re related .
It ’s like asking your customer if they ’d like to enter your crappy store or your better store ( but the ‘ better ’ store requires special glasses and a little 30 second wait …um NO THANKS ) , what you ’re really asking them is “ do you want to leave and buy from my competitor because I ’ve put up a crappy roadblock before you even know what I sell ? ” .
4 . If your website is ALL Flash , FIRE your web development company , and if you made it , add it to your portfolio under “ Useless web projects I ’ve done ” and start over .
Flash it just a tool , a wonderful powerful tool for delivering animation , video , interfaces , shopping carts , functionality etc . the list goes on , it kicks ass .
This DOES NOT MEAN you need to create your entire website in Flash , and if you do you will be at a severe disadvantage to your wiser competitors .
Look at it this way , even Macromedia / Adobe , the maker of Flash does n’t have an all Flash website , do you think there ’s a reason why ?
Oh yeah , they want to make actual money and do n’t listen to ‘ designers ’ .
5. DO NOT try to reinvent the website navigation .
Put it on the top , the left , hell even the right will work but do not try to reinvent the way people interact with digital interfaces while trying to actually sell your product or service .
People will get confused , then annoyed , then pissed , then gone .
6 . This one is going to get me in trouble .
If you are a print designer , and “ do websites on the side ” , STOP DOING websites and providing “ advice ” to your print clients about web design .
Print design to web design is like designing an ad for a race car , and actually building and racing that race car .
Do n’t get me wrong , print is great and all , you make pretty pictures and wonderful messages crafted with great copy , but when it comes down to it , it ’s still just a picture .
People cannot buy the product with a print ad ( yet ) , they ca n’t communicate with your business through a print ad .
I can already hear the grumbling coming from the print world , and look , it ’s not that I do n’t see a purpose for print advertising , just stick to print and do n’t nose you ’re way into a medium which you do not know and would n’t understand ( same goes for general “ geeks ” who do websites ‘ on the side ’ )
7 . If you do not have sufficient copy , or any REAL TEXT on your home page ( not in an image ) , and to a lesser extent your whole site , hire a copywriter and fire your webmaster NOW .
Content is King , repeat after me CONTENT IS KING .
Search engines do n’t index fancy graphics and Flash , they index text .
Good ol’ reliable text .
If you do n’t know how much text , or how to write good text , hire somebody who does ( it ’s essential to your ranking and to selling your product or service ) .
8 . If your website does not work in Firefox , welcome to 2007 DUMBASS .
Yes in most markets Firefox only commands at most a 10 - 15 % market share , but for some sites it ’s much higher ( my other site Oomny.com has 80 % Firefox users ) .
Furthermore , if the morons you hired did n’t make your site and functionality compatible with Firefox they obviously have no idea what they ’re doing , and are n’t up on their game .
I have no idea why you would need a website , or functionality system that is so dependent on IE that it simply can’t work in Firefox , and frankly it does n’t matter because there is no good reason .
The lack of Firefox knowledge by a webmaster shows they are n’t of the Internet culture , and that ’s a bad sign if you ’re a business owner .
9 . Commandment 9 is a collection of small issues that have been beaten to death other places , and are quote common principles , but bear repeating .
No blinking text , no Frontpage , no pop-ups ( even requested ) , no scrolling text , no font downloads , and no Flash intros .
If your product or service needs a flash intro to sell , it probably sucks .
10 .
If you use music on your site make sure the user can stop it , and it BETTER NOT start on page load without the user requesting it .
Same goes for video with audio ( * cough ESPN * cough ) , many web users surf from work and do n’t enjoy their speakers lighting up with your horrible and intrusive taste in music while their boss roams the halls looking for some ass to bust .
11 . Text navigations are better than images , this is n’t a big deal but it ’s better to use text for your nav with some clever CSS , than to export a large and bloated mouseover image navigation .
I know Dreamweaver makes it so super simple , but you ’ll benefit in a lot of other ways without it .
Images wisely used , just like Flash are excellent , but do n’t rely always on mouseover graphics to deliver your image , design is more about content than designing the interface ( do you know any of your friends that raves about the iPods elegant interface ?
No , and that ’s the point , it just works )
12 . A well thought out site map with logical sub sections is better than using “ drop downs ” .
Simply put , drops downs never work quite right , and only a few of the ones I have seen actually are usable .
Furthermore , the use of drop downs usually means that the person organizing the content did a piss poor job of it .
If you have the mother of all sites and need people to access hundreds of pages , you ’re probably Microsoft or CNET and you ’re ignoring me anyways .
13 .
If your site needs a search engine for users to find information , it ’s time to start over and fire the guy who came up with the site map ( and those slick drop downs on your nav ) .
Search engines are wonderful , and play a great role on some great sites , but if you lean on it for users to find content you ’re pissing 50 % + of your customers off .
Some people like to browse , they also like to search if they NEED to .
Give them a logical browse option and they wo n’t need to search , but leave search there for the advanced users really digging into your vast amount of content ( and you do have LOTS of content to be indexed right ?
If not see # 7 )
14 . Load time is still a factor for over 50 % of American web surfers .
Even though you live in the wonderful world of Cable and DSL , half of America does not and hates you for it .
If you design your site for only broadband users you ’re sending a message , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ Every other customer can bite meÃ¯Â¿Â ½?.
Bloat is simply NOT ALLOWED on the home page , but it can be used deeper in when users request it specifically .
15 .
This one seems obvious but is n’t to some people * cough Designers * cough .
Do not HIDE your message , and do n’t OBSCURE what you want the user to do .
Home page design is like a billboard , hit them with a message and a desired path ( buy now ) in 1 - 2 seconds , but provide information for people who want to dig deeper and research .
16 .
If you lead the user through a pre-determined path in order to deliver a message or demo , it ’s time to get an ANT farm and take your controlling wills out on some species that will actually like it .
The web is about modular content , it ’s not an “ experience ” or a “ wonder tour of magical enchantment ” .
If you have to have a slideshow , put thumbnails there too so people can get the content they want when they want it .
If you ’re demo has 20 pages , give them a table of contents or at least some next / previous buttons so they can fast forward ( they ’d be wathcing broadcast TV if they wanted content shoved down their throats at a pace decided by the man ) .
Pushing people through a demo , no matter how complex 1 step at a time is a mistake and will lead to the inevitable ; annoyance .
And if you ’re purpose of reloading the page to deliver the next slide in a slide show is to increase your ad impressions , you should DIE ( see SI.com , Time.com and CNN )
17 .
If you ’re delivering video , it better not ask the user which bandwidth or version of video they ’d like .
Real Player , 100K , Windows Media Player , Quicktime , WMV , 300K , AVI , Cable , DSL , Dial - Up ? NO THANK YOU .
Deliver your video in an embedded player in Flash .
I ’m sorry , Flash won this battle a long time ago ( see YouTube ) , it has the install base , the lean interface and is n’t trying to get you to join “ their world ” of media player fantasy where they place system tray icons and launch helpers and pop up every time you pop in a CD or DVD .
Flash is cross platform and cross browser compatible , something none of the other providers can say .
18 . This is a small one , but if the user has to mouse over your graphic or small image to know what it is , or where it will take them if its a link , quit your job and be a magician or a blackjack dealer , making web interfaces is not for you .
19 .
This final commandment is related to many of the above ideas , and is a good guiding principle for web geeks that are excited about new tech and want to use it .
Just because a technology is new , or you just discovered it does not make it suitable to put on a business website , JUST BECAUSE you can .
This happened with Flash , Java , and is now happening with AJAX .
Yes new technology is cool , but only integrate it on a business site if it improves the customers experience or sells more product / service .
Technology for the sake of technology is silly and only belongs on your personal show - off site , or your own computer where not one will be exposed to its horrid creativity except you .
—
One might say that if you followed all of my commandments , the web would be a boring , dry and conformist web of sites only engineered for 1 thing ; selling .
And you ’re right , but thankfully the world is full of plenty so called “ creative ” people and they keep it interesting for the rest of us .

cartooncorpse and jcs on Reddit.com suggested 4 more :
1 . Do n’t link to PDF content without disclosing the link .
2 . Do n’t employ any scripts to prevent the user from “ Backing ” out of the site with the browser ’s back button .
Ever try locking someone in your store ?
do they usually buy something ?
3. if your website says “ you ’re ” where it should say “ your ” , you should fire the person that wrote it .
4 . If your website has LOTS of random words in all capital LETTERS because the author was TRYING to emphasize words without the or tags that were created for exactly this purpose , he should be fired .
5 . It goes without saying but Taladar suggests ;
No pop ups and no javascript links ( breaks open in new tab ) .
In last year ’s last - minute tax bill , the “ frivolous filing ” penalty was increased from $ 500 to $ 5,000 and expanded to apply not only to “ frivolous ” arguments made when filing a tax return , but to arguments made at other times , such as when requesting a collection due process hearing , an application for an installment agreement , an offer - in - compromise , or a Taxpayer Assistance Order .
Mostly this is of concern to people making the various constitutionalist tax protester arguments , which the IRS pretty much universally considers to be frivolous .
However , occasionally conscientious tax resisters get caught up in this as well .
A good policy to follow if you want to avoid this penalty is to keep your arguments about why you are not paying taxes or should not be required to pay all or some portion of your taxes separate from any official interaction with the IRS concerning your tax return or their attempt to collect from you .
In other words , if you do not want to risk getting hit with a penalty , do not write a note on your 1040 form explaining why you ’re not including a check and do not request a collection due process hearing to discuss the Nuremberg Principles or anything of that sort .
If you are eager to explain to anyone at the IRS why it is that you ’re resisting taxes , why it should be legal to do so , or why you think it is legal to do so , make your arguments separately from any official correspondence concerning your tax returns and make your arguments general ones so that the IRS will not interpret them as legal positions you are taking regarding your particular return .
That might not be enough to satisfy them , though , so be aware of the risks if you tilt at that particular windmill .
The IRS position , of course , is that conscientious tax resistance has no legal justification .
They spelled this out most explicitly in Revenue Ruling 2005 - 20 .
Providence , RI --
While public perception may frame surfing as a dangerous sport , new research begs to differ .
In the first study of its kind , researchers have computed the rate of injury among competitive surfers and found they are less prone to harm than collegiate soccer or basketball players .
Led by researchers at Rhode Island Hospital and Brown Medical School , the findings of the study are published in the January 2007 issue of the American Journal of Sports Medicine .
" We found that competitive surfing has a relatively low risk of injury - 6.6 significant injuries per 1,000 hours of surfing - compared to other sports for which comparable data is available , " says lead author Andrew Nathanson , MD , an emergency medicine physician with Rhode Island Hospital 's Injury Prevention Center .
" However , the risk of injury more than doubled when surfing in large waves or over an area with a hard bottom . "
The sport of surfing has rapidly grown in popularity since the 1960's , but little is known about surfing injuries - especially the relative frequency , mechanisms and risk factors .
Nathanson and his research team collected injury data from 32 surfing contests worldwide , both professional and amateur .
Documentation of every acute surfing injury sustained during competition was recorded , as well as wave size , mechanism of injury and treatment .
" Significant " injuries were qualified as those that prevented the surfer from surfing for one or more days , resulted in a hospital visit , or required on - site suturing .
" Sprains and strains to the lower extremities , particularly the knees , were found to be the most common injuries reported .
This is likely due to the aggressive turning and aerial maneuvers , which score highly in competitions , but also appear to place high stress on a surfer 's knee , " says Nathanson , who is also an emergency physician at The Miriam Hospital and an assistant professor at Brown Medical School , both in Providence , RI .
In contrast , previous studies conducted by Nathanson researching the injuries of recreational surfers found that lacerations and contusions were the most common reported injury - these were the second most common injury among contest surfers .
Most of these injuries were caused by direct contact between a surfer and a surfboard - either their own or another surfer's .
" The fact that cuts were found to be less common among surfers during a competition makes sense since it's a more controlled environment compared to a recreational surfing - type atmosphere .
In competitions , there are a limited number of surfers in the water during each heat and the skill level is very high .
On the other hand , recreational surfers are often trying to catch waves in a dense crowd of surfers of varying abilities , " says Nathanson .
The authors note that although age and gender had no bearing on the injury rate , wave size and bottom type , independently , were significantly associated with a great chance of injury .
" It would come as little surprise to most surfers that the injury rate more than doubles when surfing in larger surf ( overhead ) compared to smaller waves , as the energy of waves increases as it grows in height .
In addition , a sea floor with a sandy bottom is much more forgiving upon impact than one covered with reefs or rocks , " says Nathanson .
The paper cites that establishing an injury rate for surfing is not just of academic or general interest , but also has implications for the insurance industry and for schools that may want to start a surfing team .
" The information could also help to predict the needs of medical staff support at contests and aid in the design of safer surfboards and protective equipment such as helmets , " Nathanson adds .
To reduce the risk of injury while surfing , Nathanson suggests good physical fitness , seeking local knowledge before paddling out to an unfamiliar break , and being realistic in terms of your ability level and the size of the waves .
Further research is needed to determine if an injury rate can be calculated for recreational surfers and to evaluate the effectiveness of modifications in surfing equipment on reducing the incidence of injury .

SECTION 1 | This manifesto is based on The Bootstrapper ’s Bible , a book I wrote a few years ago .
What I ’ve done is divided it into short sections , so you can find the little kernel of insight you need , when you need it .
( I hope ! )
The Joy of Small
What ’s a Bootstrapper ?
Well , since you bought this manifesto , chances are that you qualify !
For me , a bootstrapper is nʼt a particular demographic or even a certain financial situation .
Instead , itʼs a state of mind .
Bootstrappers run billion - dollar companies , nonprofit organizations , and start - ups in their basements .
A bootstrapper is determined to build a business that pays for itself every day .
In many ways , it ʼs easiest to define a bootstrapper by what she isnʼt : a money - raising bureaucrat who specializes in using other peopleʼs money to take big risks in growing a business .
Not that thereʼs anything wrong with that …
You can use the information in this manifesto to make any company more focused , more efficient , and more grassroots .
Throughout this manifesto , though , Iʼll be primarily addressing the classic bootstrapper : entrepreneurs who are working their butts off to start a great business from scratch with no ( or almost no ) money .
At last count , there were several million bootstrappers in this country , with another few million wannabes , just waiting for the opportunity .
My goal is to give you enough insight and confidence that youʼll get off the bench and make it happen .
The Bootstrapper ’s Manifesto
TAPE THIS TO YOUR BATHROOM MIRROR AND READ IT OUT LOUD EVERY NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED :
am a bootstrapper .
I have initiative and insight and guts , but not much money .
I will succeed because my efforts and my focus will defeat bigger and better - funded competitors .
I am fearless .
I keep my focus on growing the business — not on politics , career advancement , or other wasteful distractions .
I will leverage my skills to become the key to every department of my company , yet realize that hiring experts can be the secret to my success .
I will be a fervent and intelligent user of technology , to conserve my two most precious assets : time and money .
My secret weapon is knowing how to cut through bureaucracy .
My size makes me faster and more nimble than any company could ever be .
I am a laser beam .
Opportunities will try to cloud my focus , but I will not waver from my stated goal and plan — until I change it .
And I know that plans were made to be changed .
I ’m in it for the long haul .
Building a business that will last separates me from the opportunist , and is an investment in my brand and my future .
Surviving is succeeding , and each day that goes by makes it easier still for me to reach my goals .
I pledge to know more about my field than anyone else .
I will read and learn and teach .
My greatest asset is the value I can add to my clients through my efforts .
I realize that treating people well on the way up will make it nicer for me on the way back down .
I will be scrupulously honest and overt in my dealings , and wo n’t use my position as a fearless bootstrapper to gain unfair advantage .
My reputation will follow me wherever I go , and I will invest in it daily and protect it fiercely .
I am the underdog .
I realize that others are rooting for me to succeed , and I will gratefully accept their help when offered .
I also understand the power of favors , and will offer them and grant them whenever I can .
I have less to lose than most -- a fact I can turn into a significant competitive advantage .
I am a salesperson .
Sooner or later , my income will depend on sales , and those sales can be made only by me , not by an emissary , not by a rep .
I will sell by helping others get what they want , by identifying needs and filling them .
I am a guerrilla .
I will be persistent , consistent , and willing to invest in the marketing of myself and my business .
I will measure what I do , and wo n’t lie about it to myself or my spouse .
I will set strict financial goals and honestly evaluate my performance .
I ’ll set limits on time and money and wo n’t exceed either .
Most of all , I ’ll remember that the journey is the reward .
I will learn and grow and enjoy every single day .
TRUE STORY 1 :
I AM A LASER BEAM
The big call came just a few months after Michael Joaquin Grey and Matthew Brown had started up their toy company .
Would the two San Francisco bootstrappers like their product included in the movie marketing blitz for The Lost World ?
Nope , said Grey and Brown , who preferred to stick with their vision of gradually building a market for Zoob , their plastic DNAlike building toy .
What the bootstrappers feared was a loss of identity .
If they hooked up with the celluloid dinosaurs , theyʼd be seen as just another Jurassic spinoff .
On their own , they could create a separate brand and not only avoid extinction but create their own world .
Eventually , the two even hope to have their own Zoob movies .
TRUE STORY 2 :
THE BOOTSTRAPPER IS HERE FOR THE LONG HAUL
Jheri Redding started not one , but four companies .
And when the renowned bootstrapper died at 91 in 1998 , all four — including the first , Jheri Redding Products , begun in 1956 — were still in operation .
Howʼd he do it ?
Redding created lasting businesses through the combination of a gift for spotting long - term opportunity and his relentless drive to create significant competitive advantages in product features and distribution clout .
The Illinois farm boy became a cosmetologist during the Great Depression because he saw hairdressers prospering and farmers failing .
He soon began experimenting with shampoo formulas and showed remarkable flair for innovation .
Redding was the first to add vitamins and minerals to shampoos , the first to balance the acidity of the formulas , and the first to urge hairdressers to supplement their haircutting income by selling his products on the slow days of Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday .
The first ?
Yes , and also the last .
There arenʼt many like Jheri Redding , who also founded Redken ( 1960 ) , Jhirmack ( 1976 ) , and Nexxus Products ( 1979 ) .
Redding was …the first to urge hairdressers to supplement their haircutting income by selling his products on the slow days .
TRUE STORY 3 :
I WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT MY FIELD THAN ANYONE ELSE
When Yves Chouinard starting scaling mountains , rock climbers used soft cast - iron pitons that had to be discarded after a single use .
Chouinard , who was as passionate about climbing peaks as he was about his work as a blacksmith , designed a new piton of aircraft - quality chrome - molybdenum steel .
The tougher , reusable piton met climbers ʼ needs much better and became an instant success .
As piton sales climbed , Chouinard himself kept climbing too , as much or more than ever .
He recalls , “ Every time I returned from the mountains , my head was spinning with ideas for improving the carabiners , crampons , ice axes , and other tools of climbing . ”
It ʼs been 40 years since the blacksmith - climber hammered out his first steel piton .
Since then , it and his many other designs have become the foundation for Patagonia Inc. , a $ 100 million outdoor apparel company based in Ventura , California .
Although heʼs now a highly successful businessman , Chouinard still climbs regularly , testing his companyʼs new products while honing its most important tool : his own matchless knowledge of climbers ʼ needs .
TRUE STORY 4 :
I AM A SALESPERSON
Shereé Thomas had a personal question in mind when she called the customer service line of the company that makes Breathe Right nasal strips .
But when she found herself talking to the companyʼs medical director , she went beyond her question and revved up a sales pitch for a liquid she had invented that neutralizes the smell of cigarette smoke on clothes and hair .
A couple of switchboard clicks later , Thomas was on the line with the companyʼs president .
And three weeks after that , the company had signed a licensing agreement to invest $ 4 million to manufacture , market , and distribute Banish , the product Thomas mixed up in her chemist - grandfatherʼs garage .
Through the licensing deal , this Cedar Park , Texas , bootstrapper will rack up around six figures in annual royalty payments .
Her investment in the sale : a phone call to the companyʼs toll - free line — and a personal commitment never to stop selling .
TRUE STORY 5 :
THE JOURNEY IS THE REWARD
Charles Foley was 18 when he told his mother he expected to invent things that would be used everywhere .
At 67 , the inventor has 130 patents to his credit , including one for the venerable party game Twister , which he invented in the 1960s and still sells today .
But Foley , of Charlotte , North Carolina , is still at the inventing game .
He recently revived a discovery of his from the 1960s , an adhesive - removing liquid , and sold the rights to make and market it to a company headed by his son .
Heʼs also working on new designs for fishing floats and a home security system .
Driven to search for success ?
Hardly .
Foleyʼs just following his bootstrapping nature on a journey that ʼs lasted a lifetime .
“ I was born with a gift , ” he shrugs .
“ Ideas pop into my head . ”
WHAT’S A BIG COMPANY GOT THAT YOU HAVEN ’T GOT ?
Most of the companies you deal with every day , read about in the media , or learn about in school are companies with hundreds or thousands of employees .
They have an ongoing cash flow and a proven business model .
( Iʼll explain what that is in the next chapter . )
Because this is the way youʼve always seen business done , itʼs easy to imagine that the only way to run a business is with secretaries and annual reports and lawyers and fancy offices .
Of course , this isnʼt true , but itʼs worth taking a look at the important distinctions between what they do and what you do .
Just as playing table tennis is very different from playing Wimbledon tennis , bootstrapping your own business is a world apart from running IBM .
You need to understand the differences , and you need to understand how you can use your size to your advantage .
Traditional companies succeed for a number of reasons , but there are five key leverage points that many of them capitalize on .
1 DISTRIBUTION .
How is it that Random House publishes so many best - selling books , or Warner Music so many hit records ?
Distribution is at the heart of how most businesses that sell to consumers succeed .
In a nutshell , if you canʼt get it in the store , it wonʼt sell .
Companies with a lot of different products can afford to hire a lot of salespeople .
They can spread their advertising across numerous products and they can offer retailers an efficient way to fill their stores with goods .
Traditional retailers want the companies that sell them products to take risks .
They want guarantees that the products will sell .
They want national advertising to drive consumers into the store .
They insist on co-op money , in which the manufacturer pays them to advertise the product locally .
That ʼs why Kelloggʼs cereals are consistently at the top of the market share list .
Lots of smaller companies can make a better cereal , and they can certainly sell it for less .
But Kelloggʼs is willing to pay a bribe ( called a “ shelving allowance ” ) to get plenty of space at the supermarket .
Kelloggʼs airs commercials during Saturday morning TV shows .
And Kelloggʼs has hundreds of sales reps wandering the aisles of grocery stores around the country .
Kelloggʼs wins the market share battle in mass - market cereals because it succeeds at the last and most important step : getting the product in front of the consumer .
2 ACCESS TO CAPITAL .
The big guys can borrow money .
Lots of it .
It ʼs no big deal for a car company to raise $ 200 million to pay for a new line of cars .
In industries where the expenses for machinery , tooling , research and development , and marketing are high , big companies with cheap money often prevail .
Microsoft , for example , took six or more years to turn Windows from a lame excuse of a product into the market - busting operating system it is now .
Year after year after year , it lost money marketing lousy versions of Windows .
How could it afford to do this ?
By raising money from the stock market at very low cost and hanging in .
Big companies have access to capital that a little guy canʼt hope to match .
A hot company like Yahoo !
is able to raise money from the stock market with no personal guarantees , no interest payments , no downside risk .
And it can raise a lot .
More established companies can issue bonds or get lines of credit for billions of dollars .
The banks and investors that back these companies arenʼt looking for a monthly or even a yearly return on their investment .
Instead , they ʼre focusing on building profits a decade from now .
A bootstrapper could never afford to compete with this approach .
If a market can be bought with cash , a big company will do it .
3 BRAND EQUITY .
Why would you be more likely to try a new line of clothes from Nike than from Joeʼs Sporting Goods Store ?
Because Nike has invested billions of dollars in building a brand name , and youʼve learned to trust that name .
Nike can leverage its name when introducing new products .
Donʼt underestimate the power of the brand !
Financial World magazine estimates that the Marlboro name and logo are worth more than $ 2 billion .
Any tobacco manufacturer can make a similar cigarette .
But only Phillip Morris gets to extract the profit that comes from having more than 50 percent market share .
If the consumer of the product is likely to buy from an established brand name , the big company has a huge advantage .
4 CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS .
Especially for companies that sell in the business - to - business world , access to customers is a tremendous advantage .
Time Warner collects nearly one - third of all the advertising dollars spent on magazines in this country every year .
When Time launches a new magazine , it has a tremendous advantage in selling the ad space .
A fledgling competitor , on the other hand , has to start from scratch .
It ’s easy to imagine that the only way to run a business is with secretaries and annual reports …
Of course , this is n’t true .
Last year , Costco sold more than $ 30 million worth of shrimp in its giant warehouse stores .
The company can choose from hundreds of different shrimp suppliers ( it all comes from the same ocean ! ) , but it deals with only three firms .
Why ?
Because the shrimp buyer at Costco doesnʼt have time to sift through every possible supplier every time she makes a new purchase .
So she works with companies she trusts , companies sheʼs worked with before .
In established markets , customer relationships are a huge advantage .
5 GREAT EMPLOYEES .
Big companies are filled with turkeys , lifers , incompetents , and political operators .
But there , among the bureaucrats , are some exceptional people .
Great inventors , designers , marketers , salespeople , customer service wizards , and manufacturers .
These great people are drawn to a company that has a great reputation , offers stability , and pays well .
Smart companies like Disney leverage these people to the hilt .
During a meeting with someone at Disney , I saw a stack of paper on the corner of his desk .
“ What ʼs that ? ” I asked .
He replied that they were resumes .
More than 200 of them , all from extraordinarily qualified people , one with a gorgeous watercolor on it .
All of them had come from one tiny classified ad in the LA paper .
Big companies attract powerfully talented people .
What ʼs a bootstrapper to do ?
Big companies have better distribution , access to money whenever itʼs needed , a brand that customers trust , access to the people who buy , and great employees .
Theyʼve got lots of competition , big and small , and theyʼve sharpened their axes for battle .
Kellogg ’s is willing to pay a bribe … to get plenty of space at the supermarket .
Do you have a chance to succeed ?
No .
Not if you try to compete head to head in these five areas .
Not if you try to be just like a big company , but smaller .
If you try to steal the giantʼs lunch , the giant is likely to eat you for lunch .
Inventing a new computer game and trying to sell it in retail outlets would be crazy — Electronic Arts and Brøderbund will cream you .
Introducing a new line of sneakers to compete head to head with Nike at the core of its market would be suicidal .
You have to go where the other guys canʼt .
Take advantage of what you have so that you can beat the competition with what they donʼt .
Many bootstrappers miss this lesson .
They believe that great ideas and lots of energy will always triumph , so they waste countless dollars and years fighting the bad guys on their own turf .
That ʼs why the gourmet food business bugs me so much .
Every year , another 2,000 gourmet items — jams , jellies , nuts , spreads , chips — are introduced .
And every year , 1,900 of them fail .
Why ?
Because the bootstrappers behind them are in love with an idea , not a business .
Successful bootstrappers know that just because they can make a product doesnʼt mean they should .
Making kettle - fried potato chips from your grandmotherʼs recipe may sound appealing , but that doesnʼt mean that you can grow the idea into a real business .
Big companies have access to capital that a little guy ca n’t hope to match .
Given the choice between building a thriving , profitable business with a niche and a really boring product and putting your life savings into an intensely competitive business where you ʼre likely to fail but the product is cool , the experienced bootstrapper will pick the former every time .
If you find an industry filled with wannabe entrepreneurs with a dollar and a dream , run away and look for something else !
Now letʼs take a look at the good news .
You have plenty of things that the big guys donʼt , things that can give you tremendous advantages in launching a new business .
1 NOTHING TO LOSE .
This is huge .
Your biggest advantage .
Big , established companies are in love with old , established ways .
They have employees with a huge stake in maintaining the status quo .
How many of the great railroad companies got into the airline business ?
Zero .
Even though they could have completely owned this new mode of transport , they were too busy protecting their old turf to grab new turf .
Whenever a market or a technology changes , thereʼs a huge opportunity for new businesses .
The number - one Web site on the Internet is nʼt run by Ziff Davis or Microsoft .
It ʼs run by an upstart bootstrapper named Jerry Yang ( Yahoo ! ) .
Do n’t underestimate the power of the brand !
Fifteen years ago , I met with Jim Levy .
At the time , he was running the fastest - growing company in the history of the world .
Activision had exploded on the scene , introducing one videogame after another , capturing a huge share of the Atari 2600 marketplace .
After just one year , the company had transformed itself from bootstrapper to fat , happy bureaucracy .
As a freshly minted , slightly arrogant MBA , I decided it was my job to tell him what to do next .
So I handed him an article from the Harvard Business Review and explained that he ought to start using some of the huge profits that Activision was earning to take over the brand - new software market .
By making software for IBM PC and Apple Macintosh , he could leverage his early lead and his cash and own even more markets .
But Jim had something to lose .
His investors and his employees wanted more years like the one theyʼd just finished .
They didnʼt want to hear about investing in new markets .
They wanted to hear about profits .
So Activision did more of the same .
A few years later , they were bought for , like , $ 4.34 .
2 HAPPY WITH SMALL FISH .
In the ocean , the first animals to die are the big fish .
That ʼs because they need to eat a lot to be happy .
The small guys , the plankton , can make do with crumbs .
Same is true with you .
Disney canʼt be happy with a movie that earns less than $ 40 million at the box office .
Compare this to the entrepreneur in Vermont who made a kidsʼ video in 1990 called Road Construction Ahead .
He was just delighted when he made more than $ 100,000 .
Think about the orders of magnitude at work here : $ 40 million at the box office is 400 times $ 100,000 .
Just imagine all the room there is for a small business that operates under the radar of the giant .
Find a niche , not a nation .
[ Costco ] can choose from hundreds of different shrimp suppliers ( it all comes from the same ocean ! ) , but it deals with only threefirms .
3 PRESEDENTIAL INPUT .
In many companies , the president has no trouble getting things done .
When Jack Welch at General Electric wanted the ice maker on the new fridge to be quieter , you can bet people in the engineering department paid attention .
And when Jack wants to have a meeting with some key customers in Detroit , odds are that theyʼll make time for him — hey , heʼs the president of the whole company .
But in big companies , the president is far removed from the action .
GE has tens of thousands of employees and only one Jack Welch .
Heʼs surrounded by people with their own agendas .
He rarely gets to change the whole company .
The other day , one of my employees flew to Detroit .
He had a special fare ticket and knew that his travel options might be restricted , but he got to the airport four hours early for his flight back .
Another flight , virtually empty , was leaving in 15 minutes .
Jerry asked if he could fly standby .
After all , the plane was flying back to New York anyway , it was empty , and it would cost the airline exactly zero to fly him back now , instead of four hours from now .
For companies that sell in the business - to - business world , access to customers is a tremendous advantage .
The gate agent said no .
Do you think the president of the airline would have made the same decision ?
Do you think he would have wanted a valuable customer to spend four hours seething about the airline when he could have walked right onto a plane ?
Do you think the president would have wanted to see his valuable brand equity wasted in such a stupid way ?
I doubt it .
But the president wasnʼt there .
A gate agent having a bad day was there instead .
You , on the other hand , are the president of your company , and you have a lot of interaction with your customers .
You make policy , so youʼll never lose someone over a stupid rule .
You can use this power and flexibility to make yourself irresistible to demanding customers .
4 RAPID R&D .
They say you canʼt hire nine women to work really hard as a team and produce one baby in one month .
Teamwork doesnʼt always make things faster — it can even slow them down .
Engineering studies have shown time and time again that small , focused teams are always faster than big , bureaucratic ones .
Obviously , itʼs harder to pick a team of four great people than it is to assign two dozen randomly selected people to a project .
And itʼs riskier too .
So most companies donʼt do very well when it comes to inventing breakthrough products .
When theyʼve got a problem at IBM , they assign a squadron to it .
A squadron that sometimes creates bad ideas , like the PCjr. Barnes & Noble didnʼt invent Amazon.com .
One smart guy named Jeff Bezos did .
Microsoft and IBM didnʼt invent the supercool Palm Pilot .
A much smaller company called US Robotics bought an even smaller company that developed it .
Motorola and GE didnʼt invent the modern radar detector .
Cincinnati Microwave did .
Big companies will almost always try to reduce invention risk by assigning a bureaucracy .
You , on the other hand , can do it yourself .
Or hire one person to do it .
That ʼs why you so often see great new ideas come out of tiny companies .
They ʼre faster and more focused .
If you try to steal the giant ’s lunch , the giant is likely to eat you for lunch .
5 THE UNDERDOG .
When Viacom or Microsoft or General Motors comes knocking , lots of smaller companies smell money .
They know that the person they ʼre meeting with doesnʼt own the company ( that employee might be five or ten levels away from anyone with total profit responsibility ) so they ʼre inclined to charge more .
After all , they can afford it !
In addition to charging big companies full retail prices , smaller businesses are used to the hassles that big companies present .
Purchase orders and layers of bureaucracy .
Lawyers and insurance policies and more .
So in order to deal with the big guys ʼ inherent inefficiencies , they have to plan ahead and build the related costs into their prices when dealing with the Viacoms , Microsofts , and GMs .
Big companies donʼt treat people very well sometimes , and people respond in kind .
You , on the other hand , run a small company .
So you can acquire the distribution rights to a video series for no money down .
Or convince Mel Gibson to appear in your documentary for union scale .
Or get your lawyer to work for nothing , for a while , just because you ʼre doing good things .
6 LOW OVERHEAD .
You work out of your house , with a simple phone system , no business affairs department , very little insurance , no company car , and volunteer labor .
If you canʼt make it much more cheaply than the big guys , youʼve either picked the wrong product ( hey , donʼt go into the computer chip business ! )
Or you ʼre going about it the wrong way .
Use this power and flexibility to make yourself irresistible to demanding customers .
Even though big companies are big in scale , they still have to turn a profit on each and every product they sell or pay the consequences sooner or later .
The guy whoʼs losing money on every order shipped and trying to make it up in volume is in for a rude awakening .
By leveraging your smallness , you can often undercut bigger competitors , especially if the product or service you create doesnʼt require a lot of fancy machinery .
7 TIME .
The big companies donʼt have a lot of freedom in the way they deal with time .
When you have to pay off the bankers every month , please the stock market , and grow according to schedule , there is nʼt always the flexibility to do things on the right schedule .
Sometimes theyʼve got to rush things , and other times they hold things back .
You , on the other hand , are a stealth marketer .
No one is watching you .
Sometimes , when it counts , youʼll be ten times faster than the big guys .
But when you can make a difference by taking your time , you will — and itʼll show .
A REAL - LIFE EXAMPLE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR SIZE
( Or , how id software completely redefined the computer game market and made millions . )
The software company that calls itself id is a classic bootstrapper .
It makes violent computer games that run on home computers .
Its software is usually developed by a group of 2 to 10 people , then published by a big company like Electronic Arts .
It costs a huge amount to make a new product ( sometimes more than a million dollars ) but amazingly little to make one more copy ( as low as 50 cents ) .
They did n’t want to hear about investing in newmarkets .
They wanted to hear about profits .
So the idea in computer game software has always been to spend whatever it takes to make a great game , then spend whatever it takes to get shelf space in the software stores , then hope and pray that you sell a lot of copies .
One hit like Myst can pay all of a companyʼs bills for years to come .
Id became famous for a game called Castle Wolfenstein .
As an encore , the four guys who founded id decided to follow their own rules in playing against the big companies .
They did it with a game called Doom .
They brazenly broke the first rule of software marketing — they gave Doom away to anyone who wanted to download it .
Free.
Millions of people did .
It quickly became the most popular computer game of the year .
It didnʼt cost id very much to allow someone to download the game , but the company wasnʼt receiving any income at all .
Whenever a market or a technology changes , there ’s a huge opportunity for new businesses .
In stage two , id offered a deluxe version of Doom with more levels , more monsters , more everything .
Partnering with a big guy ( GT Interactive ) , it got the software into stores around the country .
And sold it directly by mail order .
With a user base of millions of people , id got to call the shots .
Instead of being at the mercy of the gatekeepers of distribution , it was courted by distributors and retailers .
By inventing a completely different business model , a model in which it had nothing to lose , id redefined a business and won .
Take a look at all the attributes listed in this chapter .
Id took advantage of the seven that help the bootstrapper and steadfastly avoided the five that help the big company .
By redefining the game and playing on its home field , it trounced companies valued at more than half a billion dollars .
Hereʼs how id used the seven bootstrapper tools :
1 NOTHING TO LOSE .
The method used by id threatened to destroy software distribution as we know it .
Which was fine with id , but not so fine with the guys at the big software companies .
Thereʼs no way in the world they would have had the guts to do this themselves .
2 HAPPY WITH SMALL FISH .
Because id didnʼt spend any money on advertising , and because it had developed the game itself , it didnʼt need Doom to be the best - selling computer game of the year to be happy .
Even 30,000 sales would have been enough to make the venture successful .
3 PRESIDENTIAL INPUT .
Id had total consistency .
The game was designed , marketed , licensed , and managed by the same four people .
No miscommunication here .
4 RAPID R&D .
There were no budget committees , no marketing schedules , no organizational charts to get in the way .
( It ʼs interesting to note that it took three times as long for id to create Doomʼs sequel .
The gameʼs makers had apparently forgotten what they had learned about rapid R&D . )
5 THE UNDERDOG .
Consumers love to root for the hippies at id .
It makes them more likely to spread the word and to buy ( not copy ) the final game .
6 LOW OVERHEAD .
Thereʼs no question that high overhead costs would have wiped these guys out .
7 TIME .
They knew they could ship when they needed to , instead of when shareholders demanded a new influx of sales .
Because they controlled time , they could use it to their advantage .
The flip side of these seven attributes , of course , is what id did n’t do .
Here are some ways you can redefine the big guys out of the way on these five attributes :
1 DISTRIBUTION .
Never start by selling your product in major stores .
Instead , use mail order .
Or sell directly to just a few customers for lots of money per sale .
Or use the Internet .
The last step in your chain is traditional distribution .
2 ACCESS TO CAPITAL .
Be cheap .
In everything .
Donʼt pick a business in which access to money is an important element .
That means that building a cable service , a worldwide cellular phone system , or a chemical refinery probably wouldnʼt be on your list .
When you do need capital , donʼt pay retail .
Borrow from customers or suppliers .
Find an equity angel .
But donʼt borrow at 18 percent !
And donʼt use your personal credit cards .
3 BRAND EQUITY .
Position yourself against the brand leader .
Be “ cheaper than Fritoʼs ” or “ faster than Federal Express ” or “ cooler than Leviʼs . ”
The more the other guyʼs brand gets publicized , the more your positioning statement increases in value .
Be brazen in the way you compare yourself to the market leader .
Your story should be short , solid , and memorable .
Youʼve probably already seen the Internet analogy .
Almost every single dot com failure is due to studied ignorance of the points that lie above .
Well - funded Net start - up companies didnʼt act like id .
They figured that they had enough money to act like a big company .
They were wrong .
4 CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS .
You donʼt have much of a chance of grabbing a big piece of an established companyʼs business away from one of its good customers right away .
It ʼs just too easy for the company to defend against you .
Instead , you can try one of these strategies :
• THE INCHWORM .
Get a little piece of business as a test .
Then , with great service and great products , slowly but surely steal more and more of the big guyʼs business .
Focus on one client at a time .
By the time the other guy catches on , itʼll be too late .
• SELL TO SOMEONE ELSE .
Either to companies that donʼt already have a relationship with your target customer or to someone in a different department at your target customerʼs company — someone who doesnʼt know sheʼs supposed to buy from any particular vendor .
This strategy works at home too .
For example , Saturn found that by marketing its cars to women , it could grab market share that might have automatically gone to Ford if the car - buying decision for couples had been up to the man .
5 GREAT EMPLOYEES .
Not every employee is searching for great reputation , stability , and high pay .
Amazingly enough , there are lots of people who would prefer a great adventure , stock options , flextime , a caring boss , a convenient location , or a chance to grow without bureaucracy .
By focusing on what you offer that the big guys donʼt , you can capture your own share of greatness .
This manifesto , like most business books , may seem a little intimidating .
It ʼs filled with countless things you must do right and countless things that can go wrong .
In fact , you may feel like giving up .
And I can guarantee that if you donʼt feel like giving up today , there will definitely be days when you do feel like giving up .
Which brings me to the most important , most concrete , most useful piece of advice in the whole manifesto .
Simple , but indispensable : Donʼt give up .
Surviving is succeeding .
You ʼre smarter than most people who have started their own businesses , and smarter still than those who have succeeded .
It ʼs not about what you know or even , in the end , about what you do .
Success is persistence .
Set realistic expectations .
Donʼt give up .
By redefining the game and playing on its home field , it trounced companies valued at more than half a billion dollars .
YOU CAN ’T WIN IF YOU’RE NOT IN THE GAME .
A lot of this manifesto is about survival .
A true bootstrapper worries about survival all the time .
Why ?
Because if you fail , itʼs back to company cubicles , to work you do for someone else until you can get enough scratched together to try again .
Bootstrapping is nʼt always rational .
For some of us ( like me ) , it ʼs almost an addiction .
The excitement and sheer thrill of building something overwhelms the desire to play it safe .
This is an manifesto about how to make the odds work in your favor , how to keep playing until you win .
SECTION 2 | A great idea can wipe you out
I started thinking about this manifesto when I heard a public radio report about an American entrepreneur who was busy installing a string of pay phones in Somalia .
His biggest expense , the announcer explained , was armed guards to protect the phones .
I shook my head .
Perhaps the only thing sillier would have been setting up a Pizza Hut franchise in the war zone .
There are enough obstacles to success in choosing your business .
Overcoming a flawed business model shouldnʼt be one of them .
You need to start before you start .
Figuring out which business to be in is one of the most important things you can do to ensure the success of your new venture , yet itʼs often one of the most poorly thought out decisions bootstrappers make .
Donʼt rush it .
Donʼt just pick what you know , or what you used to do , or even what you dreamed of doing when you were a teenager .
It ʼs way more fun to run a successful vegetable stand than to be a bankrupt comedy club owner .
The first law of bootstrapping : Great ideas are not required .
In fact , a great idea can wipe you out .
What ʼs a great idea ?
Something that ʼs never been done before .
Something that takes your breath away .
Something so bold , so daring , so right , that you ʼre certain itʼs worth a bazillion dollars .
An idea you need to keep secret .
Great ideas will kill you .
Coming up with a brilliant idea for a business is not nearly as important as finding a business model that works .
What ʼs a business model ?
This classic MBA phrase describes how you set up a business so you can get money out of it .
Below are some sample business models .
See if you can guess which company each comes from :
1 HIRE THE WORLD ’S BEST ATHLETES AS SPOKESPEOPLE .
Buy an enormous amount of advertising .
Use the advertising to get every sporting goods store to carry your products .
Make your product overseas for very little money .
Charge very high prices .
2 FIND LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES .
Offer them a free water cooler if they allow you to refill it .
Earn money by making deliveries on a regular basis .
3 CREATE THE OPERATING SYSTEM that runs every personal computer in the world .
Then use the power you gain from knowing that system , which controls the computers , to create software , Web sites , online services , even travel agencies .
Right .
These are the business models of Nike , Poland Spring , and Microsoft .
What makes these descriptions business models ?
They are formulas that take the assets of a company and turn them into cash .
Without a business model , a company can get publicity , hire employees , and spend money — but it wonʼt make a profit .
In a free society , the government doesnʼt control who gets the right to start a business .
Anyone can do it — in most cases without a license , a permit , or a training course .
This has one chilling implication : as soon as a business starts to make money , other people will notice , and theyʼll start a business just like it .
This is called competition , and it usually keeps people from retiring at the age of 28 .
A business model is a machine , a method , a plan for extracting money from a system .
Hereʼs another , simpler one : Buy ice cream sandwiches from a wholesaler .
Put them in a refrigerated truck , drive them to the nearest beach , and sell them at retail .
You make money on every ice cream sandwich you sell !
( I did this in high school , by the way .
I didnʼt make much money , but I did gain ten pounds . )
At first , this is nʼt such a profitable venture .
But then add another layer :
Buy cases and cases of ice cream sandwiches from a distributor , put them into 20 trucks , hire high school kids to sell them , and keep half the money .
Suddenly , you ʼre making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
Go one step further :
Buy directly from the manufacturer , at an even lower price .
Put your own label on the sandwiches .
Then load up 200 trucks .
Youʼll need a fleet administrator , insurance policies , and a thousand other things .
But you ʼve built a business .
At every step along the way , our fictional ice cream magnate made choices .
He chose to bypass the supermarket .
He chose not to advertise .
He chose not to be the cheapest .
He chose not to open an international branch .
His path shows us all the key elements of a business model :
DISTRIBUTION .
Where is it sold to the ultimate consumer ?
What middlemen are involved ?
SALES .
Who is selling it for you and how are will they be compensated ?
PRICING .
What do wholesalers and retailers and consumers pay ?
PRODUCTION .
How do you make it ?
RAW MATERIALS .
Where do you get what you sell ?
POSITIONING .
How do the ultimate users position the product in their minds ?
MARKETING .
How do consumers find out about it ?
BARRIER TO ENTRY .
How will you survive when competitors arrive ?
SCALABILITY .
How do you make it bigger ?
GET OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT BY STARTING THE RIGHT BUSINESS
Understanding the mechanics of a business model is essential before you start your business .
Business models should have the following five attributes :
1 THEY SHOULD BE PROFITABLE .
Youʼd be surprised at how often people start businesses that lose money on every product and then try to make it up in volume !
That lemonade stand you ran when you were seven was a great lesson — you need to make money to stay in business .
The only thing is that when you ʼre seven , your mom gives you the lemons for free .
Almost no business is profitable on the very first day .
The baker has to buy ovens , pay the rent , and purchase ingredients .
The consultant needs business cards and brochures .
The question is : How long before profitability ?
Write down a target date .
If you go way past it , figure out how to fix the problem or quit .
Staying in a losing business because youʼve already lost a lot of money is a bad business strategy .
Learn how to detect the factors that change a business from profitable to unprofitable .
If you ʼre contracted to deliver goods at a fixed rate but your suppliers can raise their prices on you , youʼve just become a very risk - taking middleman .
Thereʼs a great cartoon of a mathematician doing a complicated proof on the blackboard .
The board is covered with all sorts of squiggles and symbols and then , at the bottom , it says , “ And then a miracle happens , ” followed by the end of the proof .
Business models canʼt depend on miracles any more than mathematics can .
Every once in a while a business comes along that creates its own model .
I can tell you that itʼs infinitely better to have one before you start .
Using my favorite ice cream example , the business just doesnʼt work if implicit in the business model is the fact that you ʼre going to lose money on every ice cream sandwich and make it up by selling more .
This sort of wacked - out thinking only works on the Internet , and even there it wonʼt work for long .
2 THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTIBLE .
A profitable business , as mentioned earlier , is going to attract competitors .
What are you going to do when they show up ?
If you ʼre accustomed to making $ 1 on every ice cream sandwich you sell and suddenly thereʼs a price war , you may make only a nickel .
That ʼs not good .
It ʼs called a barrier to entry or competitive insulation .
Barriers can include patents ( which donʼt work as well as most people think ) , brand names , exclusive distribution deals , trade secrets ( like the recipe for Coke ) , and something called the first mover advantage .
Blockbuster Video , for example , created a huge barrier to entry when it opened thousands of video stores around the country .
By the time the competition showed up , all the best spots were taken .
As you can guess , this is a pretty expensive barrier to erect .
First mover advantage is the fond hope that the first person into a business , the one who turns it into something that works , has an advantage over the next one .
For example , if you start mowing lawns in your exclusive subdivision , the second person doesnʼt get a chance to solve someoneʼs lawn problem — youʼve already done that .
Instead , the second guy has to hope that he can undercharge or overdeliver enough to dislodge you from your spot .
3 THEY SHOULD BE SELF - PRIMING .
One of the giant traps bootstrappers fall into is inventing business models that donʼt prime themselves .
If you want to sell razor blades , for example , youʼve got to get a whole bunch of people to buy them .
Without a lot of razors out there that can use your blade , you lose .
Is it possible to build a paradigm - shifting business with just a little money ?
Sure .
It ʼs been done before .
But nine times out of ten , youʼll fail .
Why ?
Because you ʼre gonna run out of money before you change the world .
Don Katz started a business called Audible that allows you to download books on tape from the Internet .
So you can find a novel youʼve always wanted to hear , type in your credit card number , and listen to it .
The challenge Don faces , though , is that you need to buy a $ 150 Audible player to hear it .
Without the player , it doesnʼt work .
So , in order to sell the books on tape ( which is how he makes money ) , he first has to sell the player ( on which he loses money ) .
This is a business model for brave people !
Our friendly ice cream vendor has a self - priming business .
Sure , he has to lay out some cash for that first truck and for the first batch of ice cream sandwiches , but after that it ought to pay for its own growth .
Sell $ 100 worth of ice cream for $ 200 , and you have enough money to buy yourself two cases of ice cream .
4 THEY SHOULD BE ADJUSTABLE .
Remember how excited everyone got about the missiles the U.S. used during the Gulf War ?
Here was a weapon you could aim after you launched it .
You could adjust the flight along the way .
You need a business model like that if you ʼre hoping to maximize your chances of success .
If youʼve got to lock it , load it , and launch it , you ʼre going to be doing more praying than you need to .
A business model that relies on a huge number of customers or partners is far less flexible than one you can adjust as you go .
Subway sandwich shops , for example , have more than 13,000 locations , each individually operated .
If Subway decided that the future lay in barbecued beef , it would take a lot of persuasion to get each of these entrepreneurs to go out and buy the necessary equipment .
They ʼre pretty much stuck with what theyʼve got .
Compare this to a local restaurant with one or two locations .
If everyone suddenly wants fresh oat bran muffins , theyʼll appear on the menu in a day or two .
The ice cream business , which you ʼre by now no doubt bored with , is totally adjustable .
In the winter you can switch to hot chocolate .
If business heats up , ( sorry for the pun ) buy more trucks …
5 THERE SHOULD BE AN EXIT STRATEGY ( OPTIONAL ) .
If you can build a business and then sell it , you get to extract the equity you built .
If you canʼt sell it , all you get is the annual profit .
There can be a big difference .
About eight months after going public , Yahoo ! , for example , had equity worth about a billion dollars , but it made only $ 2 in profit last year .
That 500,000,000 - to - 1 ratio is huge , and itʼs unusual , and it doesnʼt last forever , but if your goal is a retirement villa in Cancun , the exit strategy it allows is very nice indeed .
Selling ice cream sandwiches offers no exit strategy at all until you reach a certain scale .
When you ʼre small , the business is just you .
A competitor can buy trucks more cheaply than buying your business .
But once you hire employees and build a brand and create trade secrets and systems , then youʼve built a business .
One of my favorite bootstrap businesses is the Stereo Advantage in Buffalo , New York .
I was one of its first customers as a teenager in the 1970s , and since then Iʼve seen it grow from a tiny one - room shop to a business with hundreds of employees , more than 4,000 commercial accounts , a service business , a catalog business , and a huge share of the stereo , home the ater , cellular phone , and even casual clothing business in the markets in which it operates .
Let ʼs look closely at how the Advantage fares on the five rules of business models .
FIRST OF ALL , IT ’S PROFITABLE .
By relying on significant relationships with suppliers , it can buy cheap and sell sort of cheap .
The profit on each sale is nʼt huge but the volume is , so thereʼs plenty of money left over at the end of the day .
IT ’S PRETTY PROTECTIBLE .
In the beginning , of course , the Stereo Advantage had nothing that couldnʼt be easily copied .
But back then , no one wanted to copy it .
Now , twenty years later , the store has built a significant brand , a huge array of loyal customers , a talented staff , ongoing service contracts , and deep , mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers .
Many , many companies have tried to go after it , but all have failed .
IT ’S SOMEWHAT SELF - PRIMING .
The beginning was a very risk - filled time for the store .
The owner had to buy inventory , take a lease , and hire staff without any guarantee that people like me would walk in and buy something on opening day .
As it grew , though , each step has been self - priming .
He brought in two televisions .
When they sold , he brought in eight more .
Now there are hundreds on display , without the risk that would have been incurred if he had filled the store with televisions before ever selling one .
IT ’S ADJUSTABLE .
If the core of the Advantageʼs business is that it combines a solid reputation with a good location and trustworthy suppliers , then the business can be adjusted a great deal within those parameters .
When portable telephones got hot , for instance , it was easy for Stereo Advantageʼs owner to talk to Sony and other suppliers and get some in the stores quickly .
Same thing with home theater .
It ʼs unlikely that the store could sell cars , or even profitably move into high - end stereos .
But , within the constraints of its business model , it enjoys a great deal of flexibility .
Which leads to the exit strategy .
It ʼs terrific .
Any number of national retail chains could buy the Stereo Advantage and use it as a template for rolling out a national chain .
The owner has managed to create a management team that doesnʼt require his personal involvement in every decision .
In many ways , itʼs the ideal business to sell : too small to go public , but permanent enough to last beyond its founder .
Ray Kroc , one of the greatest bootstrappers ever , took a completely different tack .
McDonaldʼs ( which he didnʼt invent , by the way ) was built with the intent to “ scale ” it — to make it bigger .
Ray found a restaurant in California , run by two brothers .
They had a system .
They knew how to make a great hamburger , super fries , and a wonderful milkshake .
They had a look and feel that was easy to communicate .
And a way to cook .
Ray decided that growing the business was the key to competitive insulation and profits .
If he was the biggest , first , he would win .
So he started franchising .
He let others buy the right to build their own McDonaldʼs .
The franchise deal was simple : a little money up front along with a share of the profits forever in exchange for the brand name , a rulebook , advertising , and unique products .
Letʼs take a look at the McDonaldʼs business model as Ray saw it in 1965 with regard to the five principles :
IT ’S A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS .
The cost of making the products is low , and a newly prosperous American public , fueled by a baby boom , is happy to pay for them .
IT ’S VERY PROTECTIBLE .
The brand name is powerful , and becomes more so every time any McDonaldʼs on earth runs an ad .
And by being first in the market , it gets the best locations , which are worth almost as much as the brand .
( Did you know that in 1997 , on any given day , one out of seven Americans ate a meal at McDonaldʼs ? )
IT ’S COMPLETELY SELF -PRIMING .
The brilliance of Ray Kroc was that he had other people fund his growth by paying up front for a franchise .
The more he grew , the more funding he got .
This is a much harder trick to pull off today , but itʼs not impossible .
IT ’S NOT ADJUSTABLE .
The giant risk Kroc took was that once people bought into his franchise , they didnʼt want it to change .
So as long as it was working for everyone , everyone was happy .
But what do you do with a location that just doesnʼt click ?
How do you introduce new products when competition comes along ?
And what happens when you open franchises in different countries ?
Perhaps the biggest hassle in the franchisorʼs life is maintaining flexibility when you have thousands of licensees around the world .
Without a business model , a company can get publicity , hire employees , and spend money — but it wo n’t make a profit .
A recent episode is a perfect example of this lack of adjustability .
Burger King , seemingly stranded in second place , reformulated its way of making french fries .
With a huge national campaign , it attacked one of McDonaldʼs core products .
But McDonaldʼs couldnʼt possibly respond with a new recipe quickly — the logistics are too cumbersome .
The exit strategy was terrific .
Ray Kroc took the company public and became a very , very rich man .
Inventing a new business model is a very scary thing .
The Internet is the home of scary business models , a place where new businesses open every day , many by people with no idea how they ʼre going to make a living .
Yahoo , Yoyodyne , HeadSpace , iVillage — each of these Internet marketing companies came at the marketing equation from a different angle .
Each looks for a scalable , protectible model that will allow it to extract excess profits .
But many
Net businesses ( and businesses in the real world ) ignore this critical rule : Just because itʼs cheap to start doesnʼt make it a good business .
Learn how to detect the factors that change a business from profitable to unprofitable .
This is a big danger for the bootstrapper .
You donʼt have anyone telling you you canʼt start a business .
And if you ʼre investing your time and just a little of your money , thereʼs not much to stop you from giving it a try .
You donʼt need anyoneʼs approval !
JUST BECAUSE IT’S CHEAP TO START DOESN ’T MAKE IT A GOOD BUSINESS
Soon after Staples started opening office supply superstores , an acquaintance of mine decided that heʼd start his own business .
The idea was simple :
He would go to larger companies and offer to sell them office supplies at a low price .
Heʼd make the purchases at Staples and mark up the prices for his customers .
At the beginning , there was enough difference between what these organizations were used to paying for office supplies from their dealers and what Staples was charging that he could make a small profit on every sale .
But my friendʼs idea fails most of the business model tests .
The biggest problem is that once he took the time to teach these customers that price is the most important thing to look for when buying office supplies , theyʼd find out about Staples and switch .
This was a cheap business .
He could start it for free .
But it was a bad business , a business not worth the enormous investment of time and thought it takes to get started .
Donʼt fall into the trap of doing the easy business , or the fun business , or the sexy business .
In the long run , any failed business , regardless of how cool it seems , is no fun .
The Inc. 500 is a list of the fastest - growing small companies in the country — and almost all of them are bootstrapped .
What ʼs interesting is how varied the businesses are , and how boring many of them are .
Yet the people who are running them are having the time of their lives .
The # 1 company on the list makes toothbrushes .
Among other companies in the top 25 , there is a company that markets clip art , another that performs custodial services for corporations , and a third that markets and distributes vegetables .
DO YOU WANT TO BE A FREELANCER OR AN ENTREPRENEUR ?
As you consider different business models , you need to ask yourself the critical question above .
This is a moment of truth , and being honest now will save you a lot of heartache later .
The difference ?
A freelancer sells her talents .
While she may have a few employees , basically sheʼs doing a job without a boss , not running a business .
Layout artists , writers , consultants , film editors , landscapers , architects , translators , and musicians are all freelancers .
There is no exit strategy .
There is no huge pot of gold .
Just the pleasure and satisfaction of making your own hours and being your own boss .
An entrepreneur is trying to build something bigger than herself .
She takes calculated risks and focuses on growth .
An entrepreneur is willing to receive little pay , work long hours , and take on great risk in exchange for the freedom to make something big , something that has real market value .
If you buy a Subway franchise hoping to work just a little and get very rich , you ʼre in for a big disappointment .
The numbers of the business model donʼt support absentee management of most Subways .
You , the franchisee , need to be the manager too .
A business model that relies on a huge number of customers or partners is far less flexible than one you can adjust as you go .
Contrast this with the entrepreneur who invents a new kind of photo booth , then mortgages everything he owns and borrows the rest to build a company with 60 employees in less than a year .
If it works , heʼs hit a home run and influenced the lives of a lot of people .
If it fails , heʼs out of the game for an inning or two and then , like all good entrepreneurs , heʼll be back .
Both situations offer tremendous opportunity to the right person , and millions of people are delighted that they left their jobs to become a freelancer or an entrepreneur .
But for you , only one of them will do .
And you must figure out which one .
The entrepreneur is comfortable raising money , hiring and firing , renting more office space than she needs right now .
The entrepreneur must dream big and persuade others to share her dream .
The freelancer , on the other hand , can focus on craft .
She can most easily build her business by doing great work , consistently .
This manifesto is focused on freelancers and early - stage entrepreneurs .
It ʼs designed to show you how to thrive and survive before raising money .
Because if you bootstrap successfully , youʼll find that bankers , angels , and investors are far more likely to give you the money you need to grow .
The most successful bootstrappers donʼt invent a business model .
They trade on the success of a proven one .
There are countless advantages to doing this .
Here are a few :
1. YOU CAN BE CERTAIN THAT IT CAN BE DONE .
If one or more people are making a living with this business model , odds are you can too .
2. YOU CAN LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES .
If the guy down the street overexpands , you can learn from that .
3. YOU CAN FIND A MENTOR .
Somewhere , thereʼs someone with this same model whoʼs probably willing to teach you what he knows .
4. YOU’RE NOT ALONE .
The horrible uncertainty of staring down a bottomless pit doesnʼt afflict the bootstrapper who is brave enough to steal a business model .
Donʼt get me wrong !
Iʼm not proposing you do nothing but copy some poor schmo , word for word , step by step .
Instead , copy his business model .
If there ʼs someone making a good living selling ice cream sandwiches from a truck , maybe you could sell papayas the same way .
The business model is the same — same distribution , same competitive pressures , and so on .
There ʼs plenty of room for creativity when you bootstrap , but why not take advantage of the knowledge that ʼs there for you ?
FOLLOW THE MONEY
Understanding the value chain of your business is a great first step in getting to the core of how you ʼre going to succeed .
A value chain is the process that a product goes through before it reaches a consumer .
Starbucks , for example , starts with a coffee bean in Colombia that is so cheap itʼs almost free .
Then they roast it and transport it and brand it and make it convenient and brew it and sell it .
At each step along the way , Starbucks is adding value — making the bean worth more to its ultimate consumer .
The more value you add , the more money you make .
When portable telephones got hot …it was easy for Stereo Advantage ’s owner to talk to Sony and other suppliers and get some in the stores quickly .
When looking at a business model and the value chain it creates , I like to start from the last step :
1 . Whoʼs going to buy your product or service ( called product for brevity from here on in ) ?
2 . How much are they going to pay for it ?
3 . Where will they find it ?
4 . What ʼs the cost of making one sale ?
These four questions go to the critical issue of distribution and sales .
The Pet Rock was probably the worst thing that ever happened to bootstrappers , because it led people to believe that they could turn a neat idea into nationwide distribution without too much trouble .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Getting nationwide retail distribution without money to spend on TV ads , a sales force or rep firm , and massive inventory investment is essentially impossible .
When you sell through existing retailers , they add a lot of the value that the consumer receives .
They stock it .
They make it convenient .
They offer the reliability that their brand name connotes ( itʼs guaranteed ) .
And because they add so much value , they get to keep a lot of the profit .
Look at it from their point of view .
Macyʼs , for example , knows its going to sell 10,000 jackets this year .
They can come from firm x or firm y .
The Macyʼs purchasing agent is going to squeeze x and y as hard as she can to extract as much profit for Macyʼs as she can .
Do n’t fall into the trap of doing the easy business , or the fun business , or the sexy business .
If you ʼre selling a custom service or a high - priced good , consider selling it directly .
That cuts out lots of middlemen , and leaves it in your hands .
If you can make this self - priming , youʼve gone a long way toward making your company successful .
In most products , the single largest step in the value chain is the last one — those four items in that list .
If you and your company handle that last step , youʼve earned the right to the profit that comes with it .
For example , an architect who brings in a contractor can expect to extract more profit ( or savings for his customer ) than the contractor who got the job and then brought in the architect .
Obviously , some service businesses lend themselves to direct sales more than consumer products do .
What if youʼve got your heart set on bringing a fantastic board game to market ?
Are you doomed to be at the mercy of mass marketers and nationwide toy chains ?
Not at all .
There are lots of places that sell board games that arenʼt Toys R Us.
Catalogs , for example , can help you reach large numbers of consumers without taking personal risk .
So , to recap , letʼs restate each of the four questions that relate to the value chain :
1. WHO’S GOING TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE ?
Define the audience .
2. HOW MUCH ARE THEY GOING TO PAY FOR IT ?
Do a value analysis to figure out what itʼs worth compared to alternatives .
3. WHERE WILL THEY FIND IT ?
Determine how much of the distribution of the product you control , and what value is added by the retailers or reps you use .
4. WHAT’S THE COST OF MAKING ONE SALE ?
Divide the cost of sales by the number of products you ʼre going to make .
Youʼve just figured out whether they ʼre worth selling .
The ice cream example is fascinatingly simple when it comes to these four questions .
1. WHO’S GOING TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE ?
Hot kids on the beach !
2. HOW MUCH ARE THEY GOING TO PAY FOR IT ?
Buck each !
3. WHERE WILL THEY FIND IT ?
Truck comes to them — we find the best locations .
4. WHAT’S THE COST OF MAKING ONE SALE ?
It ʼs the cost of the driver and fuel divided by the number sold each hour .
This leads us to Question 5 :
5. WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE , PACKAGE , SHIP , AND INVENTORY THE ITEM YOU JUST SOLD ?
If you know this , you can figure out :
6. WHAT’S YOUR PROFIT ON ONE SALE ?
And then you can guess :
7. HOW MANY SALES CAN YOU MAKE A MONTH ?
If we add in the cost of advertising , training , overhead , and the rest , youʼve just mastered the value chain .
And youʼve discovered how you can make your business profitable .
For example , letʼs say it costs you $ 5,000 a month in overhead to run the machine that makes your products .
The price of each product is $ 2 and the cost of each is just $ 1 .
If you can figure out how to boost your sales from 5,500 units a month to 6,000 units a month ( an 11 percent increase ) , youʼve just doubled your profits .
Business model jocks call this “ sensitivity analysis . ”
It ʼs a way of looking at the pressure points of your business .
If you know these before you even open the doors , youʼll have a much better understanding of what to focus on .
Hereʼs another example .
My father makes hospital cribs .
Heʼs got a big factory filled with punch presses and painting bays and other awesome equipment .
The plant is old , but itʼs paid for .
A sensitivity analysis on his business shows that keeping the factory filled is nʼt the smartest thing to do .
That ʼs because labor and inventory and cost of capital are far more expensive to him than the carrying costs on his plant .
The way he can maximize his profits is by making sure that every dollar he spends on personnel turns into the maximum amount of profit .
In other words , he has to either raise prices or increase productivity to make more money .
You ʼre going to be running this business a long time .
Spend an extra month to figure out what your business model feels like and save yourself some headaches later .
EVERYONE IS NOT LIKE YOU
Novelists are encouraged to “ write what you know . ”
And the business you run should reflect what you know and love and are great at .
But donʼt fall into the trap of assuming that everyone needs what you need , wants what you want , buys what you buy .
New Yorkers run around believing that everyone has a Starbucks on every corner , while entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are certain that everyone uses a laptop all the time .
It ʼs so easy to extrapolate from our own experience and multiply it by 250,000,000 .
Donʼt .
When I interview people for jobs , I always ask , “ How many gas stations do you think there are in the United States ? ”
Not because I care how many gas stations there are , but because it gives me an insight into how people solve problems .
The vast majority of people who answer this question ( Iʼve asked it more than 1,000 times over the years ) start their answer with , “ Let ʼs see ... there are 50 states . ”
They then go on to analyze their town , figure out how many gas stations there are , and multiply from there .
While this is better than some approaches , it is a ridiculous way to answer the question or to plan a business .
North Dakota is not like Michigan !
And your life , your neighborhood , your friends , and your needs are not like everyone elseʼs .
The best way to answer the question is to start with a scalable metric — either cars ( how many cars lead to how many stations ) or , surprisingly , how many big gas companies there are .
Either one will get you to a quick and defensible analysis .
Instead of starting the business that makes stuff for people just like you , do some real research .
Go to the library .
Donʼt invent something that requires you to have a handle on the purchasing habits , the psychographics , and the changing demographics of the whole country .
Instead , find a thriving industry and emulate and improve on the market leader .
Sheʼs already done your homework for you .
DON’T START A BUSINESS WHILE SHAVING !
( A CAUTIONARY TALE IN SEVERAL ACTS )
Staring into the mirror this morning , using my brand - spanking - new Norelco razor , it occurred to me how easy it would be to start down the road to ruin while in the bathroom .
Imagine that our young hero is shaving and notices that the blades on his lift - and - cut razor arenʼt as sharp as they used to be .
His best friend , he remembers , is a metallurgist , and maybe there would be a neat , inexpensive way to sharpen the blades in an electric razor .
A day of research in the drugstore and on the Web confirms what he already knows — there are a couple of razor - sharpening devices on the market , but they are hard to find , expensive , and not very good .
The entrepreneur arranges a business lunch with his friend .
He extracts a promise to keep the big idea a secret , then describes his great insight : a low - cost razor - sharpening device that would work well .
Heʼs got a business plan .
With projections , ad slogans , a corporate mission statement , a rollout schedule , the whole thing .
“ Look , ” he says , “ there are more than five million electric razors out there .
If we can sell to just ten percent of them , that ʼs five hundred thousand units !
Figure a profit of four dollars a unit and weʼre rolling in dough . ”
Following the instructions in the business books and magazines he reads , heʼs figured out an exit strategy and already has some angels in mind to finance the business .
Right there , on a handshake , they agree to a partnership .
The metallurgist will invent the device and own half the company .
The entrepreneur will take it from there .
One month later , armed with plans , the entrepreneur heads for the best patent attorney he can find .
He pays a $ 5,000 retainer and starts the process .
Then itʼs off to find a manufacturer .
Intending to be conservative , he decides to build only 10,000 devices , noting , though , that the manufacturer needs to be able to ramp up on a momentʼs notice when this thing takes off like the Chicago fire .
I know what you ʼre thinking .
Wait , it gets worse .
Doing some math , our hero realizes that he needs $ 40,000 to pay the manufacturer .
Also , heʼll need to hire some sales reps to carry his item .
And he figures that a TV commercial ( which will run just once , because heʼs on a budget ) will help jump - start the distribution .
Suddenly , he needs $ 400,000 .
And heʼs doomed .
Actually , he was doomed that first day in the bathroom .
The cost of sale is enormous .
Getting the first person to buy the first sharpener is unbelievably expensive .
It ʼs a retail item , sold in a high - volume location ( the drugstore ) .
People donʼt know it exists and they ʼre not sure they want it .
So you have to pay a bunch of money to let people know they need one , and then you have to share a lot of the profit with the retailer .
Consumer products are almost impossible to bootstrap .
Especially consumer products that need to be sold in thousands of drugstores in order to be profitable .
Take a look at your local CVS — the number of bootstrapped products there is small indeed .
It gets worse .
In order to sell a product like this , itʼs got to be in stock when the customer gets to the store .
So youʼll need to make far more than you expect to sell in the next month or so , just to fill store shelves .
But of course , retailers are not going to pay you in advance just to fill their shelves .
The biggest insult to the bootstrapper ethic is the fact that every customer needs only one for the rest of his life .
That ʼs right , after going to all the trouble of selling this item , our razor entrepreneur will never ever sell a replacement .
The cost of sale is not leveraged across many sales .
Hey , he wonʼt even get the benefit of word of mouth — would you tell a friend about an invention like this ?
Unfortunately , the belief that the successful entrepreneur must have in himself is a doubleedged sword .
Belief in a dumb business model can force you down a road that will eat away your time and your money .
All the trappings of a successful business — business plan , marketing plan , finance plan , PR agency , patent lawyer , and articles of incorporation — can hide the real flaws behind a business .
And what about our hero ?
He gave away half the company to someone who didnʼt do much work and who was easily replaceable .
Left with 98 percent of the work but just 50 percent of the company , heʼs never going to be able to raise enough money to launch this business .
Lucky for him he doesnʼt have the cash in his retirement account — he might have been foolish enough to take the money out .
Understanding the value chain of your business is a great first step in getting to the core of how you ’re going to succeed .
Successful bootstrappers know this :
Your business is about the process .
It ʼs not about the product .
If you structure a business model that doesnʼt reward you as you proceed , it doesnʼt matter how much you love the product .
Pretty soon there wonʼt be any product to love .
The bootstrapper is focused on finding a market that will sustain the process .
A platform that responds to the work you do .
With a business model that works , the deal is simple .
You invest time , effort , and money .
In return , your market responds with sales , cash flow , and profits .
But , you might be thinking , donʼt some entrepreneurs turn big ideas into big companies ?
What about Steve Jobs or Bill Gates or Phil Knight or Ted Turner ?
What about them ?
They picked giant business models and got lucky .
Someone had to .
The market was ready , and they won .
But their success is the exception that proves the rule .
For every Bill Gates there is a David Seuss , a Phillipe Kahn , and 100 other super - talented , hardworking visionaries weʼve never heard of .
You can pick any business in the universe to bootstrap .
I recommend picking one that ʼs friendly to bootstrappers , that wants you to succeed , that will likely give back what you put in .
It ʼs easier to tell you what to avoid than to point you in the right direction .
Businesses that are also hobbies usually cause bootstrappers the most trouble : restaurants , toy design and invention , creating gourmet foods .
On the other hand , mail order , consulting , acting as a sales rep or other sort of middleman , all work great .
So does focusing like a laser on a very obscure market that is growing fast .
Maybe it wonʼt make you as famous as Spike Lee or Marc Andreesen .
That ʼs okay .
It will make you happy .
HOW TO BOOTSTRAP A BUSINESS THE SMART WAY
I have a friend who can do miraculous things with fabric .
Iʼve seen her turn leftover clumps of velvet into a show - stopping shawl .
And she adores kids .
She decided to break into the toy business .
For four years she tried to sell a better diaper bag to Fisher - Price or a new kind of catch toy to Mattel .
She went to the right trade shows , got the right meetings , was careful about whom she associated with , how she positioned herself , and how she pitched her goods .
She watched her expenses like a hawk .
And she kept 100 percent of the equity .
There were some close calls .
Fisher - Price starting going to contract on the diaper bag .
Mattel asked for more details .
But each time , at the last minute , the company turned her down .
My friend eventually realized that she was competing in a world where she wasnʼt wanted .
Toy companies work hard to keep inventors away , because they ʼre scared of lawsuits and the hassles of dealing with outsiders .
They ʼre not overflowing with happy , Tom Hanks –like luminaries , looking for the next Big Idea .
The toy industry is a business , and a cutthroat one .
Spend an extra month to figure out what your business model feels like and save yourself some headaches later .
She had made a mistake .
She built a business without a business model .
She tried to invent a process that could turn into a living , to become a freelancer with a royalty stream in an industry where there were very , very few role models .
She could still design her clothes and bags as a hobby , but she knew it wouldnʼt give her enough income to make a living .
She had to find another way .
She took a look around and realized that the book business publishes 50,000 new ideas every year , relies 100 percent on outsiders , and hires editors who look for ideas from the outside .
Armed with this knowledge , she spent some time getting to know her customer base .
Here were thirty major publishers , all with money , all eager to buy something , all willing to pay money in advance .
Here was a totally different industry in which the process she had worked on for four years would work .
The system of meeting people , inventing products , licensing them , and earning a profit — the system she had tried to build in the toy business — was working every day in the book business .
Different products , same job .
After six months of hard work , she was able to get meetings with three publishers who shared her vision of the market .
She listened hard .
She worked to understand what they wanted , what their customers wanted , how the industry worked .
Without spending any money , Lynn was able to understand the market .
She was able to invent some concepts for books that she thought might sell .
And then she was ready to get serious .
So she found illustrators and researchers who could capture the messages she was trying to communicate .
And she didnʼt give them equity — instead , she paid them a share of the front money .
One publisher decided that her concept for a calendar was worth a shot .
They paid her a small advance and published it .
Two years later , My friendʼs company has more than 2,000,000 copies of their work in print .
Her calendars are often at the cash register at Barnes & Noble .
Sheʼs been hired as a spokesperson by a nationally marketed brand , she makes products she loves , she gets fan letters from people all over the country , and sheʼs having fun .
Did she succeed because the her calendar idea was the most unique , original idea in the history of publishing ?
Or because she was a skilled novelist ?
Not at all .
She succeeded because she understood what her market wanted and because she persevered for years and years to build her reputation .
She was careful with expenses , didnʼt waste her equity , and set herself up for success while protecting against failure .
All without a bank loan .
All without a patent lawyer .
All because she picked the right business model , selling a product in a way that made sense to people who wanted to buy it .
THE SHEER JOY OF GETTING IT RIGHT
As Lynn 's story illustrates , when you ʼre in the right place at the right time with the right product , you can make it work .
A lot of what I ʼm talking about in this manifesto might dissuade you from taking the bootstrapper journey .
So many opportunities to fail , so few to succeed , it seems .
But when it clicks , the magic that takes over is intoxicating .
Your work , embraced by a stranger .
It ʼs a rush .
It ’s so easy to extrapolate from our own experience and multiply it by 250,000,000 .
Do n’t .
Back in 1986 , when I was first starting out , I sent a direct mail letter ( by Federal Express ) to forty different companies .
Each firm was offered the chance to buy advertising in a book I was doing — for $ 1,000 a page , two pages minimum .
I had figured in a huge profit margin , so all I needed were a few positive responses to make it worth the effort .
Within 48 hours , the phone started ringing .
Within thirty days , I had sold more than $ 60,000 in advertising .
It ʼs the thrill that comes from this kind of success that keeps you going .
Iʼm not sure that the idea behind the advertising book was the most insightful or profitable I ʼd ever had .
But by persevering , by putting concepts in front of people in a solid , benefits - oriented way , I had succeeded .
Another time , I had the idea to create SAT prep books .
The proposal went to about a dozen publishers .
Most of them were a bit interested , some called for face - to - face meetings , and one or two seemed on the verge of making an offer .
We proposed to the publishers that we would auction off the right to publish these books , a common practice in the publishing world .
The publisher who paid the most money at the auction would get the right to be our partner in bringing the books to market .
Then an editor from Doubleday called .
“ Cancel the auction , ” she said .
“ What will it take to buy it right now ? ”
She made us an offer of about $ 150,000 .
I said it wasnʼt nearly enough .
I was bluffing .
She doubled her offer .
“ Nope , ” I said , sweating now .
After two long days of her bidding and my saying no , we ended up at just over $ 600,000 .
Instead of starting the business that makes stuff for people just like you , do some real research .
Go to the library .
Youʼll have days like this .
Youʼll fail and be rejected and struggle , and then youʼll have days like this .
Because you ʼre a determined , focused , cheap bootstrapper intent on creating firstrate products .
When they come , savor them !
ONE GOOD REASON NOT TO PLAN SO MUCH
Remember when I said I like to ask people how many gas stations they think there are in the United States ?
Well , the worst answer ( and the main reason I ask ) is , “ I donʼt know . ”
My response is , “ I know you donʼt know .
I want you to make a smart guess . ”
Nine times out of ten , people refuse , in one way or another , to guess .
They donʼt want to be wrong .
Most people hate to be wrong .
They hate to make a statement ( or , even worse , to write something down ) and then be proved wrong .
They donʼt like to buy the wrong car , vote for the wrong candidate , wear the wrong shoes .
Starting a business is the most public , most expensive , riskiest way of all to be wrong .
Faced with all the sensitivity analysis and business model mumbo- jumbo I talk about in this section , you might find it easy just to give up .
“ Iʼm never gonna be as smart as Bill Gates , so I give up ! ” Yeah , well , Bill Gates is nʼt so smart .
Bill Gates thought the Internet was a fad .
Bill Gates launched three database systems , all of which failed .
Thereʼs never been an entrepreneur with a crystal ball .
Thereʼs no way to know for sure whether your business is going to work , whether your targeted customers will buy , whether your choice of technology is a good one .
You ʼre going to be wrong .
Get used to it !
Consumer products are almost impossible to bootstrap .
Especially [ if they ] need to be sold in thousands of drugstores in order to be profitable .
In the face of this uncertainty , it seems to me that the very worst thing you can do is fail to try .
I went to business school at Stanford , which prides itself on being very entrepreneurial .
Of the 300 people in my class , at least half publicly proclaimed that they were going to start their own businesses sooner or later .
Now , twenty years later , only about 30 of us have actually done it .
The rest are still waiting for the right time or the right idea or the right backing .
They ʼre waiting for an engraved invitation and some guarantee of success .
Silicon Valley has been a tremendous boon for this country .
One reason is that it has created a culture where being wrong is okay .
Being wrong can even make you rich in the Valley !
But in most other places , in most other families , the idea of betting your livelihood on something that might not work is a little scary .
The cost of sale is enormous .
Getting the first person to buy the first sharpener is unbelievably expensive .
Hereʼs my best advice to you :
Stop planning and start doing .
You donʼt have to quit your day job .
But you do have to get out there and do it .
The more you do , the more you do .
Doors will open .
Opportunities will appear .
Your model will change , your reputation will increase , you will become a magnet for smart people , good customers , and investors .
But none of this will happen if you stay inside and keep planning .
Build your business .
One day at a time , one customer at a time .
Lower your downsides , focus on the upsides , and start building .
But start .
SECTION 3 | Doing the Math
If you donʼt run out of money , you get to keep playing .
If you end up with more money than you started with , you win .
If you plan for the money , and expect it , then you can avoid dwelling on it and get back to business .
Most entrepreneurs donʼt think about money too much when they decide to start a business .
Whenʼs the last time you asked someone at a cocktail party what he does , and he responded , “ Every month , I generate more cash than I spend ” ?
Instead , weʼre focused on marketing or sales or product development or hiring or firing or ( God forbid ) legal issues .
Rarely do we deliberately plan for the money .
In some ways , this is a great policy .
Money is a tool , not an end in itself for most bootstrappers .
If you wanted to make big money with little risk , youʼd go to Wall Street or get a fancy job for a conglomerate .
But without money , there is no business .
Run out of money and your creditors will shut you down , your employees will leave , and your spouse will worry .
On at least three occasions , Iʼve come within a few dollars of going bust .
And I can tell you that itʼs stressful , it ʼs distracting , and itʼs no fun .
I also know that in each case , if I had planned for the money , it wouldnʼt have happened .
Planning for the money doesnʼt have to be complicated .
But you do have to be consistent and , most of all , honest with yourself .
Start with the expense side .
Make a list of every fixed expense you face month after month , no matter what .
Rent .
Salaries to other people .
Leases .
Whatever .
Then add to this the actual average variable expenses youʼve faced each month over the last six months .
Are you regularly spending $ 300 a month on travel ?
Put that down .
If your variable expenses vary ( hey , that ʼs no surprise ! ) , then try to get a handle on what percentage they vary every month .
For example , if the money you spend on freelance designers over six months looks like this :
Then you have an average of $ 1,000 a month , but a variation of as much as $ 1,000 a month either way .
As you build your expense analysis , create three columns :
So in this case , youʼd enter
Now , tally up your three columns .
Youʼve just figured out the best and the worst you ʼre ever going to do in expenses .
Multiply your three numbers by 9 .
Now you know how much cash you need to last you nine months if all of your expenses are maximized and you have no revenue .
But of course , you do have revenue .
It can be unpredictable .
So , make two more lists .
In one , list all the guaranteed revenue youʼve got contracts for over the next nine months .
In the other one , list all the likely sources of revenue you expect over the next nine months .
Do n't kid yourself on the upside .
It ʼs one thing to be positive and optimistic in your daily life .
But be a superrealist when it comes time to do revenue projections .
In fact , be a pessimist .
Being pleasantly surprised by an increase in revenue sure beats the alternative .
AN ACCOUNTING ASIDE
Later , when we talk about accountants , Iʼll go into this .
But for now , letʼs be clear : Revenue is revenue when you see the money .
Expenses are expenses when you pay the money .
Cash is king and thatʼs what you keep track of .
Meaning :
If you do some work but donʼt get paid for 90 days , you record the revenue as coming in 90 days , not on the day that you finished the work .
Be a superrealist when it comes time to do revenue projections .
In fact , be a pessimist .
Not built in to any of the numbers youʼve just listed is money for you to live on .
That ʼs on purpose .
Once you realize that changing the amount of money you need to live on can dramatically increase your chances of success , you have an important choice to make :
How much are you willing to sacrifice for the business ?
One surefire way to determine if a bootstrapper is going to succeed or not is to check out how she changes her lifestyle when she starts the business .
If everything is first - class — the office , the car , the mortgage , the vacations — then my bet is that the entrepreneur is too focused on taking from the business and not nearly focused enough on building it .
Jeff Bezos was a mover and shaker on Wall Street , working at the intersection of computer science and finance , when he decided to start an Internet business .
Instead of maintaining his lifestyle in one of Americaʼs most expensive cities , he packed up his car and drove with his wife to a cheaper city with cheaper staffing costs where he pursued a much cheaper lifestyle .
This decision was probably the most important in the success of Amazon.com .
Without it , he never would have had enough money to make it to the day when investors started throwing money at him .
Are you willing to move ?
To sell your car and buy a junker ?
To cut major personal expenses so you have more to invest in your business ?
These are critical decisions , and you need to make them with your family before you run out of money .
Because adjusting your expense cycle then is way too late .
One surefire way to determine if a bootstrapper is going to succeed or not is to check out how she changes her lifestyle when she starts the business .
Hereʼs a quick look at why saving money in advance is so much more profitable than borrowing it later .
In this chart , you can see what the bank balance of fictional company would be under two savings scenarios .
In the first , the company cuts costs so it can bank $ 5,000 a year for each of the first five years , then withdraws $ 5,000 a year in the next five years when it needs to invest in the business .
In the second , it saves nothing in the first five years ( meaning it spends every bit of the profits ) and has to borrow $ 5,000 a year in each of the second five years .
The difference is amazing .
A $ 5,000 annual difference turns into nearly a $ 50,000 difference in the bottom line .
That ʼs the difference between success and failure for most businesses .
Once youʼve come up with your personal expense number , you have what you need to do some smart planning .
Youʼve got a nine - month look at your worst - case expenses , your guaranteed income , and your upside on both counts .
Do you have enough money in the bank to make it if everything goes wrong ?
If you do , congratulations .
Go run your business with focus and with confidence .
Stick with the high road and do the things you need to realize your business plan .
If not , donʼt despair .
You need an alternate plan .
A plan that allows you to spend a percentage of your time each week on low - risk revenue sources .
A way to bring in freelance income while you build your core business .
There are a lot of advantages to the multiple income source strategy .
First , having a cash flow is a good feeling .
It makes you more stable , more confident , more likely to have a successful business .
Second , and just as important , those freelance gigs can easily turn into things that will help your core business .
The time to develop a multiple income source strategy is not when you run out of money .
Then it will be too late .
Letʼs say , for example , you want to develop a career as a stand - up comic .
You know it will take many months of hard work before you can expect serious income .
Along the way , why not make money doing publicity for some of the clubs ?
Doing that can generate some money , teach you to deal with the media , and give you access to club owners .
No need to charge a lot for your services — even an extra $ 100 or $ 200 a week supplementing your budget can make a big difference .
Again , the time to develop a multiple income source strategy is not when you run out of money .
Then it will be too late .
Right now , plan for the money .
While Iʼm a huge fan of the multiple income source strategy , thereʼs an important caveat :
Donʼt let the sideline take over ( unless you want it to ) .
It ʼs so easy to get focused on the short term , on the “ now , ” that you ignore the reason you started the business in the first place .
Suddenly , itʼs five years later and you havenʼt done a stand - up gig for years .
Your comedy career died the day you focused all your energy on the sideline instead of the dream .
KEEPING SCORE
Every month , you need to tally up the numbers you care about .
Write them down .
Share them with your spouse and board of advisers .
Here they are :
ONE LAST THING
Debt .
Debt is so seductive .
You can lease computers .
Use your credit cards .
Mortgage your house .
Borrow from relatives .
Should you do it ?
Let me break the debt down into two groups : professional and family .
Professional debt is expensive .
Eighteen percent on credit cards and leases , less on a mortgage .
Expensive debt carries an interest expense that can make the problem you ʼre trying to solve even worse .
Basically , if you ʼre borrowing money to pay the interest on borrowed money , you ʼre dead .
My rule of thumb is that debt is bad .
Available credit , on the other hand , is good .
If youʼve got a great opportunity and need access to debt , you want to be able to know itʼs available .
But living with debt regularly will enrich everyone at the banks long before it will enrich you .
Did you know that the average family in this country is carrying more than $ 3,000 of expensive credit card debt ?
This is complete lunacy .
If the debt is being used to accelerate the collection of life - enhancing junk that most people buy , itʼs like ripping a hole in your bank account and watching the money ooze out .
Borrowing to build is the only borrowing you should do !
My rule of thumb is that debt is bad .
Available credit , on the other hand , is good .
You should borrow money if the borrowed money is going directly into something that will generate profits exceeding the interest .
For example , if you have a hot new device and 500 orders for it , but you canʼt afford to buy the parts you need to build the things , go ahead and borrow .
You know youʼve got the sales and youʼll be able to pay off the debt in 90 days .
That ʼs good use of professional debt .
On the other hand , if you ʼre borrowing on spec , building something that you hope will sell , youʼve got to have the guts to stare bankruptcy right in the face .
Because if you ʼre wrong , if the opportunity disappears and the debt doesnʼt , you ʼre stuck .
Even worse , if you ʼre borrowing to pay your living expenses and salaries , trying to keep the business going just a few more months until it clicks , you ʼre taking a similar risk .
This is more pressure than yours truly can handle , but you might have a better stomach than I do .
Now , even though Iʼve called this sort of debt “ professional debt , ” it ʼs almost certainly personal .
Meaning that you , the boss , are personally on the hook for the debt .
Real businesses never personally guarantee anything .
When Lee Iacocca ran Chrysler , he didnʼt have to put up his car when the company floated a bond offering !
Thatʼs why companies incorporate .
Borrowing money personally to fund your corporation is risking your personal credit .
And if you ʼre not careful , this can make it easier for other creditors to “ pierce the corporate veil ” and turn the actions of your company against you personally .
And that ʼs bad .
Is your business such a sure thing that you ’re willing to bet everything you own on it ?
When I started , I promised myself I wouldnʼt personally guarantee anything , including debt .
This makes it much harder to get going , but in the long run gives you a level of insulation that makes your business easier to live with .
Once again , itʼs up to you .
But once you choose a policy , stick with it .
If you personally guarantee your business , all the money you earn , from this business or any other , belongs to the bank .
That means the stakes have gotten dramatically higher .
You canʼt just watch this business fail and walk away .
If it fails , you lose it all .
And that means it will take much , much longer for you to bootstrap again .
Is your business such a sure thing that you ʼre willing to bet everything you own on it ?
Family debt is something else entirely .
When I say family , I mean friends , college roommates , parents , anybody crazy enough to put some money up .
Right from the start , youʼve got to be clear about why these people are putting up money .
Is it a chance for them to make some great money by investing in your business ?
Or is it just a vote of confidence in you , with no real expectation of repayment if you fail ?
You must get all the expectations down in writing .
Figure out in advance what the interest rate is , whatʼs the term .
Decide what the collateral is if you canʼt pay it back on time .
You can really screw up some important relationships if you borrow money without both sides understanding whatʼs at stake .
Early in my bootstrapping career , I borrowed $ 10,000 from my mom .
As you can guess , there was no interest and I ʼm not sure my mom ever expected me to pay her back quickly .
But I used the money to invest in a new computer system , which led to significantly increased sales .
She got her money back within six months .
Lucky for me .
What if I hadnʼt been able to pay her back ?
If our expectations hadnʼt matched , there would certainly have been bad feelings — and we all know how quickly misunderstandings about money can damage a relationship .
Later , weʼll talk about how to raise money for your business , not for you .
But for now , the things to remember are :
1. Donʼt borrow money just to cover expenses .
2 . Try to avoid personal borrowing at all costs .
3 . When you borrow money from friends , spell out the terms .
IF YOU HAVE SALES , YOU HAVE ( ALMOST ) EVERYTHING
Be sales - focused .
A well - financed company can afford to build a product and hope customers will come buy it .
You canʼt .
Sales before investment !
A business with plenty of sales can almost always get funding .
A company with plenty of sales can almost always fix its other problems .
But a company without sales is close to dead .
In chapter 2 , I spent a lot of time talking about self - priming businesses .
That ʼs because a self - priming business addresses most concerns of the bootstrapper .
It brings in sales before you get in too deep .
It scales itself — the money you bring in can be used to garner even more money .
A company with plenty of sales can almost always fix its other problems .
But a company without sales is close to dead .
Sooner or later , your business comes down to extracting cash from other people or businesses and keeping as much of it as you can .
It ʼs tempting to focus on your product , your systems , your policies , the writing on page 7 of your brochure .
But none of those matter if you donʼt have sales .
The first question to ask yourself : “ Whoʼs going to pay for this ? ”
Whatever you create has to be so compelling that people will switch from their current solution to whatever it is that you ʼre selling .
Please , please donʼt underestimate how important this is .
Once you have sales , you ʼre in the driverʼs seat .
You can dictate whom you buy from , whom you hire , just about everything about your business .
Donʼt believe me ?
Take a look at the relationships that already exist in business .
Barnes & Noble sells lots of books .
Thatʼs why publishers come and beg them to carry their books .
Disney gets people to wait in line to attend their movies .
Thatʼs why thereʼs a long line of actors and directors waiting to do a movie for Disney .
The customer is king because the customer has money .
If you figure out how to get the money , you become the king !
Here are the two most important sales rules youʼll need :
1. SELL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BUY ( AND KNOW HOW TO BUY ! ) .
This sounds obvious , but in practice , itʼs not .
The Edsel , for example , or jerky - flavored banana chips require a missionary sale , a level of persistence and patience that might not be worth your time .
Microsoft has introduced dozens of products that have failed miserably , and so has Disney , Apple , Motorola and lots of other well - respected ( and some long - gone ) companies .
Figuring out what people want to buy is a two - step process .
The first step is figuring out what they ʼre already buying .
The second step is getting people to switch .
Letʼs say , for example , youʼve got a great idea : welcome mats for corporations custom - made with their logo , perfect for making an even bigger impression on visitors .
Guess what ?
Most companies donʼt have someone in charge of buying this product .
And if they do , that person doesnʼt have a budget for an item like this .
And if she did , sheʼd hesitate because sheʼs never bought anything like it before .
What if her boss hates it ?
What if someone trips and sues the company ?
It will require bravery to buy this product , and guts and persistence for whatever salesman wants to sell it .
In a nutshell , companies donʼt know how to buy a welcome mat , and so if you want to sell one , youʼve got your work cut out for you .
Do you have Post - it notes on your desk ?
If so , it ʼs only because 3 M was persistent enough to spend years marketing them before they caught on .
The problem was simple : they were selling something no one knew they needed .
Office supplies are sold almost entirely on a reorder basis : when you run out of something , you buy more .
But no one had any Post - it notes , so they never ran out .
While a Post - it note is a great product , the company had a serious problem .
There was no one in each prospect company assigned to purchase such an item , and the cost of the sale was very , very high compared to the anticipated profit .
What will it take to get people to switch from what they already use to whatI sell ?
The solution was elegant .
The chairman of 3 M had his secretary send a case of Post - it notes to the secretaries of the other Fortune 500 chairmen .
And they started using them .
Suddenly , people from the other companies were running around saying , “ Hey , where can I get some of these ? ”
And when they ran out , they had to reorder .
This was a risky bootstrap solution from a big company .
If it hadnʼt worked , 3 M would have folded the product .
It ʼs so much easier to sell something that people are already buying .
Which leads to the second question : “ What will it take to get people to switch from what they already use to what I sell ? ”
Believe it or not , the answer is almost always not money .
Why ?
Because a trusted supplier will lower her rates enough to make your offer less interesting .
Why ?
Because switching to a low cost supplier who does a bad job can cost the purchaser his or her job .
Why ?
Because most products are purchased because of what they do , not what they cost .

I was greatly anticipating Scott Rosenberg ’s , co-creator of Salon , new book , Dreaming in code and was happy to get a free copy in the mail .
In short : I enjoyed the book and recommend it – it ’s a good , though uneven , book exploring why software is hard to make .
I read most of it in one night and finished it off in a second , and despite anything else i say , that ’s an endorsement of any book of any kind .
However my take on the book is unavoidably hurt by its lead praise from James Fallows , of The Atlantic , who said ‘ The first true successor to Tracy Kidder ’s The Soul of a New Machine ’ , in reference the Pulitzer prize and National book award winner that defined the ‘ computer engineering as human narrative ’ genre .
Kidder ’s book was personally seminal and I have respect for Fallows , but it ’s misguided praise , and worked to Rosenberg ’s disadvantage .
I do n’t think his intent as an author was to write the same kind of book , and the comparisons in my mind did n’t help .
However , as an author I ’m ambivalent on the appropriateness , or dangers , of comparing a book based on what it ’s blurbs say , so I ’ll leave it at that .
Dreaming in code is three books woven into one : one of them is a narrative story of of the Mitch Kapor led project to create a new PIM application called Chandler .
The other threads introduce software concepts ( e.g. explaining object oriented programming and how Python differs from C++ ) and explores why software is hard to make .
All big topics , and fun ground for Rosenberg ’s curiosity and intelligence to explore .
The book struggles however with keeping them together : the 3 threads are uneven , and I was often unsure where he was going , or when we ’d get back to the Chandler story , the one I expected to be , based on the cover and Kidder reference , the focus of the book .
For example , the book dances between assuming the reader has tech - interests vs. being a layperson , with side threads into esoterics like Hungarian notation and Literate programming , that made me wonder .
Most books in this genre do n’t go that far , drawing the line around the depth of what a magazine feature article would explain : even Digital woes , a favorite book on why software fails , nails the topic without getting into construction or showing code samples .
Steven Levy ’s Insanely Great , about making the Macintosh computer , or Zachary ’s ShowStopper , about Windows NT , are classics in this genre , and unlike them Dreaming in code has a higher degree of difficulty : it does n’t have a star central project at the book ’s core .
I would never have heard of Chandler without picking up the book .
Mitch Kapor and Andy Hertzfeld , industry pioneers and legends , play leading roles which adds some star power , but they ’re not the focus .
And without the natural tension of a big well known project , the players in the book feel light : the drama and passion that are integral parts of good projects are n’t there ( and it ’s something Kidder went to great lengths to capture ) .
I ca n’t tell if that ’s Rosenberg ’s polite reporting , or something missing in the project itself , but the emotional commitments of people to each other , and the project , is critical to making good software , and might be the secret Rosenberg seems to seek in the book , but it ’s never mentioned .
That said , Rosenberg is smart and insightful , and the book has its share of gems .
Ideas from many luminaries are touched on , from Doug Englebart , Fred Brooks , Alan Kay , Richard Stallman , Don Knuth , Watts Humphrey and more .
The result is a good , often charming book , that would be good fodder for a team to read together , discussing their own opinions as each chapter unfolds .
But with the rickety management example of Chandler at the book ’s core , software management , as a discipline , is portrayed as an immature , misguided , geeky business : perhaps an accurate snapshot of the average team today , but not of the best .
Rosenfeld does n’t give serious context until the last 1/3rd of the book , when Joel Spolsky , 37 Signals , and Google ’s theories surface as cautious remedies to the challenges Chandler faced , but the vibe is cynical , and I found myself , especially with Chandler as the example , defensively optimistic about what a good project manager could have done .
As a sweet side note , Rosenberg did uncover thought provokers I had n’t heard before :
Alan Kay ’s wonderful software as a doghouse metaphor
Linus Torvalds on how you should start large projects
Richard Gabriel ’s passionate criticism of programming education
Rosenberg ’s perspective cuts both ways : his outsider view is an advantage as he asks questions veterans and gurus have forgotten or are scared of , which paves new ground on old topics .
But it you want guidance , harder critiques , or expert analysis of what to learn from Chandler , you ’ll need to discuss the book with someone else , or look elsewhere .
A Chapter is available online , and it ’s worth a look .

Oregon Trail Deluxe
Review 1 :
Probably the least known entry in MECC 's famous Oregon Trail series that is now up to the fourth edition , Oregon Trail Deluxe is a solid VGA remake of the 1988 original Oregon Trail release that set new standards in edutainment .
Notable for being the last floppy - based release of this series , Oregon Trail Deluxe is great to look at and a lot of fun to play .
As in the original game , Oregon Trail Deluxe puts you in the year 1848 as the Gold Rush was in full swing .
Your goal : emigrate from the US ' East Coast to Oregon in the West before winter sets in .
After deciding which occupation your alter ego has , you will plan for a long journey by buying food , spare wagon wheels , bullets , mules , and other necessities .
There are many factors to take into account while you are on the road .
Pushing your animals too hard can cause them to collapse from exhaustion .
From time to time , the game will offer you a choice between two or more routes to take , each with its own advantages and disadvantages .
Tough decisions like these are half the fun of Oregon Trail , and what makes the game varied and interesting .
To liven up your journey , you will pass several notable monuments along the way , each with a short but concise description and / or history .
As in the first game , there several arcade - style mini-games , including hunting and fishing .
And there are more opportunities to talk to and trade with other pioneers this time around .
The on - line help is always available to give you hints throughout the game , and Oregon Trail Deluxe comes complete with comprehensive historical reference about objects , people , and places .
Overall , this last floppy version of the game is a very nice update to the original edutainment classic , and arguably the best version before MECC went down the " multimedia extravaganza " route , releasing Oregon Trail II and subsequent entries on CD - ROM that focus more on form than content .
Review 2 :
Offering adventure , educational , role - playing ( rpg ) , strategy , simulation in a world of history , managerial , real - time , Oregon Trail Deluxe is an abandonware developed by MECC and published by MECC .
Released in 1992 , you wander around in a perspective .
The Oregon Trail , well known road crossing the Rocky Mountains used by the settlers in the 19th century .
MECC made an educational game based on this memorable part on the USA story .
The player must cross the oregon trail and fight against the difficulties the settlers had .
Hunting for food , trading supplies , survive LOTS of possible deaths ( snakes , typhoid , dysentry ... ) .
Should you succeed in your journey , your points will be based on your profession , the number of settlers still alive , your remaining cash and much more .
Oregon Trail was played by a lot of American people born in the eighties and the game stay into memory as one hard , unforgiving and unbeatable game .
Some family would eventually play the game together and children in school would even make competition over who got the farthest before dying in the game !

Why The Morning - After Pill Is Pro-Life
By Steve Chapman
If you want to locate the dividing line between what is morally accepted and what is morally controversial in modern America , you can often find it at Wal - Mart .
The retail giant declines to stock unrated movies , CDs that carry parental advisory warnings , and raunchy magazines such as Maxim and FHM .
It does carry birth control pills -- but not morning - after pills .
Why is that ?
Because most Americans are far more comfortable with birth control than they are with abortion .
The pro-life movement has long opposed the morning - after pill as abortion in disguise , not the " emergency contraception " it is supposed to be .
Anti-abortion groups argue that by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg , it destroys a fetus .
That reputation has made many people justifiably leery of it .
And that reputation apparently has been enough to deter the Food and Drug Administration from approving an application to allow over - the - counter sales of the medication known as Plan B .
But it turns out the reputation is groundless .
The best scientific evidence we have indicates that the morning - after pill serves to block fertilization , while having no effect on implantation .
That makes it contraception , not abortion .
As a longtime pro-lifer , I think anti-abortion groups had solid grounds to oppose the morning - after pill when its function was unclear -- as I did .
But given what we now know , it 's a grave mistake to keep opposing it .
In fact , there are grounds for celebration : A drug once believed to produce abortion is found to prevent abortion .
For almost two years , the FDA has delayed making any final decision on the application -- ignoring the advice of its own medical experts , who said it should be sold without a prescription .
In August , Susan F. Wood , head of its Office of Women 's Health , quit in protest , saying she could " no longer serve when scientific and clinical evidence , fully evaluated and recommended for approval by professional staff here , has been overruled . "
This week , the Government Accountability Office , an investigative arm of Congress , released a report that gave a withering critique of the agency 's handling of the issue .
It concluded that high - level FDA officials decided against Plan B before the scientific review had been done , as part of an approach the GAO described with such adjectives as " unusual , " " novel " and " unprecedented " -- a polite , bureaucratic way of saying " outrageous . "
Many groups that oppose abortion have no use for Plan B. The American Life League says , " Plan B aborts children and hurts women . "
Concerned Women for America opposes it partly because of its " abortifacient potential . "
But they 're aiming at the wrong target .
The data that have been compiled on the morning - after pill in recent years make a convincing case that if you oppose abortion , you have no quarrel with Plan B .
In June , Chicago Tribune reporters Judy Peres and Jeremy Manier reported a surprising consensus among experts that " there is no scientific evidence the pills prevent implantation -- and considerable evidence they work mainly by blocking the release of an egg from the woman 's ovary , so no embryo is formed . "
They cited a study by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm which found that the pill 's effects " involve either blockade or delay of ovulation . . . rather than inhibition of implantation . "
Dr. David Archer , director of clinical research at the Contraceptive Research and Development Program of Eastern Virginia Medical School , said " there 's no evidence scientifically " that Plan B is an abortifacient .
The GAO report agrees .
The drug , it concluded , can prevent pregnancy by impeding sperm and by delaying ovulation , but it has " not been shown to cause a post - fertilization event -- a change in the uterus that could interfere with implantation of a fertilized egg . "
There is no way to be 100 percent sure that emergency contraception never interferes with implantation .
But the mere possibility of an adverse event is a poor reason to reject its use .
After all , breast - feeding is known to cause uterine changes that can prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted .
No one in the pro-life movement would say mothers should therefore abstain from nursing .
Just as nursing is morally and ethically permissible because it advances worthy purposes , so is the morning - after pill .
If emergency contraception were widely and easily available , it could prevent a lot of pregnancies that would otherwise end , tragically , in abortion .
That 's reason enough for the FDA to approve over - the - counter sales .
For anyone who believes in the sanctity of life from the moment of conception , Plan B is not an enemy but an ally .
March 23 , 2007  --
The president of pet food maker Menu Foods , which last week issued a recall of 60 million cans and pouches of pet food after a rash of animal sickness and death , said today that the company would reimburse pet owners who can trace their pets ' illnesses to the company 's products .
Earlier today , New York State veterinary health investigators announced that the pet food responsible for pet deaths around the country was contaminated with the rodent poison aminopterin .
" A pet is an important part of any family , " Paul Henderson , the president and CEO of Menu Foods , said at a Toronto press conference .
" We understand what pet ownership is . "
While Henderson described himself as " angry " over the massive recall and the impact it has had on hundreds of pets , he also said the company has not stopped manufacturing at the two plants believed to have produced the contaminated pet food .
Instead , he said the company , which manufactures nearly 100 brands of dog and cat food , will immediately begin testing any " suspect raw materials " to identify any additional contaminated products .
" We have the support of our customers , we have the support of our employees , " Henderson said .
" We 're confident in the future and we remain confident we can put this behind us . "
Investigators , meanwhile , are looking into whether the rat poison came into the United States on an ingredient used in the recalled food .
ABC News has learned that Menu Foods bought wheat gluten , the only ingredient changed in its plants , from China .
That possibility raises questions about the safety of pet and other food products in the United States .
The chemical can cause kidney failure in dogs and cats , said Donald Smith , dean of Cornell University 's College of Veterinary Medicine , during the conference .
Scientists at the state 's food laboratory in Albany , N.Y. , made the discovery a week after Menu Foods issued its recall .
" This is one step in a long process that will lead us to know what has happened and how it has happened , " Smith said .
Aminopterin is not registered for use as a pesticide in the United States , and it has been known as a potential source of birth defects in humans .
Interestingly , trials are under way to test the chemical 's effectiveness in the treatment of certain types of cancer .
ABC News first reported that the rodenticide may have been present in the wheat that was imported from China and used by Menu Foods , according to a source close to the investigation .
Some Vets Remain Skeptical
Some veterinary experts say they are still skeptical as to whether the chemical is responsible for the kidney damage the pets endured .
" With the information that we have , none of us feel that this product fits the lesions we are seeing , but there may be information we do n't know yet , " said Lawrence McGill , a veterinary pathologist in Salt Lake City .
" The feeling is that there are more questions than answers with this product . "
" Renal failure is not the expected response to these drugs , " said Susan Weinstein , executive director of the Massachusetts Veterinary Medical Association .
She added that most rodent poisons work as severe anticoagulants -- meaning they cause the rats that ingest them to bleed to death .
" Whether this particular toxin in this case can create renal failure depends on how this drug works in the body , which may be an entirely different pathway than the anticoagulants , " Weinstein said .
" Because we are n't yet familiar with this toxin , we can't be confident of the causation link . "
Investigators also have not yet determined whether aminopterin is the only contaminant in all the recalled food .
" If it is not the only culprit , as I suspect , the problem is n't over , " McGill said , adding that it is also uncertain as to whether the finding will be much help to veterinarians .
According to McGill , even if the aminopterin is the culprit , " most veterinarians have never heard of this product .
There will need to be more information put out to suggest therapeutic regimens . "
Concerns May Spur Regulatory Response
With the widespread notoriety of the deaths associated with the contaminated pet food , some are beginning to speculate whether the result could be greater regulation of pet food safety .
" Certainly , finding something like this would have everyone step back and say , ' How do we make sure this never happens again ? ' " said Sandy Wellis , communications chair of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine .
" Knowing our public , they would probably like more regulation , and it may occur , but it has n't happened with previous situations like this , " McGill said .
" There is a call for it , but will the public pay for it because it will make pet food more expensive . "
It would not be the first time the suggestion has been made that games programmers hold at least one key to the future for business systems development .
But IBM 's latest research project - a " secret island " within the confines of Linden Labs ' Second Life massively multi-player games environment - brings that possibility a whole lot closer .
The basic premise is to exploit the multi-player and graphics capabilities at which games programmers now generally excel to create an on - screen virtual analogue of a business .
The idea behind this is simple , according to Irving Wladawsky - Berger , vice president of technology strategy and innovation at IBM .
" Government and enterprise back - end systems are getting ever more complex , with even printers having IP addresses .
Can people cope with designing such systems , let alone use them ?
Technology is at its best when it is providing something intuitive , something very visual and graphic . "
Visualisation tools are already well - advanced in engineering and science , but he feels there is a long way to go in areas such as business modeling and management .
When it comes to modeling and simulation , the cutting edge with graphics utilisation is in gaming .
So IBM has decided to use the capabilities already developed by Linden Labs for its Second Life gaming environment to build a separate , experimental area within it .
Participants – from IBM research and development departments around the world – can contribute whatever they feel is important to create a productive environment in which to conduct and manage " business " .
As with Second Life , participants create an online " avatar " to represent them .
There is already a business psychology aspect emerging here , revolving around whether the avatar should be a close approximation of the individual 's appearance ( probably suitable for a " conservative " or " professional " business image ) or some more adventurous expression of the participant 's view of their personality ( for the fart and flair brigade ) .
Essentially , when a meeting is called , the participants ' avatars appear in a Second Life , 25 MByte , online container that appears on each of their PCs .
Communications can be by key - entry text or VoIP if that is appropriate .
With text , all the contributions can be easily and fully minuted , and the probability is that speech - to - text systems will allow the same for speech - based interactions in the near future .
The IBM developers , led by Hursley - based Ian Hughes ( who has the to - die - for job title of Metaverse Evangelist ) are also making use of appropriate " gadgets " developed by other Second Life players .
For example , one such gadget has been adapted to create a simple coffee table tool that creates a chair round it whenever a participant wishes to " sit down " .
The team itself is contributing gadgets to Second Life , including a language translator system .
This has been provided free to Second Life mentors and is available for sale on the system .
It has also developed a portal to an external business system – in this case Amazon – which can then be used by all participants .
This has already highlighted the need for one or more APIs that will be needed to allow customisable integration of the system with all relevant external business systems .
The advantage over phone or video conferencing systems is that participants feel they are much more " there " – for example , it is far easier to identify who is communicating what at any one time .
It also adds the scope to move away from a formal meeting to relax or " play " , or perhaps hold a breakout meeting , all of which can help creativity .
Wladawsky - Berger would not be drawn on timescales or detailed development plans – though the hint is that if this experiment works IBM may set about developing its own , more business - oriented implementation of the idea .
The experiment is , however , already throwing up areas for serious consideration , not least the complexities that might arise with managing the licensing of the IP behind useful gadgets and add - ons .
Less obvious and tangible issues will revolve around the development of etiquette and behavioral rules .
" We are starting to address and define the issues and problems involved , " he said .
He is also looking at the potential the system might have for furthering the disaggregation of business structures .
At one extreme this could lead to their being no " businesses " as we know them today – everyone would be self - employed .
More likely however , certainly in the mid-term , is that it could provide a very useful tool for companies and participants to manage and work with a project as a perceivable entity , with participants that could be drawn from many departments within the company , anywhere in the world , as well as business partners , customers and suppliers . ®
One feels that NF Simpson 's judge might have felt at home this week with the logic of the law lords ' decision in the case of Vincent and Michael Hickey in their battle for compensation for their wrongful conviction in 1979 for the murder of newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater .
It was decided , by a four - one majority , that the pair , who spent more than 12 years in jail for a murder they did not commit , must pay the " living expenses " they incurred in prison and which have been deducted from their compensation package .
The law lords said the deduction , which amounted to around £ 50,000 each , should not be seen as board and lodging , but as expenses they would have had to pay from their earnings if they had been free .
The dissenting judge , Lord Rodger , likened the men's ordeal to a " prolonged kidnapping " ; and the Hickeys ' solicitor , Susie Labinjoh , said that the decision " offends against justice " - but , unless a challenge succeeds in Europe , it will stand .
The Hickeys are only two of many who were victims of miscarriages of justice who have effectively had to pay for their porridge .
Paddy Hill , one of the Birmingham Six , who was also wrongfully jailed , has been campaigning vigorously to halt these deductions , which are made for prisoners wrongly convicted in England and Wales but not in Scotland .
" They treat us worse than the guilty , " said Hill , likening the experience of being suddenly released after many years proclaiming your innocence to that of a diver coming to the surface too fast and suffering from the bends .
Reg Dudley , now 82 , who spent more than 20 years inside before being cleared on appeal , says that he too would have fought against the deductions , but the legal process just takes too long .
Anyone who has spent a couple of decades inside for a crime they did not commit , or been vilified as a bomber or a child killer while in jail , will say that no amount of money will ever compensate them for the damage and time .
But if there is a logic to deducting B&B expenses from a wrongly convicted person , why should it stop at the costs of board and lodging ?
With the cost of travel shooting up all the time , is n't this the moment to ask whether any of the freed men and women ever put their hands in their pockets to pay for their speedy and secure transport from the Old Bailey to Parkhurst , or from Birmingham crown court to Dartmoor ?
Private gyms are now a major expense for the busy professional , yet wrongly convicted prisoners have been able to tone their muscles with weights and play badminton , without ever bothering to pay a monthly fee .
Surely some room for deductions there ?
And at a time when many people in the hectic outside world are spending hundreds of pounds to go on a retreat , should n't prisoners who have spent long months in solitary confinement pay an equivalent amount for the peace and tranquillity of that experience ?
China has already shown the way forward by charging relatives of executed prisoners for the price of the bullet .
And if anyone objects to reducing the compensation packages even further , we can always quote NF Simspon 's judge : " The law is not to be cheated in this way . "
duncan.campbell@theguardian.com
In August , 2001 , the American television channel CBS aired an interview with a Hamas activist Muhammad Abu Wardeh , who recruited terrorists for suicide bombings in Israel .
Abu Wardeh was quoted as saying : " I described to him how God would compensate the martyr for sacrificing his life for his land .
If you become a martyr , God will give you 70 virgins , 70 wives and everlasting happiness . "
Wardeh was in fact shortchanging his recruits since the rewards in Paradise for martyrs was 72 virgins .
But I am running ahead of things .
Since September 11 , news stories have repeated the story of suicide bombers and their heavenly rewards , and equally Muslim scholars and Western apologists of Islam have repeated that suicide is forbidden in Islam .
Suicide ( qatlu nafsi-hi ) is not referred to in the Koran but is indeed forbidden in the Traditions ( Hadith in Arabic ) , which are the collected sayings and doings attributed to the Prophet and traced back to him through a series of putatively trustworthy witnesses .
They include what was done in his presence that he did not forbid , and even the authoritative sayings and doings of his companions .
But the Hamas spokesman correctly uses the word martyr ( shahid ) and not suicide bomber , since those who blow themselves up almost daily in Israel and those who died on September 11 were dying in the noblest of all causes , Jihad , which is an incumbent religious duty , established in the Koran and in the Traditions as a divine institution , and enjoined for the purpose of advancing Islam .
While suicide is forbidden , martyrdom is everywhere praised , welcomed , and urged : " By the Being in Whose Hand is my life , I love that I should be killed in the way of Allah ; then I should be brought back to life and be killed again in His way ... " ;
" The Prophet said , ' Nobody who enters Paradise will ever like to return to this world even if he were offered everything , except the martyr who will desire to return to this world and be killed 10 times for the sake of the great honour that has been bestowed upon him ' . "
[ Sahih Muslim , chapters 781 , 782 , The Merit of Jihad and the Merit of Martyrdom . ]
What of the rewards in paradise ?
The Islamic paradise is described in great sensual detail in the Koran and the Traditions ; for instance , Koran sura 56 verses 12 - 40 ; sura 55 verses 54 - 56 ; sura 76 verses 12 - 22 .
I shall quote the celebrated Penguin translation by NJ Dawood of sura 56 verses 12 - 39 : " They shall recline on jewelled couches face to face , and there shall wait on them immortal youths with bowls and ewers and a cup of purest wine ( that will neither pain their heads nor take away their reason ) ; with fruits of their own choice and flesh of fowls that they relish .
And theirs shall be the dark - eyed houris , chaste as hidden pearls : a guerdon for their deeds ...
We created the houris and made them virgins , loving companions for those on the right hand ... "
One should note that most translations , even those by Muslims themselves such as A Yusuf Ali , and the British Muslim Marmaduke Pickthall , translate the Arabic ( plural ) word Abkarun as virgins , as do well - known lexicons such the one by John Penrice .
I emphasise this fact since many pudic and embarrassed Muslims claim there has been a mistranslation , that " virgins " should be replaced by " angels " .
In sura 55 verses 72 - 74 , Dawood translates the Arabic word " hur " as " virgins " , and the context makes clear that virgin is the appropriate translation : " Dark - eyed virgins sheltered in their tents ( which of your Lord 's blessings would you deny ? ) whom neither man nor jinnee will have touched before . "
The word hur occurs four times in the Koran and is usually translated as a " maiden with dark eyes " .
Two points need to be noted .
First , there is no mention anywhere in the Koran of the actual number of virgins available in paradise , and second , the dark - eyed damsels are available for all Muslims , not just martyrs .
It is in the Islamic Traditions that we find the 72 virgins in heaven specified : in a Hadith ( Islamic Tradition ) collected by Al - Tirmidhi ( died 892 CE [ common era * ] ) in the Book of Sunan ( volume IV , chapters on The Features of Paradise as described by the Messenger of Allah [ Prophet Muhammad ] , chapter 21 , About the Smallest Reward for the People of Paradise , ( Hadith 2687 ) .
The same hadith is also quoted by Ibn Kathir ( died 1373 CE ) in his Koranic commentary ( Tafsir ) of Surah Al - Rahman ( 55 ) , verse 72 : " The Prophet Muhammad was heard saying : ' The smallest reward for the people of paradise is an abode where there are 80,000 servants and 72 wives , over which stands a dome decorated with pearls , aquamarine , and ruby , as wide as the distance from Al - Jabiyyah [ a Damascus suburb ] to Sana 'a [ Yemen ] ' . "
Modern apologists of Islam try to downplay the evident materialism and sexual implications of such descriptions , but , as the Encyclopaedia of Islam says , even orthodox Muslim theologians such as al Ghazali ( died 1111 CE ) and Al - Ash'ari ( died 935 CE ) have " admitted sensual pleasures into paradise " .
The sensual pleasures are graphically elaborated by Al - Suyuti ( died 1505 ) , Koranic commentator and polymath .
He wrote : " Each time we sleep with a houri we find her virgin .
Besides , the penis of the Elected never softens .
The erection is eternal ; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint .
Each chosen one [ ie Muslim ] will marry seventy [ sic ] houris , besides the women he married on earth , and all will have appetising vaginas . "
One of the reasons Nietzsche hated Christianity was that it " made something unclean out of sexuality " , whereas Islam , many would argue , was sex-positive .
One cannot imagine any of the Church fathers writing ecstatically of heavenly sex as al - Suyuti did , with the possible exception of St Augustine before his conversion .
But surely to call Islam sex-positive is to insult all Muslim women , for sex is seen entirely from the male point of view ; women 's sexuality is admitted but seen as something to be feared , repressed , and a work of the devil .
Scholars have long pointed out that these images are clearly drawn pictures and must have been inspired by the art of painting .
Muhammad , or whoever is responsible for the descriptions , may well have seen Christian miniatures or mosaics representing the gardens of paradise and has interpreted the figures of angels rather literally as those of young men and young women .
A further textual influence on the imagery found in the Koran is the work of Ephrem the Syrian [ 306-373 CE ] , Hymns on Paradise , written in Syriac , an Aramaic dialect and the language of Eastern Christianity , and a Semitic language closely related to Hebrew and Arabic .
This naturally leads to the most fascinating book ever written on the language of the Koran , and if proved to be correct in its main thesis , probably the most important book ever written on the Koran .
Christoph Luxenberg 's book , Die Syro - Aramaische Lesart des Koran , available only in German , came out just over a year ago , but has already had an enthusiastic reception , particularly among those scholars with a knowledge of several Semitic languages at Princeton , Yale , Berlin , Potsdam , Erlangen , Aix - en - Provence , and the Oriental Institute in Beirut .
Luxenberg tries to show that many obscurities of the Koran disappear if we read certain words as being Syriac and not Arabic .
We can not go into the technical details of his methodology but it allows Luxenberg , to the probable horror of all Muslim males dreaming of sexual bliss in the Muslim hereafter , to conjure away the wide - eyed houris promised to the faithful in suras XLIV.54 ; LII.20 , LV.72 , and LVI .22 .
Luxenberg 's new analysis , leaning on the Hymns of Ephrem the Syrian , yields " white raisins " of " crystal clarity " rather than doe- eyed , and ever willing virgins - the houris .
Luxenberg claims that the context makes it clear that it is food and drink that is being offerred , and not unsullied maidens or houris .
In Syriac , the word hur is a feminine plural adjective meaning white , with the word " raisin " understood implicitly .
Similarly , the immortal , pearl - like ephebes or youths of suras such as LXXVI.19 are really a misreading of a Syriac expression meaning chilled raisins ( or drinks ) that the just will have the pleasure of tasting in contrast to the boiling drinks promised the unfaithful and damned .
As Luxenberg 's work has only recently been published we must await its scholarly assessment before we can pass any judgements .
But if his analysis is correct then suicide bombers , or rather prospective martyrs , would do well to abandon their culture of death , and instead concentrate on getting laid 72 times in this world , unless of course they would really prefer chilled or white raisins , according to their taste , in the next .

It is , in all seriousness , it is a distressing and depressing time to be a conservative .
I 'm reminded of the old saying by Mao -- things are always darkest before they go completely black .
In recent years , we have watched a Republican Congress disgrace itself with its association with scandal , with its willful lack of fiscal discipline , and with its utter disinterest in the reforms that America needs .
And at the same time , we watched a Republican President abet or passively accept the excesses of his Congressional party and , more importantly , fail to take the steps - until perhaps now - fail to take the steps to win a major foreign war .
. . .
So we need to figure out a way how to make conservative policy and principles appealing and relevant again to the American public , and we need to do it together .

In that worldview , what matters was the ideological analysis : good versus evil .
What mattered was the assertion of the United States ' right to act alone if necessary to defend its own security .
What mattered was the zero-sum analysis that we had to choose between war against Saddam and a potential mushroom cloud in an American city .
It was this rigid and abstract analysis that essentially abolished the idea that the war was subject to rational debate .
. . .
The fundamentalist makes his mind up instantly , makes the fundamental decision , and cannot , by necessity , stop short at a later date and ask himself if he 's right .
Such second - guessing undermines his entire worldview .
It threatens his psychological core .

UPDATE
Every one of us might be aware and must be aware the hazardous effect of a nicotine and exposing and ingesting ourselves with high concentrations would lead to diseases and fatality .
This does not go along with your traditional cigarette but also with what you think is safer for you and that ’s your eJuice for vaping .
Yes , this might be a healthier option yet there could be possibly harmful circumstances if you do n’t follow the instructions below .
Read and spread the awareness .
Always keep control of usage
This means that you must be responsible with your consumption just like of what is advised when you are to consume your alcohol for both alcohol and nicotine could bring serious illnesses to a human body .
Another control that you need to establish is the safety of where you keep , where you use and where you dispose your eJuices .
These are colorful substances that children might find it very attractive and edible .
Yet behind the sweet smell and the fruity colors , this might be a deadly snack for your kids .
Another thing is when you expose this product to your teens and awaken their curiosity making them smoke secretly and would open another opportunity to any other vices .
When to Dispose of YoureJuices
Typical brands of eJuices only last for a half of year after opening .
Yet you could always extend the shelf life of your eJuice when you have it stored properly and neatly .
Another tip is that , when you have your eJuicessweeter than any other flavors , well , this kind has shorter shelf life .
Tasting through small puffs would let you know how your eJuice is going another is when the liquid changes its color , you will notice that when you choose a higher nicotine content eJuices , the faster they will get darker .
Proper Disposal
Many of the users may have it flushed directly into the toilet or into the sink , and that is something that could harm and damage the aquifer , so you must stop doing that right until it happens .
Both drugs and nicotine rich substances are now being minimized in flushing with the drainage for they may cause serious build ups that may affect the comfort and the health of the community .
So the best thing that you could do about it is to dump it and have it absorbed with solid yet absorbent substances such as used diapers , sawdust , or even with your coffee grounds .
After which , wrap in in a paper or newspaper to secure and have it disposed of for them to be dropped on your local landfill .
This will avoid the substance to just be around your community and will run off at the dump site , no one would be harmed by it then .
These are the best ways that you could dispose of your eJuice from eliquid - depot.com , so the next time you finished a bottle , you are sure of what to do , making you a better and responsible citizen .

A common criticism of positive thinking is that it ’s self - delusion .
Images of Saturday Night Live ’s Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley come to mind : “ I ’m good enough , I ’m smart enough , and doggone it , people like me ! ”
I happen to think this criticism is perfectly valid .
I do n’t do daily affirmations or recommend them to others because I think they ’re a waste of time .
Too much positive thinking can lead to self - delusion .
You experience a false sense of growth because you lower your awareness , blinding yourself to your problems instead of truly facing them .
As a general rule of personal development , whenever you do something that lowers your awareness instead of raises it , you ’re making a mistake .
Personal growth is more than merely conditioning yourself to feel better about your life .
While some people clearly need an attitudinal adjustment to make progress , the optimal attitude for personal growth does n’t arise from self - delusional positive thinking .
You do n’t need positive thinking for personal growth .
You simply need intelligence .
If you find that your personal growth efforts are in conflict with what your intelligence is telling you , trust your own intelligence , regardless of what anyone else says , including me .
I ’ve read hundreds of self - help books over the years , and a significant percentage of them included exercises which I felt at the time were pointless and stupid .
But I usually did them anyway because I figured the author probably knew more than me and that there would be a good reason for doing them .
But I was right .
Those exercises were just fluff , and I got much better results when I began trusting my own intelligence above what any self - help book contained .
I just wish it had n’t taken me years to figure that out .
There are three key components of intelligence as it relates to personal growth : self - trust , awareness , and fearlessness .
Note that positive thinking is n’t one of them .
Self - trust
In the long run , it ’s more important to learn to trust your own intelligence than it is to be right .
At first your self - trust may be misplaced .
You may very well find that you make a lot of dumb decisions by trusting yourself ahead of people who seem to know more .
But through this process of failure , you ’ll develop your intellectual capacity and expand your awareness , and soon your self - trust will be justified , and you ’ll begin making some really empowering decisions that actually generate results .
Follow Shakespeare ’s advice , “ To thine own self be true , ” even when it gets you into trouble initially , and eventually your faith in yourself will be well - earned .
The reason for self - trust becomes clear when you consider the alternative , which is never to fully trust yourself .
You ca n’t really behave intelligently if you ca n’t trust your own decisions and act on them .
Imagine what would happen if your computer was always doubtful about its computations , so it figured it was best not to share the results with you for fear of being wrong .
It would be useless .
And it ’s fair to say that a human being who cannot trust him / herself is somewhat useless , in the sense that s/he is living far below his / her potential .
But in that case , the most likely outcome is that this person will end up serving whatever goals social conditioning imparts .
In the USA this means getting a job , going into debt , and gaining weight , among other things .
It ’s fine to put more faith in your scuba instructor when you know nothing about scuba .
That is n’t a self - trust issue .
Self - trust comes into play when you make the big decisions of your life , such as those involving your career , your choice of mate , your spiritual beliefs , and how you will live .
It is n’t intelligent to let your parents , your spouse , or your social conditioning make these decisions for you .
I guarantee that if someone else makes these decisions on your behalf , your results in life will be nothing but a pale shadow of your true potential .
Trust your own intelligence , even when it does n’t seem warranted to do so .
For example , if you think I ’m full of B.S. , then do n’t read anything more from me .
Seek out sources of knowledge that resonate with you on a deep level .
You wo n’t always be right , but you ’ll learn from your mistakes , and soon your self - trust will be warranted .
And that ’s when you ’ll really begin to shine – when you can trust yourself fully AND be justified in doing so .
Look upon self - trust as a skill to be developed , one that you must keep pushing towards congruency .
It ’s perfectly OK to be wrong now and then .
Awareness
Awareness is a crucial component of intelligence .
To make intelligent decisions , you need accurate data .
If you ignore valid data , you lower your awareness and thereby your intelligence .
Imagine how your computer would function if it simply disregarded the contents of its memory on occasion : “ I ’m not going to read that part of my RAM because it looks like there ’s a lot of work for me to do in there . ”
Stupid of course … yet this is precisely what we humans do that holds us back .
Positive thinking can reduce intelligence by lowering awareness .
Instead of facing your real problems and challenges , you try to write them off with affirmations .
That is n’t the way to grow .
It ’s better to face and accept the whole truth , even if you do n’t like what you see .
A little pain now and then is n’t going to kill you .
Part of awareness involves acknowledging your weaknesses .
I do n’t affirm that my weaknesses do n’t exist .
I simply say to myself , “ Yup .
That ’s a weakness . ”
Then I can consciously choose to work on it or not .
There ’s only so much time to devote to personal growth , so we humans cannot fix all our problems overnight .
But we can make progress on the ones that matter most – if we acknowledge their existence .
Some of my personal weaknesses include :
Fashion .
My wife keeps submitting applications to Queer Eye for the Straight Guy on my behalf .
That pretty much says it all .
Being colorblind does n’t help , nor does the fact that I wore uniforms for eight years of my life ( Catholic school ) .
Plus I ’m not gay .

Cars .
I ’m typing this blog entry on a PC I built myself , but I never look under the hood of my car .
I do n’t even know how to change the oil .
My Dad is very skilled at auto maintenance , but I ’ve never shared his passion .
I ’m strictly a computer guy .
Unfortunately , I really need a new car soon , since my 1994 Pontiac has 156,000 miles on it and is on its last legs .
But this is an area where I have no idea what I ’m doing .
Mostly I ’m annoyed we do n’t have transporters yet .
I ’m aware of these weaknesses and many others , but I ’ve chosen not to work on them because there are other things which are much more important to me .
I do n’t do positive affirmations and then work on my car .
A mechanic does the work .
I enjoy listening to music almost every day ( trance is my favorite genre ) , but I use writing and speaking as my creative outlets .
And when it comes to dressing myself , I use that as a tool for humor , which makes it easier for me to genuinely connect with people .
Did you know that it ’s possible to acknowledge your weaknesses with no loss of self - esteem ?
If you have a bad marriage , a job you hate , or a belly that ’s way too big , it ’s better to acknowledge it and keep your awareness high than to try to convince yourself the problem does n’t exist and lower your awareness .
You ca n’t solve a problem if you do n’t acknowledge its existence .
Do n’t allow yourself to lower your awareness even when faced with problems that seem intractable .
Fearlessness
Fearlessness means living without fear .
Duh .
I ’m not referring to your biological fight - or - flight response but rather to irrational fears like fear of failure , fear of rejection , and fear of success .
It ’s intelligent to avoid going head - to - head with a lion .
It is n’t intelligent to be afraid of public speaking .
Think about it .
Supposedly people are more afraid of public speaking than they are of death .
Is n’t that sort of … well … dumb ?
I say this not to proclaim my own fearlessness but rather because I lived with this fear for most of my life and found it very annoying .
Why did I have to get nervous before getting up in front of an audience ?
What ’s the point ?
There ’s no real danger , is there ?
So why is my body pumping out cortisol and adrenaline ?
Why am I experiencing the physiological reaction of fear if there ’s no reason to be afraid ?
There might be times when you have good reason to decline a public speaking situation , but this is the kind of decision that should be made intelligently based on opportunity and risk .
Fear should n’t be part of the equation .
Fear has become such an integral part of our society that we ’re expected to be afraid .
We regard public speaking as if it ’s supposed to be scary and “ only natural ” to be nervous .
Talking to members of the opposite sex is threatening .
Starting a new business is too risky .
Some people feel it is n’t even safe to go outside their homes .
Yet the real danger in these situations is negligible … unless you happen to live in New York City that is – those people are genuinely nuts . 🙂
Fearlessness is n’t the same as courage .
With courage you face your fears , and that ’s a potent skill in its own right .
But with fearlessness you never experience the emotional reaction of fear in the first place .
Imagine doing public speaking and not being nervous at all .
Is that possible ?
Sure it is .
I ’ve done it many times .
Last night I attended my first improv comedy workshop .
After seeing the live performance the previous week , I was amazed .
The performers ’ skill seemed almost inhuman , especially being able to come up with original songs off the top of their heads in a matter of seconds .
But I was intrigued , so I signed up for eight weeks of classes .
Before the class started , one of the other students said to me , “ There are two ways you can do this : 1 ) ease into it gently and gradually warm up to it , or 2 ) just jump right in and do it . ”
I said , “ I ’m definitely a jumper . ”
Total immersion is a great way to learn , so I dove in fearlessly and did all the exercises and games that everyone else did , as opposed to sitting on the sidelines and just watching .
During the class I made up stories and songs , played games like charades and props , got down on all fours barking like a dog , acted out a character named Rufus , got a mock haircut , and did a lot of other crazy things .
Basically I made a complete fool of myself .
But I had a blast and am looking forward to the next workshop .
The reason I had such a good time even though I was out of my element was that I went into the class with the attitude that it was perfectly acceptable to me to fail .
And of course that ’s the intelligent attitude to have because I was genuinely in no real danger – no matter how poor my performance was , I could n’t possibly be hurt .
But most people are n’t like that – they get nervous in such situations due to fear of embarrassment , humiliation , or failure .
But without fear one is able to focus on learning and having fun instead of on worry and anxiety .
Being afraid or nervous in situations where there ’s no real danger simply is n’t intelligent .
Yet most people go through their whole lives avoiding situations because of irrational fear .
We ’re socially conditioned to believe it ’s normal and natural to be afraid in such situations .
But there ’s nothing natural and normal about it at all .
It ’s common , but it is n’t our natural state to be afraid .
Children tend to be a lot more fearless than adults – we learn to be afraid as we grow up .
Why ?
Because we ’re taught a model of the universe which , if we believe it , will induce fear automatically .
Dump that model and you dump irrational fear along with it .
It ’s well and good to learn that we should look both ways before crossing the street .
But it ’s just dumb to be conditioned to fear public speaking , asking someone out on a date , or starting a new business .
We might not have had a say when that conditioning was first imparted , but we have a say now .
The solution to irrational fear is n’t to adopt positive thinking and try to overwrite the fear with affirmations .
That ’s just dumb .
The real solution is to turn on our wonderful brains and dive more deeply into our fears in order to really understand them .
Underlying irrational fears are irrational assumptions about reality .
Once we can see this clearly , it ’s natural and normal to simply drop those irrational assumptions altogether .
So the big problem with fear is that it ’s based on an inaccurate model of reality .
If we could perceive reality accurately , we would be much less afraid .
So I ’m saying that if public speaking makes you nervous , it ’s because you do n’t perceive reality accurately enough to really believe at a deep enough level that there ’s nothing at all to be afraid of .
I think fearlessness is a key component of enlightenment ( in the Buddhist sense ) .
If you find that you have irrational fears that hold you back , can you accept that these fears might be caused by an erroneous understanding of reality ?
I gave that possibility some thought , and by following this trail diligently , I eventually reworked my whole concept of reality to the point where I stopped creating fear when it was n’t warranted .
So I found that this was indeed the solution to irrational fear .
To overcome fear we simply need to upgrade our understanding of reality – all the way down to the level of our spiritual beliefs .
The bad news is that if you happen to be attached to spiritual beliefs that are irrational and fear - inducing , then you ’ll never be able to let go of fear no matter how hard you try .
You can still develop courage or turn to pharmaceuticals to numb yourself emotionally , but otherwise the irrational perception of fear will always be with you .
It ’s simply a natural consequence of an irrational perception of reality .
If someone pulls a gun on me in dark alley , I ’ll be scared out of my wits because my biological fight - or - flight response will take over , and I probably wo n’t have immediate access to my rational mind .
But if I ’m put in a situation where I have to take a social risk that involves no real danger ( like making a fool of myself in public ) , that wo n’t phase me as much .
And the reason is n’t that I ’m some uber - courageous hero .
It ’s simply because I happen to view reality in such a way that I genuinely perceive no threat from such situations .
Speaking in front of an audience is no more emotionally challenging than talking to a friend .
How does one develop the quality of fearlessness ?
I ’ve already talked about this at length on Podcast # 8 : Overcoming Fear , so if you have n’t already heard that one , give it a listen .
I ’ve received a lot of positive feedback about it .
You wo n’t necessarily agree with me on all points , which is perfectly fine , but it should get you thinking about alternatives to the current way in which you view reality .
The real key is that you must upgrade your understanding of reality from an irrational one that produces irrational fear to a more rational one that produces no fear .
On that podcast I present the model that worked for me ( which comes from Buddhism ) , but I do n’t believe that ’s the only rational model of reality that makes it possible to transcend fear – I ’m sure there are others , but I imagine they ’re going to share similar qualities .
If your body starts pumping out stress hormones in situations that presents no real danger , then you are n’t behaving intelligently , are you ?
But your body is n’t an idiot .
Your mind is just feeding it bad information .
You do n’t need positive affirmations to deal with this problem – affirmations will only treat the symptoms .
What you need is a genuine cure for fear , such that you learn to stop producing the symptoms of fear altogether .
This is an intelligent approach because you really should n’t be afraid when you are n’t in any real danger .
Beyond Positive Thinking
When you develop the qualities of self - trust , awareness , and fearlessness , the natural consequence of these will be optimism .
But this is n’t the phony optimism that comes from self - delusional thinking .
You ’ll have good reason to be optimistic because you ’ll have the asset of intelligence working for you at full strength , and intelligence is an incredibly powerful human endowment .
You ’ll be able to handle challenges that would have previously paralyzed you because fear will no longer be part of the picture .
Fear is a major barrier to intelligence .
We humans are emotional creatures .
If we feel fear , it ’s going to influence our actions , perhaps even to the point of controlling them .
Developing courage is a good start , but eventually we need to stop producing fear altogether .
Fear simply is n’t necessary for our survival .
And when fear gets out of the way , then a positive emotional state becomes the norm .
Not neutral – positive .
This is the state of joy , where you go through your days feeling ridiculously happy , highly motivated , and passionately driven by the desire to serve others … and for no apparent reason .
But the reason is simple .
Since it feels good to be joyful and since life would be much better on this planet if all humans felt this way instead of being afraid of each other , it ’s only intelligent for your body to pump out the hormones that create joy and happiness around the clock .
Sure you can be knocked out of this state from time to time , and you ’ll still experience negative emotions now and then , but imagine what it would be like if the state of joy was your everyday default .
The state of joy is far superior to the state which most people consider to be normal or neutral .
When joy becomes your default state , you ’ll realize that the state you previously labeled as neutral was actually mild fear .
Overcoming fear and reaching the point of perpetual joy is n’t easy though .
And that ’s an understatement because most people never reach this state in their entire lifetimes .
One of the most difficult problems is that fear has become such an integral component of life on earth these days .
When people are afraid , they ’re easy to manipulate .
They can be controlled by pulling on their fear strings .
Stirring up fear is an effective way to induce action because deep down , we all desire to be unafraid , so the elimination of fear is a powerful incentive for spending .
There are more positive reasons for spending money too , but too many companies today are aligned with this fear model .
This is particularly true in the USA , where our media is largely devoted to stirring up fear and then using it to shape public opinion in a manner that drives sales for the companies of greatest influence .
Part of the reason people use fear to manipulate others is that they mistakenly believe it will help them assuage their own fears .
A common way of dealing with fear is to try to control that which you fear .
But this only perpetuates and strengthens fear in the long run , so more and more control is needed .
This happens at the individual level as well as the community level .
For example , fear is one of the driving forces behind how the USA deals with the rest of the planet .
This country ’s strategy is based on achieving greater and greater control in order to assuage the fears of its citizens .
For non-Americans this is easier to see , but there are those of us in this country who recognize the severity of this problem and are working to change it .
In the long run , I believe the control strategy will ultimately fail .
It just is n’t necessary for human beings to relate to each other this way any longer .
We ’re going to have to let it go .
Do n’t be so naive as to think that there are n’t forces working against you .
There are .
But fortunately , those forces are n’t strong enough to stop you if you continue to intelligently pursue the development of your own consciousness .
Self - delusional positive thinking merely perpetuates fear and shoves it below the level of conscious awareness .
It ’s better to be afraid and be aware of your fear , so you can ultimately perceive its irrationality and learn to release it .
Then your behavior will become far more intelligent , and you ’ll be amazed at just how fearful everyone else seems by comparison .
Then you can help them overcome fear as well , and over our lifetimes we ’ll gradually shift this planet away from fear and over to the side of unconditional love , where our true potential as human beings will finally be able to manifest .
Yeah , I ’m an optimist , but I have good reason to be .
