Ten Tactics is calls on the experience of activists using technology
DIGITAL PLANET

The power of technology to mobilise the masses and force change has been felt across the world - and now a documentary film - maker hopes to offer " practical advice " for activists .
The film - 10 tactics for turning information into action - offers practical advice such as " amplify personal stories " , and " how to use complex data " .
" Technology and social media platforms have revolutionised the way we communicate and campaign on global and local issues , " says Stephanie Hankey , co-founder of Tactical Tech , the NGO behind the film .
" We have seen examples of the power of social media to shine a spotlight on oppression and hold governments to account , notably in Iran and Burma . "
Essential support
The film , which is being shown in over 35 countries , draws on the experience of 25 rights advocates from around the world who have used social media tools like Twitter , Google Earth and Facebook to successfully take on governments and corporations .
THE TEN TACTICS 1 . Mobilise People 2 . Witness and Record 3 . Visualise Your Message 4 . Amplify Personal Stories 5 . Just Add Humour 6 . Investigate and Expose 7 .
How to Use Complex Data 8 .
Use Collective Intelligence 9 . Let People Ask the Questions 10 .
Manage Your Contacts
Listen to Colin Grant 's full report Among them is Noha Atef , an Egyptian blogger who campaigned heavily for the release of prisoners , and Dina Mehta , who helped orchestrate a Twitter campaign to get blood donors and essential support to hospitals during the Mumbai terror attacks .
Tactical
Tech tries to encourage productive use of information activism , the term they give to empowering people , using technology , with facts .
While the film heavily encourages social media use , it also takes time to explain the dangers and limitations .
" The security and privacy aspect of information - activism - any activity that is in anyway political - is extremely important to us , " says Marek Tuszynski , also from Tactical Tech .
" We do n't just tell people ' Hoorah !
This is the ten tactics we have to be using ' .
" In each tactic we explain the downsides of using it and how you should be protecting yourself . "
Protecting victims Sam Gregory , from human rights organisation Witness , also says efforts must be put in to make activists fully aware of the consequences of their actions online .
DIGITAL PLANET Digital Planet is the weekly technology programme broadcast from the BBC World Service
It is broadcast on Tuesday at 1232GMT and repeated at 1632GMT , 2032GMT and on Wednesday at 0032GMT
It is also available as a podcast
It can be found on the social networks Facebook and Orkut " Victims and survivors of human rights abuses are already vulnerable , so it 's really important when we film them to make sure we do n't doubly victimise them .
" In a digital era you can't assume that once a piece of footage is out there it wo n't be copied , placed on YouTube , and seen by the perpetrator . "
Beyond safety and privacy issues , Tactical
Tech is also trying to warn of operational problems that activists may face .
" Facebook stops you from messaging the people in your group after you hit 5000 , " notes Namita Malhotra from the Alternative Law Forum , Bangalore .
" So without realising when we crossed that mark and became 16,000 and 40,000 we realised we could not communicate with anyone in the group anymore . "

Why Democrats Will , at the End of the Day , Pass Health - Care Reform
" Democrats should , but almost certainly wo n't , listen to Jon Chait , " writes Matt Yglesias .
He 's referring to this post Chait wrote on the way Americans will judge health - care reform :
People do not pay close attention to details ... [ I ] f health care reform passes ... it will have a Rose Garden ceremony , lots of commentary about the historical import , liberal celebrations and conservative apoplexy .
If it fails , then the plan will be described as a " failure " -- a designation intended to describe the political prospects but which is certain to bleed into the public 's estimation of the plan 's substantive merits -- and produce endless commentary about liberal overreach , all of which will make people more prone to believe that the plan was a disaster .
Democrats simply have to accept that health care reform is going to be polling badly when they vote on it .
There 's no mechanism in the current media configuration that would allow them to convey the details of the plan in a positive way without getting overrun by negative process stories .
It 's just not possible .
What they have to focus on is which alternative is likely to make them better off : reform passing or reform failing .
It 's an easy call , which is why I think reform will pass .
First , a word on the bad " process stories " afflicting health - care reform right now :
This sort of thing is inevitable .
The final stage of a legislative fight is a bit confusing :
It is very hard to tell a legislator who is voting against a bill apart from a legislator who is trying to maximize his influence over a bill .
The two of them do the same thing , after all : Express concerns , point out a couple areas of disagreement , admit to overall ambivalence .
But one of them does n't want to vote for the bill and the other is positioning himself to vote for the bill .
Reporters , however , can't read minds , so they take the statements at face value .
That makes things look a lot grimmer than they are .
As they say , it always looks darkest before the deal .
But there will be a deal .
This is , in part , for the reasons Jon outlines .
Importantly , however , the argument in his post is not some brilliant insight point he thought up during a particularly productive hour on the treadmill .
It 's just what happens .
With all major pieces of legislation .
And everyone knows it .
Medicare Part D , for instance , barely survived the legislative process .
It had a one - vote margin in the House of Representatives .
Republicans almost broke the Congress securing the bill 's passage .
If it had failed , the ethics violations and angry Republicans and huge price tag would have launched a thousand editorials explaining the bill 's failures and the deep inadequacies they demonstrated in the administration 's policy process .
But the bill did n't fail .
Now it 's law , and pretty popular law , at that .
Democrats know full well that there are two plausible outcomes to the health - care reform process .
Health - care reform will fail , dealing a huge blow to the Democratic Party and giving Republicans tremendous momentum as we enter the 2010 campaign season .
Or health - care reform will pass , and Democrats will criss - cross the country touting the largest legislative accomplishment in decades .
Republicans may still attack them on the plan .
But attacking a historic legislative success is a whole lot harder than attacking a historic legislative failure .
Republicans know that , which is why they want to kill the bill .
Democrats know it too , which is why they wo n't let them .

Banking on Coal
With the U.N. climate change conference in Copenhagen getting under way this week , the pressure ’s on for world leaders to come up with some sort of climate agreement .
Despite the appearance of a unified plea for action , however , not everyone is playing ball .
And one of the shirkers is especially surprising :
Even as governments are weighing tough choices to bring down emissions and cope with rising temperatures , the World Bank is financing — and plans to continue financing — coal projects to the detriment of renewable energy .
In effect , the World Bank is sending the message that coal is not just an acceptable fuel , but also a resource that should be developed with international funding .
It ’s a betrayal of everything the World Bank ’s member countries are supposed to be working for .
The bank ’s recently released draft Energy Strategy , which will guide its energy lending and influence partner institutions for the next seven to 10 years and announces its investment in coal , is very , very bad news .
Although the proportion of coal to renewable energy is falling , the shift is too little too late .
Back in 2004 , the World Bank ’s Extractive Industries Review recommended that the bank " phase - out support for oil by 2008 , and formalize its moratorium on lending for coal projects immediately . "
That was five years ago .
Today , the World Bank strategy notes that " In some countries , electricity from coal is significantly cheaper " and the bank " could use its traditional financing instruments to support client countries to develop new coal power projects under certain conditions . "
Indeed , the Bank Information Center finds that bank funding for coal has increased almost 200 percent between 2007 and 2009 .
But even if it saves costs in the short term , each newly constructed coal plant has a life of about 50 years , during which it will emit carbon ; rehabilitation extends the life of the plant by an additional 20 .
So even as World Bank donor countries are fighting political battles to cut emissions , their dollars are funding new World Bank coal projects that will cancel out any hard - won gains .
It ’s hard to understand why " coal " is n’t a dirty word in the halls of the World Bank — an institution whose mandate is built on the idea of sustainable development .
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , coal is the most carbon - intensive of the fossil fuels and is the fastest growing carbon - emitting energy source .
Coal ’s share of world carbon dioxide emissions is projected to increase to 45 percent in 2030 , meaning that nearly half of all new pollutants can be traced back to coal .
Perhaps most outrageous of all is that climate change driven by such investments will disproportionately affect the poor , those who ’ve had the smallest role in producing emissions .
Mining the stuff also wreaks havoc on the environment .
Open pit , strip , and underground mines all cause severe erosion , leach toxic chemicals into nearby streams and aquifers , and push animals and plants out of their habitats .
Coal is particularly harmful for public health .
A 2009 Environmental Defense Fund study estimated that between 6,000 and 10,700 annual deaths can be attributed to the 88 coal - fired power plants and companies receiving public international financing , including from the World Bank .
Yet even knowing coal ’s blemished track record , the bank is not only subsidizing coal projects but doing so to an increasing degree .
During the 2008 fiscal year , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) increased funding for fossil fuels by 102 percent compared with only 11 percent for what it categorizes as new renewable energy such as solar , wind , biomass , geothermal energy and hydropower projects under 10 megawatts .
On average , fossil fuel financing by the bank still accounts for twice as much as all new renewable energy and energy efficiency projects do , combined .
Bloomberg News reported that thanks to World Bank financing , India ’s Tata " ultra mega " power plant will have the dubious distinction of being one of the world ’s 50 largest greenhouse gas emitters once it begins operation in 2012 .
At this very moment , the bank is considering a loan for the South African electricity company Eskom that would commit $ 3.75 billion for the 4,800 - megawatt Medupi coal - fired power station , currently under construction .
According to Reuters , if approved , this will represent the single largest World Bank loan awarded to post - apartheid South Africa — and yes , it ’s for a coal plant .
Of course , the bank does know and admit that cutting emissions is a goal it should strive for .
But its rhetoric and actions on the topic are mismatched .
Whereas the institution claims in its Energy Strategy that it " support[s ] countries in their efforts to shift to a low - GHG - intensity path , " the hard data on bank support for coal paints another picture .
For each thoughtful , renewable project that the bank supports , such as its $ 20 million investment in the Yemeni Al - Mokha wind farm , there is another coal - fired power plant or emissions - intensive hydropower project on the horizon .
What does this mean in the context of Copenhagen ?
World Bank - financed projects are a significant source of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions , and they ’re set to grow .
When the fossil fuels involved in the World Bank and IFC lending projects for the 2008 fiscal year are combusted , the projected lifetime CO2 emissions from this one year of financing will amount to approximately 7 percent of the world ’s annual CO2 emissions from the energy sector .
That ’s twice the amount of Africa ’s annual energy - sector emissions .
What ’s even worse is that sustainable alternatives to coal exist .
The World Bank could use its sizable energy investment portfolio ( more than $ 7 billion ) to promote low - carbon development that helps ( rather than hurts ) emissions targets .
It could push the political consensus to do the same .
But it ’s not doing either — a failure of great magnitude for an institution that ’s supposed to lead by example , not follow the path of least resistance .
Now that the government of Dubai has been forced to guarantee banks ' debts , attention has focused on its worldwide exposure .
Is the crisis wider tha Dubai and which countries have lots of debt out there ?
Now , thanks to the Bank for International Settlements we can begin to get a picture .
This data , from the second quarter of this year , shows how much money banks in the major lending regions have lent to every country in the world .
The UK is one of the world 's biggest lenders .
Find out where the money goes to and how Dubai compares .
This does not show government or public debt – such as that detailed here .
Instead it gives us private loans made to citizens and companies .
Increasingly globalised markets have widened the sources of finance beyond traditional borders .
UK banks such as RBS , British building societies , Spanish savings banks and others around the world have started lending aggressively over the past few years .
While credit was cheap and available , this funded the property boom that has now has collapsed in Dubai – and around the globe .
The data shows us that British banks had more than $ 50bn ( £ 30 bn ) outstanding in Dubai debts and European banks more than $ 88 bn .
As the FT pointed out , this data does not include Taipei , with $ 1.63 bn in exposure .
But it is the best source we have .

Data summary
Ever hear of Douglas Prasher ?
Probably not .
He just missed out on this past year ’s Nobel in chemistry .
That ’s not unusual , as many scientists never even come close to a Nobel .
What is unusual , is that Dr. Prasher works at a car dealership , not in a lab .
Despite doing the critical research on discovering GFP that became the work for last year ’s Nobel Prize , he was unable to find grant money and a job to continue his work .
Prasher ’s story is what concerns me with science , engineering , math , and technology .
In the U.S. , we are constantly hearing about how the country is falling behind in science .
We need more scientists to fill all of those jobs we want to create .
And the cure to that is to fund more PhD programs !
Yet , when you ask graduate students and postdoctoral scholars what their individual experiences are , a science career is a very tough road with low pay and few career prospects .
It ’s such a tough path that an entire PhD comic strip was born to alleviate the situation with laughter .
Why then , is there such a disconnect ?
As a friend of mine , who has worked for two decades in both academia and industry , recently put it , “ it ’s a Ponzi scheme ” ( name withheld to protect his job ) .
Large corporations and universities need a lot of workers to meet their objectives .
While conspiracy theories abound over biopharma lobbying the government for more PhDs with the secret ambition to lower wages , it does n’t seem too far - fetched .
Universities need grad students and postdocs to churn out the papers that bring in grant money for the professors .
While that is a well - established tradition going on for more than a century , what is different now is how we are attracting students into science careers .
With tuition paid - in - full PhD programs and benefits as a graduate student , many who would normally not enter science are lured in .
Reality usually hits after the second year , in which qualification exams to continue in the programs are taken .
Only then , do students realize the road that lies ahead is dotted with pit stops leading , not to Nobel glory , but a journeyman career with salaries well below that of their friends who went into business , law , or medicine .
With a PhD , a postdoc can expect to start , at most , US $ 42 K a year in academia and $ 52 K in industry .
More over , 45 % of all recent doctorates are now taking postdoc positions prior to a faculty appointment .
This contrasts with only 31 % following the same path 25 years ago ( see NSF ) .
And postdoc positions are increasing in length of time as well , and are often followed by a second or even third “ tour of duty . ”
While the National Science Foundation ’s ( NSF ) most recent data shows an average of two years per postdoc across all disciplines , my own anecdotal experience in the life sciences shows that number is closer to four years .
In reality , more PhDs are a good thing , but should something be done to help out recent graduates and what could be done ?
President Obama has included just a 1.5 % increase in the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) budget for 2010 , which does n’t even make up for the lost years of keeping up with inflation under the Bush era .
Obama has promised to double NIH ’s budget within 10 years .
Great , but how will that money be spent ?
The NIH budget doubled from $ 7.5 billion in 1990 to $ 15.5 billion in 1999 and has doubled again to $ 30 billion in 2009 , yet the career path to a tenured faculty position has become a tougher pill to swallow .
While more money in science is a great thing and should be increased , the data suggests that money alone is not the answer to improving the engineer / scientist quality of life .
Specific policy to increase salaries would do this , but the reality of that occurring is thin at best .
And as data from the NIH shows in the figure below , despite an ever growing number of PhDs and increased national budgets , there are disproportionally fewer young faculty receiving NIH grants .
This is a fairly dark picture that has just been described .
Being somewhat of an optimist , there are some changes beginning to occur that give me hope .
As usual , it is a grassroots movement that is taking the lead .
In the United States , The National Postdoctoral Association was established in 2003 .
It has made some major accomplishments in getting the NIH , NSF , and more than 160 universities to adopt new policies .
The biotech industry was born in the late 1970s , and despite visions of grand careers in science , it has largely failed to deliver .
One could argue that this failure is more related to the biotech industry being a failure itself , since it was billed as the “ next computer industry . ”
Ironically though , biotech is slowly morphing with the computer industry in the form of genomics and computational biology .
And the computer industry is starting to meet science in the middle with specific programs from Google , Microsoft , IBM , and others .
And of course , Mendeley is a melding of academia with computers and online tools .
Despite calls for promoting alternative careers in graduate school , in the end it is going to be a slow organic movement toward cross - disciplinary careers , perhaps with in silico technology , that improves the life of a PhD .
An actionable example of this would be the Singularity University hosted at NASA Ames , which is having its inaugural class this year .
The “ University ” part is a bit of a misnomer , as it is really just a nine - week networking event with an intense lecture schedule .
And it is far too early to measure its beneficial impact .
However , this may serve as inspiration for real universities to establish more practical PhD programs alongside the critical basic research type of degrees .
Curiously , science has always been more of an art than a science , and artists are often exploited .
With computers , one can remove artistry , at least somewhat .
If there ’s one piece of advice for graduate students and postdocs , it would be to inject a bit of computational work into your career .
Do n’t wait for policy changes to create greater salaries , benefits and more tenured positions .
While treading the same arduous path that our predoctoral or postdoctoral advisors tread has become regarded as a rite of passage , it does n’t need to remain such .
The story of one Douglas Prasher losing a Nobel is one too many .

Advertisement The Bank of England has revealed for the first time that it lent Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) and HBOS £ 61.6 bn in emergency funding last autumn .
Bank governor Mervyn King told a committee of MPs it " was to prevent a loss of confidence spreading through the financial system as a whole " .
The money was repaid in full by January this year , he added .
A spokesman for the prime minister said it was " a powerful reminder " of how the banking system had nearly collapsed .
Why on earth did the Bank , Treasury and FSA think it was a good idea to keep the £ 61.6 bn of lending secret ?

It was also revealed that Chancellor Alistair Darling had agreed to underwrite any losses which the Bank may have made on the loans .
The Liberal Democrats have called on Mr Darling to explain to the House of Commons why the Treasury guarantees were kept secret .
Vince Cable , the party 's Treasury spokesman , called it a " shocking cover - up " .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said the revelations about the secret loans showed the need to reform the system of banking regulation .
" The scale of these loans raises the question of how Labour 's tripartite regulatory structure allowed these banks to come so close to collapse in the first place , and underlines the need for fundamental reform to put the Bank of England back in charge , " he said .
Secrecy
It is the first time that the central bank has detailed this support for the two institutions .
ANALYSIS By Hugh Pym , chief economics correspondent
We may feel numbed these days when there is talk of the hundreds of billions of pounds in taxpayer support to the banks .
Even so , the revelation of these secret emergency loans to RBS and HBOS a year ago is breath - taking .
The Bank of England only felt it was safe to reveal this covert support now , once the ink was dry on longer - term bailout deals agreed with the banks a couple of weeks ago .
Lloyds shareholders were being asked to approve the takeover of HBOS .
Yet they were not told about a Northern Rock - style cash bailout of HBOS .
The authorities argue that disclosing the loans would have caused greater disturbance to the whole system .
But bank shareholders might well see it differently .
Mervyn King said the Bank was acting in its capacity as the lender of last resort .
The loans , which were given in October and November of 2008 , were in addition to other financial support measures extended to the banks by the government .
The chairman of the Treasury Committee , John McFall , said that when he saw the amount there had been " a little bit of an intake of breath thinking how many universities , how many colleges , how many jobs you could support with this " .
The Bank of England said it had carefully considered the public interest case for disclosure but decided that the assistance should only be revealed " once the Bank considers that the need for secrecy has ceased " .
RBS has since signed up for the government 's Asset Protection Scheme while Lloyds Banking Group - which took over HBOS - has announced plans to raise capital from its shareholders .
The BBC 's chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym said that the £ 62bn of emergency loans were agreed just as shareholders were being asked to approve the takeover of HBOS .
He suggested that shareholders might be unhappy at not being told earlier .
Profound challenges Please turn on JavaScript .

In his parliamentary testimony Mr King also discussed the wider UK economy , reiterating his view that the recovery was still in the early stages .
He told the Treasury Committee that the economy still faced " profound challenges " .
Regarding the Bank 's policy of quantitative easing - pumping money into the economy to try to boost lending by the commercial banks - Adam Posen , one of Mr King 's colleagues on the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) , said he hoped the initiative was " coming to an end " .
Earlier this month , the MPC voted to increase its quantitative easing programme by a further £ 25 bn to £ 200 bn .
However , minutes released subsequently showed a three - way split on the decision , with seven of the nine MPC members voting for it , one wanting a larger increase in the scheme , and one calling for no additional spending .
Mr King also told MPs that he did not think there was any " immediate risk " of the UK having a credit downgrade .

( CNN ) --
The Netherlands and Nigeria will begin using body scanners on airline passengers following the attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. - bound flight on Christmas Day , authorities in both nations said Wednesday .
The millimeter - wave body scanners will be in place at Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport in about three weeks and will be used on all passengers traveling to the United States , Dutch Interior Minister Guusje ter Horst told a news conference at The Hague .
" We 've escaped a very serious attack with serious consequences , but unfortunately in this world there are individuals who do not shy away from attacks on innocent people , " she said .
Nigeria did not say when it would begin the new scans .
" In combating the new threat of terrorism as unfolded recently , Nigeria will be upgrading its security screening system to 3D Total Body Imaging Scanner , " the country 's airport authority said in a statement .
It gave no further details .
Do new rules make you feel safer ?
Share your airport experiences .
Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , 23 , is accused of trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane going from Amsterdam to Detroit , Michigan , with explosives that had been concealed in his underwear .
He is charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft .
The militant group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the December 25 plot .
Dutch authorities have already said they were confident in the security measures that were carried out when AbdulMutallab transferred to the Detroit flight from an earlier flight from Nigeria .
A source in Lagos , Nigeria , with connections to the aviation industry told CNN that AbdulMullatab arrived in Nigeria from Accra , Ghana , on December 24 .
He flew in on a Virgin Nigeria flight , arriving in Lagos about 7:30 p.m. local time ( 1:30 p.m. ET ) , about an hour before he checked in for a KLM flight to Amsterdam .
He checked one bag , the source said .
Ter Horst said that security measures in place in Amsterdam were metal detectors and X - ray machines , and admitted they could not have picked up the explosive material that AbdulMullatab was allegedly carrying .
" The introduction of these body scanners would certainly have helped in detecting that he was carrying something on his body , " she said .
" We know that metal detection does not help to detect non-metal explosives , and these millimeter - wave scanners can do this , which would mean that this would be an improvement . "
One passenger on same plane as AbdulMutallab told CNN's " Larry King Live " that the security checks at Schiphol were not as stringent as those she is used to in the United States .
" We walked through and did not have to take our shoes off , " said Wisconsin native Richelle Keepman .
" Also , my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she 'd completely forgotten about .
And it went right through and we did n't realize it until we were on the plane . "
Ter Horst acknowledged that the systems currently in place are " not watertight , " which is why the body scanners are being introduced .
As to privacy concerns -- namely that the scanners could pick up private features of a person 's body -- ter Horst said the scan results would first go through a computer , which would then flag any suspicious items to a human .
The scanners will be permanent at Schiphol , and any passengers bound for the United States who do not go through them will be body - searched , ter Horst said .
Erik Akerboom , the Dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism , said part of the investigation is looking at whether the explosives were brought into Schiphol by someone else for AbdulMutallab to pick up later .
Dutch authorities are also looking into whom he was in touch with while at Schiphol awaiting his connecting flight .
They are combing surveillance camera footage from the connections hall , Akerboom said .
Asked about reports that AbdulMutallab paid for his ticket in cash and was flying only with hand luggage , Akerboom said neither would have necessarily raised any alarms .
" There are several travelers who do this , " he said .
AbdulMutallab's name had come to the attention of U.S. authorities before the attack , sources have told CNN in recent days .
His father talked twice about his son's extremist views with at least one CIA representative at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency , a reliable source told CNN's Jeanne Meserve on Tuesday .
Had that critical information been shared , the man might have been denied passage on the flight , the source said .
A U.S. intelligence official said AbdulMutallab's name , passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated .
But the official added , " I 'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put AbdulMutallab on the no-fly list . "
CIA spokesman George Little defended the agency 's actions regarding AbdulMutallab , but also said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done .
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter .
Kelly said any decision to revoke the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision .
Ter Horst said Dutch authorities did not know that AbdulMutallab had raised any security flags , and she called for a global watch list for all suspect travelers in the future .
One Monday in May , I was setting off from Washington to Colorado Springs , home of the United States Air Force Academy .
I had kindly been invited by the academy ’s “ freethinkers association , ” a loose - knit group of cadets and instructors who are without religious affiliation .
As I was making ready to depart , and checking my e-mail , I found I had been sent a near - incredible video clip from the Al Jazeera network .
It had been shot at Bagram Air Force Base last year , and it showed a borderline - hysterical address by one Lieutenant Colonel Gary Hensley , chief of the United States ’ military chaplains in Afghanistan .
He was telling his evangelical audience , all of them wearing uniforms supplied by the taxpayer , that as followers of Jesus Christ they had a collective responsibility “ to be witnesses for him . ”
Heating up this theme , Lieutenant Colonel Hensley went on : “ The Special Forces guys , they hunt men , basically .
We do the same things , as Christians .
We hunt people for Jesus .
We do , we hunt them down .
Get the hound of heaven after them , so we get them in the kingdom .
Right ?
That ’s what we do , that ’s our business . ”
The comparison to the Special Forces would seem to suggest that the objects of this hunting and hounding are Afghans rather than Americans .
But it ’s difficult to be certain , and indeed I am invited to Colorado Springs partly because chaplains there have been known to employ taxpayer dollars to turn the hounds of heaven loose on their own students and fellow citizens .
As the Bagram tape goes on , however , it becomes obvious that Afghans are the targets in this case .
Stacks of Bibles are on display , in the Dari and Pashto tongues that are the main languages in Afghanistan .
A certain Sergeant James
Watt , a candidate for a military chaplaincy , is shown giving thanks for the work of his back - home church , which subscribed the dough .
“ I also want to praise God because my church collected some money to get Bibles for Afghanistan .
They came and sent the money out , ” he beamingly tells his Bible - study class .
In another segment , those present show quite clearly that they understand they are in danger of violating General Order Number One of the U.S. Central Command , which explicitly prohibits “ proselytizing of any religion , faith , or practice . ”
A gathering of chaplains , all of them fed from the public trough , is addressed by Captain Emmit Furner , a military cleric who seems half in love with his own light - footed moral dexterity .
“ Do we know what it means to proselytize ? ” he asks his audience .
A voice from the audience is heard to say , “ It is General Order Number One . ”
To this Sergeant Watt replies : “ You ca n’t proselytize but you can give gifts . …
I bought a carpet and then I gave the guy a Bible after I conducted my business . ”
So where ’s the harm in a man who is paid by the United States government to be a Christian chaplain strolling condescendingly through the souk and handing out religious propaganda as if it were a handful of small change or backsheesh ?
Probably not much more damaging to the war effort , or insulting to Afghan sensibilities , than the activities of the anonymous torturers who have been found operating elsewhere on the Bagram base .
But it is taking the axe to the root of the United States Constitution , never mind General Order Number One .
( Neither of these seems to be in force locally : no action against the uniformed missionaries has been taken . )
The film was originally shot by Brian Hughes , a maker of documentaries and a former member of the United States military who had fought in the Gulf War .
It was made available to James Bays , one of Al Jazeera ’s more experienced Afghan reporters .
By the time I had landed in Colorado Springs , later that day , I expected that the thing would have become a national story and that the cadets , perhaps most especially the freethinkers club , would be talking about it .
But I was mistaken twice .
Only a few fringe anti-war malcontents had made anything of this outrageous clip , and there was a general shrug when I mentioned it .
“ That sort of thing happened to me a lot in Afghanistan , ” I was told by Carlos Bertha , a veteran of the war who now teaches philosophy to cadets and who helped organize my talk .
“ I used to complain and sometimes the word would come down to lay off , but it was always ready to start up again . ”
He was talking , however , about in - your - face Christian - fundamentalist displays at the entrance to the chow hall .
Perhaps local Afghan hired helpers would have to see these , too , but the propaganda was n’t being inflicted directly on them .
So the question becomes two related questions :
Is there a clique within the United States military that is seeking to use the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as an opportunity to mount a new crusade and to Christianize the “ heathen ” ?
And does this clique also attempt to impose its beliefs on young Americans in uniform , many of whom may even be Christian already ?
If the answer to either question is “ yes , ” then we are directly financing the subversion of our own Constitution and inviting a “ holy war ” where we will not be able to say that only the other side is dogmatic and fanatical .
Britain 's former spy chief , Sir John Scarlett , misled the Iraq inquiry by exaggerating the reliability of crucial claims about Saddam Hussein 's ability to launch weapons of mass destruction , according to the leading Ministry of Defence expert who assessed the intelligence behind the decision to go to war .
Scarlett who was responsible for drafting the Government 's controversial 2002 dossier outlining the case for invading Iraq , claimed last week that intelligence indicating Iraq possessed missiles that could be launched within 45 minutes was “ reliable and authoritative ” .
But Scarlett 's evidence is contradicted by the most senior WMD analyst who saw the original intelligence .
Brian Jones said that it was vague , inconclusive and unreliable .
Dr Jones , who was head of the nuclear , chemical and biological branch of the Defence Intelligence Staff in the run-up to the invasion , said that it was “ absolutely clear ” the intelligence the Government relied upon was coming from untried sources .
The 45 - minute claim was one of the key assertions that convinced MPs to take Britain to war .
“ Having said there was the intelligence to show Iraq had WMD , there was no indication in what ( Scarlett ) said about what is now very well known , that those additional pieces of new intelligence were all caveated , ” said Dr Jones .
He added that Scarlett crucially misled the inquiry about the source of the information .
“ The description Scarlett gave for the secondary source , who passed the information on , was ‘ reliable and authoritative ' .
If he is passing on information from someone who has never reported before , then that is a nonsense . ”
All witnesses to the Iraq inquiry are made to sign a written transcript of their evidence , declaring that it is “ truthful , fair and accurate ” .
Scarlett was the head of the Joint Intelligence Committee when he oversaw the drafting of the September 2002 dossier .
Despite the controversy , Scarlett was promoted to become the head of MI6 in 2004 and later received a knighthood .
Dr Jones 's comments will add to the pressure on Mr Blair ahead of the former Prime Minister 's own expected appearance before the Chilcot inquiry panel next month .

Hold that Tiger ?
More like find that Tiger .
Florida State Troopers can't seem to get a hold of Tiger Woods to discuss his car accident Friday morning .
The holed - up - at - home sports star turned down the Florida Highway Patrol twice today , after troopers visited his Windermere , Fla. , home looking for more answers regarding the bizarre tree - and hydrant - smashing crash .
The Florida Highway Patrol received word from Wood 's rep that the 33 - year - old golf pro and his club - swinging wife , Elin Nordegren , would not be available for an interview that was previously scheduled for Saturday .
Officers were asked to return to the home Sunday for a sit - down .
The agency is still investigating the incident , and has not yet reviewed the 911 tapes from the accident .
Woods ' missing - in- action behavior comes on the heels of reports that the accident followed a spat between him and Nordegen over an alleged affair .
Of all the crude comments and jokes we had made before , getting censored for showing a little blood was a bit silly to us .
Originally the third panel showed the students hitting the ground in a pool of blood .
That original version was deemed too violent and gross .
We were later accused by Provost Gary Brockway of using this strip to encourage students to jump off buildings .
Our reply was if students killed themselves over our comic , the university had bigger problems than us .
The strip was to originally also contain a reference to Jackson Pollock ( hence the blood splatter ) , but was taken out before even submitting it .
We still showed the arm and leg from a dead student , just no blood .
ALTERNATE PRINT VERSION :
A version used on the CBeebies channel was altered so rather than " could n't put Humpty together again " all the King 's horses " made Humpty happy again " .
The broadcaster said the change was made purely for creative reasons rather than trying to give a soft version of the rhyme for children .
A spokeswoman said : " We play nursery rhymes with their original lyrics all the time and the small change to Humpty Dumpty was done for no other reason than being creative and entertaining . "
Labour MP
Tom Harris told the Independent on Sunday : " For goodness sake .
Obviously children will find it far too violent , distressing and horrific that Humpty should not be put back together again .
" This is what happens when adults try to make these kinds of judgments . "
He told the newspaper that he had also seen Little Miss Muffet changed on the channel , so that she made friends with the spider instead of running away .
But the BBC spokeswoman said that alteration was made for similar creative reasons and there was " nothing more to it than that . "

Apparently customers are not the only ones upset by Verizon ’s new early termination fee ( ETF ) policy because the Federal Communication Commission ( FCC ) has now opened an investigation .
Verizon recently doubled the fee for customers with premium devices , from $ 175 to $ 350 , who would like to get out of their contract with Big Red .
Verizon argues that consumers can avoid the ETF by paying the full retail cost for their devices .
The FCC is also investigating $ 1.99 data charges that are present on customer ’s bills .
The FCC asked “ whether consumers are being charged for minimal , inadvertant use of Verizon ’s Mobile Web service , and what notice is being provided to those consumers . ”
Verizon has until December 17 , 2009 to respond to the FCC .

Scientists have worked out just what a perfectly designed gill mushroom would look like .
Their study reveals that no such fungi exists naturally , but it does show how a mushroom 's unique structure helps it reproduce so successfully .
The research also sheds light on why different mushrooms possess different arrangements of fleshy gills underneath their caps .
The findings are published in the journal Mycological Research .
Mushrooms are fruiting bodies produced by fungi , and they grow to spread reproductive spores into the environment .
Mushrooms are masterpieces of natural engineering
Professor Nicholas Money
Miami University , Oxford , Ohio , US
For over a century , mycologists have studied fungi structure , and it has long been known that the soft filamentous structures called gills found on the underside of many capped mushrooms help spread spores .
" Spores are catapulted from the gill surface , travel a short distance horizontally , and then fall vertically to be swept away by air currents swirling around the mushroom cap , " explains Professor Nicholas Money from Miami University , Oxford , Ohio , in the US .
The spores then start new fungal communities .
But only now have researchers revealed the perfect shape for a mushroom 's fleshy gills .
Prof Money and Dr Mark Fischer from the College of St Joseph , Cincinnati , also in Ohio , US used theoretical modelling , measurements and photographs to investigate the optimal gill structure for a mushroom .
Natural gills fork , aiding spore dispersal " We set out to design the perfect mushroom , " Prof Money says .
In nature , gilled mushrooms have gills arranged so that they fork and branch off .
By having this arrangement relative to a flat surface the mushrooms are able to increase their surface area 20 - fold and increase their spore dispersal , the researchers say .
" Mushrooms are masterpieces of natural engineering , " says Prof Money .
But no mushroom in nature has an optimal design .
Grand design
" We found that the most efficient arrangements in engineering terms do not occur in nature . "
" A single gill organised as a tight spiral beneath the cap would work very well , and a ' venetian blind ' type arrangement would be very effective too , " he says .
A hypothetical ' spiral ' mushroom with one long gill spiralling to the centre .
But neither optimal arrangement occurs naturally , due to the constraints imposed by how a fruiting body develops .
For a start , the arrangement of cells requires each mushroom to develop radial symmetry .
" Natural selection has sculpted various radial arrays of gills that work very well , or at least , work well enough to have allowed mushrooms to flourish for tens of millions of years , " says Prof Money .
By increasing its surface area 20 - fold , a mushroom could increase the number of spores it releases by the same amount .
" Twenty billion spores is a lot more than 1 billion spores , " says Prof Money .
Design by nature Scientists are interested in how natural structures such as those found in mushrooms may be used to inform engineering designs .
A hypothetical " Venetian blind " mushroom with gills arranged in lines .
" There might be some ways in which the arrangements of gills in a mushroom could aid the design of heating or air - conditioning devices , or filters for purifying water , " says Prof Money .
The next challenge for the researchers is figuring out what kind of mushroom is the most efficient at releasing spores .
" We are going to start by looking at bracket fungi next , these have fruit - bodies that release spores from skinny tubes rather than gills , " Prof Money says .
Preliminary studies indicate that bracket fungi can increase the surface area for spore release by a factor of 40 or more .
" The storm of spores falling from these giant brackets is a truly amazing sight and well worth an evening trek into the woods , " he says .

When Unity 3D went free a friend of mine started playing around with it and voiced the opinion that mods would now increasingly become free or indie games , because here was a 3D engine that was so easy to use , and so straightforward to port assets into .
Then we had the UDK announcement , which gave us modder ’s favourite , the Unreal Engine , as a free platform .
So what does that mean for the future of modding ?
I ’d always presumed that modding was so popular because it was a shortcut to professional - grade 3D engines .
It was a step - ladder , a short - cut , not only to the technology but also to the tools needed to make use of it .
Now , however , we have a situation where those engines are not only free to use , but also stand alone : you wo n’t need your players to own an Unreal game to play something made with UDK .
With open stuff like Ogre , and free stuff like Unity , we now have an embarrassment of 3D engine riches , and it seems to me that modding teams will indeed stretch their ambitions that bit further to move their activities over to these engines , and own their work .
Crucially , their efforts no longer need be confined to particular communities : they can make games in UDK and anyone will be able to play them .
So what does that mean for modding ?
What fraction of the current modding community would or could step away from their parent games and develop for these platforms ?
And would that end the likelihood of there being another Counter - Strike or Killing Floor ?
Why would the talented few sink their time into yet another mod , when they could be aiming for their own indie game using a free engine ?
Modding has already seen something of a decline as engines have become more difficult to work with – the thing Carmack was talking about with the difficulty of introducing new tech to modders and amateur designers .
Combine this with games increasingly closing off areas in which modders could work – as in the case of MW2 – and are we at the end of the great modding arc ?
Of course I expect that as long as the PC exists we ’ll get tweaks and alterations for existing games – those compilations of alterations and unlocks that make Stalker so complete , for example , or the balances generated by the community for Total War games – but what of the most vital life - blood of the modded games : the total conversions and remakes ?
What modding has done best is generate those impressive titles that occasionally break through the meniscus of amateur ambition and into commercial production .
Titles that inspire commercial development .
Will modders not now move their ambitions on to these new 3D engines ?
And will that be for the good , or the detriment , of the PC as a gaming platform ?
I ’m asking you , Internet , because I really do n’t know , and I think the question needs to be asked .
There are several subspecies of boa constrictor ( species name boa constrictor ) that are found in the pet trade .
Red tailed boas ( Boa constrictor constrictor ) are commonly found in the pet trade , and Boa constrictor imperator can be found as well , among other less common subspecies .
The care for all the species is fairly similar .
Before committing to ownership of a boa constrictor , be sure you will be able to handle the size and strength of a full grown snake for the 25 - 30 years your snake might live .
A full grown boa constrictor ( red tailed ) will reach 8 - 10 feet long and weigh up to 50 pounds .
These are very muscular and thick bodied snake .
While generally quite docile in temperament , it is important to respect the inherent strength of these animals and that could inflict serious injury to a person .
As a general rule , for a constricting snake over 6 - 8 feet it is a good idea to have a second person present while handling the snake , just in case assistance is required .
Keep in mind also that large , secure housing is required for these snakes , and as adults need large prey such as large rats or even rabbits .
As with other reptiles , owners should choose a captive bred specimen .
Captive bred reptiles are generally more healthy and docile than wild caught counterparts .
All boa constrictors fall under CITES ( Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species ) and are listed in CITES Appendix II ( threatened in their native habitat ) .
Additionally , Boa constrictor occidentalis is on CITIES Appendix I – endangered – and requires permits to buy and sell .
Fortunately boa constrictors breed fairly readily in captivity .
When choosing a boa constrictor , look for the following signs of a healthy snake :
alert
firm , muscular body
no loose fold of skin
tongue flicking
clear eyes
no signs of retained shed ( check eyes , end of tail )
no visible external parasites
clean vent
scales healthy , no brown or curled edges
no wounds on skin
reacts to handling by coiling firmly ( but gently ) on hand / arm , and relaxing a bit after a while

Goldman Sachs director ' offered 28 - year - old Slovakian £ 500,000 to leave her pensioner husband '
A millionaire banker offered an escort girl £ 500,000 to leave her pensioner husband , a court has heard .
Yann Samuelides , 35 , a managing director of Goldman Sachs , became so infatuated with the Slovakian escort girl that he wanted to make her his wife .
And being a money man , he calculated that 28 - year - old Alzbeta Holmokova was worth £ 500,000 .
Arriving at court : Goldman Sachs banker Yann Samuelides ( right ) allegedly promised £ 500,000 to Alzbeta Holmokova ( left ) if she left her husband
Retired : Ms Holmokova 's husband Denis Morley said Mr Samuelides threatened to kill himself if she stopped seeing him
He offered her this amount to marry him , the court was told .
He also threatened to kill himself if she stopped seeing him , Miss Holmokova 's estranged husband claimed during a bitter divorce hearing .
Denis Morley , a 67 - year - old retired businessman , told the court the banker had showered his young wife with gifts after becoming her client .
He had even rented a luxurious flat for her before offering his £ 500,000 marriage proposal , he said .
' He bribed her to leave me , ' he said .
' My wife had told him that she loved and respected her husband .
She said she was happy and had to refuse him .
' He threatened to commit suicide if she stopped seeing him .
So I said , " You 'd better keep seeing him " .
' His response was , " Here 's a £ 5,000 diamond ring , here 's a £ 1,500 handbag and £ 3,500 cash " .
' Eventually he said , " Leave your husband and come and live with me and I 'll give you £ 500,000 " . '
Miss Holmokova filed for divorce from her husband in February this year , citing his unreasonable behaviour .
She is understood not to have asked for any financial settlement .
Mr Morley , who is contesting the divorce petition , has allegedly admitted once threatening to kill Mr Samuelides .
' She has told me that she 's with him for the money , ' he told the hearing .
' She 's not going to get the £ 500,000 unless she marries him . '
Mr Samuelides , who was born in France , accompanied Miss Holmokova to the divorce hearing at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court in central London , which was adjourned until next month .
They both refused to comment .
In Toulouse , where Mr Samuelides was educated , a friend described him as ' a romantic with a heart of gold ' .
The woman , who asked not to be named , said : ' He 's always been a hardworking high achiever who enjoys the good things in life .
' This all sounds very sleazy and not like Yann at all .
' He 's a decent person . '
Mr Morley , from Coventry , married Miss Holmokova in 2002 at Coventry Registry Office when she was 21 .
It is not known if the couple also met through her work as an escort girl .
Mr Samuelides was appointed a managing director at Goldman Sachs , one of the world 's oldest and largest investment banking firms , in December 2007 .
At the time he was praised for his leadership abilities .
A spokesman for the firm last night refused to comment on the divorce case .
LOS ANGELES - The California Science Center will start the new year defending itself in court for canceling a documentary film attacking Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
A lawsuit alleges that the state - owned center in Los Angeles improperly bowed to pressure from the Smithsonian Institution , as well as e-mailed complaints from University of Southern California professors and others .
It contends that the center violated both the First Amendment and a contract to rent the museum ’s Imax Theater when it canceled the screening of “ Darwin ’s Dilemma : The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record . ’’
The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the American Freedom Alliance , a Los Angeles - based group described by senior fellow Avi Davis as a nonprofit , nonpartisan “ think tank and activist network promoting Western values and ideals . ’’
The AFA seeks punitive damages and compensation for financial losses , as well as a declaration from the court that the center violated the Constitution and cannot refuse the group the right to rent its facilities for future events .
The AFA had planned an Oct. 25 screening of two films at the museum - one a short Imax movie called “ We are Born of Stars , ’’ which favors Darwin ’s theory ; the other , “ Darwin ’s Dilemma : The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record , ’’ a feature - length documentary that criticizes Darwin and promotes intelligent design .
Intelligent design is the theory that an intelligent being , rather than impersonal forces such as Darwinian natural selection , is responsible for shaping life on earth .
An overwhelming majority of scientists and science and natural history museums consider the theory of evolution to have been proved beyond a doubt by genetic and fossil evidence .
Critics of intelligent design have dismissed it as a superficially scientific cloak for the straightforwardly religious belief known as Creationism that ’s anchored in a literal reading of the biblical Book of Genesis .
The AFA ’s Davis said his group has no position on Darwinism and intelligent design but is concerned that debate is being stifled by the scientific establishment .
During the fall , the AFA organized a series of public events , including the film screening , geared to the 2009 bicentennial of Charles Darwin ’s birth and the 150th anniversary of his landmark work , “ On the Origin of Species . ’’
On Oct. 5 , the science center , one of 165 national affiliates of the Smithsonian that enjoy special access to loans from its massive collection , received an alert - and a complaint - from Harold Closter , director of the Smithsonian ’s affiliates program .
Closter gave the science center the heads - up about a news release that had been issued not by the AFA but by the Discovery Institute , a Seattle - based think tank that promotes intelligent design and whose researchers are featured in “ Darwin ’s Dilemma . ’’
In an e-mail that ’s an exhibit in the lawsuit , he wrote that the news release wrongly implied that the California Science Center is “ a West Coast branch of the Smithsonian , and that the film showing is a Smithsonian event . ’’
Closter asked science center officials to correct the error but did not mention canceling the screening .

How Google avoided a British tax bill of £ 450 m
Google avoided paying £ 450 million in corporation tax on its £ 1.6 billion earnings from advertising in Britain last year .
Accounts show the company paid HM Revenue and Customs only £ 141,519 on other earnings .
Google managed to avoid paying millions here because its European headquarters is in Dublin - and advertising earnings from customers in Britain are funnelled through to the Irish subsidiary .
Finding loopholes : Google pays tax in Ireland for all its UK revenues
Accountants say that if the £ 1.6 billion advertising revenue stayed in Britain , it would be subject to corporation tax at 28 - 30 per cent rather than the 15 per cent levy in Ireland .
Google 's bill would have been up to £ 450 million .
But even the accounts for its Irish operation show a low tax bill .
While Google is not accused of any wrongdoing , the tax it paid in 2008 was just £ 6.7 million .
Spokesman Peter Barron said : ' Google makes a big investment in the UK , with more than 800 employees , and we make a substantial contribution to local and national taxation .
' But the fact is that our European headquarters is in Dublin .
We comply fully with the tax laws in all the countries in which we operate .
' It would be wrong to think of Google 's revenues from UK advertisers as solely the result of operations carried out locally . '

BBC News , Istanbul
A trial in Turkey , which has lasted nearly 28 years , has finally concluded .
A panel of judges found 39 of the 1,223 defendants guilty of trying to topple the government and constitution , and sentenced them to life imprisonment .
The charges against other defendants were dropped because of the time that had elapsed .
They were all alleged members of an extreme left - wing organisation , Dev-Sol , who were arrested in the wake of the country 's 1980 military coup .
It will be of small comfort to the defendants - 13 of them have already died - but their trial has probably broken all records .
Proceedings in court started on 15 March 1982 .
The defendants - all alleged members of Dev-Sol - were charged with offences ranging from putting up illegal posters to armed rebellion .
Twenty - seven years and nine months later , the judges have finally reached a verdict - 39 of the defendants were given life sentences , although they will not actually serve any time , because they have already spent so long in jail .
In the court in Istanbul were 22 of the defendants , together with children and grandchildren , most of whom were not born when the case began .
The initial trial lasted 10 years - the case then went to the appeal court and sat there for 13 years because 100 folders of evidence had gone missing .
The European Union has long been pressing Turkey to make improvements to its judicial system , as part of the country 's bid for EU membership .
If the EU needed a case to support its argument , it looks like it now has one .

It 's a tough world for man 's best friend .
Patrol dogs dodge bullets every day at home and risk their lives sniffing out trouble in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As a result , K9 Storm in Winnipeg , Canada , makes $ 5 million a year selling custom armor for dogs in the U.S. Army , Navy , Marines and Special Forces ; police departments in 13 countries ; and security firms worldwide .
Next up , the 12 - employee firm is offering a new way to communicate with canines .
In 2010 it launches the K9 Storm Intruder , a bulletproof dog vest with a wireless camera , speakers and a microphone built in .
The handler can see what the dog sees and issue commands through the audio system .
" This will change the way dogs are managed in emergencies , " says Glori Slater , 47 , vice president and co-founder of K9 Storm .
" It will extend the range of the handler to 300 yards . "
Slater 's husband , Jim , is a former dog handler for the Winnipeg police department .
For two terrifying days in 1996 , he and his German shepherd Olaf helped subdue a prison riot in which the inmates were armed with makeshift weapons .
Slater worried more for Olaf than for himself .
" He was out working ahead of our lines , " he says .
" I realized it would be a bad way for him to go down , stabbed with a screwdriver . "
After the riot , Slater retrofitted a human flak jacket for his canine partner .
That prompted orders from fellow canine officers , and soon K9 Storm was in business .
The Slaters spent 11 years perfecting the vest .
Quality control was crucial , given that a poorly sewn seam can inflict crippling lesions on a dog that 's on its paws for 12 hours a day .
The Intruder is their lightest camera and audio system , weighing less than seven ounces .
The vest is not cheap .
The Intruder system starts at $ 20,000 .
But the Slaters say they have dozens of preorders .
Military working dogs are major investments , costing up to $ 50,000 each to purchase and train .
There also are plenty of donors stepping up to help cash - strapped municipalities buy the vests .
Ben Roethlisberger , the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers , gave $ 250,000 to the Pittsburgh police and fire departments for canine armor .
The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , which treats 50,000 animals a year , has received a $ 5,000 grant for dogs at Boston 's police department from Roethlisberger .
" Suspects pursued by police will stab , shoot and kick working dogs , " says Brian Adams , spokesman for the MSPCA - Angell veterinary hospital in Boston .
" They are like any officer of the law .
We want to protect them . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite the frenetic pace of bank failures this year , 552 lenders are still at risk of going under , according to a government report published Tuesday .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said that the number of banks on its so - called problem list climbed to its highest level since the end of 1993 .
At that time , the agency red-flagged 575 banks .
Mounting bank failures have proven costly for the FDIC , the government agency created to cover the deposits of consumers and businesses in the event that a bank is shut down .
On Tuesday , the agency revealed its deposit insurance fund , as a result , slipped into the red for the first time since 1991 .
At the end of the quarter on Sept. 30 , the value of the fund was $ 8.2 billion in the hole .
But that number accounts for $ 21.7 billion the agency has set aside in anticipation of future bank failures .
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair , who has won praise both in Washington and on Main Street for shepherding the industry through a particularly difficult period , said the industry 's fate is tied to the broader recovery .
" I think that it really is all about the economy at this point , " said Bair .
The banks that end up on the problem list are considered the most likely to fail because of difficulties with their finances , operations or management .
Still , history has shown just 13 % of banks on the list have failed on average .
Regulators however , never make public the names of the banks on the list out of fear the publicity could cause customers to pull out their deposits .
Tuesday 's report did reveal that the number of assets controlled by those institutions climbed to $ 345.9 billion from $ 299.8 billion in the previous quarter .
The ongoing recession has already claimed 124 banks so far this year .
But fears persist that the number will multiply in months ahead because banks are still taking losses on mortgage - related loans and face growing problems with commercial real estate .
In the event of a failure , the FDIC fully insures individual accounts up to $ 250,000 for single accounts .
Fund in focus
In anticipation of future bank failures , the FDIC has been scrambling to shore up its ailing deposit insurance fund .
Earlier this year , the agency imposed a special assessment on all banks .
And just recently , it approved having banks prepay their insurance premiums for the next three years .
The move is expected to generate roughly $ 45 billion for the FDIC .
However , due to accounting rules , the fund would not be back in the black until 2012 .
One lingering question is whether , at some point , the agency would need to tap its $ 500 billion credit line with the Treasury Department , which was approved earlier this year .
The agency however , has been averse to the idea , hoping instead it can instead navigate the crisis using the tools already at its disposal .
Mixed signals
Tuesday 's report however , was n't all bad news .
The roughly 8,100 institutions that make up the nation 's banking industry earned $ 2.8 billion during the third quarter .
In the previous quarter , banks were in the red , losing a combined $ 4.3 billion .
Stronger sales and the rising values of some securities certainly helped , but those gains were capped as lenders again set aside massive amount of cash to cope with future loan losses .
All told , banks earmarked $ 62.5 billion for future loan losses .
While that was down slightly from the previous quarter , Bair cautioned not to read too much into the numbers , adding that number could jump back up in the current quarter .
" I think we need to live with this a bit longer , " she said .
" I would n't read too much in quarter - to - quarter trends . "
One persistent trend , however , was that credit continued to remain tight .
In fact , loan balances at the nation 's lenders fell 2.8 % of $ 210.4 billion , representing the largest quarterly decline since banks started reporting this figure in 1984 .
Some economists have argued that the lack of available credit to borrowers , such as small business owners , is choking off the economic recovery .
Banks , on the other hand , have argued that demand for loans is way off , as both consumers and businesses try to pay down debt .
Flashback , early 2008 : Citibank officials are witnessing a huge spike in fraudulent withdrawals from New York area ATMs – $ 180,000 is stolen from cash machines on the Upper East Side in just three days .
After a stakeout , police arrest one man walking out of a bank with thousands of dollars in cash and 12 reprogrammed cards .
A lucky traffic stop catches two more plunderers who'd driven in from Michigan .
Another pair are arrested after trying to mug an undercover FBI agent on the street for a magstripe encoder .
In the end , there are 10 arrests and at least $ 2 million dollars stolen .
The wellspring of the dramatic megaheist turns out to be more prosaic than imagined :
It started with a breach of the public website of America 's most famous convenience store chain : 7 - Eleven.com .
In his most - recent plea agreement , filed in court Monday , confessed hacker Albert Gonzalez admitted conspiring in the 7 - Eleven breach and fingered two Russian associates as the direct culprits .
The Russians are identified as " Hacker 1 " and " Hacker 2 " in Gonzalez 's plea agreement , and as " Grigg " and " Annex " in an earlier document inadvertently made public by his attorney .
The Russians , evidently using an SQL injection vulnerability , " gained unauthorized access to 7 - Eleven , Inc. 's servers through 7 - Eleven 's public - facing internet site , and then leveraged that access into servers supporting ATM terminals located in 7 - Eleven stores , " the plea agreement reads .
" This access caused 7 - Eleven , Inc. , on or about November 9 , 2007 , to disable its public - facing internet site to disable the unauthorized access . "
At the time , there were 5,500 Citibank - branded ATMs at 7 - Eleven stores around the country .
According to SEC documents , 7 - Eleven ran its own transaction - processing server to handle 2,000 of them : advanced models called Vcom machines , manufactured by NCR .
The 7 - Eleven Vcoms support special functions like bill payment , check cashing and money - order purchases .
For two weeks in September 2007 , anyone who typed a PIN in one of these was exposed .
Court records from the New York–area Citibank cases show how that single breach from Russia trickled over the internet and down to the streets of New York .
The first break in the case had its roots in a Jan. 30 , 2008 , traffic stop .
Westchester County police pulled a car over for speeding on the Saw Mill River Parkway in Dobbs Ferry , New York .
The driver , 21 - year - old Nue Quni , was driving on a suspended license , so the officers decided to have the vehicle impounded .
While they waited for the tow truck , they conducted a routine " inventory search " of the car .
Inside , police found $ 3,000 in cash , a laptop computer , a magstripe writer – which is used to reprogram cards – and 102 blank , white plastic cards .
They also recovered receipts showing cash withdrawals from ATMs in Manhattan and the Bronx , and more showing wire transfers .
Facing federal access - device - fraud charges , the passenger in the car , 22 - year - old Luma Bitti , began cooperating with the FBI .
She explained that she was hired over the internet in December 2007 to program cards with the stolen information , then withdraw money from ATMs and wire it to other people .
With Bitti's consent , an FBI agent took over her IM and e-mail accounts , and began corresponding with the person who hired her .
The FBI arranged in April 2008 to meet the man in Manhattan , supposedly to provide him with a magstripe writer .
An FBI agent , still posing as a fraudster , showed up at the meeting with a magstripe writer in hand .
But the man , who is identified in one court record by the initials " DK " , double - crossed the undercover agent , and sent two proxies in his place : 21 - year - old Andrey Baranets and one Aleksandr Desevoh , according to an FBI affidavit .
When the agent refused to hand over the magstripe writer , Desevoh took a swing at the agent , who ducked the blow and ran away .
The two men gave chase through the streets of Manhattan , before they were grabbed by other FBI agents who'd been watching the scene .
In pleading guilty last February , Desevoh said DK had told him to " take this device using force . "
Federal prosecutors in New York had by then charged three more people in the ATM - cashing conspiracy , including 32 - year - old Ukrainian immigrant Yuriy Ryabinin , aka Yuriy Rakushchynets , and 30 - year - old Ivan Biltse .
In addition to looting Citibank accounts , Ryabinin had participated in a global cybercrime feeding frenzy that tore into four specific iWire prepaid MasterCard accounts , issued by St. Louis–based First Bank , in the fall of 2007 .
On Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 – just two days – the iWire accounts were hit with more than 9,000 actual and attempted withdrawals from ATM machines around the world , resulting in $ 5 million in losses .
At the time of the ATM capers , FBI and U.S. Secret Service agents had been investigating Ryabinin for his activities on Eastern European carder forums .
Ryabinin used the same ICQ chat account to conduct criminal business , and to participate in amateur - radio websites .
The feds compared photos of Ryabinin from some of the ham sites to video captured by New York ATM cameras in the Citibank and iWire withdrawals , and determined it was the same man – right down to the tan jacket with dark - blue trim .
When they raided Ryabinin 's home , agents found his computer logged into a carding forum .
They also found a magstripe writer and $ 800,000 in cash – including $ 690,000 in garbage bags , shopping bags and boxes stashed in the bedroom closet .
Another $ 99,000 in cash turned up in one of the safe - deposit boxes rented by Ryabinin and his wife , Olena .
Biltse was also found with $ 800,000 in cash .
Ryabinin's wife told investigators that she witnessed her husband " leave the couple 's house with bundles of credit cards in rubber bands and return with large sums of cash , " a Secret Service affidavit ( . pdf ) reads .
Two of the ATM scammers arrested by the FBI filled in the bureau on the details of the operation , explaining how , beginning in December 2007 , they began working with a ringleader in Russia , who provided them with ATM account numbers and PINs .
The deal was straightforward :
They 'd use the information to encode fraudulent ATM cards and withdraw cash , sending 70 percent of the take to the Russian and keeping 25 percent for themselves .
Another 5 percent went for expenses .
The duo initially used Western Union money transfers to get cash to their boss in Russia , according to an FBI affidavit .
Later , they exploited a relationship with 30 - year - old Ilya Boruch , an " exchanger " for the site WebMoney , a PayPal - like internet - payment system .
Exchangers are normally legitimate businesspeople who swap cash for WebMoney 's internet currency .
But according to the feds , Boruch had gone bad and become a money - laundering service for the Citibank ATM heists , transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the ringleader in Russia , without reporting the transactions to the government , as required by U.S. law .
Through his business , Bidding Expert , Boruch allegedly funneled as much as $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 a week on behalf of the two fraudsters , who delivered the cash to Boruch in person , sometimes by tossing envelopes into an open window in his car .
One of the FBI informants , identified as co-conspirator 1 , or CC - 1 , in court documents , held this instant - message exchange with Boruch on Jan. 10 , 2008 , according to the FBI .
( Punctuation is added ) .
CC - 1 : Need more wm [ WebMoney ] ...
Boruch : How much ?
CC - 1 : 60 [ $ 60,000 ] Boruch : Wow .
OK .
Listen , is everything OK ?
CC -1 : So far .
Why ?
Boruch :
Well , you need so much wm !
It 's just kinda strange CC - 1 : We 're working Boruch : OK .
Drop it off all in 100s ...
CC -1 : When can the wm be ready ?
Boruch : Do n't know CC - 1 : Approximately Boruch :
If you pay an additional 0.5 percent then it'll be ready tomorrow CC - 1 : And if not ?
Boruch :
Then I do n't know .
I can buy it from my people , but they 're expensive
Boruch was charged last year with conspiracy to launder money .
The final known arrests in New York came on May 8 of last year .
Citibank noticed that a large number of the fraudulent withdrawals were coming through its 65th Street branch , prompting them to put the location under surveillance .
When the Citibank official staking out the spot got a call alerting him to a theft in progress , he crossed the street to peer through the vestibule glass , and watched as a man in a baseball cap , jeans and a sports coat put a thick envelope into a briefcase and moved from one ATM to the next .
The official flagged down two nearby NYPD officers who 'd already been briefed on the fraud , and the cops arrested 28 - year - old Aleksandar Aleksiev .
With his consent , they searched his bag and found six ATM - deposit envelopes stuffed with cash , and 12 blank cards with stickers on them and a different PIN code written on each .

A 1980s - style video game attacks the Mac platform , deleting users ' files as they progress through the level and shoot enemies .
While its creator clearly warns of the consequences , the software has been labeled a Trojan horse .
The software created by Zach Gage is described as an " art project . "
The " game " generates aliens based on the number of files on a user 's computer , and killing them deletes a file .
Upon the player 's death the game is supposed to delete itself .
It includes an online raking of players ' scores .
" By way of exploring what it means to kill in a video - game , Lose / Lose broaches bigger questions , " the project 's creator said .
" As technology grows , our understanding of it diminishes , yet , at the same time , it becomes increasingly important in our lives .
At what point does our virtual data become as important to us as physical possessions ?
If we have reached that point already , what real objects do we value less than our data ?
What implications does trusting something so important to something we understand so poorly have ? "
While Gage sees his project as art , Symantec views it as a Trojan , though " Lose / Lose " is not seen as a great threat at the moment .
The malware 's creator even warns on his Web site what the application does , and upon starting the game , players are also cautioned that it will result in the deletion of files from their computer .
But the security firm cautioned that the threat , called OSX .
Loosemaque , could be modified by someone with " more malicious intentions " and passed on to unsuspecting users without the current warnings .
In a video demonstrating the Trojan , Symantec showed how the game begins to delete files on the system as aliens are killed , in a top - down shooter designed in the style of classics like Galaga .
After a number of aliens were killed , the program attempted to delete a critical system file , which caused the malware to crash .
" You 'll notice that while I 'm blowing up the ships , the files in my Documents folder are disappearing , " the video states .
" It looks like the game chooses users ' documents first , and then it moves on to preference files contained within the very subfolders of the user 's home directory . "
Cult of Mac noted that the game has also been defined as a threat by Sophos Anti-Virus and Intego VirusBarrier X5 .
The software was first released in September .
Washington ( CNN ) --
It emerged in anger and it threatens to split in anger .
One major group in the Tea Party movement -- named after the famous Boston Tea Party -- is set to host its first convention in February , with former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin as its keynote speaker .
But there are fractures in the movement that threaten its future .
And if history 's any guide , such movements tend to flame out .
The Tea Party movement erupted on April 15 -- tax day -- over criticism of President Obama 's economic policies and what organizers called big government out of control .
The movement , made up of local , state and national groups , continues to protest what it considers fiscally unsound policies .
And the movement is well funded .
Action groups like FreedomWorks -- chaired by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey -- helped organize and fund its April 15 rally in Washington .
Other groups , including Americans for Prosperity , Tea Party Nation and Tea Party Patriots , are also vying for the helm of the movement , and it 's creating what some are calling " competitive chaos . "
Some Tea Partiers have voiced anger and concern over whether the powerful groups are " astroturfing ' ' what is supposed to be a grass - roots coalition -- the idea that the movement is being organized by old - fashioned GOP bigwigs to promote their agenda .
Donna Klink , of the Golden Triangle Tea Party - Texas , said in a post on the Tea Party Patriots Web site that the chaos needs to be addressed .
" We must craft a simple coalition message that we can all agree on .
...
We should all remember the simple principles of ' Strength in Numbers ' and ' United We Stand , Divided We Fall , ' " she wrote .
Klink added that individual Tea Party groups can keep their own identity and beliefs while " still reaching out to and working with other groups that share common goals . "
" We MUST stop this battle within and fight together , " she insists .
The factions , however , have said they are only trying to engage citizens in fiscal conservatism -- and disagreements are inevitable .
" There are disagreements over the exact direction of the movement .
There are some big battles between some of the national organizations happening , " said Brendan Steinhauser of FreedomWorks .
" But ultimately I think 90 percent of the Tea Party movement -- the grassroots members and state and national leaders -- are all moving in the same direction .
But there are certainly divisions that need to be worked out . "
While anger over economic issues sparked the movement , it has come to represent anger in general -- from anger over health care reform to just anger against politicians , like Obama , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
At rallies over the summer and fall , crowds carried signs portraying Obama as Hitler and likening his policies to those of Nazi Germany .
In one case , heavy criticism forced a Tea Party group in Danville , Virginia , to cancel a bonfire in which an effigy of Pelosi was to be burned .
And there 's the threat that fringe members will taint the public 's perception of the movement .
" The Tea Party combines the best elements of civic activism with some of the worst elements of fringe extremism , " said GOP strategist and CNN contributor John Feehery in a CNN.com commentary .
" While most Tea Party activists are genuinely concerned about the future of the country , some others see conspiracies around every corner and use unacceptable rhetoric to communicate their displeasure with the president . "
Steinhauser noted that the fringe elements only make up a small part of the movement and should not come to represent the cause .
" If you have 500,000 people at a rally or say you have 10,000 people at a rally , there 's always going to be less than one percent or some small percentage of people that are there that have some fringe voice or issue . "
That issue is similar to what other populist movements in the U.S. have faced over time .
Jon Avlon , author of " Independent Nation : How Centrists Can Change American Politics , " has said that history shows that Tea Party - esque movements and " demagogues rise when the economy turns south . "
" They specialize in blaming others for the troubles with wild accusations .
It 's a time - honored formulation , a powerful narcotic for the nervous and dispossessed , with violent side effects , " he wrote in a CNN.com commentary .
The populist movement started in the 19th century .
The Populist Party later emerged , made up largely of farmers , and coalesced around opposition to the gold standard as currency .
Its ties to the free - silver movement , among other things , failed to resonate with a broader base of Americans -- especially urbanites in populous states .
Later in the 20th century , populist anger rose up during the Great Depression , focused on big business 's role in the 1929 stock market crash and its subsequent effect on American society .
And in the late 1960s , populist anger was geared against big government .
" But now we 've got both -- anger at big business and big government , " said Avlon , a columnist for The DailyBeast.com .
" It 's a perfect political storm , primed for a return to pitchfork politics .
...
The fringe is blurring with the base , creating leverage on the party leadership . "
Nathan Gonzalez of the Rothenberg Political Report said that in order for Tea Party activism to blossom into a lasting movement , it " has to exhibit some real influence that goes beyond a set of rallies . "
He said that while there 's the risk of fading away -- based on the divisions within the movement -- it has growth potential .
" There 's certainly a risk of dying out [ like many populist movements ] but there 's the potential for having some staying power as well , " he said .
" If they become larger or more organized there 's a potential to have more influence .
It depends on how they 're able to harness the energy that 's there now and translate that into future success . "
And part of that organization could come from having a face to associate with the Tea Party name .
Palin , Fox News ' Glenn Beck and Rep. Michele Bachmann , R- Minnesota , have emerged as Tea Party darlings .
Gonzalez said the Tea Partiers need to have a one person to identify with their message -- much in the way Obama became identified with " change " in the 2008 presidential election .
If the Tea Party movement wants to develop into a political party or force , Gonzalez added , it should take the lessons of the populists and other third - party movements to heart .
" I think if a third party wants to take off , there has to be a face with it .
And Ross Perot was a good example of that in 1992 and 1996 .
It 's become more difficult [ with this movement ] . "
Mohammed Ezzouek began to pray .
He believed his death was imminent and that it would be bloody and brutal .
The 23 - year - old from west London could hear men talking in Somali .
" They were saying : ' You lot are al - Qaida ' and laughing , " he recalls .
" They were saying , ' You lot are going to get it ' . "
Ezzouek had had little idea what was happening to him as he and 15 or so other men had their hands tied behind their backs and were bundled onto a plane that left the Kenyan capital Nairobi in the dead of night .
By the time the plane had landed just after sunrise , Ezzouek had managed to work his blindfold free an inch .
He saw men with rows of " bullets strapped along their chests " , carrying " big guns " .
" I remember seeing through the window some guys lying down on the runway , their eyes blindfolded and their hands tied .
It was like a scene in a film where people have already been executed .
I thought , ' Oh my gosh , they 're going to kill us . '
Everyone thought they were going to die so I started praying .
There was nothing you could do ; there was no point in crying . "
Ezzouek wondered whether this country in which they had landed – and in which he thought he was going to die – was Ethiopia or Somalia .
He thought of his family back in Britain .
He could have been forgiven for wishing he had agreed to the deal the British agents had offered him just days before in Nairobi .
On several occasions , they promised him : " Confess to being a terrorist and you can return to the UK . "
But Ezzouek and three other Britons on the plane , who had all fled the Somalian capital of Mogadishu for Kenya in late 2006 as the American - backed Ethiopian forces swept into the country , had repeatedly protested their innocence to their British interrogators .
Although he had been held in a pitch - black cell measuring three metres by two and a half – in which conditions were so cramped that some of the 20 inhabitants had to stand for hours on end – every time he had been hauled out he would tell the British agents the same thing : he had gone to Somalia because he wanted to live under sharia law as enforced by the Islamic Courts , the Islamist alliance that back then governed much of the war - torn country , a faction of which has been linked to al - Qaida .
Ezzouek told the agents that he had entered Somalia by flying from Heathrow to Dubai and then from Dubai to Mogadishu .
He had told his family what he was going to do .
It was hardly the furtive journey of an al - Qaida operative .
Having fled Somalia , Ezzouek had made his way through the jungle and then to Kenya by boat .
" I had no idea a war was going to happen , " he said .
" If I was someone who was looking for trouble , I would not have been someone who turned up in Mogadishu several months beforehand , but a couple of weeks before the fighting broke out .
The Ethiopians had bombed the airport so the only way to leave was across the border to Kenya .
It was fight or run . "
It was a dangerous journey , he said .
" Helicopters kept flying overhead , dropping bombs and firing rockets across the whole region . "
Finally , after almost two weeks of travelling and being holed up in a Kenyan mosque , the exiled group , which included women and children , were captured by the Kenyan army .
Ezzouek and his three fellow Britons were transferred to a cell in a police station in the back streets of Nairobi where they were held for almost three weeks .
" It was like a horror movie , no lights , completely black , mosquitoes everywhere .
You can't imagine it , " Ezzouek said .
During this time , early 2007 , the four were regularly taken from their cell and smuggled through the back entrance of an upmarket hotel in downtown Nairobi .
In a luxurious suite they were questioned by two men who identified themselves as agents with the British security service .
Ezzouek asked them if he could phone home .
" I said to them what about my family ?
No one knows whether I 'm dead or alive .
Can I make a call to them ? "
They said : ' No you can 't . '
It was then that I realised what these people were about . "
He was shown photographs of alleged terrorists and asked if he knew them .
" They asked me about the 1998 Kenya - Tanzania bombings .
I said I remembered exactly where I was during the bombings – I was in secondary school .
They were so desperate to pin anything on anyone . "
The Kenyan security services also subjected him to interrogations that started at sunrise and were repeated every couple of hours .
One Kenyan agent suggested : " Maybe we 're being too nice to you .
Maybe , Mohammed , if we bring other people to you , you will co-operate , people who will make you talk . "
As the questioning progressed and Ezzouek became increasingly anxious , unable to eat and fearing for his sanity , a senior British intelligence agent who identified herself as " Frances " arrived from London .
The questioning became more threatening .
Fran ces told Ezzouek nobody knew where he was and that " anything could have happened to him " .
" She said how would you like it if the Kenyans were to take you to the Somalia / Ethiopia border , within sight of an Ethiopian checkpoint and then leave you to sort yourself out ? "
It was a terrifying threat , given that Ezzouek had fled the Ethiopians in the first place .
Frances became increasingly angry that Ezzouek was sticking to his story .
" She said : ' Look , Mohammed , I did not come all the way from London to Nairobi to hear you say you went to Somalia for an Islamic education .
There are serious people back home who are going to be unhappy with this explanation . '
I said : ' What do you want me to tell you ? '
She said : ' I want you to tell me you went to Somalia to fight with those terrorists . ' "
The implicit threat that Britain would wash its hands of one of its citizens was never far away during the interrogations .
Ezzouek , who was born in Britain to Moroccan parents , was asked if he was happy spending the rest of his life in his Kenyan police cell .
One of the British agents told him : " For your people , there 's no such things as solicitors , lawyers ; you 're another breed . "
After three weeks of questioning , the British agents seemed to have run out of lines of questioning .
It was then that Ezzouek and his three fellow Britons – Reza Afsharzadagen , Hamza Chentouf and Shajahan Janjua – were flown out of Kenya to Somalia .
Ezzouek said they had been accompanied by a group of " brothers " , fellow exiles from Mogadishu who had come from Jordan and Saudia Arabia and other parts of the Middle East .
It was these men whom Ezzouek had seen from beneath his blindfold , tied up on the runway in Somalia the morning he thought he was about to be executed .
Some of the " brothers " were not as lucky as the Britons .
Ezzouek later discovered from lawyers that they had been rendered to Ethiopia , where they had been beaten and tortured .
Ezzouek and his three compatriots were placed in a dank , dark cellar in the city of Baidoa , the then home to Somalia 's transitional government , which was fiercely opposed to the Islamic Courts .
Bullet holes in the bolted wooden door provided the only light .
The men were forced to urinate in a bottle in one corner of their makeshift prison while Somalian military guards held muttered conversations above them .
On one occasion , Ezzouek heard a cockney accent .
He is convinced British security agents were in the area at the time he was held .
The four might have stayed in Somalia indefinitely .
No one , apart from British intelligence , knew they were there and the agents had apparently washed their hands of them .
But back in Britain , questions were being asked at the Foreign Office .
Shortly before the men had been flown out of Kenya , Janjua had bribed a guard and contacted his family by mobile phone , telling them where he and the others were being held .
The four families were put in touch with the charity Reprieve , which campaigns to free those held in Guantánamo Bay .
Reprieve contacted the UK government .
That night police raided the family homes of the four , battering down the doors and removing computers and papers .
Looking back , Ezzouek says he now realises the British agents stopped quizzing the four of them only when they realised Janjua had managed to contact his family in Britain .
From that moment , the four were no longer invisible .
" That 's when they stopped interrogating us , " he said .
" I did n't know that was why at the time .
If Sha [ Janjua ] had n't made the phone call , we would have ended up in Ethiopia or somewhere else .
The agents were so angry with him when they found out he had made the call .
They said ' You 've ruined everything , you do n't know what you 've done . ' "
After three days in Baidoa , a British Foreign Office official arrived and took the four back to Britain where they were released without charge .
Ezzouek has never spoken about his ordeal before and is still wary about speaking out two years afterwards .
Now 25 , his conversation peppered with street slang and wearing trainers and a parka coat , he seems little different from other twentysomethings .
Only his long beard and his frequent thanks to Allah hint at his profound religious beliefs and his desire to live in a sharia state .
But his story threatens to haunt the government .
It shines fresh light on the lengths the security services were allegedly prepared to go to by allowing British nationals to be held in dehumanising conditions , without legal representation , out of sight of the law and where the threat of torture was ever - present .
Such treatment contradicts the government 's insistence that it " works hard with international partners to stop the practice of torture and of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " .
However , the government has refused to provide clarification on what guidance and policies it has given to British agents to prevent their collusion in the torture and mistreatment of detainees abroad .
What is known is that the guidelines were altered between 2002 and now .
Written instructions given to MI5 and MI6 officers in 2002 stipulated they were under no obligation to intervene to prevent detainees from being mistreated .
" Given that they are not within our control , the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this , " the 2002 policy stated .
It was amended in 2004 , according to the government , which will not explain why or how .
Now , in a landmark move , Reprieve is to launch legal proceedings , seeking a judicial review into the policies governing the actions of British intelligence agents when interviewing detainees abroad .
The litigation is designed to elicit what the 2004 policy is and whether it is still in use .
Reprieve 's lawyers have requested the government provide them with a copy .
In a letter to Treasury Solicitors , which provides legal services to government , which has been obtained by the Observer , Reprieve claims : " All of the available evidence which we have outlined ... suggests that the 2004 policy is unlawful because it fails to instruct service personnel that they must not obtain evidence in circumstances giving rise to complicity in torture . "
As part of the legal challenge , Reprieve and its lawyers , Leigh Day & Co , have submitted numerous examples of what they allege are the security services ' complicity in the ill treatment , rendition and torture of British and foreign nationals up to 2008 , suggesting the policy changes introduced by the government had little effect .
The case of Ezzouek , and the three other Britons known collectively as the " Nairobi Four " , will form part of the legal challenge , as will well - known cases such as that of Binyam Mohamed , who was allegedly tortured in Morocco , during which he answered questions sent to his interrogators by British intelligence .
Other , lesser - known examples cited in the legal challenge , include that of Salim Awadh , a Kenyan detained in Ethiopia who , according to Reprieve , was beaten for several months , after which he was questioned by British agents , and Khaled al Maqtari , who was violently beaten in Abu Ghraib in Iraq , where he was interrogated by British Special Forces .
The examples are troubling , according to Reprieve 's director , Clive Stafford Smith , because they suggest British intelligence agents were prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to keep Britons out of the reach of British protection , even if it meant , as in Ezzouek 's case , they were rendered to hostile regimes .
Stafford Smith says such a tactic must have been deliberate .
" We know from the 2002 policy that high - up people in government approved a policy of turning a blind eye to torture , " he said .
" We know that a 2004 policy amended the 2002 policy .
We know the government desperately wanted to cover that up .
But when we look back on the last seven or eight years , the thing we 're going to find more pernicious than the torture is the effort to cover up the torture .
The only question is how long before all this comes out ? "
Allegations of British complicity in torture
Allegations of British complicity in torture and the mistreatment of British nationals held abroad on suspicion of being involved in terrorism date back years and are fiercely rejected by the government .
In 2006 , the Pakistan - based lawyer who was acting for a British man , Zeeshan Siddique , told the Observer her client was routinely questioned by MI6 officers after being abused by the country 's notorious intelligence agency , the ISI .
The case of Siddique , who was returned to the UK with damage to his eye and later absconded after being placed on a control order , was one of the first to trigger concern among human rights groups .
But it has emerged that those in British intelligence have also raised concerns .
Parliament 's 2005 Intelligence and Security Committee report referred to concerns raised by a British agent about the treatment of a suspect interviewed abroad .
According to the ISC report , the agent wrote to his superiors asking for clarification of his obligations to the suspect , suggesting that at the very least the guidelines were far from clear .
Several other cases of British agents interviewing suspects abroad who were allegedly at risk of torture have subsequently come to light .
In July , the Joint Committee on Human Rights called for the government to publish all the legal opinions provided to ministers concerning the relevant legal standards on torture and complicity in torture .
It followed an announcement in March by the prime minister , Gordon Brown , of a review of the current policy on interrogation .
Brown promised to publish the current policy " once it has been reviewed by the Intelligence and Security Committee " , but since then the government has declined to provide more information .
Tomorrow , the government will be back in the high court as it attempts to prevent the disclosure of any documents that may reveal the extent of UK government complicity in the mistreatment and torture of British resident Binyam Mohamed , who was interrogated in Pakistan and Morocco .
Given the government 's extensive use of the courts to block legal attempts to shine light on the actions of British agents abroad , and its apparent reluctance to publish its interrogation guidelines , campaigners may have to wait until after the next election for a breakthrough .

29 Nov 2009
by State Rep. Matthew Shea ( WA - 4th )
This summer , legislators from several states met to discuss the steps needed to
restore our Constitutional Republic .
The federal government has ignored the many
state sovereignty resolutions from 2009 notifying it to cease and desist its
current and continued overreach .
The group decided it was time to actively
counter the tyranny emanating from Washington D.C.
From those discussions it became clear three things needed to happen .
1. State Legislatures need to pass 10 key pieces of legislation “ with teeth ” to
put the federal government back in its place .
2 . The people must pass the legislation through the Initiative process if any
piece of the legislative agenda fails .
3. County Sheriffs must reaffirm and uphold their oaths to protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States .
With the advent of the Tea Party Movement , many people have been asking how
exactly we can make the above reality .
What follows is Part I of the outline of
that plan regarding state legislation , the action steps any concerned citizen
can take to see this legislation to fruition , and the brief history and
justifications behind each .
Step 1 : Reclaim State Sovereignty through Key Nullification Legislation
Our Constitutional Republic is founded on a system of checks and balances known
as the “ separation of powers . ”
Rarely , however , are the states considered part
of this essential principle .
Enter the “ doctrine of nullification . ”
Nullification is based on the simple principle that the federal government
cannot be the final arbiter of the extent and boundaries of its own power .
This
includes all branches of the federal government .
In the law this is known as a
“ conflict of interest . ”
Additionally , since the states created the federal government the federal
government was an agent of the states ; not the other way around .
Thus , Thomas
Jefferson believed that , by extension , the states had a natural right to nullify
( render as of no effect ) any laws they believed were unconstitutional .
In the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 he wrote ,
“ co -States , recurring to their natural right … will concur in declaring these acts
void , and of no force , and will each take measures of its own for providing that
neither these acts , nor any others of the General Government not plainly and
intentionally authorized by the Constitution , shalt be exercised within their
respective territories . ”
1
Alexander Hamilton echoed this sentiment in Federalist # 85 “ We may safely rely
on the disposition of the state legislatures to erect barriers against the
encroachments of the national authority . ”
2
It is clear then that State Legislatures can stop the unconstitutional overreach
of the Obama administration through nullification .
Here is a list of proposed
nullification legislation to introduce in all 50 States .
1. Nullification of Socialized Health Care [ current efforts ] [ example legislation ]
2. Nullification of National Cap and Trade [ example legislation ]
3. Federal Enumerated Powers Requirement ( Blanket Nullification ) [ details ]
4. Establishment of a Federal Tax Escrow Account [ example legislation ]
If imposed , socialized health care and cap and trade will crush our economy .
These programs are both unconstitutional , creating government powers beyond
those enumerated by the Constitution .
If those programs are nullified , it will
give the individual states a fighting chance to detach from a federal budget in
freefall and save the economies of the individual states .
Next , blanket nullification .
The Federal Government , particularly the House of Representatives , needs to
abide by its own rules .
In particular , House Rule XIII 3 (d ) specifically states
that :
“ Each report of a committee on a public bill or public joint resolution shall
contain the following : ( 1 ) A statement citing the specific powers granted to
Congress in the Constitution to enact the law proposed by the bill or resolution . ”
3
Needless to say , this rule is generally ignored .
The idea behind blanket
nullification is that if the Congress does not specify the enumerated power it
is using according to its own rules , or the power specified is not one of the
enumerated powers granted to Congress in the United States Constitution , then
the “ law ” is automatically null and void .
Lastly , the federal government cannot survive without money .
I know that seems
obvious but many states are missing the opportunity to use money as an incentive
for the federal government to return to its proper role .
Most visibly , states
help collect the federal portion of the gasoline tax .
That money should be put
into an escrow account at the state level and held there .
The Escrow Account
legislation includes a provision that all consumer , excise , and income taxes
payable to the federal government would go through this account first .
This
would do two things .
First , it would give states the ability to collect interest
on that money to help offset revenue shortfalls .
Second , it would allow states
to hold that money as long as needed as an incentive for the federal government
to return within the enumerated boundaries of its power .
Step 2 : Erect an impenetrable wall around the County Sheriff and the 2nd
Amendment .
As recently stated in the famous Heller opinion by the United States Supreme
Court , the right to bear arms “ is an individual right protecting against both
public and private violence ” and “ when the able - bodied men of a nation are
trained in arms and organized they are better able to resist tyranny . ”
4
Thus , it is clear that the 2nd Amendment not only protects the right to
self - defense but that right extends to defending oneself against tyranny .
As
with any historical attempt to establish a dictatorship weapons must be seized
or severely regulated .
5
Here is a list of legislation to prevent this from happening , some of which has
already been introduced in states around the country :
• Sheriff First [ model legislation ]
• Extension of the Castle Doctrine ( right to protection ) [ sample legislation ]
• Prohibition of Gun and Ammunition Tracking [ see above ]
• Firearms Freedom
Act [ current efforts ] [ model legislation ]
The county Sheriff is the senior law enforcement officer both in terms of rank
and legal authority in a county .
This comes from a tradition of over 1000 years
of Anglo - Saxon common law .
Anglo - Saxon communities were typically organized into
“ shires ” consisting of approximately 1000 people .
6
The chief law enforcement officer of the shire was the “ reeve ” or “ reef . ”
Hence ,
the modern combination of the two words , as we know them today , “ shire reef ” or
“ Sheriff . ” 7
Consequently , the Sheriff ’s pre-eminent legal authority is well established .
This was confirmed in Printz v. United States .
7 Justice Scalia quotes James
Madison who wrote in Federalist 39 :
“ In the latter , the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent
portions of the supremacy , no more subject , within their respective spheres , to
the general authority , than the general authority is subject to them , within its
own sphere . ”
9
Sheriff 1st legislation would formally declare that all federal agents and
officers must give notice of , and seek permission before , any arrest , search , or
seizure occurs .
Thus , federal agents and officers seeking to enforce
unconstitutional laws must go through the county Sheriff first .
Extending the castle doctrine to one ’s person would go a long way toward
eliminating the arbitrary “ no carry ” areas .
Like Virginia
Tech , it is these
areas where guns for self - defense are most needed .
Many gun and ammunition tracking schemes have been , and are still being ,
attempted .
The intended purpose of “ reducing gun related ” crime is never
realized .
Instead , law - abiding citizens are punished with regulatory burdens and
fees .
Quite simply we need transparency in government not in the people .
Montana started the firearms freedom act to rein in the federal government ’s use
of the Commerce Clause to regulate everything within the stream of commerce .
The
original intent of the Commerce Clause was to regulate commerce between states
not within states as Professor Rob Natelson points out in his 2007 Montana Law
Review article.10
The Montana FFA simply returns to that original understanding regarding firearms
made , sold , and kept within a state ’s borders .
This list is by no means exhaustive .
However , it does contain some immediate
steps that can be taken toward freedom and restoring our God honoring
Constitutional Republic .
Hitler ’s laws of January 30 and February 14 , 1934 ,
should serve as a stark reminder of what happens when state sovereignty is
abolished .
In the coming few weeks I will publish the next part of the plan .

This is what I got from my Australian Secret Santa .
I do n’t know his or her username but hopefully they ’ll see this .
It ’s a clay figure , a vinyl disc of Lennon ’s “ We all Shine on ” ( along with a copy burned on cd ) and an Australian silver dollar .
Plus there ’s a card .
This is what it says :
Greetings , fellow Redditor !
I enclose a few gifts for you as your profile was a bit ‘ vague ’ .
So I had to improvise and hope for the best .
My first gift ( aptly labeled “ 1 ” ) is a somewhat ugly little figure I picked up while in Cuzco , Peru .
But appearances can be deceiving .
This is a symbol of good luck and prosperity .
But it only works if it ’s freely given , no bought .
So now it ’s yours .
The second one “ 2 ” is my way of giving you an ‘ upvote ’ .
It ’s one of my favorite songs and it always cheers me up .
Finally , number “ 3 ” was bought on impulse .
But it ’s a good gift as a symbol of prosperity and good fortune .
It also works as a good sign of friendship .
Be a friend and share your good fortune whenever you can .
Another fellow Redditor .
Now , if you ’ll indulge me for a moment , I ’d like to explain why this is so special to me .
About five years ago my wife and I uprooted and moved away from all of our friends to the place we are now .
Friends who were once within walking distance or maybe just a short drive away are now scattered across the country with only occasional phone calls , emails and rare reunions to keep us connected .
Here I ’m faced everyday with people who I share no common interests , tastes or philosophy with .
I ’m not griping and am not saying I ’m lonely .
I have my more - beautiful - than - I - deserve - to - be - around wife and three amazing kids who get all my attention but for everything else , there ’s reddit .
I ’m definitely more of a lurker than anything but this is still one of those rare places outside my own home where I feel connected .
When this SS deal rolled around I jumped at it and I ’m so glad I did .
It was the first opportunity I ’ve had for something that ’s been such a part of my everyday life to have some tangible result .
I did n’t care what I ’d get .
Those four paperclips would ’ve even been worth a lot to me .
Just something from a person who ’s a member of the same community proving that there ’s flesh and blood behind the links and text .
These things , each beautifully wrapped , really hit me .
It was much more than I ’d expected .
The shipping alone cost what I consider to be a fortune .
But it was so much more because rather than just some thing , some token of a like - minded individual existing somewhere , there was a lot of thought put into it .
It ’s meaningful and it has made my Christmas .
It beat the hell out of the shamwow set I sent .
Thank you so much whoever you are .
And kickme444 and 5 days , you guys are the greatest .
WASHINGTON -- Congress 's move to lift the federal government 's borrowing limit by $ 290 billion -- enough to last about two months -- sets the stage for a contentious debate early next year on government spending .
The Senate on Thursday approved the increase in a 60 - 39 vote that was largely along party lines .
The House passed the measure last week .
The additional $ 290 billion in borrowing ability lifts the total public debt the federal government can hold to about $ 12.4 trillion and will allow the government to keep borrowing through February .
Treasury officials had warned that the current limit of $ 12.1 trillion was close to being breached .
Congressional leaders scrambled to raise the ceiling before they began the holiday recess .
An increase in the debt ceiling is largely symbolic as it represents money already spent by the U.S. government .
In the unlikely scenario where it was ever breached , however , there would be significant consequences for the financial markets .
The federal government would be forced to default on its obligations , and could lose its top credit rating , having to pay much higher interest rates as a result .

Bipartisan support may grow behind an effort to reinstate the Glass - Steagall act , a sponsor of that effort said Wednesday .
Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) , who joined with Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to sponsor a bill re-introducing the Depression - era law separating commercial and investment banking , said she 's heard quite a bit of chatter about their effort .
" I think it 's going to be a bipartisan issue , " she said during an interview on MSNBC .
" I think it 's going to be an American issue . "
ADVERTISEMENT
An effort by a group of House lawmakers to go after " too big to fail " financial institutions was beaten back last week , though Hoyer said Tuesday that reviving Glass - Steagall is " certainly under discussion " in the House , according to Bloomberg News " I 've heard from many of my Democratic colleagues in the last 24 hours .
Sen. Feingold ( D - Wisc. ) , others , who are joining us on this legislation , " she said during an appearance on MSNBC .
" I saw where [ House Majority Leader ] Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) came out in a comment saying we need to go back and look at this again .
" Cantwell has struck a pose in recent months as a particularly outspoken liberal voice against support for large banks , and a perceived closeness between Obama administration officials and Wall Street .
She said in November she 's " not sure " why Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner still has a job .
Mike Kosowski was dealt a bad hand on 9/11 – but now the former NYPD detective has come up all aces .
Kosowski , a 53 - year - old amateur card - player , won $ 1 million on the FOX poker game show PokerStars.
net Million Dollar Challenge after beating one of the world ’s top pros in a head - to - head game .
“ It ’s unbelievable , ” he told The Post .
“ We ’re still on an emotional high every day .
Every day I wonder , ‘ Am I living a dream . ’ ”
Kosowski said he was able to live out a real life David vs.
Goliath story and beat pro Daniel Negreanu by using a combination of good cards and the ability to read people , which he learned on the police force .
“ I said this guy ’s a pro , if he gets a chance to read me he ’s going to pick me off , ” he said .
“ So , being a detective sergeant , I knew I could n’t let that happen .
“ Playing against a pro is difficult , ” he added .
“ Because you know he knows the game inside and out .
You ca n’t take as many risks as you would against some guy in Atlantic City . ”
Kosowski was a first responder at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , who was helping evacuate survivors when the South Tower collapsed .
He was knocked 10 feet in the air and suffered burns and injuries to his neck and back .
The Staten Island man retired from the force in 2004 – and out of boredom started taking up poker .
“ With my injury I was getting lethargic , out of shape , ” he said .
“ My wife noticed this . ”
He said his wife , Francis , looked for something to help occupy his time , and she noticed him watching Negreanu on television playing on the PokerStars show .
“ She said ‘ What do you have to do to become [ a player ] like that I said I need a miracle , ’ ” he said .
“ But I said , one day I ’m going to play him face - to - face and I ’m going to beat him . ”
Little did he know that he would get his chance just months later , when he entered a 16,000 - person on - line tournament on the PokerStars website – and came in 4th place .
That high finish entitled him to submit a video to the show ’s producers explaining why he would make a good TV contestant .
He eventually asked to be an alternate and flown with his wife to Los Angeles , where the show was taped .
It was the weekend of their Anniversary .
“ We said it was the weekend of our anniversary and we ’ll have the party when we came back , ” he said .
He would be a very good party indeed .
As Kosowski wound up getting to play – and winning two consecutive 4 - person qualifier games .
Then he got to face Negreanu – and he came prepared .
He said that he had already read the pro’s book , and he had watched Negreanu on television and figured out his tell .
“ The only read I picked up on him was . . . you knew he did n’t have the best hand because he puts his hand behind the back of his head . ”
Kosowski said he could n’t talk about his winning hand .
People will just have to watch the show when his winning game airs on FOX Dec. 27 at 5 p.m .
Kosowski , who will pay off his mortgage and donate some money to charity , was modest about his win , saying : “ I just got lucky , you know , and I just played my game . ”
This well - done benchmark comparison of several Virtual Private Server vendors gives me warm and fuzzies that I chose Linode for my new hosting provider .
However , the benchmarks chosen mostly test CPU performance and the bottleneck when hosting a dynamic web site is likely to be memory capacity .
The number of requests per second that your server can handle is determined by the maximum concurrent requests possible divided by the time in seconds to handle each request .
Each Apache process running WordPress PHP scripts via mod_php consumes about 20 MB on my Linode .
This means I can only run about 10 Apache processes and therefore handle 10 concurrent requests .
If each request takes 150 milliseconds to process , 50 milliseconds transfer time and 100 milliseconds processing time , my server can handle 10 / .15 = 66.67 requests per second .
Let ’s assume another VPS vendor provides the same 360 MB as my Linode account but the CPU is half as fast .
The requests might take 250 milliseconds so the server could handle 10 / .25 = 40 requests per second .
In this situation , the faster CPU is a clear win .
But several of the vendors in the review provide significantly more memory than my Linode account .
If that slower processor came with 1024 MB memory , it could maybe run 45 Apache processes and serve 45 / .25 = 180 requests per second , far outstripping my supposedly faster Linode .
As you add memory to a server , CPU will eventually become the bottleneck again , but my Linode rarely goes above 1 % CPU utilization while serving 66 requests per second , so I think that number is probably quite high .
There are also other web servers and Apache configurations that are a bit more memory efficient than what I am talking about , but with all of them you will still be limited by the number of 10 - 20 MB PHP processes you can fit in memory .
I do n’t regret choosing Linode as my VPS provider , they have great support and nice management tools .
I also do n’t expect to get anywhere near the traffic levels I talked about above .
But if you are evaluating VPS vendors based on how much traffic you handle for the money you are paying , be sure to consider memory capacity .
Sometimes songs get ‘ stuck in our head ’ .
In German , this experience is known as having an ‘ earworm ‘ and a new study shortly to be published in the British Journal of Psychology surveyed the typical features of this common phenomenon .
What particularly struck me was that “ the length of both the earworm and the earworm experience frequently exceed standard estimates of auditory memory capacity ” .
What is meant by auditory memory here is our ability to consciously remember a short piece of sound or to ‘ repeat something back to ourselves ’ – often called the ‘ phonological loop ’ in a popular model of working memory .
This tells us that ‘ earworms ’ are probably not something getting stuck in our very short - term memory but the reason why such tunes keeping buzzing around our conscious mind is still a mystery .
However , it ’s interesting seeing a study address what the experience typically consists of :
Earworms ( ‚ Äòstuck song syndrome ‚ Äô ) : Towards a natural history of intrusive thoughts British Journal of Psychology , C. Philip Beaman and Tim I. Williams
Two studies examine the experience of ‚ Äòearworms ‚Äô , unwanted catchy tunes that repeat .
Survey data show that the experience is widespread but earworms are not generally considered problematic , although those who consider music to be important to them report earworms as longer , and harder to control , than those who consider music as less important .
The tunes which produce these experiences vary considerably between individuals but are always familiar to those who experience them .
A diary study confirms these findings and also indicates that , although earworm recurrence is relatively uncommon and unlikely to persist for longer than 24 h , the length of both the earworm and the earworm experience frequently exceed standard estimates of auditory memory capacity .
Active attempts to block or eliminate the earworm are less successful than passive acceptance , consistent with Wegner ’s theory of ironic mental control .
The reference to ‘ Wegner ’s theory of ironic mental control ’ is just the fact that when you deliberately try not to think of something ( sometimes called thought suppression ) you tend to think about it more often .

Many millennial parents in Australia are quite busy trying to make ends meet while meeting the needs of their children .
Some are employees of certain organisations which have strict bosses leaving them with no option rather than looking for child care centres to leave their children there while they go to work .
We all know that one needs to be careful when it comes to selecting the right child care centre in their location .
Many parents have lost their children while they left them in the daycares .
Nothing can be compared to a child , and therefore one needs to be very cautious when selecting the right child care centre .
Well , for sure there are very modernised child cares all over Australia that are generally performing great and taking care of children fully in the right way .
That does not mean that there are no counterfeits in every city .
The last thing you want to see is coming back from work and finding your child missing in a child care centre where you left them .
That should tell you the need for having the right child care centres .
Now , what does a good child care centre do to your child in Australia ?
This is what we are going to look at in this article .
So stick with us , and we will let you know the purpose and roles of a daycare centre in Australia .
Let ’s jump right in and get started .
The Roles of a Child Care Centre
1 . To keep your child safe
This is the paramount purpose of having a daycare .
You leave your child in child care to keep them free and safe from certain conditions and intruders .
A good child care centre should provide the children with the right environment , which is secure and safe from any kind of danger .
This is where you check at the caregivers and ensure that they are dedicated to keeping your child safe while you are away .
You need to ensure that the centre is licensed and registered to operate .
With that , you are confident that it is a safe place for your child .
2. Educate your child
Most child care centres in Australia have come up with a planned program of activities they undertake to educate your child .
This is where your child learns from the various programs they are involved in , including playing .
A good child care centre educates your child the basic alphabet letters and simple calculations .
Generally , they add value to your child and make them better over time .
3 . To keep your child healthy
This involves all the actions needed to keep the facility safe and clean always .
This will keep the children away from diseases and other germs on the surfaces .
Besides , when it comes to the meals given to the children , the meals should be a healthy and balanced diet .
However , there are certain centres which allow the parents to bring food to their children .
4 . To create interactions and socialisation
This is a very important aspect of life that will determine how your child behaves when they grow up .
Generally , human beings are social beings , and as your child is in the centre , they tend to socialise with their peers and become better people in society when they grow up .
Besides , they find it easy to adapt to life in the preschool and other high levels of education .
The caregivers in Cranbourne North child care centre ought to be very kind and understanding to execute their roles .

The growing view that the economy is embarking on a self - sustaining recovery that could be similar in duration to the average expansionary cycle over the past century brings me to a new segment I like to call " Really !?!
With Doug . "
Of course , this is a takeoff from " Saturday Night Live 's " Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers .
If you are not familiar with their " SNL " schtick during their Weekend Updates ,
here are
a few
of their
Really !?!
segments
.
Really , the economy is recovering ?
Really , economists ?
I mean , really !?!
With globalization , wage deflation and with the prospects of tepid top - line sales growth , which corporations intend to expand their labor rolls ?
So , there 's going to be a meaningful return to jobs growth in 2010 !
Really !?!
And what happened to the previous forecasts that job creation would emerge in fourth - quarter 2009 ?
I mean , really !
In the face of the withdrawal of government stimulus programs ( 2010 ) , higher marginal tax rates ( in 2011 ) , costly health - care legislation , a
low level of small business confidence
, still relatively normal inventory - to - sales ratios and only a moderate improvement in demand , employers will soon to be forced to expand both hours and payrolls to meet demand ?
Really !?!
And , really , an economic recovery without job growth ?
According to the household survey , nearly 600,000 jobs were lost last month , and 15.7 million Americans are out of work .
Really !?!
The credit mechanisms of the shadow - banking system and the securitization market remain adrift , and banks are n't lending .
An economic recovery without credit ?
Really !?!
How about the state and local governments that have provided an anchor to growth in previous economic periods ?
Only two states have balanced budgets , and New York is letting out prisoners early to save money .
Really !?!
And I imagine retail sales are going to firm up into a better - than - expected Christmas season ?
Really !?!
The reliable
Liscio Report
states that sales tax collections dropped by 10.2 % in October , far worse than in September , and consumer confidence remains moribund .
I mean , really !?!
Are there any drivers to growth that can replace housing in the last cycle ?
I mean , really ?
And housing , which led us into this mess , is going to lead us out ?
Really !?!
Then how do the economists explain the recent drop in mortgage applications to a nine - year low and the very tentative housing upturn described in recent homebuilder conference calls since Labor Day ?
I mean , really ?
With consumers representing 70 % of domestic GDP , an underemployment rate at 17.6 % and possible cost - push inflation caused by a lower U.S. dollar strategy , how exactly will the economic recovery sustain itself ?
Really !?!
The drop in the U.S. dollar is orderly , and central bank buyers ( and others ) of U.S. fixed - income will continue as far as the eye can see ?
Really !?!
Given the outsized budget deficit , another fiscal stimulus package can patch things back together in 2010 ?
Really !?!
And what about the government 's budget forecasts that are based on the projection that the U.S. government will continue to pay generational low interest rates on the rollover of our national debt ?
I mean , really ?
Does anyone think that politicians , facing the 2010 Congressional elections next November , will embark upon serious budget reform ?
I mean , really !?!
Finally , to the rigorous cadre of economists and strategists who failed to identify the 2007 - 2009 economic downturn , the unprecedented credit crisis and that the
S&P 500
would fall below the 700 level :
What confidence should investors have in your 2010 $ 80 - a- share S&P 500 forecast or in 3 % - plus real GDP growth ?
John Mauldin reports that " the so - called ' Blue Chip ' economists told us at the beginning of 2008 that unemployment would peak out at 6 % . "
I mean , really !?!

Consider this the multitasking hall of fame , the master list of new uses for everyday things that will finally let you make the most of every single item in the house .
With these new uses for common household finds , anything — even something as seemingly single - purpose as a coffee filter — can take on new purposes .
And repurposing everyday things can even solve some decidedly mundane problems , such as a dangerously slippy rug or a clogged drain , without the need to buy yet another household item .
Whether they ’re needed to solve a particular problem — such as trash can smell — or to make the most of an everyday thing already in the house by repurposing it , new uses can be total game - changers , especially in homes already overrun with an excess of odds and ends .
There ’s no need to buy a new container for snowy boots when newspaper can do the job — while offering easier clean - up at the end of the season .
Save money on high - end sachets by repurposing dryer sheets instead ; instead of pricy ( and potentially dangerous ) weed - killer , try some vinegar .
The new uses list goes on and on .
( Olive oil alone has nine extra uses around the house . )
Ultimately , all repurposing ideas have the same purpose : to put used - up or readily available items to work in new ways , solving problems all over the house .
Start with these basic new uses for staples such as lemon , vinegar , olive oil , coffee filters , dryer sheets , newspaper , and more , then consider what else these standard items can do to simplify your life — and prepare to do a lot of easy problem - solving without a single trip to the store .
Once you ’ve mastered the art of repurposing , you can find new uses for anything and everything .
All it takes is a little creativity and plenty of little problems to solve .
Now , most of you must have got the idea from the title itself .
Of course , it is the IPL and Mr.Lalit Modi who have struck again .
And they along with the whole BCCI individual giants are encouraging a format , where India does n't even rank in top 5 .
Come on BCCI ... why do you always have to something atrocious and harmful for the team in your control ?
Bring in some more tests please :s ... before we , the fans of Indian Cricket break your luxurious , exquisite office made from the money - through - IPL into bits and pieces .
For MSD and Co. somehow provided the icing on the cake by first marking Indian Cricket 's 100th test win , and then of course , taking India to numero uno .
Now that playing against minnows like Bangladesh is going to give India not even one single point in the table , and with the NZ test series still not confirmed , I doubt if India might even slip to as low as 3 or 4 in the rankings .
Possible enough ?
Is n't it ?
Here is where , MSD 's golden luck will come into play .
Do n't forget how SL players were left licking their wounds due to the lacking of UDRS .
Had it been there , at least the 3rd test could have resulted in a draw .
And now in the present and the future , if by god 's grace , the Aussies and the Saffas could fail to make amends of the opportunities coming at them , it is going to be Dhoni 's luck again .
Still though , credit has to be given to the whole Indian team , not only the one in the present but right from the 90s when our legendary heroes were cementing their place in the side right to youngsters coming in the side and doing well of late .
Needless to say , it has been a long journey , and the whole of Indian Cricket deserves to cherish these precious moments .
Who knows .. kal India No. 1 ho ya na ho ?

Mr Coulton said the surprise " mauvais élève " has been France , which has let its budget deficit balloon to 8.5 pc of GDP next year - or higher including an off balance sheet " Grand Loan " of € 35bn ( £ 31 bn ) for investment projects - despite having suffered a mild recession .
" It is one thing to run a large deficit when your economy has shrunk sharply , but this is self - inflicted .
They are moving close to double digits .
It is a concern , " he said .
Seattle , Washington ( CNN ) --
A manhunt for a suspect in the shooting deaths of four police officers stretched into Monday night after the man appeared to have eluded authorities in an east Seattle neighborhood .
Maurice Clemmons , 37 , is wanted in connection with what investigators called an ambush of the four officers from Lakewood , about 40 miles south of Seattle , on Sunday morning .
Witnesses say Clemmons was shot during the attack , and police believe he is losing blood , Pierce County sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer said .
Police surrounded a home in eastern Seattle 's Leschi neighborhood for about 12 hours , but Clemmons was not found in the home when the siege was lifted Monday morning , Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters .
Clemmons was believed to have been outside the home Sunday night , but apparently slipped out of the area , Kappel said .
His escape was " an unlucky thing for us , and a lucky thing for him , " Troyer said Monday night .
" But his luck 's going to run out , because he does n't have people to help him do that any more , " Troyer said .
Police have arrested several people they believe helped Clemmons flee , he said .
The killings took place at a coffee shop in Parkland , a suburb of Tacoma .
Authorities identified the victims as Sgt. Mark Renninger , 39 ; Officer Ronald Owens , 37 ; Officer Tina Griswold , 40 ; and Officer Greg Richards , 42 .
Early Monday , authorities started identifying Clemmons as a suspect , rather than as someone wanted for questioning .
The night before the shootings , Clemmons threatened to kill police officers , but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings , Troyer said on " Good Morning America . "
Clemmons is a convicted criminal with a long rap sheet in Washington and Arkansas , according to authorities and documents .
He was accused of child rape and assaulting a police officer in May , and was released on $ 150,000 bond five days before the shootings , according to court records .
After his arrest , Clemmons ' sister told police that he " had not been himself lately " and that his behavior was " unpredictable and erratic . "
" He had said that the Secret Service was coming to get him because he had written a letter to the president , " an affidavit quoted her as telling investigators .
In addition , neighbors complained he threw rocks through their windows .
Clemmons ' wife told deputies that she and her husband argued over a " newly discovered child , " and she suggested that was why he went on his rock - throwing spree , according to an arrest affidavit .
Clemmons was given a 95 - year prison sentence in Arkansas in 1989 for a host of charges , including robbery , burglary , theft and bringing a gun to school .
His sentence was commuted in 2000 by then - Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , Troyer said .
Read the documents for Clemmons ' clemency
Clemmons returned to prison in 2001 , but was paroled in 2004 .
" Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy , it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state , " Huckabee 's office said in a statement Sunday night .
During his 2008 presidential bid , Huckabee was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate , convicted rapist Wayne DuMond , who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri .
Huckabee 's statement brought a sharp response from Troyer on Monday .
" We 're disappointed that Gov. Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington , " Troyer said .
" We 're guessing that 's probably a spin doctor , not him . "
Sunday 's shooting was the first for the Lakewood Police Department , which was created five years ago for the town of nearly 60,000 .
Until then , the Pierce County sheriff 's office provided law - enforcement services there .
Police Chief Bret Farrar told reporters
Monday he has repeatedly been asked how the city 's officers are doing .
" This is how everybody 's doing , " Farrar said , gesturing to the police force standing behind him .
" They 're here .
They 're doing their jobs .
They 're working hard .
They 're dealing with their loss .
...
We 're here to carry on .
This is what we do . "
The four officers " were good people , " Farrar said , fighting to maintain his composure .
" They were great officers , and we will all miss them very much . "
The Lakewood Independent Police Guild is accepting donations for the officers ' families , said guild president and Lakewood police officer Brian Wurts .
Contributions have come from as far away as Switzerland , he said .
" I can't believe he was out on the street , " Wurts said of the suspect .
" You have 5 percent of the people out here committing 90 percent of the crime -- not against just us , but against all of you .
And we 've got to hold these people accountable .
We 've got to keep them locked up .
And if they want to rehabilitate them , you can rehabilitate them , but you rehabilitate them in prison , where they 're supposed to be .
This guy should have never been on the street . "
The coffee shop on Steele Street is a popular hangout for law enforcement officers and is one of 22 Forza Coffee Co. locations in Washington .
" As a retired police officer , this senseless shooting hits extremely close to home to me , " Brad Carpenter , chief executive officer of Forza , said in a statement on the company 's Web site .
Police said there was no warning .
The shooter walked past the officers to the counter as if to order coffee before he pulled a gun out of his coat and began shooting at 8:15 a.m.
Sunday , Troyer said .
Two of the officers were " executed " as they sat at a table , said Troyer , the sheriff 's spokesman .
Another was shot when he stood up and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door , Troyer said .
All were in uniform , with their marked patrol cars parked outside .
Two coffee shop employees and other customers inside the shop were unharmed .
" Just the law enforcement officers were targeted , " Troyer said .
" After , we believe , some of the officers were shot , one of them managed to fight his way with the suspect -- fight his way , wrestle , fight all the way out the doorway until he was shot and died of a gunshot wound , " he told reporters .
Griswold ' sister , Tiffany Ryan , told reporters her " worst nightmare has come true . "
" I can't tell you how painful it is to lose my sister , " she said .
" If that man is watching this ... I want him to know what he took from us .
I wo n't ever get to see her again .
She wo n't ever get to watch her children grow and her daughter get married and have children . "

It ’s been a tough couple of months for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the country ’s most powerful business lobby .
Big corporations have been resigning from the organization in protest over the Chamber ’s opposition to cap - and - trade legislation , which I wrote about here .
Activist pranksters the Yes Men pulled off a hoax at the Chamber ’s expense , sending out a quite convincing press release saying that the organization was reversing its position on climate change legislation , and then holding a press conference on the subject that only ended when an actual Chamber spokesman showed up to interrupt .
And now Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones has shown convincingly that the Chamber has at best misreprented and at worst just lied about how many businesses it actually represents .
For more than a decade now , the Chamber has said in myriad venues , including congressional testimony , that it represents three million businesses .
That number has been pretty much universally accepted , and I used it in my column .
But in a recent post ( which came out after my column went to press ) , Harkinson pretty much demolishes that number , showing that the Chamber ’s claim to represent three million businesses likely depends on claiming the members of local chambers of commerce ( which often do belong to the national organization ) as its own , even though all those individual businesses do n’t pay dues to the Chamber or have any say in the organization .
In fact , Harkinson suggests , the Chamber ’s membership is probably somewhere between two and three hundred thousand .
The Chamber might conceivably try to wiggle out of this by saying that it does “ represent ” these businesses even if they are n’t official members , or , since its spokesmen have used the phrase “ three million members , ” by trying , as it has , to redefine the meaning of “ membership . ”
But I think Harkinson has them dead to rights , and that the accurate number is around ten per cent of what the Chamber previously claimed ( and I repeated ) .
And in fact , in a follow - up post , Harkinson reported that the Chamber has decided to acknowledge reality .
In a press conference to announce its big new campaign to defend free enterprise , Chamber officials said they had three hundred thousand members .
Remarkably , this was not another Yes Men hoax , and it only happened thanks to Harkinson ’s excellent work .
Sen. Jim DeMint went on Fox News '
Your World yesterday to explain why he's been holding up the appointment of a new Transportation Safety Administration chief 's appointment :
Namely , he 's more concerned about the potential unionization of the TSA than he is about the agency 's ability to function properly .
Of course , he claims that keeping the unions out is essential to making them able to function well :
DeMint :
It makes absolutely no sense to submit security in our airports and the passengers here in this country to collective bargaining with unions .
Of course , that would preclude such things as air - traffic controllers unions too -- but then , DeMint is probably fine with that .
Because unions are a greater threat than terrorists .
McClatchy has the full story :
Who 's running the TSA ?
No one , thanks to Sen. Jim DeMint WASHINGTON --
An attempt to blow up a trans -Atlantic flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day would be all - consuming for the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration — if there were one .
The post remains vacant because Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , has held up President Barack Obama 's nominee in opposition to the prospect of TSA workers joining a labor union .
... Two Senate committees have given Southers their bipartisan blessing .
An acting administrator is in place pending his confirmation .
Marshall McClain , the president of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association , said that the Senate should have acted sooner to confirm Southers .
" Friday 's terrorist attack on U.S. aviation makes it all the more imperative that there be no further delays in filling this crucial position , " he said .
DeMint said in a statement that the attempted attack " is a perfect example of why the Obama administration should not unionize the TSA . "
He wants Southers to clarify his stand on unionizing the TSA , a shift that Democrats support .
Without collective bargaining , DeMint said , the TSA has " flexibility to make real - time decisions that allowed it to quickly improve security measures in response to this attempted attack . "
If organized labor got involved , DeMint said , union bosses would have the power " to veto or delay future security improvements at our airports . "

THE University of Texas - El Paso ( UTEP ) is one of the most binational of America 's big universities .
Some 90 % of its students come from the borderplex — the Texan city of El Paso and its much larger sister - city , Ciudad Juárez , on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande .
More than 70 % of its students are Mexican or Mexican - American .
And that , in turn , means that the El Paso campus is rather different from the University of Texas 's flagship campus in Austin .
More than half of UTEP students are among the first in their families to go to college , and roughly a third come from families with incomes below $ 20,000 a year .
Diana Natalicio , UTEP 's president , says that for many of her students trouble at work , or an unexpected expense , can derail a whole year of college .
UTEP tries to help , offering after - hours advice and instalment plans for tuition fees .
Such measures have helped it to become one of the country 's leading sources of degrees for Hispanic students .
UTEP 's experience provides pointers for college administrators elsewhere , who are looking for ways to close the gap in achievement between Hispanic and “ Anglo ” students .
According to a report in October from the Pew Hispanic Centre , 89 % of Latino high - school students say that a college degree is important , but only 48 % plan to go to university themselves .
Hispanic students are more likely to drop out of high school than Anglos , and those who finish are less likely to go on to college .
Those who go are more likely to enroll in two - year community colleges , which have lower rates of completion than four - year universities .
In 2007 , according to the National Centre for Education Statistics , only 7.5 % of bachelor 's degrees were awarded to Hispanic students , even though Latinos made up about 15 % of the American population that year .
Most Latino college students are native - born Americans , but the Mexican - born students have a hard time , and youngsters without the right documents have the hardest time of all .
Stella Flores , of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee , argues that the best thing that can be done at the state level is to adopt policies that allow all of a state 's high - school students to pay fees at its public universities at the discounted rate that normally applies to people from that state , regardless of their legal status .
Such policies already exist in a number of states , including California and Texas , where the Latino population is so large that few like the idea of denying a proper education to crowds of undocumented youngsters .
A federal bill called the DREAM
Act would expand that approach and provide some undocumented students with a path to citizenship , but it is hardly at the top of the long to - do list now facing Congress .
Separately , measures are afoot to expand federal financial aid to students , and over the summer President Barack Obama announced that the federal government is to put about $ 12 billion into community colleges .
In the meantime , Deborah Santiago of Excelencia in Education , a non-profit research group , says that some good steps are free .
For example , El Camino College in California holds pronunciation classes for staff who might otherwise struggle with Hispanic names .
When students are crossing the stage to get their diplomas , they should not have their names butchered in front of the gathered family and friends .
What does Christianity , 911 and The Federal Reserve all have in common ?
" They must find it difficult ...
Those who have taken authority as the truth ,
rather than truth as the authority . "

The most progressive US president in a generation comes to the most important international meeting since the Second World War and delivers a speech so devoid of substance that he might as well have made it on speaker - phone from a beach in Hawaii .
His aides argue in private that he had no choice , such is the opposition on Capitol Hill to any action that could challenge the dominance of fossil fuels in American life .
And so the nation that put a man on the Moon can't summon the collective will to protect men and women back here on Earth from the consequences of an economic model and lifestyle choice that has taken on the mantle of a religion .
Then a Chinese premier who is in the process of converting his Communist nation to that new faith ( high - carbon consumer capitalism ) takes such umbrage at Barack Obama 's speech that he refuses to meet – sulking in his hotel room , as if this were a teenager 's house party instead of a final effort to stave off the breakdown of our biosphere .
Late in the evening , the two men meet and cobble together a collection of paragraphs that they call a " deal " , although in reality it has all the meaning and authority of a bus ticket , not that it stops them signing it with great solemnity .

Obama 's team then briefs the travelling White House press pack – most of whom , it seems , understand about as much about global - climate politics as our own lobby hacks know about baseball .
Before we know it , The New York Times and CNN are declaring the birth of a " meaningful " accord .
Meanwhile , a friend on an African delegation emails to say that he and many fellow members of the G77 bloc of developing countries are streaming into the corridors after a long discussion about the perilous state of the talks , only to see Obama on the television announcing that the world has a deal .
It 's the first they 've heard about it , and a few minutes later , as they examine the text , they realise very quickly that it effectively condemns their continent to a century of devastating temperature rises .
By now , the European leaders – who know this thing is a farce but have to present it to their publics as progress – have their aides phoning the directors of civil society organisations spinning that the talks have been a success .
A success ?
This deal crosses so many of the red lines laid out by Europe before this summit started that there are scarlet skid marks across the Bella Centre , and one honest European diplomat tells us this is a " shitty , shitty deal " .
Quite so .
This " deal " is beyond bad .
It contains no legally binding targets and no indication of when or how they will come about .
There is not even a declaration that the world will aim to keep global temperature rises below C. Instead , leaders merely recognise the science behind that vital threshold , as if that were enough to prevent us crossing it .
The only part of this deal that anyone sane came close to welcoming was the $ 100bn global climate fund , but it 's now apparent that even this is largely made up of existing budgets , with no indication of how new money will be raised and distributed so that poorer countries can go green and adapt to climate change .
I know our politicians feel they have to smile and claim success ; they feel that 's the only way to keep this train on the tracks .
But we 've passed that point – we need to go back to first principles now .
We have to admit to ourselves the scale of the problem and recognise that at its core this carbon crisis is , in fact , a political crisis .
Until politicians recognise that , they 're kidding themselves , and , more than that , they 're kidding us too .
Not all of our politicians deserve the opprobrium of a dismayed world .
Our own Ed Miliband fought hard , on no sleep , for a better outcome ; while Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva offered to financially assist other developing countries to cope with climate change , and put a relatively bold carbon target on the table .
But the EU did n't move on its own commitment ( one so weak we 'd actually have to work hard not to meet it ) , while the United States offered nothing and China stood firm .
Before the talks began , I was of the opinion that we would know Copenhagen was a success only when plans for new coal - fired power stations across the developed world were dropped .
If the giant utilities saw in the outcome of Copenhagen an unmistakable sign that governments were now determined to act , and that coal plants this century would be too expensive to run under the regime agreed at this meeting , then this summit would have succeeded .
Instead , as details of the agreement emerged last night , we received reports of Japanese opposition MPs popping champagne corks as they savoured the possible collapse of their new government 's carbon targets .
It 's not just that we did n't get to where we needed to be , we 've actually ceded huge amounts of ground .
There is nothing in this deal – nothing – that would persuade an energy utility that the era of dirty coal is over .
And the implications for humanity of that simple fact are profound .
I know we Greens are partial to hyperbole .
We use language as a bludgeon to direct attention to the crisis we are facing , and you will hear much more of it in the coming days and weeks .
But , really , it is no exaggeration to describe the outcome of Copenhagen as a historic failure that will live in infamy .
In a single day , in a single space , a spectacle was played out in front of a disbelieving audience of people who have read and understood the stark warnings of humanity 's greatest scientific minds .
And what they witnessed was nothing less than the very worst instincts of our species articulated by the most powerful men who ever lived .

On his MSNBC program Countdown , host Keith Olbermann delivered a special comment about the compromise healthcare reform bill .
Olbermann said , “ The Senate bill with mandate must be defeated , if not in the Senate then in the House . ”
If the bill passes , Olbermann called on his viewers to not buy insurance .
Here is the video :

Olbermann described the compromise bill as , “ Seeking the least common denominator , Sen .
Reid has found it , especially the least part .
This is not health .
This is not care .
This is certainly not reform …
The men of the current moment have lost to the mice of history .
They must now not make the defeat worse by passing a hollow shell of a bill just for the sake of a big stage signing ceremony . ”
He discusses the people who made this defeat possible , Chuck Grassley , Ben Nelson , Jim DeMint , and Max Baucus .
Some of his harshest words were saved for Sen. Joe Lieberman and President Obama .
On Lieberman Olbermann said , “ He has been bought and sold by the insurance lobby .
He has become a senatorial prostitute . ”
Olbermann addressed Obama directly , “ Sir , your hands off approach while noblely intended and perhaps someday applicable to the reality of an improved version of our nation enabled the nation humiliation that was the town halls , and the insufferable neanderthalian stupidity of Congressman Wilson , and the streetwalking of Mr. Lieberman . ”
Olbermann said that the insurance mandate must stripped out .
He called it immoral and a betrayal to the people who put Obama in office .
He concluded by urging people not to buy government mandated health insurance requirement without a buy in or a public option becomes law .
He said , “ I call on all those whose conscience urges them to fight to use the only weapon that will be left to us if this bill as currently constituted becomes law .
We must not buy federally mandated insurance if this cheesy counterfeit of reform is all we can buy .
No single payer , no sale .
No public option , no sell .
No Medicare buy in , no sale .
I am one of the self insured all be it by choice , and I hereby pledge that I will not buy this perversion of healthcare reform … I will not buy this insurance .
Brand me a lawbreaker if you choose .
Fine me , if you will .
Jail me if you must . ”
If this bill does get killed , it will likely happen in the House .
Olbermann ’s anger is representative of many on the left who ca n’t understand how a bill that started out as healthcare reform became an individual mandate with no regulation on the insurance companies .
In the end though , Democrats seem hell bent on passing a bill , even if it is a bad one , so this bill will likely pass and be signed by President Obama .
Former High Court judge Michael Kirby .
Nearly 120,000 Australians signed a petition against internet censorship by online activist group GetUp .
In an interview with Fairfax Radio this morning , Kirby said some circles feared the controversial policy would be " the thin end of the wedge of the Government moving in to regulating the actual internet itself " .
" Once you start doing that you get into the situation of Burma and Iran where the Government is taking control of what people hear and what information they get , " he said , adding that Australia 's approach had n't been attempted anywhere else in the world .
Google has also entered the debate , saying yesterday the scope of the content to be filtered went too far beyond child pornography and that the " heavy handed " approach would restrict freedom of expression .
" Refused Classification ( or RC ) is a broad category of content that includes not just child sexual abuse material but also socially and politically controversial material - for example , educational content on safer drug use - as well as the grey realms of material instructing in any crime , including politically controversial crimes such as euthanasia , " Google Australia 's head of policy , Iarla Flynn , said .
" This type of content may be unpleasant and unpalatable but we believe that government should not have the right to block information which can inform debate of controversial issues . "
Kirby and Google 's concerns mirror that of Sydney University Associate Professor Bjorn Landfeldt , who said yesterday that there was no clear definition of " refused classification " and the goalposts dictating what content is prohibited could be substantially widened in future .
Already , the refused classification category includes a significant proportion of legal material such as regular gay and straight porn sites , fetish sites , euthanasia material and innocuous sites that have been mistakenly prohibited .
" It was through ' public complaints mechanisms ' like the one Conroy is proposing , that classic literature such as , and were once banned in Australia , " Get Up said .
Conversely , the Australian Christian Lobby has said it wants the filters broadened to cover all X - and R - rated content on the internet , with people having to opt - in to receive this material .
Landfeldt also criticised the pilot trial report used by the Government to justify the policy , saying the trials were designed to succeed from the outset , presented no new information and were now being used by the Government to further its political agenda .
The Government has said 15 other Western democracies have implemented the same filtering plan but most of the other countries have made the scheme voluntary for ISPs and the blacklisted content is limited to child pornography .
" Australia 's proposed regime would uniquely combine a mandatory framework and a much wider scope of content , the first of its kind in the democratic world , " Flynn said .
In a phone interview , Flynn said it was too early to say what effect the filters would have on Google 's services but " if you were to look at YouTube today and ask : ' Is there material on YouTube which could be considered refused classification ? ' , the answer would have to be ' yes ' " .
Conroy 's policy has attracted significant ridicule from international commentators and media , with news headlines such as " Australia plans Chinese - style internet filtering " and " Joining China and Iran , Australia to filter internet " appearing on the Telegraph.co.uk and FOXNews websites .
The Greens are expected to oppose the Government 's censorship legislation , while Family First Senator Steve Fielding has said he would support it .
The Coalition has expressed " concerns " about the filtering scheme but it is believed the conservative leadership team would have difficulty opposing legislation designed to protect children online .
Liberal leader Tony Abbott said he was " open to proposals " yesterday but two Liberal backbenchers , Jamie Briggs and Alex Hawke , have already committed to opposing the policy .
" While our reservations about the effectiveness of the proposal are strong , we will examine and assess the detail as we have consistently said we would , " Opposition communications spokesman Tony Smith said .

New visa proposal to help create the next big thing
By Maggie Shiels
Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
Investors worry the US is not doing enough to entice founders here A proposal that will make it easier for foreign entrepreneurs in the US to start the next Google or Yahoo will be debated in the new year .
Congressman Jared Polis has proposed a start - up visa to entice " foreigners with good ideas " to stay in the US .
The issue has been gathering steam in Silicon Valley where half of all tech company founders are immigrants , according to Duke University research .
The idea is part of a proposed overhaul of the US immigration system .
" Every day the American economy is losing ground - not to mention high - tech jobs and technologies - to India and China because foreign - born entrepreneurs cannot secure a visa to stay in the US , " he said .
Lost opportunity Eric Diep , who has just turned 22 , could be regarded as one entrepreneur who got away .
He came to Silicon Valley as a student like many immigrant founders who have helped start companies such as Google and PayPal .
Mr Diep was one of the first developers to get into social games with his application called Quizzes , initially launched on the social networking site Facebook .
Google , Pfizer , Yahoo and eBay were in - part founded by immigrants
Over a year ago he started to apply for a visa to allow him to carry on working in the Valley , but he soon encountered problems .
" The reason it was so difficult for me was because I dropped out of university and the stipulation for a lot of visas is undergraduate experience .
My age also seemed to be an issue for the attorneys " At the beginning it was n't the expense in terms of legal fees but the big problem soon became one of distraction .
I was trying to spend as much time working on perfecting my product but then I would have to go away and figure out the legalities of applying for the visa , " Mr Diep told BBC News .
In the end , Mr Diep decided to base himself in his native Canada and travel back and forth to Silicon Valley .
" The flying is so tiring between the two places and it 's expensive .
At one point , I had no money left in my bank account but at the last minute money came in and now I feel pretty fortunate that I can still do this .
" It was a pretty close call , " he added .
He backs a start - up visa because , for him , being in Silicon Valley is where he needs to be .
" Being there at the time really launched me .
I would never have spotted the social gaming opportunity had I not been there . "
Visa details
The start - up visa is aimed at streamlining the country 's EB - 5 visa system which was initially introduced in 1990 to attract foreign capital to the US .
Each year 10,000 EB - 5 visas are available but to get one , applicants need to invest $ 1 m and create 10 full - time jobs .
Mr Polis said he wants " a new class of eligibility " with the start - up visa .
The new visa would require $ 100 k - $ 250 k in venture capital funding
It would be granted to foreign entrepreneurs if their business plan attracts either $ 250,000 from a venture capital operating company that is primarily US based or $ 100,000 from an angel investor .
They must also show that the business will create five to ten jobs or generate a profit and at least $ 1 m in revenue .
Some of these requirements may well be changed when the bill goes to committee in the new year .
" Immigration reform is a big discussion in Washington , " said supporter Brad Feld , who is also a managing director with venture company the Foundry Group .
" We think the start - up visa is an easy thing to talk about and get consensus around in terms of having a positive spin on entrepreneurship and creating jobs . "
Job creation
Some critics fear that making it easier for entrepreneurs to set up shop will hurt Americans by taking jobs away from them .
" I feel incredibly strongly that that is a misinterpretation of the proposal , " said Eric Ries a venture advisor and author .
Start - up companies are needed to boost the economy say backer of the visa " Some people have called those opposed to new immigration reform xenophobes and that is why I think it is important we craft this proposal so it addresses those concerns .
This is not a new visa category but reform of an existing but flawed category , " he told BBC News .
The proposal 's backers say that far from taking away jobs , new jobs will emerge that were never there in the first place .
" If the capital is available for the market , we should jump to bring those people here .
Those jobs only get created once the founders get funded .
This is a market driven decision , " said Dave McClure , an internet entrepreneur , investor and start - up advisor .
YouNoodle is a start - up company founded by two British entrepreneurs .
It tracks the start - up sector and said the figures speak for themselves .
" If just ten thousand start - up visas were made available this would mean over 3000 additional new innovative and funded companies would be based in the US every year , " said Kirill Makharinsky , YouNoodle co-founder .
" They would generate more than 10,000 jobs on average every year .
In the first 10 years that would add up to over 500,000 highly - skilled new jobs " So the upside is huge and the downside is negligible because no jobs are being taken away from US citizens , " Mr Makharinsky told BBC News .
And for Mr McClure , the consequences of not establishing a start - up visa class are obvious .
" We will lose out because we are not being competitive with the rest of the world , " he said .
" There are similar programmes in Canada , the UK and Australia .
They are all vying for the top entrepreneurs and if we only look at our own citizens , we are only taking 10 - 20 % of the world 's talent into consideration here .
That would be short - sighted in the extreme . "

“ Egypt ’s role is receding regionally , and its cards are limited , ” said Emad Gad , an expert in international relations at the government - financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo .
“ Their main card , which is reconciliation and peace , is receding . ”

Egypt says these efforts will come to nothing until there is progress in the peace process , an approach the Saudis have not accepted .
Even as its vast reserves of oil money have expanded its global influence , Saudi Arabia finds itself unable to exert its will even on its own border , where it blames Iran for stoking an uprising against the government in Yemen ; or in Lebanon , where its chief source of influence , former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , was assassinated .
Even its goal of leading the Persian Gulf states , under the umbrella of the Gulf Cooperation Council , has faltered .
“ Saudi ’s role in the last 10 years has declined , ” said Abdulkarim H. al - Dekhayel , a political science professor at King Saud University in Riyadh .
“ The leadership now feels it has to try to reset the agenda . ”
The Saudis have decided that the key to re-establishing a strong hand in the region rests broadly in Arab unity and specifically in Syria .
Syria has close economic and political ties with Iran .
It hosts the political leadership of the militant group Hamas .
It shares a border with Iraq and has been accused of allowing militants and weapons to cross over .
It has a close alliance with Hezbollah .
All of these are excellent tools for undermining Saudi efforts to blunt Iran and push for peace with Israel .
“ The relations between the Arab countries , if they are solid , if the understanding is there , if the cohesiveness of their policy exists , then there is no worry , ” said Prince Saud al - Faisal , Saudi Arabia ’s longtime foreign minister .
“ It is only when there is division , and looking for other alternatives between the Arab countries , that creates problems . ”
So me and Grandma logged into that World Wide Web and took a look at the Nature 's Turkey ® website , and what they said on TV was true ; you could get get a turkey with pig genes spliced in for a nice hammy taste , or yam genes spliced for a sweet potato flavor , and on and on and on , whatever you liked .
You could even specify what herbal formula they 'd feed your bird as it was growin ' up .
It really was a whole meal in one bird !
And best of all , it was cheaper than them conventionally grown turkeys !
There was this big tank in the middle of the mall - some sorta aquarium , full of oxygenated juice -- what had dozens o' these newfangled turkeys all swimmin ' around in it .
The Chevronsanto man explained to us that they were born and raised aquatic .
That way , they did n't have to worry about gravity , and they could grow up bigger , plumper , juicier and more tender .
So we gave the girl our confirmation code , and she punches it into her computer , and it sends some kinda signal into the tank that alerts our turkey that it 's time to come out and be eaten .
Of course , the turkey does n't know it 's gonna be eaten ; it actually thinks this is the signal to come and get fed .
Little does it realize , when it swims through that tiny hatchway , it 's gonna end up inside a special super - microwave oven .
They said the computer would calibrate the oven to cook the bird at precisely the right time and temperature for the size of bird it was , etc. etc .
It took about two minutes .
And then out it popped , all Therma - Seal 'ed up and ready to go .
Hell , it used to take hours to cook one o' them conventional turkeys !
You can bet Grandma was pleased she did n't have to spend the whole day in a hot kitchen .
Later that day , the whole family was all settled down at the dinner table .
We said our prayers , and Grandma unsealed the turkey and brought it to the table .
I tell ya , it smelled deee - licous !
We could hardly wait to dig in !
Sure enough , that Nature 's Turkey ® jumps right off the dinner table , slips and slides across the kitchen floor and finally bolts through Bowser 's dog door .
We did n't try to stop it .
It ran out into the street as fast as its little duck - legs could carry it , which was pretty fast , considerin ' .
We all crept up to the window to take a look ...
It looked like everybody else in the neighborhood was havin ' the same problem .
Apparently that oven - thing down at the food mall must not 've been workin ' proper .
EXCLUSIVE ( contains update ) :
If you ’ve followed Nic Cage ’s financial back - and - forth with his business manager , then this will interest you .
Plus , if the allegations are true , I think it should rank in the Hall of Fame of entertainment business manager screw - ups .
Is it possible that the prominent business manager for a well - known hip hop band has failed to file ANY federal and state tax returns for the group , leaving it vulnerable to financial and legal penalties ?
According to a legal document filed today in Los Angeles Superior Court , Sean Michael Larkin is accused of that and more , including allegations he hid more than $ 1.4 million in tax refunds due members of that touring group .
( Though the legal papers do n’t identify the band , sources tell me it ’s the Black Eyed Peas . )
The filing also claims he has been obstructing efforts to conduct an audit of his records .
It goes on to charge that only recently has Larkin begun creating “ necessary accounting ledgers ” for the music group .
This is all according to the legal filing by Helen Yu , an attorney for several members of the group .
Yu was responding to a lawsuit filed last week by Larkin , who accused her of attempting to destroy his reputation .
* UPDATE : As his lawsuit states , “ The defendant used lies , falsehoods and baseless accusations seeking to ruin a competitor ’s business and reputation .
Plaintiff Larkin is a successful business manager with over two decades of experience .
He is the president and founder of a well - respected business management company , Larkin Business management .
One of his major clients is a very successful , world - famous music group .
Due to an inadvertent oversight , LBM did not timely file certain tax returns for the corporate and individual entites related to the group .
Upon realizing the mistake , Larkin accepted responsibility , set forth a course of action to correct the mistake and agreed to pay any interest and penalties associated with the late tax filings . ” *
Yu claims that she has at all times simply been protecting the rights and financial affairs of her clients , who relied on their business manager to oversee tens of millions of dollars in worldwide earnings .
Her filing also states that “ corporate entities ” owned by the music group and its members have been “ suspended ” by the Franchise Tax Board for failing to file tax returns .
One of the few utility programs that are used every day on mobile devices is a wireless networking tool , but somehow this is one of the last applications to appear for KDE 4 .
With the autumn 2009 crop of Linux distributions , a usable client for the widely used NetworkManager system finally makes its debut .
Why so long ?
D -Bus connects the NetworkManager Server and Client D-Bus connects the NetworkManager Server and Client
So why did a native KDE 4 version of what is basically a system tray icon take three and a half KDE 4 releases to complete ?
There are several reasons .
The original NetworkManager client was a GNOME applet and was developed in tandem with the server .
Because of this , the NetworkManager interfaces for client developers were only partially documented .
The NetworkManager system consists of a system daemon that receives network settings from a pair of settings services , one of which is run by the first local logged in user .
This service supplies configuration information by placing Connection objects on the system bus .
A client application sends commands to the service to activate these connections .
One of the first tasks , therefore , was to take the D - Bus interface documentation system from Telepathy and apply it to the NetworkManager D - Bus interface .
This was contributed to the upstream NetworkManager project , enabling up - to - date HTML documentation to be produced at build time so that other client authors can work without reading the NetworkManager C sources .
Another reason was that the existing KDE 3 KNetwork Manager needed many improvements to its user interface to fit in with other KDE 4 apps .
It used the Qt3 D - Bus bindings , so this layer had to be completely rewritten as well .
The current KDE 4 code shares only a few core algorithms with its predecessor .
Finally , the KDE 3 KNetworkManager clients for NM 0.6 and 0.7 were developed entirely in - house at SUSE and never merged into KDE main modules , so few developers joined in and most of the work was done when necessary by SUSE engineers .
A new beginning , and a false dawn
The KNetworkManager menu The KNetworkManager menu
Will Stephenson of the openSUSE KDE
Team took over responsibility for the KDE 4 NetworkManager client in 2007 from another team and began coding the base D - Bus layers using the new Qt4 D - Bus bindings .
At the KDE 4 Launch Event in Mountain View in January 2008 , he met with Celeste Paul , Christopher Blauvelt , Sebastian Kügler and others to develop a concept for a user - friendly yet powerful NM client .
It was to be designed as a native Plasma Network Management applet for KDE 4.1 , and shipped on several distributions .
But this client had more than its share of flaws , mostly because the team spent much of its time dealing with layout problems in the very new QGraphicsView classes , instead of ensuring that NetworkManager features worked , and the design had grown naturally over time , resulting in an amorphous structure that was hard to work with .
Then in May 2009 , the KDE eV offered to sponsor a coding sprint in Oslo , where seven developers met and produced a workable design to go forward with .
Throughout Summer 2009 this was refined , implemented and tested .
The problems with the previous implementation led the team to produce a strongly layered design so that a simpler System Tray applet could be written first , running as an independent process so that any bugs could not crash Plasma , with most of the code in libraries that a subsequent Plasma applet can build on .
What KNetworkManager offers
Basic configuration Basic configuration
So what does the new KNetwork Manager offer ?
At the least , a Network Manager client provides user controllable networking .
A system daemon receives configuration and commands from user programs .
This is what the default nm - applet tool for GNOME offers .
But since we were creating a new client from whole cloth , and with the experience of two KDE 3 clients and nm- applet to work from , we decided to improve on existing designs to make it as usable as possible .
For example , where there are many wireless networks available , showing all the networks all the time in the applet 's menu results in a screen - filling popup , making it hard to spot the network you wish to use .
Instead , the applet only shows networks that you have used before out of those that are present .
To connect to another network , or a previously used hidden network , a dialog provides a scrollable complete list , which can be easily filtered with a search line .
Even though KNetworkManager is not built with the fashionable QGraphicsView used by Plasma for its UI , Qt allows a lightweight yet attractive interface , with menu items that display wireless strength and detailed security information , while other designs are still mockups .
You can connect to networks with a single click in the popup menu , and its configuration dialog plugs into the standard KDE System Settings tool , making it easy to find there or in the popup menu .

The system tray applet with tooltip
But that 's not all we managed to fit in .
Due to the modular structure of the code , we 've already been able to attract new developers like Paul Marchouk to add polish and enhancements while the core was being completed .
Features such as setting custom icons for a connection , configurable tooltips for both the hardcore networking specialist and the first time user , a choice between one icon for everything , or an icon per network interface ( like in Windows ) , and a configuration UI for IP addresses that is ' better than OS X ' have come from new KDE contributors .
Other tweaks like storing passwords and other secrets securely or forcing them to be entered every time please administrators , and a Wireless Scan display lets you see what access points are in the neighbourhood .
But what about Plasma ?
Some readers will be asking about the Plasma applet now .
While this is n't being released yet , it has n't stood still .
The Oslo sprint design splits the user interface from the configuration UIs and the D - Bus services that do most of the work , so 90 % of the KNetwork Manager code will be used directly by the Network Management Plasma applet .
Meanwhile , Sebastian Kügler is continuing to polish the code , and the layout issues have been fixed in Qt .
We expect that the Plasma applet will be released as part of KDE 4.4 .
Future directions
Detailed information on a network Detailed information on a network
While we hope that users of openSUSE 11.2 , Kubuntu 9.10 and Fedora 12 will agree that KDE 4 KNetworkManager is useful for daily wired and wireless networking , and is mostly functional for 3G mobile broadband connections , there is still a lot to be done .
The number of possible networking configurations mean there are still known and undiscovered bugs , which are being fixed now .
A set of final icons are being prepared by the Oxygen team .
Improvements for KDE 4.4 will include a minimal UI when creating new connections , showing only the password fields necessary , and better input verification to produce connections that work first time .
Mobile Broadband will be improved by the inclusion of a database of ISPs , and support for the ModemManager interface will deliver cellular signal strength .
IP v6 configuration should be available soon , and it will also be possible to create and edit system - wide connections so networking is up before users log in .
And by passing information about connection usage to Nepomuk , queries such as ' Which files did I download at the office yesterday ? ' become possible .
Finally , we hope that backends for other network management stacks such as wicd , ConnMan , and the in - house tools used by Mandriva and Pardus will be written , so that a KDE user will feel at home no matter which distro he / she picks up .
Distributions working for KDE , not the other way round
Extensive configuration settings Extensive configuration settings
Most of the the KDE 4 Network Management stack was developed by Will Stephenson as a Novell employee , but it is important to point out that this is an open and Free development , with and for every other distribution and end user to benefit from .
Throughout the development we have liaised with Fedora and Kubuntu and exchanged bug reports , experiences , patches and even icons .
The source code is in KDE SVN , and will shortly move to Extragear , and developer documentation will be available at TechBase .
We hope that this serves as a model for other cross-distribution cooperation to benefit all of KDE .
Well , it ’s not really all about me .
But methane has figured strongly in a couple of stories recently and gets an apparently - larger - than - before shout - out in Al Gore ’s new book as well .
Since a part of the recent discussion is based on a paper I co-authored in Science , it is probably incumbent on me to provide a little context .
First off , these latest results are being strongly misrepresented in certain quarters .
It should be obvious , but still bears emphasizing , that redistributing the historic forcings between various short - lived species and CH 4 is mainly an accounting exercise and does n’t impact the absolute effect attributed to CO 2 ( except for a tiny impact of fossil - derived CH 4 on the fossil - derived CO 2 ) .
The headlines that stated that our work shows a bigger role for CH 4 should have made it clear that this is at the expense of other short - lived species , not CO 2 .
Indeed , the attribution of historical forcings to CO 2 that we made back in 2006 is basically the same as it is now .
As is well known , methane ( CH 4 ) is the greenhouse gas whose anthropogenic increase comes second only to CO 2 in its 20th Century effect on climate .
It is often stated that methane is ‘ roughly 20 times more powerful ’ as a greenhouse gas than CO 2 and this can refer to one of two ( very different ) metrics .
If you calculate the instantaneous forcing for an equivalent amount of CO 2 and CH 4 ( i.e. for a 1 ppmv increase in both ) , you find that the global forcing for CH 4 is about 23 - 24 times as large ( depending slightly on the background assumed ) .
Separately , if you look up the Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) of CH 4 in IPCC AR4 ( the integrated forcing of a kg of CH 4 compared to kg of CO 2 over a 100 year period ) , you get a value of about 25 .
GWP is used to compare the effects of emissions today on climate in the future .
The numbers are only coincidentally similar since the GWP incorporates both the weight ratio and the ratio of effective lifetimes in the atmosphere which roughly cancel for a 100 year time - horizon .
In the Second Assessment report ( 1995 ) , the GWP for methane was 21 , and it was increased in AR4 because of a greater appreciation for the indirect effects of methane on atmospheric chemistry , and in particular its role as a tropospheric ozone precursor ( since increasing methane leads to an increase in low level ozone ) .
There is also an indirect effect on stratospheric water vapour where methane oxidation is a significant source of water in an otherwise very dry region .
Both tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapour are effective greenhouse gases so including these indirect effects made the net effect of methane greater .
In the standard ‘ forcings bar chart ’ such as seen in Hansen ’s papers , or in TAR , or AR4 ( figure 2.20 ) , each change in atmospheric composition is given a separate column .
Thus ozone and aerosol effects are denoted separately .
Starting off with a paper we wrote in 2005 , though , a different approach that is perhaps more useful to policy makers has also been adopted .
This ’ emissions - based ’ viewpoint attributes the forcings to the actual emissions , rather than to the eventual concentration .
Thus since some of the ozone increase is related to CH 4 emissions , you get to include that under CH 4 .
The other ozone precursors ( carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds ) can also now be blamed for a portion of the ozone impact .
This was incorporated into figure 2.21 in AR4 , where it is clear that the impact of methane ( once some indirect effects are included ) is greater than you would have thought based on the ‘ abundance ’ viewpoint .
Note the changes basically only affect the reactive species .
When thinking about the various metrics , the emissions - based view is more closely tied to GWP than the traditional abundance - based approach .
A big difference is that GWP is looking forward in time , while emission - based forcings are looking back at historical events .
The increasing sophistication when it comes to attribution and GWP is strongly connected to the development of more comprehensive Earth System Models ( ESM ) in recent years .
These are the descendants of the General Circulation Models of the climate that have been developed over the last 30 years , but that now include interactive atmospheric chemistry , aerosols ( natural and anthropogenic ) and sometimes full carbon cycles in the ocean and land surface .
This extra machinery allows for new kinds of experiments to be done .
Traditionally , in a GCM , one would impose atmospheric composition forcings by changing the concentrations of the species in the atmosphere e.g. the CO 2 level could be increased , you could add more sulphate , or adjust the ozone in the stratosphere etc .
However , with an ESM you can directly input the emissions ( of all of the relevant precursors ) and then see what ozone levels or aerosol concentrations you end up with .
This allows you to ask more policy - relevant questions regarding the net effects of a particular sector ’s emissions or the impact of a specific policy on climate forcing and air pollution ( see here for a discussion ) .
Our new Science paper ( Shindell et al , 2009 ) expands on some of the earlier work ( as was discussed here ) and extended consideration of the indirect effects of CH 4 and CO ( carbon monoxide ) to aerosols as well .
This is necessary since SO 2 requires oxidants to transform to sulphates ( and so is affected by the perturbation of the chemistry by other emissions ) , and it takes into account the competition between nitrates and sulphates for ammonia ( which means that there is a small anti-phasing effect – increasing sulphates tends to decrease nitrates and vice versa ) .
When we did this , we found that methane ’s impacts increased even further since increasing methane lowers OH and so slows the formation of sulphate aerosol and , since sulphates are cooling , having less of them is an additional warming effect .
This leads to an increase in the historical attribution to methane ( by a small amount ) , but actually makes a much bigger difference to the GWP of methane ( which increases to about 33 – though with large error bars ) .
Currently methane levels are relatively stable ( despite small upticks in the last two years ) and are running below IPCC projections made in 2001 ( this of course is good news ) .
However , CH 4 is at more than twice its pre-industrial concentration and so still presents a tempting target for emission reductions which , because of our new work and the relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere , will likely be a little more effective at reducing future forcings than previously thought .
Given the value of methane as a fuel , it is likely that more of it will be captured ( as in this recent story ) .
CO 2 , however , is still increasing dramatically despite the slow down in the economy , and so current growth in radiative forcings is dominated by CO 2 and that will very likely continue for decades .
Despite our increasing appreciation of the role of other forcings ( including land use for instance ) , the overwhelming driver of climate change in the 21st Century will be CO 2 increases .
In a follow - up post , I ’ll discuss the sources of methane and the implications of the new results for attribution of climate forcing to different sectors ( including agriculture ) , where there have been some very odd ( i.e. wrong ) recently published numbers .
Dr. Iglesia said the argument for changing Pap screening was more compelling than that for cutting back on mammography  which the obstetricians ’ group has staunchly opposed  because there is more potential for harm from the overuse of Pap tests .
The reason is that young women are especially prone to develop abnormalities in the cervix that appear to be precancerous , but that will go away if left alone .
But when Pap tests find the growths , doctors often remove them , with procedures that can injure the cervix and lead to problems later when a woman becomes pregnant , including premature birth and an increased risk of needing a Caesarean .
Still , the new recommendations for Pap tests are likely to feed a political debate in Washington over health care overhaul proposals .
The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing .
Senator Tom Coburn , a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician , said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women .
Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation ’s health care system , he said , would lead the new mammography , Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences , hurting many people .
“ These are going to be set in stone , ” Mr. Coburn said .
Senator Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening , said in an interview : “ And this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening ?
That is curious . ”
Mr. Specter , who was treated for Hodgkin ’s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008 , said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings , not limiting them .
Representative Rosa DeLauro , Democrat of Connecticut , said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that “ Republicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction . ”

For all the rubber - stamp criticisms Anderson gets about being quirky and focussing on set design or whatever , his characters have pathos and he is n't disrespectful to them or anything like that .
Save that type of shittalk for people like Tim Burton , Guillermo Del Toro , Spike Jonze or DUN DUN Terry Gilliam .

Honestly , I 've always believed that Jar Jar was the best character in Part One , its gay that morons always pick him as the scape goat for why Phantom Menace sucks .

I knew this was going to be special when he compared his disappointment over his son with his disappointment over this movie and concluded the movie was more so .

SEOUL -- North Korean banks on Wednesday formally began a currency exchange that promises to wipe out much of the private savings people have accumulated through market activities .
The process was supposed to start Tuesday , but it was apparently delayed by protests to officials of the ruling Workers Party , say aid groups in South Korea with contacts in the North .
Phones were cut off in the country Monday and a curfew was ordered to quell potential trouble .
But ...
A drama exploring the romantic past and emotional present of Ann Lord ( Vanessa Redgrave ) and her daughters , Constance Haverford ( Natasha Richardson ) and Nina Mars ( Toni Collette ) .
As Ann lays dying , she remembers , and is moved to convey to her daughters , the defining moments in her life fifty years ago , when she was a young woman .
Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) is the man Ann loves in the 1950s ...

Sen .
Snowe urged the president to withdraw the public option because Republicans were universally against it .
What kind of argument is this ?
That 's like asking the chicken to vote for Col .
Sanders because the chicken eaters are hungry .
I oppose the Finance Committee version of the healthcare bill , and hope and believe it will be dramatically changed before it goes to conference .
I believe the public option lives and the fight must be waged all out , in full force .
The Senate Finance Committee wasted an eternity with bogus negotiations with a Group of Six that represented only small states and included two Republicans who would never vote for a good healthcare bill , and one Republican who should be a Democrat but opposes the most important provision because she says it is universally opposed by members of her party , which she states has left her on major issues .
Andrew Jackson once said that " one man with courage makes a majority . ”
Olympia
Snowe demonstrates that the healthcare of America can be distorted and disrupted by one senator who says she wants healthcare to be affordable but votes to make healthcare less affordable .
A $ 60 million project to extract renewable energy from the hot bedrock deep beneath Basel , Switzerland , was shut down permanently on Thursday after a government study determined that earthquakes generated by the project were likely to do millions of dollars in damage each year .
The project , led by Markus O. Häring , a former oilman , was suspended in late 2006 after it generated earthquakes that did no bodily harm but caused about $ 9 million in mostly minor damage to homes and other structures .
Mr. Häring is to go to trial next week on criminal charges stemming from the project .
On Thursday , he did not respond to messages asking for comment .
The findings are a serious blow to the hopes of environmentalists , entrepreneurs and investors who believe that advanced geothermal energy could substantially cut the world ’s use of emissions - causing fossil fuels .
The report comes as the United States Energy Department is preparing its own review of the safety of a closely related project , by a start - up company called AltaRock Energy , in the hills north of San Francisco .
The AltaRock project is the Obama administration ’s first major test of advanced geothermal energy .
Like the Basel project , AltaRock ’s plan is to drill miles underground , fracture hot bedrock and circulate water through it to generate steam .
The Energy Department began its review after an article in The New York Times in June raised questions about whether AltaRock had been forthcoming about the earthquakes set off by the fracturing in Basel .
The AltaRock project has also been plagued with technical problems .
So , it looks like Nintendo finally got the memo from a few years back and realized that demo ’s drive game sales .
The problem with the WiiWare service has always been that as a consumer , you were blindly buying games .
It ’s really been a shame to see so many people overlook some of the gems on WiiWare , like my favorite title , NyxQuest .
While it ’s good that we can now try out a few games for free , it kinda sucks that it is limited to only a few titles .
There are a few drawbacks to the demos seeing as Europe and Australia do not have World of Goo or Pokemon Rumble ( as of now ) , and the demos will only be available from now through Jan. 31 , 2010 .
While this may seem a bit underwhelming , I think it is a step in the right direction , and I hope they do n’t stop with just these few releases .
This is just a short list of the demos available now in North America , as well as their prices in Nintendo Points ( for full game ) :
- Bit. Trip : Beat ( 600 pts. for full game )
- Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a Darklord ( 1,000 pts. for full game )
- NyxQuest : Kindred Spirits ( 1,000 pts for full game )
- Pokemon Rumble ( 1,500 pts. for full game )
- World of Goo ( 1,500 pts. for full game )
So now that I got all the info about the downloads done , what are my picks for games you should check out ?
First and foremost , NyxQuest is fantastic and totally worth the ten bucks .
Just a little time with the demo , and you will be hooked .
Unfortunately , the full game will only take you 3 - 5 hours to collect everything , but it ’s like a nice , healthy meal … short , sweet , and satisfying .
I like a game that does n’t overstay it ’s welcome or beat a dead horse , so be sure to give NyxQuest a download .
World of Goo is another fun game if you are into puzzles , and the quirky sense of humor will put a smile on anybodies face .
My last pick would have to be …Bit. Trip : Beat .
BTB has a unique control scheme ( reminiscent of Pong ) , in which you must hit squares that go along with the music .
I hope as the weeks go on , we see more demo ’s come out of the WiiWare service , so that people can realize there are some great games on the service .
“ Word of mouth ” has been really the only thing selling a lot of these titles , so it will be interesting to see a sudden spike in WiiWare sales in the coming weeks .
The Cassini spacecraft has weathered the Monday , Nov. 2 , flyby of Saturn 's moon Enceladus in good health and has been sending images and data of the encounter back to Earth .
Cassini had approached Enceladus more closely before , but this passage took the spacecraft on its deepest plunge yet through the heart of the plume shooting out from the south polar region .
Scientists are eagerly sifting through the results .
In the unprocessed image above ( top left ) , sunlight brightens a crescent curve along the edge of Enceladus and highlights the moon 's misty plume .
The image was captured by Cassini 's narrow - angle camera as the spacecraft passed about 190,000 kilometers ( 120,000 miles ) over the moon .
Another raw image ( top right ) appears to show separate jets spewing from the moon .
This image was taken from approximately 330,000 kilometers ( 200,000 miles ) away .
At its closest point on Nov. 2 , Cassini flew about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) above the surface of Enceladus .
Since the discovery of the plume in 2005 , scientists have been captivated by the enigmatic jets .
Previous flybys detected water vapor , sodium and organic molecules , but scientists need to know more about the plume 's composition and density to characterize the source , possibly a liquid ocean under the moon 's icy surface .
It would also help them determine whether Enceladus has the conditions necessary for life .
Mission managers did extensive studies to make sure the spacecraft could fly safely through the plumes and not use an excessive amount of propellant .

Advertisement Scientists have identified the most ancient fossil relative of the dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex .
The new addition to T. rex 's clan is known from a 30 cm - long skull uncovered during excavations in Gloucestershire in the 1900s .
The well - preserved fossil is held in London 's Natural History Museum .
A British - German team has now uncovered evidence linking it to what may be the most famous dinosaur family of all .
The dinosaur , named Proceratosaurus , lived about 165 m years ago , during the middle Jurassic Period .
It is really surprising that it has received so little attention
Dr Oliver Rauhut , palaeontologist
The two - legged meat - eater would have measured about 3 m long and weighed up to 60kg .
The palaeontologists used computed tomography ( CT ) techniques to generate a 3D image of the delicate skull to investigate its internal structure in meticulous detail .
Dr Angela Milner , associate keeper of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum , told BBC News : " This is a unique specimen .
It is the only one of its kind known in the world . "
She added : " It was quite a surprise when our analysis showed we had the oldest known relative of T. rex .
" Fossils collected a century ago can now be studied again with the benefit of much greater knowledge of dinosaurs from around the world . "
Originally described in 1910 as a new species of Megalosaurus , the fossil was presented to the museum in 1942 .
The skull had been unearthed during excavations for a reservoir close to Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire .
T. rex lived during the Cretaceous Period
Dr Milner said that despite obvious differences between the skulls of Proceratosaurus and T. rex - such as their divergent sizes - the two shared many similarities .
" If you look at the animal ( Proceratosaurus ) in detail , it has the same kinds of windows in the side of the skull for increasing the jaw muscles , " she told BBC News .
" It has the same kinds of teeth - particularly at the front of the jaws .
They 're small teeth and almost banana - shaped , which are just the kind of teeth T. rex has . "
" Inside the skull , which we were able to look at using CT scanning , there are lots of internal air spaces .
Tyrannosaurus had those as well . "
Although the skull has attracted much interest because of its exquisite preservation , it has not been closely studied until now , thus , its link to the tyrannosaurs remained undiscovered .
" This is still one of the best - preserved dinosaur skulls found in Europe , " said co-author Dr Oliver Rauhut from the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology and Geology in Munich .
" It is really surprising that it has received so little attention since its original description . "

At just 26 , Donald Glover is a YouTube sensation ( with his five - person comedy troupe , Derrick ) and a veteran of the vaunted 30 Rock writers ’ room and has a role on NBC ’s Community as the dim - witted ex-jock Troy .
Next up : Mystery Team , Derrick ’s self - financed first feature — which Glover , for good measure , also scored .
He spoke with Amos Barshad .
When did all this hyperactivity begin ?
I went to a performing - arts - type school that my mom made me go to — she thought it was safer than my district school .
I auditioned with a monologue from Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off — the ending speech that Cameron gives .
I did that , and I sang a Boyz II Men song .
Luckily , the guy I was auditioning for was a big Boyz II Men–Ferris Bueller fan .
What are the odds ?
And then right after graduating from New York University , you got hired to write for 30 Rock ?
Yeah .
I literally had my R.A. pager go off the first day of work .
I had no money .
That summer before I got the job , if I was n’t at my dorm , I was in the psychological wing of NYU , doing some sort of test for $ 200 .
If you were lucky , it was just questions .
But sometimes it ’d be like , “ Okay , put these goggles on and look at this light for a half an hour . ”
Then I got an e-mail out of nowhere from one of the producers .
I was doing a lot of improv at UCB
Theatre and other places , and my name got passed around .
You wrote a lot for Tracy Morgan ’s character .
How was that ?
The first day I met him , I had a small Afro , and he was like , “ You know , if you want to get dreads , you should get your girl pregnant and put the placenta in your hair . ”
And I was like , “ What the fuck … are you talking about ? ”
But from that point on , I thought , Any brain that can make that up needs to be studied .
How did you land Community ?
I auditioned , but I did n’t think it was going to go anywhere .
Not that I did n’t like it , I just thought they ’d want a good - looking , hunky , football - player -y white dude .
I was more focused on my stand - up because I had just quit 30 Rock .
Wait — you quit 30 Rock before being cast on Community ?
Oh , yeah .
I was really getting into stand - up , and I wanted to write more .
I was unemployed for six days .
Impressive .
So Mystery Team is essentially an Encyclopedia Brown spoof — three kids who used to solve mysteries like “ Who stole the cookies ? ” grow up and try to solve murders with the same techniques they used as kids .
How did Derrick raise the money for the film ?
A lot of it came from YouTube dollars — they set up a revenue program [ for people who produce extraordinarily popular videos ] .
Also we produced online commercials for Clearasil .
What do you see for Derrick in the future ?
I honestly hope we become something like Pixar [ laughs ] .
Anybody else , I ’d laugh too .

A conservative Iowa group 's effort to lure Sarah Palin to its banquet next month has had an unintended effect .
Iowa Republicans wince at Palin fee
A conservative Iowa group ’s effort to lure Sarah Palin to its banquet next month has had an unintended effect :
Rather than exciting conservatives about the prospect of a visit from the former Alaska governor , the group ’s plan to raise a six - figure sum to bring her to the state has GOP activists recoiling at the thought of paying to land a politician 's speaking appearance .
The Iowa Family Policy Center ’s effort to cobble together $ 100,000 for Palin would represent a striking departure from customary practice in the first - in - the - nation state , these Republicans say , noting that a generation of White House hopefuls has paid their own way to boost their party and presidential ambitions .
Advertisement
Were Palin to appear in Iowa on November 21st , it would mark her first trip back to the state since she spoke to a handful of rallies there last fall as the GOP ’s vice - presidential nominee .
She would offer powerful counter - programming to another major political event that night :
The Iowa Democratic Party ’s Jefferson - Jackson Dinner with Vice - President Joe Biden as the headliner .
But representatives from other Iowa - based political advocacy groups said they would never consider shelling out money for what many politicians see as a privilege : the opportunity to speak to a room full of sure - fire caucus - goers who often serve as precinct captains and can be instrumental to a presidential candidate ’s success .
“ If somebody tells me they want me to pay an appearance fee , it tells me they ’re not very serious about running for president , ” said Ed Failor , Jr. , president of Iowans for Tax Relief and an influential GOP insider .
“ I found it really , really odd , ” Failor said .
He noted that his group had not and never would pay for a politician to speak — pointing out the obvious in - kind contribution any potential presidential hopeful receives by appearing in the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process .
“ They come and show up here because they want to be relevant in Iowa , ” he said .
Steve Scheffler , the president of the Iowa Christian Alliance and a longtime GOP activist , said his organization would also never ante up .
“ We certainly would n’t do it , even if we had the money , ” Scheffler said , adding that he wanted to keep his group “ impartial ” in the caucus process and that paying money to one prospective candidate could raise questions about such neutrality .
Tim Albrecht , spokesman for the conservative , Iowa - based American Future Fund , said his group “ has a policy not to pay speakers to come to Iowa , ” and , like Failor , hinted at what those guests get in return .
“ We are proud to host conservative leaders from across the country , providing them an audience across the state and nation to share their conservative vision , ” Albrecht said .
Like the other Iowa political hands , he could not recall a single instance where a potential candidate had been paid to speak .
At the request of the Iowa Family Policy Center , Team Sarah , a national pro-Palin organization not formally connected to the former governor , has begun raising money among its members in an effort to collect the $ 100,000 .
Reached on his cell phone , Iowa Family Policy Center president Chuck Hurley said he had been expecting another call from the “ 202 ” area code and declined to answer questions , saying alternately that he was signing checks and in a meeting .
He passed his phone to Bryan English , a spokesman for the group , who initially said their effort to raise money was only to secure a venue , pay for lighting and promote the event .
But then he said he was “ not personally aware of a speaker ’s fee . ”
“ There may or may not be , I do n’t know , ” English said .
And he added : “ Any details of arrangements between our speakers and our organization are between our speakers and our organization . ”
But , money or not , it seems unlikely that Palin will appear for the event .
“ This is one of more than a thousand requests for the governor 's time , ” said Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton .
“ This particular invitation arrived late last week .
It is under consideration , as so many are , but will be incredibly difficult to attend with her tightly - scheduled book tour underway at that point . ”
Palin ’s book , “ Going Rogue , ” is to be released on November 17th , followed by a national book tour .
There is no indication that the former governor has requested a fee or that her decision whether to attend is being influenced by whether she ’ll be paid .
Plainly , though , Hurley ’s organization is trying to do all it can to get Palin to the banquet .
In addition to working with the Team Sarah group to raise cash , the group issued a statement Tuesday promising an event “ on a much larger scale ” and touted their communications with the former governor “ through both official and informal channels . ”
Privately , Iowa Republicans are cringing at , not only the idea of pay - to - play , but also what they view as an amateurish effort to sell tickets for the dinner by floating Palin 's name .
But English dismissed a question about the group ’s tactics to secure a Palin visit .
“ I do n’t think anything about this process has to be part of a political tradition , ” English said , observing that their only goal was to have a successful event .
Palin , it seems , is breaking the mold again .
Longtime Iowa strategists say the attempt to publicly dangle money before her is yet another reminder of Palin ’s sui generis status on the political scene .
“ She is a phenomenon , ” said David Kochel , an Iowa GOP consultant , recalling the thousands Palin drew in her appearances in the state for the party ticket last fall .
“ If she can draw a big enough crowd , it would put a spotlight on the organization , ” Kochel added , noting that they could recoup the speaker ’s fee if , as is being considered , they drew Palin and had the event at Des Moines ’s Wells Fargo Arena .
“ They want to trade on her star power . ”
Gordon Fischer , a former Iowa Democratic Party chairman and Des Moines lawyer , called the gambit “ incredibly unusual . ”
“ It shows the incredible star power of Gov. Palin , at least in certain circles , ” Fischer said .
The effort also underlines how Palin straddles the line between politician and political personality .
Failor , the anti-tax advocate , said the only other examples he could recall when a group paid for a political speech were with big - name talk show hosts such as Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh .
But for Iowa political activists accustomed to high - profile politicians of both parties — Clintons , Kennedys and Bushs — descending on their state and spending hours in their homes , schools and churches , the idea of paying for the attention some see as their birthright is anathema .
“ If it comes to pass , it 's not a precedent Iowans will like , ” said Ann Trimble - Ray , Chairwoman of the Sac County GOP .
“ We are spoiled -- and used to being paid attention to . ”
Recently , I found one of my co-workers glued to the Britney - cam live feed on CNN.com .
During the ensuing conversation on the ridiculous nature of stars " nowadays , " I began to recall the ridiculous ( and tragic ) behavior of stars " back in the day " as well .
Here are 10 celebrities and their scandals you may or may not be familiar with .
1. Mabel Normand
Mabel Normand ( 1895 - 1930 ) was one of the most popular comediennes of the silent era .
After embarking on a relationship with legendary director Mack Sennett , Normand worked side - by - side with other notable ( and scandalous ) stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle .
In 1918 , after her relationship with Sennett dissolved , Normand descended into alcoholism and narcotics abuse .
Eventually pulling her life back together , Normand became the last person to see director William Desmond Taylor alive ( see below ) , after Taylor was shot and killed only moments after Normand left his Hollywood home .
The two had been friends and exchanged literature ( yes , literally ) , and although she was never considered a serious suspect , newspaper rumors ran wild about her drug use and connections with Arbuckle .
In 1924 she was involved in another scandal when her chauffeur shot her lover with Normand 's own pistol .
Never far from the headlines , she died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 .
2. Jean Harlow
Jean Harlow ( 1911 - 1937 ) , namesake for Nicole Ritchie 's baby , seems in many ways to be early cinema 's Anna Nicole Smith .
Rising to fame at the end of the silent era as a sex symbol of the 1930s , the " Blonde Bombshell " was plagued with scandal all of her short life .
Her father was a connected mobster , nude photos were taken of her at the age of 17 , and she had a reported abortion of a child fathered by her one - time fiancee William Powell .
However , Harlow 's most recognized scandal involved her second husband Paul Bern , an intellectual luminary of Hollywood over 22 years her senior .
On September 5 , 1932 just months after their wedding , Bern was found shot in the head , sprawled in front of a bedroom mirror and drenched in Jean 's perfume .
A note accompanied his body , which was ruled a suicide , that confirmed rumors Bern suffered from an impotence which he found too embarrassing to live with .
Harlow 's own death a few years later was again tabloid fodder .
Though the official cause of death was from kidney disease that became more aggressive after a string of illnesses , at the time many ( untrue ) myths suggested Harlow 's kidneys were damaged because of beatings from her husband Paul , or that the bleach from her hair had seeped into her brain and killed her .
3. William Desmond Taylor
Director William Desmond Taylor 's ( 1872-1922 ) death became one of the Great Unsolved Mysteries of Hollywood .
Shot in the back in 1922 , rumors circulated that the suspects might include Mack Sennett , Rudolph Valentino , and Mabel Normand among other Hollywood notables .
Taylor was himself an eccentric figure , abandoning his first wife and children in one of his " mental lapses " thought to be aphasia .
During the media frenzy over his murder , many of his friends claimed Taylor had made " delusional " statements , and some feared he might be insane .
The Irish - born director of over 50 films became another unfortunate casualty of the Silent Era , which had so many scandals that many movie studios began requiring their actors and directors sign " morality clauses " to their contracts .
4. Errol Flynn
Errol Flynn ( 1909 - 1959 ) set the gold standard for celebrity debauchery .
A fan of drinking , fighting and fooling around , he was thrice tried on statutory rape charges and was accused of being a Nazi spy ( according to biographer Charles Higham , although subsequent biographies have denounced this particular claim ) .
One of Flynn 's most infamous scandals involved his ( recently deceased ) friend John Barrymore .
Flynn 's posse stole Barrymore 's body from the morgue and propped it up , Weekend at Bernie 's style , inside Flynn 's home so Flynn could be " greeted " by his old friend .
The police did n't find the charade so funny , and neither did the newspapers or public .
Flynn 's mischief did not end with his death - he is said to be buried with six bottles of whiskey as a parting gift from friends .
5. Barbara La Marr
Barbara La Marr's ( 1896 - 1926 ) quote , " life is too short to waste on sleep " ( she reportedly only slept two hours a night ) , seems like it could have been uttered by any number of current Hollywood starlets .
Like her later counterparts , La Marr 's film career flourished along with her love for the nightlife .
However , an addiction to heroin soon took its toll on her as she juggled work schedules and a hyperactive social life .
" The Girl Too Beautiful To Live , " as the newspapers called her , died suddenly of tuberculosis at the age of 29 .
6. Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle
One of the most notorious scandals of the silent era involved Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle ( 1887 -1933 ) , who was accused of the assault and murder of Virginia Rappe at a party in 1921 .
Although later acquitted , the incident ruined Arbuckle 's career and cast a dark shadow on his Hollywood coevals .
Rappe , for her part , was known for her wild behavior and promiscuity , and it is believed that complications from an abortion likely caused her demise .
Caught in the wrong place at the wrong time , Arbuckle was accused of misdeed by Maude Delmont ( who did not witness any of the alleged crime , despite her reports ) , known to be involved in extortion , fraud and racketeering .
Despite a written apology from the courts for their mismanagement of the case , Arbuckle 's career was over .
Falling into alcoholism , the formerly beloved actor died at age 46 .
7. Charlie Chaplin
A close friend of Fatty Arbuckle 's ( he borrowed Arbuckle 's pants to create his most famous character , " The Tramp " ) , Charlie Chaplin ( 1889 - 1977 ) always lived on the edge of scandal .
Eventually forced to leave the country because of alleged Communist sympathies and troubles with the IRS , most of Chaplin 's infamy revolved around his relationships with younger girls , many of whom he mentored and went on to marry or embark on relationships with .
One biographer even claims Nabokov 's " Lolita " was inspired by Chaplin .
Additionally , Chaplin was involved with one of Hollywood 's greatest mysteries , the death of producer Thomas Ince ( the " Father of the Western " ) aboard the yacht of William Randolph Hearst in 1924 , possibly caused by an argument Chaplin was having with Ince over the actress Marion Davies ...
8. Thelma Todd
Thelma Todd ( 1905 - 1935 ) rose to fame as a comedic actress alongside the Marx Brothers , Laurel & Hardey , and Buster Keaton .
Unfortunately , the " Ice Cream Blonde " died from carbon monoxide poisoning in her car at the age of 30 , although the supposed " suicide " was not so clear - cut .
With blood at the scene , a high blood - alcohol content , and clean shoes ( while the area outside the car was muddy ) , many believed it to be murder .
While the theory was largely ignored by the LAPD , suspects ranged from Todd 's highly possessive boyfriend , director Roland West ( who was thought to have locked Todd in the garage to keep her from going to a party ) to the gangster " Lucky " Luciano , who wanted to involve Todd 's club in illegal gambling against her wishes .
Roland
West was said to have later confessed the murder to a friend , but his only punishment was a closing of ranks by Hollywood 's elite so he never worked in motion pictures again .
9 -10 . Jack Pickford & Olive Thomas
Jack Pickford ( 1896 - 1933 ) came from a famous family of silent stars that included his sisters , Mary and Lottie .
He worked in bit roles throughout the era , but was most well known for his tabloid romances ( and three marriages , to be exact ) .
The first one resulted in the death of his spouse Olive Thomas ( 1894 - 1920 ) , a former Ziegfeld girl who had become a movie star .
Though their romance was rocky , the two had hoped to repair their relationship with a second honeymoon to Paris .
While there , it is rumored that Thomas took cocaine , and later , intoxicated and fatigued , accidentally ingested a large dose of mercury bichloride , which belonged to her husband to treat his syphilis .
Accounts vary as to the confusion , but unfortunately the dose was lethal .
Rumors circulated about her suicide or murder , but whatever the truth , Olive Thomas was yet another Hollywood starlet who succumbed to deep misfortune .

Michael Ignatieff says federal Liberals will support legislation to implement a harmonized sales tax in Ontario and British Columbia , despite previously bashing it as a job - killing " Harper sales tax . "
The Liberal leader announced his decision Tuesday after meeting his MPs , many of whom felt trapped in no -win situation and were torn over what to do .
Some MPs fear a backlash from voters in the two provinces , who are becoming increasingly angry about the prospect of paying more for a host of goods and services .
Others fear alienating the Liberal governments in Toronto and Victoria , whose campaign machines will be vital to the success of federal Liberals in the next election .
In the end , Ignatieff came down on the side of respecting the wishes of provincial governments , not to mention longstanding federal Liberal policy .
" This is a request from the provinces because they believe it'll improve the competitiveness of their economy and create jobs , " Ignatieff said , noting that federal Liberals have promoted harmonization for 15 years .
" We will support this legislation in Parliament . "
Just last summer , during a tour of B.C. , Ignatieff criticized Prime Minister Stephen Harper for pushing provinces in the midst of a recession to adopt what he derisively referred to as the " Harper sales tax . "
In September , he demanded a clarification after Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said Ignatieff had promised he'd abide by a federal agreement to ease the transition to the HST with $ 4.3 billion for Ontario and $ 1.6 billion for B.C .
After a week of confusion , Ignatieff grudgingly acknowledged that he would , in fact , honour that agreement should he become prime minister .
By Tuesday , that acknowledgment had become a point of principle which Ignatieff maintained demonstrates the difference between him and Harper , whom he slammed for tearing up federal - provincial agreements on child care and aboriginals upon taking office .
" We 're practising a federalism of respect .
Mr. Harper . . . practised a federalism of disrespect and division and I do n't think that 's any way to run a federation . "
Ignatieff also slammed Harper , who 'll be in China when the HST implementation legislation is introduced , for trying to distance himself from the unpopular tax and " pretend he has nothing to do with it . "
" This was initiated by Mr. Harper and leadership means taking responsibility for your decisions .
I 've done so today .
I wonder why he has not . "
The Bloc Quebecois is also likely to support the legislation , leaving only the NDP to vote against it .
NDP Leader Jack Layton is hoping to parlay consumer anger over the tax into votes for his party .
" The Liberals have decided to turn their backs on the hardworking families who are going to have to pay now billions of dollars in more taxes , " Layton said Tuesday , vowing to use every procedural tool available to stop the legislation .
Ignatieff said the vote on the HST implementing legislation will be " whipped , " meaning all Liberal MPs will be expected to support it .
That may yet prove difficult for some .
Victoria MP Keith Martin continued Tuesday to crusade against the HST in his province , predicting it will kill jobs , hurt people of modest means , and cramp the economy .
He dismissed his leader 's argument that federal politicians should respect the wishes of provincial governments .
" We simply are not there to be lackeys , to just move ahead and nod our heads and say yes , " Martin said .
" Our role and responsibility is to defend the interests of the people in our province . "
Toronto MP Judy Sgro acknowledged that federal Liberals are worried they 'll be blamed for the HST by Ontario voters , who 'll likely cast ballots federally before they vote in a provincial election .
She said history shows voters take out their anger on the first politicians to show up at the door .
" Clearly , this is a difficult issue , " she said .
In essence , we believe the ads mislead consumers into believing that AT&T does n't offer ANY wireless service in the vast majority of the country .
In fact , AT&T 's wireless network blankets the US , reaching approximately 296M people .
Additionally , our 3G service is available in over 9,600 cities and towns .
Verizon 's misleading advertising tactics appear to be a response to AT&T 's strong leadership in smartphones .
We have twice the number of smartphone customers ... and we 've beaten them two quarters in a row on net post - paid subscribers .
We also had lower churn -- a sign that customers are quite happy with the service they receive .
Whoa -- we just got word that AT&T is suing Verizon for false advertising over Big Red 's " There 's a map for that " ads .
We 're reading the complaint and motion to stop the ads right now , but here 's what AT&T says is the big problem : AT&T also says its network reaches about the same number of people as Verizon 's , so we 're thinking it 's a little miffed that it 's being portrayed as an also - ran here .
We 'll update as we learn more , keep it locked !
So this seems like a very narrow lawsuit , actually .
As we 've been told , AT&T thinks Verizon is trying to fool viewers into thinking that they can't use any AT&T phone services outside of 3G coverage areas by showing two essentially different maps .
Since Verizon 's entire network is 3G , the gaps in the red map are actual service gaps -- but Verizon does n't show that the gaps on the AT&T map might be covered by AT&T's huge 2G network .
We can see how that could be misleading , but at some point you 've got to compare apples to apples , and AT&T even says it has " no quarrel with Verizon advertising its larger 3G network " in its complaint , so we 'll see how the court reacts .
Interestingly , Verizon 's already changed the ads once at AT&T 's behest , editing them to remove the phrase " out of touch " and adding a " Voice and data services available outside of 3G areas " small print disclaimer at the end .
Apparently that was n't enough for AT&T , which says the ads still confuse non-technical viewers into thinking AT&T provides no service at all outside of its 3G coverage .
Okay , we 've read everything -- there 's really not much more to this suit than the arguments over the maps .
We 're thinking Verizon could have easily dealt with this by just using dark blue and light blue on the AT&T map to differentiate between 3G and 2G coverage , but at this point we do n't think Ma Bell is all that interested in anything except getting these ads off the air .
All that said , it 's hard to deny that Verizon 's ads made a perfectly valid point : using an iPhone on AT&T 's network in New York or San Francisco is an exercise in frustration , regardless of whether you have 2G or 3G , and we 've had zero problems on Verizon .
Let 's just hope AT&T is working as hard to fight these ads with its actual service as it is with its lawyers .
He grew up in the city and he will tell you he went to school with some of the judges he appears before .
After all these years , he knows what works for them , and what falls short .
That understanding , coupled with his long experience in the law , has yielded positive outcomes for thousands of clients over the years .
Wearing a beard or staying clean shaven is a man ’s prerogative .
But a new campaign by Gillette is making some men feel this “ fundamental ” right is being violated .
Thousands of men have ganged up against the latest Gillette campaign — Shave India Movement , Women against Lazy Stubble — terming it mental harassment .
Some of them have lodged a protest with the Advertising Standards Council of India ( ASCI ) .
They have also called for a boycott of all Gillette products to " discourage " companies from creating campaigns that " spread hatred among genders " and " hurt religious sentiments . "
" In the Gillette campaign , men who do not shave or those who wear stubble are shown to be lazy , so their women have every right to detest and demean them , " said Mumbai - based PR Gokul of the All India Men ’s Welfare Association ( AIMWA ) .
" Gillette also tags this campaign as women on the warpath .
We feel it portrays men negatively and tries to curb their choices " said Mumbai - based PR Gokul of the All India Men ’s Welfare Association .
Proctor and Gamble ( P&G ) claimed that the campaign was based on research findings .
" Serving men since 1895 , their well - being is at the heart of every decision that Gillette takes .
In that spirit we respect all ideologies , communities and opinions that men have .
WALS is a creative expression of research findings by AC Nielsen which state that a majority of women prefer their with a men clean shaven look .
Our campaign is not an imposition of such views on men who feel differently or wish to grow facial hair out of choice .
Our endeavour is to provide superior quality shaving products to men who wish to shave , " said P&G spokesperson .
Men disagree .
" The thoughts expressed in the campaign do not represent the views of the average Indian woman .
It has a commercial interest and there is every reason to believe the views are bought off .
The campaign ignores researches that prove it ’s men with the stubble who attract women , " said Virag Dhulia , a protestor from Bangalore .
“ By calling men with stubble lazy , P&G have made a communal statement , ” said Myth Kumar from Bangalore .
Terming the campaign in bad taste , the Shahi Imam of Delhi ’s Jama Masjid said , " Sikhs and Muslims wear beards due to religious reasons .
But their wives do not complain .
Companies should be careful of religious sentiments before running campaigns , " said Bukhari .
" Stubble certainly looks sexy .
But the reason why some men do not keep one is that it is itchy and the corporate world prefers the clean - shaven look , " said Amrish from Mumbai .
Merry Christmas !
Now that the day is almost over and everyone is winding down - families have gone home , presents have been opened and played with ( or in my case , consumed ) - it ’s time to sit back and enjoy the Christmas beer to end all Christmas beers .
The History
Samichlaus Helles ( as well as the original ) was originally brewed by the now - extinct Swiss Hürlimann Brewery .
The eponymous Albert Hürlimann was a pioneer in the study and development of yeast .
After 20 or so years of experimentation , Hürlimann was able to cultivate yeast hardy enough to produce a monstrous beer without being killed off by the alcohol .
Unfortunately , the Hürlimann Brewery ceased production in 1997 .
Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg , out of Vorchdorf , Austria picked up the ball in 2000 and has been running with it ever since .
The Eggenberg Castle - where the brewery is located - dates back to the 9th century C.E. , and has been producing beer in some capacity since at least 1400 .
[ I love reviewing these European beers , so much history ! ]
The current commercial operation began in 1861 .
Aside from taking over responsibility for the World ’s Strongest Lager , Schloss Eggenberg brews a handful of other old - world - class beers .
If the brewery (s ) history is n’t enough for you , the beer itself has quite the interesting story .
Introduced in 1979 at 14 % + alcohol - by - volume , Samichlaus was the strongest beer in the world until the late - 90 ’s advent of US craft “ extreme ” brewing .
It is still the strongest lager .
Helles , a lighter version of the original Samichlaus , was last produced by Hürlimann in 1986 , and sat dormant until 2007 , when Eggenberg bottled it once more .
Both are brewed once a year - on December 6th - and lagered for 10 months before bottling , making them a rare and coveted find .
Why December 6th ?
Well , it ’s the Feast of St. Nicholas , basically the original Christmas .
The bottle in front of me tonight is from the new - first - time 2007 batch ( brewed December 6 , 2006 ) .
With 10 months in the barrel , and 2 more years in the bottle , this should be quite the experience …
The Style
Samichlaus Helles is technically a Doppelbock , a stronger version of the German Bock .
I say ‘ technically ’ , because as far as doppelbock ’s go , Samichlaus is far and away the strongest .
If Sam Adams had n’t already stolen the name , this could just as easily be dubbed a Tripelbock .
Bocks are lagers by definition , but generally much darker and stronger than their far more popular pale brethren .
This is a result of a bigger malt content and a longer period of cold - storage ( ” lagering ” ) .
The original ‘ meal in a glass ’ , doppelbocks are full - bodied , dark , higher in alcohol , and usually on the sweet side .
The Tasting
Pours a crisp clear caramel .
There ’s barely any head , though the beer is quite fizzy .
Malty and raisiny on the nose , sweet syrup aroma .
Taste is candi sweet .
As much raisin on the tongue as in the nose .
Other dried fruits as well , dates and apricot .
Some burnt molasses .
Oak notes , as well as a vanilla complexity as it unfolds .
Very , very low hop character .
Almost non-existant , but it does make itself known as a slight pepper at the back of the throat .
Alcohol is finely hidden .
appearing just briefly as a warmth in the finish .
And finally theres a bit of an oaky / grassy whiskey aftertaste .
Overall the flavor feels somewhere between brandy & barleywine .
Full - bodied , but lighter than you ’d expect from a beer of this strength .
Far from syrupy , but far from ‘ clean ’ .
It ’s a bit more drinkable than it probably should be , considering its strength .
The Verdict
Having sat on this bottle for close to a full year , I certainly had my expectations .
Happily , they were more than met .
Helles is as much an experience as a beer , one that takes a good part of the evening to really appreciate ( and not just because of its alcohol content ) .
It ’s not an easy find , but well worth the effort .
Certainly a fantastic end to a great holiday .
And now I can join the Facebook group .
9.5/10
Incedentally , I picked up a bottle of the original version a few days ago .
Look for a review of that on Christmas Day 2010 ( provided I ’m still maintaining this website ) .

Sharyl Attkisson is a CBS News correspondent and investigative reporter .
She ’s covered Capitol Hill since February 2006 and has been a Washington - based correspondent there since January 1995 .
She was also part of the CBS news team that received the Edward Murrow Award in 2005 for overall excellence .
Additionally , she received an Outstanding Investigative Journalism Emmy in 2002 for a series on the Red Cross .
In case you did n’t realize it , Sharyl Attkisson is the investigative reporter behind the groundbreaking CBS News study that found H1N1 flu cases are NOT as prevalent as feared .
In fact , they ’re barely on the radar screen .
How did this startling information come about , and why is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) painting a different picture entirely ?
I spoke directly with Sharyl Attkisson to find out .
Two Videos
The first video is an amazing interview I did with Sharyl about ten days ago and what the bulk of this article is based on .
The second video is brand new and was done at noon yesterday in which I was videoed in the CBS studio in downtown Chicago .
Sharyl was gracious enough to invite me to be on with Dr. Bernadine Healy , the former director of the NIH .
We both were in agreement about the swine flu and opposed to the stance the CDC is taking , but we had different views on mammograms .
Please also watch the second interview as it is very entertaining .
Getting Started on the Swine Flu Trail
Ms. Attkisson says : “ The reason I looked into this is a couple of months ago , I got tips from three or four different segments of public healthcare , with folks telling me the CDC has recommended that they go ahead and stop testing for and counting swine flu cases .
Each different entity that contacted me was concerned , thinking that this should not be happening .
They really felt that it was necessary for the swine flu to continue to be tracked in some details .
So I went about trying to find out why this decision was made and what the ramifications would be .
… I started by contacting the CDC and the HHS and asking some basic questions .
I felt like I pretty much got stonewalled with some of the information I really needed to get at , especially what I needed from the states data , and information on the rationale behind this decision to stop counting and testing for swine flu . ”
Because the CDC did not initially respond to Attkisson ’s requests , she contacted all 50 states directly , asking for their statistics on state lab - confirmed H1N1 prior to the halt of individual testing and counting in July .
She also asked states , one by one , to help explain the rationale behind the CDC ’s decision to stop tracking H1N1 cases .
Attkisson continues : “ One of my good sources within the government said to me that they ’re either trying to , in his opinion , over - represent the swine flu numbers or under - represent by not counting them anymore .
He said , “ You need to find out which it is . ”
And so to find out which it might be , I really wanted to see the data that the CDC had at the time it made the decision to quit counting the cases . ”
What Her Investigative Report Reveals
If you listen to most media outlets and even to government agencies , you get the impression that virtually every person who has visited their physician with flu - like symptoms in recent months has H1N1 , with no testing necessary because , after all , there ’s an epidemic .
[ efoods ]
We are all being led to believe that every case diagnosed as “ swine flu ” or even as “ flu - like illness ” is , in fact , swine flu .
But Attkisson ’s investigation revealed a very different picture right from her first contact with individual states .
She explains : “ Across the country , state by state , they were testing [ for H1N1 ] until CDC told them not to bother .
They were testing , in general , the cases most likely to be believed to have been swine flu based on a doctor ’s diagnosis of symptoms and risk factors such as travel to Mexico .
These special cases were going to state labs for absolute confirmation with the best test — not the so - called “ rapid testing , ” but the real confirmation test .
Of those presumed likely swine flu cases out of approximately every hundred of what was tested , only a small fraction were actually swine flu .
In every instance , perhaps the biggest number of cases that were swine flu was something like 30 % .
The smallest number was something like 2 % or 3 % .
Maybe there ’s one state where it was just 1 % .
The point is , of the vast majority of the presumed swine flu cases recognized by trained physicians , the vast majority were not flu at all .
They were n’t swine flu or regular flu ; they were some other sort of upper respiratory infection . ”
And here is the clincher that it seems the CDC just does n’t want the American public to know …
“ The CDC explained that one of the reasons they quit counting was because of all the flu that ’s out there , most are swine flu .
Well , that ’s true .
Most of the flu that was out there was indeed swine flu , but they failed to say that most of the suspected flu was nothing at all .
And I think that ’s the caveat the public just did n’t know , ” Attkisson explains .
She gives even more striking examples of the numbers the investigative report revealed .
For instance :
In Florida , 83 percent of specimens that were presumed to be swine flu were negative for all flu when tested !
In California , 86 percent of suspected H1N1 specimens were not swine flu or any flu ; only 2 percent were confirmed swine flu .
In Alaska , 93 percent of suspected swine flu specimens were negative for all flu types ; only 1 percent was H1N1 flu .
Freedom of Information and Getting the Truth Out
It is not easy for journalists to access this type of information , and they often have to wait weeks , months or even years for information from the CDC and the FDA — information that is readily available and supposed to be clearly public .
Attkisson expands on the difficulties she faced in trying to get simple data regarding swine flu cases in the United States : “ They [ CDC ’s public affairs ] quit communicating with me when I pressed on why I could n’t get certain information .
They just would n’t answer my emails anymore .
So I had to file a Freedom of Information request , which is usually my last choice because I know I was going into a deep black hole many times and I ’ll never get an answer .
But in this case , I got an interesting response on October 19 from the CDC when I had asked for some simple , public documents that would have been easy for them to obtain too quickly .
Journalists are allowed to ask for expedited processing of their Freedom of Information request because , for obvious reasons , they ’re working on a story that may have public impact or be of public interest .
The agencies are not supposed to use the Freedom of Information Law to obstruct or delay the release of this information .
This may be the first time I was denied that expedited processing from Freedom of Information that we ’re entitled to as members of the press ; a letter from HHS or Health and Human Services ( the CDC is under HHS ) said to me that one of the reasons they ’re denying my expedited processing is because this is not a matter of “ widespread and exceptional media or public interest . ”
In other words , the CDC does n’t think these questions about swine flu prevalence and these other things that we ’ve been asking are , at least in their opinion in this letter , not a matter of widespread and exceptional media or public interest . ”
Yet , while the CDC expressed that questions about swine flu prevalence were not a matter of widespread media or public interest , the President had declared the swine flu a national public health emergency !
The inconsistencies at the CDC are nearly incomprehensible .
The Ramifications of the Swine Flu Policy
According to Attkisson ’s CBS
News study , when you come down with chills , fever , cough , runny nose , malaise and all those other “ flu - like ” symptoms , the illness is likely caused by influenza at most 17 percent of the time and as little as 3 percent !
The other 83 to 97 percent of the time it ’s caused by other viruses or bacteria .
So remember that not every illness that appears to be the flu actually is the flu .
In fact , most of the time it ’s not .
Curiously , the CDC still advises those who were told they had 2009 H1N1 ( and therefore should be immune to getting it again ) to get vaccinated unless they had lab confirmation .
But because very few people have actually had a lab - confirmed case of H1N1 ( and in most cases those people told they had swine flu probably did not ) , this means nearly everyone is still being advised to get the swine flu vaccine .
Attkisson has been one of the few to speak out against this flawed system and point out the serious ramifications that come when a public health agency is secretive about their health data .
Attkisson says : “ From a public and journalistic standpoint , I believe the mistake comes when you do n’t fully disclose to the public as you go and discover the mistakes .
Try to disclose and fix things that come up .
Everybody understands that there is n’t a perfect system , but I think you need to be upfront with them , explain what you ’re doing , and explain what you ’re discovering .
If you ’ve made a mistake or you feel like you need to correct something , say that , too , but do n’t just try to keep information from the public . ”
I could n’t agree more , and Attkisson ’s CBS News report has stood out like a bright light of truth among all the clouds of misinformation .

Now here ’s a story that really is outrageous , as the TSA subpoenas and confiscates the computers of two bloggers who posted their new screening directive — even though the document was not classified .
Two bloggers received home visits from Transportation Security Administration agents Tuesday after they published a new TSA directive that revises screening procedures and puts new restrictions on passengers in the wake of a recent bombing attempt by the so - called underwear bomber .
Special agents from the TSA ’s Office of Inspection interrogated two U.S. bloggers , one of them an established travel columnist , and served them each with a civil subpoena demanding information on the anonymous source that provided the TSA document .
The document , which the two bloggers published within minutes of each other Dec. 27 , was sent by TSA to airlines and airports around the world and described temporary new requirements for screening passengers through Dec. 30 , including conducting “ pat - downs ” of legs and torsos .
The document , which was not classified , was posted by numerous bloggers .
Information from it was also published on some airline websites .
“ They ’re saying it ’s a security document but it was sent to every airport and airline , ” says Steven Frischling , one of the bloggers .
“ It was sent to Islamabad , to Riyadh and to Nigeria .
So they ’re looking for information about a security document sent to 10,000 - plus people internationally .
You ca n’t have a right to expect privacy after that . ”
Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Suzanne Trevino said in a statement that security directives “ are not for public disclosure . ”
“ TSA ’s Office of Inspections is currently investigating how the recent Security Directives were acquired and published by parties who should not have been privy to this information , ” the statement said .
Frischling , a freelance travel writer and photographer in Connecticut who writes a blog for the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , said the two agents who visited him arrived around 7 p.m.
Tuesday , were armed and threatened him with a criminal search warrant if he did n’t provide the name of his source .
They also threatened to get him fired from his KLM job and indicated they could get him designated a security risk , which would make it difficult for him to travel and do his job .
“ They were indicating there would be significant ramifications if I did n’t cooperate , ” said Frischling , who was home alone with his three children when the agents arrived .
“ It ’s not hard to intimidate someone when they ’re holding a 3 - year - old [ child ] in their hands .

I go to jail , and my kids are here with nobody . ”

EARLIER closing times , bans on selling shots and lockouts imposed on 14 Newcastle pubs have slashed the number of assaults by 31 per cent and could see similar restrictions extended across the state .
The first study into the effects of the restrictions imposed by the former Liquor Administration Board in March last year found at least 133 fewer assaults in an area that had the highest rates of assault in the state .
The director of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research , Don Weatherburn , was '' stunned ' ' by results of the bureau 's study which showed the restrictions were having a bigger effect on assault rates than any measure he 'd seen .
'' I 've been watching successive governments trying to deal with the assault problem in NSW since 1988 and nothing has ever had any effect , '' he said .
'' This is a substantial reduction and if it continues it will pull the state assault rate down and that will be the first time in over 20 years that 's happened . ''
Start with satellite imagery
This type of imagery data — past , present and future — is available all over the globe .
Even so , while today you candeforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way toit .
With this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration of a forest .
In developing this prototype , we 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon .
Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery .
Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change .
However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and computational resources for processing .
What if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high - performance satellite imagery - processing engine running online , in the “ Google cloud ” ?
And what if we could gather together all of the earth ’s raw satellite imagery data — petabytes of historical , present and future data — and make it easily available on this platform ?
We decided to find out , by working with Greg and Carlos to re-implement their software online , on top of a prototype platform we 've built that gives them easy access to terabytes of satellite imagery and thousands of computers in our data centers .
Here are the results of running CLASlite on the satellite imagery sequence shown above :
SAD online :
The red " hotspots " indicate deforestation that has happened within the last 30 days
Unprecedented speed :
On a top - of - the - line desktop computer , it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon .
Using our cloud - based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds .
Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening .

Ease of use and lower costs :
An online platform that offers easy access to data , scientific algorithms and computation horsepower from any web browser can dramatically lower the cost and complexity for tropical nations to monitor their forests .

Climate change impact :
We think that a suitably scaled - up and enhanced version of this platform could be a promising as a tool for forest monitoring , reporting and verification ( MRV ) in support of efforts such as REDD .
Combining science with massive data and technology resources in this way offers the following advantages :
As a Google.org product , this technology will be provided to the world as a not - for - profit service .
This technology prototype is currently available to a small set of partners for testing purposes — it 's not yet available to the general public but we expect to make it more broadly available over the next year .
We are grateful to a host of individuals and organizations ( find full list here ) who have advised us on developing this technology .
In particular , we would like to thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for their close partnership since the initial inception of this project .
The goal of the Moore Foundation ’s Environmental Conservation Program is to change the ways in which people use important terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems to conserve critical ecological systems and functions , while allowing sustainable use .
We 're also working with the Group on Earth Observations ( GEO ) , a consortium of national government bodies , inter - governmental organizations , space agencies and research institutions through GEO 's Forest Carbon Tracking ( FCT ) task force .
Last month together we launched the GEO FCT portal and are now exploring how we can also together bring the power of this new technology to tropical nations .
We 're excited to be able to share this early prototype and look forward to seeing what 's possible . : Additional information on the Moore Foundation has been added to the post .
Fewer than 1,800 Indochinese tigers are thought to be living in the wild
A Chinese man has been jailed for 12 years for killing and eating a rare Indochinese tiger .
Kang Wannian , a villager from the southern province of Yunnan , said he had encountered the tiger while out fishing , and killed it in self - defence .
The animal may have been China 's only wild Indochinese tiger , which is on the brink of extinction .
Four other men were jailed for sharing the tiger meal and covering up the incident .
Endangered species
Kang was confronted by the tiger in February while gathering freshwater clams in a nature reserve near China 's border with Laos .
He said he shot the animal after dark and claimed that , at the time , he did not know it was an endangered Indochinese tiger .
According to local media , Kang was sentenced to 10 years for killing a rare animal plus two years for illegal possession of firearms .
The court in Xishuangbanna , Yunnan province , also ordered him to pay a fine of 480,000 yuan ( $ 70,000 ; £ 44,000 ) .
Fewer than 1,800 Indochinese tigers are thought to be living in the wild , in the forests of Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand and Burma .
The only known wild Indochinese tiger in China was photographed in 2007 at the same reserve that Kang visited .
The tiger has not been seen since Kang 's meal , and there is speculation that Kang could have eaten the last one .
I really , really do .
Because a huge part of feminism , for me , is about being trusted to weigh available information , to consider the facts , and to come up with your own opinion .
To be able to decide , for yourself , what is right and wrong .
In fact , to reject the idea that people can tell you what to do and how to do it .
Which is why prescriptive feminism is incredibly frustrating for me ; it ’s people using the master ’s tools to take down the master ’s house .
As soon as someone makes a blanket statement like “ doing X is not a feminist act ” or “ anyone who does Y is not really a feminist , ” I turn off .
Because the thing about judgments and blanket statements is that they do not consider context , nuance , and the human factor .
So what I hear when people say things like that is “ there ’s only one way to do feminism , and it ’s this way , and everyone who disagrees is obviously not feminist . ”
Prescriptive feminism is “ my way or the highway , ” it ’s crude , it ’s brutal , it has no respect for context , and it ’s offensive as all getout .
Prescriptivists like to throw the “ feminism is about choice ” argument back in our faces by saying “ choices do n’t occur in a vacuum . ”
And , you know what ?
They are absolutely right .
Choices occur in a complex social , cultural , and political context .
They do n’t occur in a vacuum of black and white , right or wrong , good or bad .
Which is , oddly enough , what prescriptivists seem to think .
They ’re created their own vacuum .
Everyone inside it is a feminist , everyone outside it is n’t .
I was thinking about this recently because of yet another blowup about wearing heels .
So , here ’s the thing .
Heels are viewed , rightly so , as symbols of oppression .
Heels , one might say , are problematic in a social and cultural context .
When a lawyer wears heels to court because she knows that she will not be taken seriously or respected if she wears flats , that ’s not a feminist act .
That ’s a capitulation to a system which says that lady lawyers who wear flats are less likely to have cases decided in their favour .
And it sucks that lady lawyers who would prefer to wear flats must have their values compromised by the system , must decide between “ comfortable ” and “ winning the case . ”
But , for me , wearing heels is a feminist act .
And here ’s why : Heels are more comfortable for me to wear than flats .
They are more comfortable , they feel better with my body , they provide my feet with the support they need .
If the “ feminist act ” is supposed to be about wearing shoes which fit you , which feel practical and comfortable , ignoring public opinion , than , for me , wearing heels is feminist .
Not in every setting , of course ; when I ’m traipsing in the woods , I do n’t wear heels , because they are not practical .
But I get seething mad when I hear people judging me for my choice of footwear .
It ’s a blanket judgment which says “ all experiences are the same , and flats are more comfortable for me , therefore everyone who is wearing heels is bowing to the patriarchy . ”
Uhm , no .
I wear heels because they are comfortable , for me , because they are practical .
I do n’t really care if anyone notices , I am definitely not wearing them to impress some man .
And I am definitely not impressed by people who claim that I am lying when I say that heels are more comfortable , to justify giving in to the patriarchy .
Yes , that ’s a good way to approach feminism , let ’s tell women who experience things differently that they are lying about their own experiences and feelings .
I wear heels to the grocery store for the same reason that lots of women like to wear tennis shoes to the grocery store :
Because they are comfortable .
I am aware that other people may read my action differently , and that ’s fine , but I am not going to wear flats and hurt my feet just to be a “ good feminist , ” because that ’s pretty darn antifeminist , if you ask me , letting someone else ’s judgment about your motivations influence what you do .
I am , in fact , choosing to wear heels because they are the right choice for me .
I ’m not forcing that choice on anyone else .
I ’m not forcing my experience on anyone else .
I ’m acting as an individual , and I am allowed to do that .
I feel like a lot of prescriptivists are very bound up in image policing ( which inevitably leads me to ask “ do n’t you have something more important to do ? ” ) .
“ Shaving is an antifeminist act . ”
What if you ’re a feminist competitive swimmer ?
Should you not shave so that you can be a good feminist , and give up an edge to the competition ?
What if you ’re a feminist actress in a period drama , wearing tights ?
Should you not shave to be a good feminist , even though it ’s going to make your tights look really weird ?
“ Wearing makeup is an antifeminist act . ”
So , again , if you ’re an actress , you should go on stage bare , even though it will look out of place ?
If you prefer to cover a birthmark with makeup rather than attracting attention , you ’re committing an antifeminist act ?
Everything happens in context .
This means that you ca n’t judge someone for doing something until you know the nuances of the situation .
Maybe for you , personally , who you are , wearing heels is not a feminist act .
But do n’t tell me I can’t wear heels .
Do n’t tell me that wearing skirts is antifeminist when it ’s extremely hot and I ’m wearing a knee length skirt because the thought of being swathed in trousers makes me feel faint .
Do n’t tell Dara Torres or Natalie Coughlin they should n’t shave their legs .
Do n’t tell feminist actresses not to wear makeup .
Do n’t tell women they should n’t change their names at marriage when you have no idea about the context .
Yeah , choices do n’t occur in a vacuum .
That means that there are a lot of things that are socially and culturally complicated .
Which means that it ’s not as simple as “ doing this is feminist ” or “ doing that is not feminist . ”
Especially once you throw other cultures into the mix .
You there , white person , do you really want to tell a woman of colour that something she ’s doing , something which is a part of her culture , is not feminist ?
You there , American , are you really sure that you know everything about the world and that you are therefor entitled to judge women from somewhere else ?
Being a prescriptivist involves making a lot of assumptions .
And you know what they say about assumptions .
So we set up a call with Randall this morning to discuss some of the profoundly stupid things his guy Ralph de la Vega said recently about creating incentives that would encourage people to stop using AT&T ’s data network so much .
Point of the talk was , when you ’re lucky enough to create a smash hit product — when the stars align , and the hardware is great and the ecosystem is great and the apps are great and the whole experience is great , and everything you do just makes everything else better , and you ’re totally on a roll and can do no wrong — when that happens , you do not go out and try to fuck it all up by discouraging people who love your product .
What you do , instead , is you fix your fucking shitty ass network you fucking shit - eating - grin - wearing hillbilly ass clown !
First off , before we even start the call , we ’ve got problems , because shithead wo n’t get on the phone unless I ’m on the line first .
Like , Ja’Red comes in and says we ’re ready to go , and I go , You mean Randall is on the line , and Ja’Red says , No , his assistant is on the line and once you get on then they ’re going to get Randall — so I reach down , hit the button then hit it again so the call gets terminated .
I tell Ja’Red to explain to these motherfuckers that Steve Jobs does not get on the line first , ever .
Ja’Red does this , but Randall ’s assistant insists Randall always gets on last , and especially so in this case since AT&T is about three times the size of Apple , so this time I pick up the phone and tell the assistant that he should inform Randall that when he ’s ready to get his pointy head out of his ass and call me , I ’ll be here waiting for his call .
So fine .
We wait a bit , and he calls .
He does n’t say anything about the standoff , but I can tell he ’s pissed , which is fine by me .
He launches into a mumbling spiel about how Ralph de la Vega did n’t really say what all the papers are saying he said , and he was misquoted , and it was taken out of context , but I ’m like , Bitch , please , guys at our level do n’t get taken out of context , we write the shit out in advance and we know exactly what we ’re saying when we say it and every goddamn word has been vetted and gone over by a team of flacks .
So please do n’t sit there like a zoo monkey throwing your own feces at me through the bars of your cage , bokay ?
Then I go , Look , Randall , you ’re how old — about 50 ?
He says he ’s 49 .
I go , Okay , so you were born in 1960 , so maybe you do n’t remember Meet the Beatles .
Or do you ?
Do you remember that album ?
Did they have record players out there in Arkansas ?
He goes , I ’m from Oklahoma , and I ’m like , Yeah , same thing , so anyway did you know that album ?
Were you aware of it ?
Came out in the beginning of 1964 .
The one with the four guys in black and white , half their faces white , half in shadow ?
Just four faces against a black backdrop ?
He says he ’s familiar with the album but he thought we were getting on the phone to talk about incentivizing heavy users in order to optimize the network resources blah blah and I ’m like , Dude , if you ever use the word incentivize around me again I swear I will get in my Gulfstream and fly to wherever you are and I will smash you in the face with a rock .
He sighs and says , Okay .
I ’m like , I ’m sorry , what did you say ?
He says , Okay .
I go , I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t hear you .
What did you say ?
He goes , YES !
and I go , That ’s better .
But back to the Beatles .
Now , the thing about that album was , on the day it hit the U.S. the whole world changed .
Like , before that day , the world was one way , music was one way , culture was one way — and then after that day the world was never the same ever again , and as soon as you heard that album you knew that , and even if you were only nine years old , which I was , you just knew .
You knew .
Sales were crazy .
I mean nuts .
The thing was a huge smash hit .
By April , twelve weeks after that album came out , the Beatles had the top five spots on the Billboard chart .
Now there was a lot of demand for that record — so much that the plant that printed the records could not keep up .
Now here ’s the lesson .
Do you think the guys who were running Capitol Records said , Gee whiz , the kids are buying up this record at such a crazy pace that our printing plant can’t keep up — we ’d better find a way to slow things down .
Maybe we can create an incentive that would discourage people from buying the record .
Do you think they said that ?
No , they did not .
What they did was , they went out and found another printing plant .
And another one and another one , until they could make as many records as people wanted .
Randall is like , Okay , I get your point .
I ’m like , You know what , I do n’t think you do , because if you did , we would n’t be sitting here having this conversation , would we ?
I mean if you did understand how to do things , your guys would n’t be standing up at Wall Street conferences and complaining about how much traffic you ’re getting .
Instead , you would be running around like a fucking maniac trying to build out your fucking network and make it the best network in the world — and the only reason you would ever need to talk to me would be to thank me for creating a phone that ’s so amazing that it draws people to your shit network in the first place .
Randall , baby .
we ’ve got a hit on our hands .
We ’ve got the smartphone equivalent of Meet the Beatles .
It ’s not like that album was the first rock album ever .
It ’s not like nobody ever made a band with some guitars and drums before .
But it was radical .
It was new .
They took old forms and made them new .
Same with us .
We did n’t invent the smartphone or the PDA or the music player or the Web browser .
We just made them better .
We made them new .
We changed the fucking world , Randall .
And when I say that “ we ” have a hit on our hands , I ’m really giving you way too much credit , because let ’s be honest , the success of iPhone has nothing to do with you .
In fact , iPhone is a smash hit in spite of your network , not because of it .
That ’s how good we are here at Apple — we ’re so good that even you and your team of Bell System frigtards ca n’t stop us .
You know what it ’s like being your business partner ?
It ’s like trying to swim the English Channel with a boat anchor tied to my legs .
And yes , in case you ’re not following me , in that analogy , you , my friend , are the fucking boat anchor .
So let ’s talk traffic .
We ’ve got people who love this goddamn phone so much that they ’re living on it .
Yes , that ’s crushing your network .
Yes , 3 % of your users are taking up 40 % of your bandwidth .
You see this as a bad thing .
It ’s not .
It ’s a good thing .
It ’s a blessing .
It ’s an indication that people love what we ’re doing , which means you now have a reason to go out and double or triple or quadruple your damn network capacity .
Jesus !
I ca n’t believe I ’m explaining this to you .
You ’re in the business of selling bandwidth .
That pipe is what you sell .
Right now what the market is telling you is that you can sell even more !
Lots more !
Good Lord .
The world is changing , and you ’re right in the sweet spot .
While I ’m ranting , let me ask you something , Randall .
At the risk of sounding like Glenn Beck Jr. — what the fuck has gone wrong with our country ?
Used to be , we were innovators .
We were leaders .
We were builders .
We were engineers .
We were the best and brightest .
We were the kind of guys who , if they were running the biggest mobile network in the U.S. , would say it ’s not enough to be the biggest , we also want to be the best , and once they got to be the best , they ’d say , How can we get even better ?
What can we do to be the best in the whole fucking world ?
What can we do that would blow people ’s fucking minds ?
They would n’t have sat around wondering about ways to fuck over people who loved their product .
But then something happened .
Guys like you took over the phone company and all you cared about was milking profit and paying off assholes in Congress to fuck over anyone who came along with a better idea , because even though it might be great for consumers it would mean you and your lazy pals would have to get off your asses and start working again in order to keep up .
And not just you .
Look at Big Three automakers .
Same deal .
Lazy , fat , slow , stupid , from the top to the bottom — everyone focused on just getting what they can in the short run and who cares what kind of piece of shit product we ’re putting out .
Then somehow along the way the evil motherfuckers on Wall Street got involved and became everyone ’s enabler , devoting all their energy and brainpower to breaking things up and parceling them out and selling them off in pieces and then putting them back together again , and it was all about taking all this great shit that our predecessors had built and “ unlocking value ” which really meant finding ways to leech out whatever bit of money they could get in the short run and let the future be damned .
It was all just one big swindle , and the only kind of engineering that matters anymore is financial engineering .
And now here we are .
Right here in your own backyard , an American company creates a brilliant phone , and that company hands it to you , and gives you an exclusive deal to carry it — and all you guys can do is complain about how much people want to use it .
You , Randall Stephenson , and your lazy stupid company — you are the problem .
You are what ’s wrong with this country .
I stopped , then .
There was nothing on the line .
Silence .
I said , Randall ?
He goes , Yeah , I ’m here .
I said , Does any of that make sense ?
He says , Yeah , but we ’re still not going to do it .
See , when you run the numbers what you find is that we ’re actually better off running a shitty network than making the investment to build a good one .
It ’s just numbers , Steve .
You ca n’t charge enough to get a return on the investment .
Now there was silence again .
This time I was the one not talking .
There was this weird lump in my throat , this tightness in my chest .
I had this vision of the future — a ruined empire , run by number crunchers , squalid and stupid and puffed up with phony patriotism , settling for a long slow decline .
“ Okay , ” I said .
“ Nice talking to you . ”
Then I hung up .
Kerry Skarbakka seems to have a superhuman ability to survive some terrible accidents , all of which are of his own making .
The artist photographs himself falling from trees , jumping off of bridges and in the midst of fires all in the name of art .
Inspired by the helplessness he felt after the 9/11 attacks Kerry has produced a series of images showing the artist frozen in a moment of peril .
The images sell for up to 4,500 .

That ’s not so .
In fact , she ( allegedly ) chose the perfect club to fit the crime .
So to help all you married golfers out there , we created this handy guide .

The killing of an HIV / AIDS outreach worker on December 14 , 2009 , is part of a pattern of violence against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people in Honduras that seems to have accelerated in the turbulent months since the June 28 coup , Human Rights Watch said today .
The organization called on Honduran judicial authorities to open full investigations of all the reported killings , and to provide human rights training for the police and the judiciary about sexual orientation and gender identity .
" The mounting violence against people who look or love differently in Honduras reflects a crisis of intolerance , " said Juliana Cano Nieto , researcher in the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch .
The latest attack was on Walter Orlando Trochez , 27 , who had been active both in the LGBT movement and in political activity opposing the coup .
He was shot in the chest by an unidentified person late on the night of December 14 in downtown Tegucigalpa , near the Central Church .
Indyra Mendoza of Cattrachas , a local lesbian organization , told Human Rights
Watch that he managed to call his friends on his mobile phone after the shooting .
When they arrived at the scene , an ambulance was taking Trochez to Hospital Escuela , where he died .
An autopsy revealed that he died from one shot to the chest .
On December 5 , Trochez reported to the Attorney General 's Office that four armed men in civilian clothes attempted to kidnap him on the previous day .
He said there had been a series of threats against his life on the grounds of his participation in the resistance movement .
" Walter used to go with me to recognize the bodies of our transgender friends when they were killed , " Mendoza said .
" Now I had to go on my own to identify his body . "
Since June 28 , the National Criminal Investigation Department in Tegucigalpa has documented at least seven killings of transgender and gay people in Honduras , including Trochez .
Local LGBT advocates have asked the prosecutor 's office for information about approximately nine more reported killings in the second largest city - San Pedro Sula and neighboring cities .
In " Not Worth a Penny : Human Rights Abuses against Transgender People in Honduras " , a report released in May , Human Rights Watch documented the killing of 17 transgender women between 2005 and 2008 .
In the report , Human Rights Watch called on Honduran authorities to :
Repeal provisions of the Law on Police and Social Affairs that penalize public conduct on arbitrary and vaguely defined grounds .
Authorities should send a clear message to all law enforcement institutions that violence against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people , will not be tolerated , the report said ;
Conduct independent , impartial , and effective investigations into the general phenomenon of homophobic and transphobic violence and into specific allegations of police brutality , extortion , and ill - treatment against LGBT people , leading to the identification and prosecution of the perpetrators ;
Adult games and games for adults are different .
European developer Quantic Dream does n't just dream of making games for adults , it is .
With upcoming PS3 title Heavy Rain , the developer aims to make the video game equivalent of something like an R rated film — adult characters , adult content .
As mentioned previously , some of that content is nudity .
The preview build of the game played by Kotaku included a little bit of nudity - a bare male posterior , a topless woman , and cheekily blocked genitalia during some scenes of dressing and undressing — but no sex .

Footage from Polish site tvgry.pl offers a look at how the adult content in the game is being handled — looks somewhat sterile , which is refreshing for a video game .
The stack trace is precious !
The stack trace is one of the most valuable pieces of information you can have when trying to debug a problem .
It tells you what line of code was being run when an error was thrown and gives you an idea of the execution path that lead to that line of code being run .
Quick plea then .
Please do n't do this :
def foo do_something rescue => e puts " Problem : # {e} " raise e end
This will start a new stack trace at raise e .
If I rescue this further up the stack there 's no indication of where the problem was originally encountered - I just get pointed at your error handling code .
Precious information , gone .
Do this instead :

* Homemade Food Dehydrator *
By Stryder
3-24-02
If you ’re like most survival folks you ’ve got a commercial dehydrator or two that you use to preserve foods .
Maybe it ’s to preserve your garden produce or maybe to make some lightweight backpacking foods at a reduced cost .
Whatever use you make of it , it probably looks something like the one pictured above .
I have three favorite ‘ survival ’ food books that I leaf through from time to time .
They are : Putting Food By by Hertzberg , Vaughn , and Greene , Cooking in the Outdoors by Jacobson , and my absolute favorite and the one I would pick if I could only pick one food book , Stocking Up by Carole Store .
Like many folks , since September we have been very busy double checking our preps and staying close to home ‘ just in case ’ and we have not had much time to enjoy the outdoors .
So the other day I was planning a short weekend camping trip with my family and looking through Cooking in the Outdoors for some new backpacking recipes to try .
The recipe I wanted to try called for some dehydrated ground beef and I did n’t have any made up .
I went to get the dehydrator to make some and then just decided – what the heck – I ’ll make a home made dehydrator first to make the ground beef with .
The first thing I did was round up what I needed which was a heavy cardboard box ( I chose one that a computer monitor had come in ) , some aluminum foil , masking tape , a light socket and bulb , some lamp cord and an electrical plug , some aluminum cookie sheets , some wooden strips ( I chose some stuff in the garage I had used to fix screen doors with this past summer ) , and my trusty do everything tool – my Kbar .
Being a packrat I had all the stuff around the house , it was nothing special and should be easy to find or very cheap to buy .
Next I lined the box with the aluminum foil and taped it down with the masking tape .
Roll the masking tape into a small loop so that you have the sticky side out and tape the foil to box without the tape showing .
After the box is lined with the foil , carefully make up the light socket and connect the lamp cord and plug .
If the socket you are using is open remember to make a backing for it with cardboard because it should not be in direct contact with the foil lined box after assembly .
I used a 150 watts bulb in my dehydrator because it was the biggest wattage bulb I had in the house ( do n’t even know why I had it ! ) but it seems to be absolutly right for the size of the box
Mount the finished light fixture into a bottom corner of the box .
On two opposite sides of the box measure off and cut holes to slide the wooden slats through that will hold the trays ( aluminum cookie sheets ) of food to be dehydrated .
If you look closely at the picture you 'll see that one of the slats has marks on it .
I used that slat as a crude measuring stick to be sure I lined up the holes on the sides but without using any tools other than my Kbar .
The next step was to load up the trays with the ground beef I was going to dehydrate , plug in my new dehydrator , and let it do its thing .
For even faster results , a small 12VDC computer fan , attached to a 12VDC power supply , can be directed into the box to provide air circulation for more uniform dehydration .
DO NOT leave your Homemade Food Dehydrator Unattended !
If your light bulb is too hot , or your box too small , you run the possibility of having a fire hazard .
What is its thing ?
Well ground beef for one .
Just cook up your ground beef ( the leaner the better ) on the stove the way you normally would .
When it ’s cooked , drain the fat .
Put the cooked beef into a strainer and run a teapot of boiling water through it .
The water will drain off most of the grease , which is what causes early spoiling .
It will also leach out some , but not all , of the nutrients but none of the taste .
Throw it in your dehydrator for a day until it is VERY dry and crumbles into powder when you break it up in your hand .
Then you can use it for soups and stews , in sauce and chili in the field .
Rehydrate it by letting it sit in a plastic bag with a pint of water per pound for about an hour .
It will last about 4 weeks in a zip lock bag , and it lasts a year - from one summer to the next - just sitting on a shelf if it ’s vacuum sealed .
About 5 pounds of dehydrated ground beef fits into a quart bag ( that does n’t leave any room to add water to rehydrate , however . )
Canned kidney beans , with or without the syrup work well too and you ’ll need those for the chili .
Fruit for a trail snack is easy and a common thing folks think of doing in a dehydrator – bananas are on sale often in the winter , sometimes near me they ’re five pounds for a dollar .
Grab them up , slice them up in ¼ inch to 3/8 inch slices , brush them with a little honey thinned ½ and ½ with water with 1 T. of lemon juice added and you ’ll have cheap , great tasting trail snacks .
Do up enough to last ‘ till next winter – they ’ll keep .
Have you got Chilean winter grapes coming into your area stores ?
How about some homemade raisins to mix with those banana chips ?
What else can you do ?
Maybe some campfire corn chowder .
½ cup of dried corn , 4 strips of cooked dehydrated bacon , 1 small onion chopped ( can also be dehydrated to save weight and volume ) , 1 medium potato diced , 2 cups dry milk , 1 tablespoon flour , 1 ½ teaspoons salt , 1/8 teaspoon pepper .
Mix the flour , salt , milk , pepper , and onion ( if you decide to dehydrate it ) together in a ziplock before you go .
Rehydrate the corn in 1½ cups of water for 30 minutes .
Place the undrained , rehydrated corn and 2 more cups of water into a pot and slow boil for 45 minutes .
Add water to maintain volume as water boils off .
Add potato and cook until tender .
Combine the pre-measured milk , salt , pepper , and flour mix to 2 ½ more cups water and mix well .
Add the milk mix to the soup pot , mix well , and add the bacon and onion .
Serve with crackers or hard bread .
It ’s lightweight for packing but big on taste around a campfire .
Take 4 pounds of flank , rump , brisket or round steak and trim ALL the fat with a sharp knife then cut into ¼ inch strips about 6 inches long .
Marinate in the refrigerator overnight in just enough water to cover mixed with 1 1/3 T salt , 1t pepper , 2 t onion powder , 1 t garlic powder , 1 t Worcestershire sauce , 12 drops Tabasco sauce and ¼ t thyme .
Next morning lay it on your dehydrator trays with no overlapping , plug in the dehydrator and when you come home from work that night , 8 - 10 hours later , you ’ll be looking at some fine beef or venison jerky .
Meals Rejected by Ethiopia have their place for sure .
But with a little practice you can make some very tasty meals in the field from things that do n’t have any more weight or bulk than MREs .
Dehydrators also greatly add to the storage life and decrease the bulk of some of your storage foods .
If you do n’t have a dehydrator , you really should have one .
This homemade version works as well or better than a commercial dehydrator and should n’t cost anyone more than $ 5 to put together even if you ’re buying some of the parts plus an hour or less of labor .
If you scavenge an old lamp , a cardboard box , and some tin foil , it costs nothing .
Then use it and see the world of difference it makes in campfire meals and pack weight !
Then … .
Get out and train !

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore on Thursday called for a boycott of the state of Connecticut in reaction to Sen.
Joe Lieberman 's ( I - Conn . ) opposition to key provisions of healthcare reform legislation .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) recently removed the public option and Medicare - buy in proposal , which the centrist Lieberman opposes , from the bill in order to attract centrist votes .
Reid needs 60 votes in order to break a Republican filibuster of the bill .
Moore focused his anger on the Connecticut voters who reelected Lieberman in favor of liberal candidate Ned Lamont ( D - Conn . ) in the 2006 elections .
He tweeted :
People of Connecticut :
What have u done 2 this country ?
We hold u responsible .
Start recall of Lieberman 2day or we 'll boycott your state .
Lieberman has become the scourge of the left for withholding his vote on healthcare reform due to the inclusion of the public health insurance option and the Medicare buy - in proposals .
There is no provision in the state of Connecticut to recall public officials .

The BBC has learned that the British Government is preparing to levy a one off windfall tax on investment bankers based in the UK .
But there are concerns from some in the financial industy that the plan could undermine London 's status as one of the world 's most important financial centres .
There 's no doubt levying a tax on bankers will be popular as many people blame the high - flying risk takers in banks for causing the financial crisis .
Many banks are still only in business thanks to injections of billions of dollars of taxpayers ' money , so the prospect of bankers who made costly mistakes getting bonuses is questionable .
It is thought the tax will also be levied on bonuses paid to executives working at foreign banks .
That 's a worry for the City of London which fears it could undermine London 's position as one of the world 's major financial centres .
Stuart Fraser is the head of policy making for the City of London Corporation .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) -
The Kremlin ’s chief political strategist warned in an article published on Monday that Russia risked collapsing into chaos if officials tried to tinker with the political system by flirting with liberal reforms .
Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff Vladislav Surkov said it was clear Russia was falling behind in many areas of economic development and that the country could not simply continue being a “ resource power . ”
But in answer to calls from opponents for democratic reforms to liberalize the political system built under former President Vladimir Putin , Surkov warned that the resulting instability could rip Russia apart .
“ Even now when power is rather consolidated and ordered , many projects are very slow and difficult , ” Surkov was quoted as saying by the Itogi weekly magazine .
“ If we add any sort of political instability to that then our development would simply be paralyzed .
There would be a lot of demagoguery , a lot of empty talk , a lot of lobbying and ripping Russia to pieces , but no development . ”
As the Kremlin ’s point man on domestic politics , Surkov rarely speaks in public .
Surkov , 45 , is viewed by diplomats and investors as one of Russia ’s most powerful officials and is credited with helping Putin to craft the Kremlin ’s centralized political system after the chaos of the 1990s .
He worked for Putin ’s entire eight - year presidency in the Kremlin as a deputy chief of staff and continued under Putin ’s protege , President Dmitry Medvedev .
Medvedev , who took power in May 2008 , has repeatedly stressed the need for Russia to open up and modernize its political system .
But opponents say he has made few changes to the tightly controlled system he inherited from Putin , who continues to serve as prime minister .
After disputed October 11 regional elections , which official results showed Putin ’s United Russia party won with a landslide , opposition parties have called for electoral reforms and a rerun of the vote .
“ We must not confuse liberal , democratic society with chaos and disorder , ” Surkov said , adding that Russia should avoid the excesses of both Chinese leader Mao Zedong and Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
“ Though Mao Zedong said that a lot of chaos results in a lot of order , he probably meant that tough or even totalitarian regimes are born from ruins .
We do not need that .
We do not need a Pinochet , ” Surkov said .
Surkov graduated in economics and served in the Soviet army before working as a public relations and advertising consultant in the 1990s , including for tycoons such as Mikhail Fridman and the now disgraced oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
“ We must understand that authority that is unconsolidated and unbalanced ( and ) weak democratic institutions are unable to ensure an economic revival , ” Surkov said .
U.S. assistance to food banks rose in 2009 with Recovery Act funding , after a record number of Americans struggled to put food on the table in 2008 , a new report found .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of Americans that have trouble putting food on the table shot up last year in an unprecedented spike to a record 17 million households , the government reported on Monday .
The Department of Agriculture report , which has been released annually since 1995 , said the number of Americans that were hungry rose to 14.6 % .
In 2007 , 13 million households or 11.1 % of Americans had trouble getting enough food .
The one - year jump is all the more significant , given the number of hungry Americans had never been higher than 11.9 % since these surveys began .
Of the near - 15 % of the nation that could n't secure enough food last year , the USDA said one - third of them had " very low food security , " meaning they reduced the amount that they ate or disrupted their eating patterns during the year .
That group made up 5.7 % of all U.S. households , which was also a record high .
More than 500,000 households that scaled back the amount that they ate were households with children , making up 1.3 % of all U.S. homes with children .
The USDA said the main cause of hunger and food insecurity in the country is poverty .
Obama 's call to action .
President Obama called the report " unsettling , " and said more needs to be done .
" My Administration is committed to reversing the trend of rising hunger , " Obama said in a statement .
" The first task is to restore job growth , which will help relieve the economic pressures that make it difficult for parents to put a square meal on the table each day .
But we are also taking targeted steps to prevent Americans from experiencing hunger . "
Obama urged Congress to pass a " strong " child nutrition bill to help ensure that American children do n't go hungry .
To combat the nation 's rapidly growing hunger problem , the Recovery Act allocated $ 20 billion to the nation 's food stamp program , and hundreds of millions of dollars to food banks and school lunch programs .
One recipient of stimulus funds was the USDA 's Emergency Food Assistance Program , which was allocated an additional $ 150 million from the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan .
The 28 - year old program , known as TEFAP , sends shipments of federally purchased food to states , which in turn gets the food in the hands of large food banks .
The food banks then allocate the food to soup kitchens and pantries that serve people in need .
The $ 150 million for TEFAP provided by stimulus about doubled the amount of money already allotted to the program this year .
Feeding America , a network of more than 200 food banks that advocates in Washington for food assistance programs , said its member food banks reported a 30 % increase in the number of people seeking assistance earlier this year , and 72 % of food banks had been unable to adequately meet demand before the stimulus bill was enacted .

Programming languages , operating systems , despair and anger
Or , the State of the End - User Environment / Programming Onion ...
So , in a confluence of events , I have been lately looking at Scala and yesterday spent some time looking at Pike / Thompson / Google et. al. 's " Go " language for " systems programming . "
And Guido halts Python syntactic evolution before the job is done ...
And it fills me with despair and anger .
Language designers in general : You are IN THE WAY .
Go here : http://www.rebol.com/oneliners.html
... then do us all a favor and do n't resist the urge to fall on that wakizashi when your shame overcomes you .
First of all , neither Scala nor Go is anything more than incremental evolution ;
Go in particular put me over the edge .
It 's merely the latest of a series of languages from these same people ( former god- like heroes to me ) --- most recently Limbo , each successive one of which implements the same ideas in barely , idiosyncratically , every - so- slightly different ways .
And so for 20 years now these folks --- * the* shining lights , in many ways , of " practical " programming language , operating systems , and general systems research --- have continued to fail to " get " the fundamental practical needs of everyday programmers working in The Real World .
" Go " is just another language written first for the compiler and only secondarily for the programmer --- and stuck in a 70s mindset * about the relationship of that programmer to the ( digital ) world within which they live and work !
( But hey , it compiles fast !
Which is , of course , THE problem that really needs addressing . )
( Or rather , a fast - forwarded 70s mindset projected into a fictional future .
I get the sense that Google is a bit Star Trek -ish ; an anachronistic - nostalgic future that does n't really exist outside of its own fictional milieu .
I mean --- it took 'em 200 years to figure out the implications of the transporter buffers --- and then they did n't even take advantage of them consistently ?
GMAFB .
But I digress . )
I think Carl Sassenrath may be the only person on the planet working in this area that accurately perceives the " pain " involved in general , everyday , practical programming and is * actually * trying to address it .
Too bad his solution is locked in closed source , in corporate lock - in , and in a company that * clearly * is suffering from a completely schizophrenic ( lack of ) " business model " --- no doubt due to the influence of investors and suits and isolation .
( Not to mention suffering from ghastly - ugly , mondo - 1989 graphic design of its built - in GUI toolkit components and hence all application UIs . )
( Other candidates for clue include Eric Meijer who , unfortunately , seems to have been unable to translate clue to practice in many ways , despite lots of " enterprise - scale " innovation ; and Alan Kay , who has some real ideas ( " Worlds " == absolutely awesome idea ) but is apparently suffering from " research / think tank / industry alumni " inability to reduce research to practical practice . )
( Wolfram might get it ... maybe , part of it ... but let 's not go there , same lock in probs as Carl 's gig but a whole lot worse , and a lot of other issues too . )
What do we do ?
Communication , coordination , automation , analysis , and visualization / animation / interaction .
That 's IT .
Over a few - dozen basic kinds of information and in a handful of typical hardware environment / architectural scenarios .
Come on !
J.H.C , folks , it 's nearly 2010 .
Let 's get a few things straight : - most programming involves schlepping a few but complex data types between different string representations - programmers have become plumbers and documentation - archaeologists mostly , which is sad and uninteresting - programming languages are for * programmers * --- not compilers and compiler - writers - until you make the everyday , " simple " things simple , it will continue to be a dark art practiced by fewer and fewer - any language that makes you explicitly import an IO module to read a file or stdin is fucked - declarations are a pointless anachronism ( same for explicit memory management ) - if I have to understand category theory to write a program that does IO , IT IS A NON STARTER !
- less stupid line - noise syntax and punctuation , people SIMPLE GUI PROGRAMMING !
Remember BASIC ?
Logo ?
Zero to graphics in three minutes , max .
How the hell are kids supposed to learn to program these days ?
Even Python 's learning curve is too high , IMHO , though it 's probably the closest thing to a reasonable starting ground that has any real traction .
And the GUI bar is raised these days : kids and non-developers ( and busy developers w/ o time for little , interesting toy projects * just because project set - up cost is so high in almost any language / environment ! ) need to be able to throw together complex multi-agent 3D microworlds with minutes .
( Yes , I 'm aware of Kodu and friends .
It 's a start , maybe ; but it needs its textual equivalent ; enough with the " only visual programming " crap , it has shown its limits . )
If you provide some binding / embedding to Tk and you think that 's sufficient to satisfy your GUI needs , then IT'S A NON - STARTER !
If you DO NOT provide a CANONICAL cross-platform GUI toolkit , IT'S A NON - STARTER !
If it 's more than 5 readable lines to produce a " hello , world " web server --- NON STARTER !
If sending an e-mail is n't a one - liner --- NON STARTER !
Getting a web page or making a simple http post > 1 line --- NON STARTER !
Figuring out the number of days between two dates > 1 line --- NON STARTER !
While I 'm on a rant , FUCK JSON .
I mean , first fuck XML thoroughly and nastily , but let 's call it like it is - wrt - JSON .
Anything that forces me to do this shit : { ' someSymbolicKeyAsString ' : ' someUriValueAsString ' } ...is BROKEN BY DESIGN !
NO MORE TUNNELING CRAP IN STRINGS !!!
* REAL WORLD * , modern datatypes , built - in , literal , batteries - included PLEASE !!!
If the following are n't first - class types with first - class literal constructors / representations supported * at the language level * then your new programming language ISN'T EVEN ON THE PLAYING FIELD : - symbols AS SUCH - numbers AS A SINGLE TYPE - strings NOT AS BYTE ARRAYS - a single , universal aggregate type ( cf. Lua tables , more or less ; Rebol blocks ) - e-mail addresses , file / directory paths , and general URI types - date and time constructions with simple operator arithmetic - generic markup constructs ( cf. Meijer " Unifying Documents [ etc . ] " ) - domain names and IP addresses - regexes and structural regular expressions - generalized patterns for pattern - based dispatch - quantities --- numbers with attached dimensionality - booleans and * potentially tri-state logic support * - ranges and slices - some controlled ability to do open classes - concurrency constructs AS SUCH Also : if your language does n't include a CPAN / CRAN / etc. repo and package - distribution capability BUILT IN , it 's again a non-starter !
Dammit , people !
And let 's get a few things straight : I do n't care if it 's the OS , language , or language - integrated runtime ( as opposed to externalized " standard library " or even worse third - party library ) but : - the " operating system " or runtime should provide * real world abstractions * , too - higher - level stuff BUILT IN , like : - person , group , social network , presence , identity , authority , permission , etc. - media objects : audio , video , pdf , still images , etc. ( just a few ! ) - pages , bookmarks , notes , tasks , todo lists , other lists , calendars , events , etc. - spreadsheets , charts , diagrams , formulas , maps , etc. - tagging rather than hierarchy --- EVERYWHERE - workspace , context , orthogonal persistence , location - transparency - context awareness , " cluestreams " , user activity , remembrance agents enabled / made easy - not just multi-core single - machine or homogeneous - cluster programming , but rather : - a heterogeneous , loosely - connected , multi- device , multi- input , user - centered universe - of - tools - multiple machines , multi-machine - aware tools and objects - programmable / multi-machine clipboard / clipping / plumbing - scheduling ( i.e. cron ) , rules , etc. ( e.g. things like " Puppet " unnecessary ! ) - caching / replicated / fully versioned home dirs , drop boxes , etc. - deep support for both client - and server - side personalizable HTTP and mail services - handling of disconnection / replication / synchronization - dispense with application - level balkanization of data ! - composition and re-use Grrrr .... it 's pretty damn sad that something as limited and now - ancient as bash represents some kind of optimum of productivity for many real - world " everyday programming " tasks --- and yet fails so miserably for so many other everyday programming tasks due to lack of data abstraction and richness .
If I have to write one more polyglot bash / awk / python script to gather data from log files on a bunch of different machines , demux that into a time - ordered event stream , pipe it through something to munge it into some slightly different format , ship that off via post to some web address and get some JSON back , parse that into some other shit , do some computation over it like aggregation or date math over time stamps with unlike representations , wrap the results up in an HTML table and send that table in a MIME - enabled e-mail to myself I think I am going to * explode . * 90 % of the shit that gets written does n't even involve anything as complicated as finding set partitions .
Really .
Somebody do something about this , before I LOSE MY FUCKING MIND !?!?!

By Henry Abbott
On TrueHoop on Monday , we dedicated considerable time to debunking some of the claims in Tim Donaghy 's book .
That was shortly after sitting across from Donaghy and letting him hear about the same research , which you can now see on the video above .
In a nutshell , his book " Personal Foul " outlines many techniques he used in winning bets at an incredible rate , without fixing games .
We checked into four of them ( selected essentially at random , using the " which of these claims can we check ? " technique ) and found that those four betting techniques were not nearly as good as he said they would be .
In fact , taken all together , they prove to be far worse than just betting at random .
Think of it like this , if you tell me you built a mansion , I might be skeptical .
I might say , OK , here , build a dog house .
Just so I can see that you can build something .
Then if the doghouse falls all apart the first time the wind blows ... well , no , I have not proven you did n't build the house .
But I know that the two things were built differently .
Donaghy is adamant that he won his bets at a rate -- better than 70 % -- that one gambling expert told me would be hard to achieve even if you were fixing games .
15 out of 16 wins in one stretch !
In the book he is clear that these were the kinds of strategies that he used to achieve those results .
Hearing they were not profitable strategies , he shifted course , saying there were other factors too .
What were those ?
Why are they not in his tell - all book ?
Why is your doghouse in ruins ?
On one particular issue he changed his tune a few times .
In the book , he is lavish in explaining the degree to which referee Dick Bavetta is reliable in keeping games close .
In debunking that claim , Donaghy heard me say that seven - point underdogs did n't have a good track record .
That was a spread a gambling expert had told us was a good definition of a big underdog .
Donaghy replied that he did n't bet on seven - point underdogs , he bet on double - digit underdogs .
So , he was saying , I had made an error .
I clarified later in the interview : Was he saying that if we looked up double - digit underdogs in Bavetta games , we 'd find a winning strategy ?
He then changed his tune , saying that we should look for Bavetta games with 13 - or 14 - point underdogs .
None of it panned out .
You lose money any which way you follow the advice :
In games with 7 - point or bigger underdogs during the four years Donaghy was betting , the Bavetta strategy would have won in just 48 of 104 games .
In games with 10 - point or bigger underdogs , you would have won 17 out of 42 .
In games with 13 - point or bigger underdogs won just two out of eight .
So then we are left clinging to his assertion that the FBI checked all this out , and they believe him .
But is that even true ?
From Monday 's post :
U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell wrote , in a letter to the presiding judge , that " there is no evidence that Donaghy ever intentionally made a particular ruling during a game in order to increase the likelihood that his gambling pick would be correct . "
The letter adds that Donaghy has acknowledged that his gambling may have subconsciously influenced his work .
The NBA 's investigation concluded , essentially , that Donaghy might not have rigged games .
" It seems plausible to us that Donaghy may not have manipulated games , " but admits that they have no thorough way to check .
" Given the information currently in our possession , we and the League ’s experts are unable to contradict the government ’s conclusion that ' [t ] here is no evidence that Donaghy ever intentionally made a particular ruling during a game in order to increase the likelihood that his gambling pick would be correct .' ...
Donaghy officiated close to 300 games in this period .
Without knowing on which games or teams he wagered and without access to Donaghy ’s explanation for his calls , we believe that it would be impossible to find that the government ’s conclusion that he did not manipulate games is erroneous .
So we have one body saying he may have influenced some games , but they do n't have evidence , and another saying there are tons of games that he might have influenced but they have n't watched .
Meanwhile , Donaghy points to the foreword of his book , penned by former FBI agent Phil Scala .
The foreword goes to some trouble to lend credence to Donaghy , but specifically does not say he did not fix games .
Does that mean Tim Donaghy fixed games ?
No .
But it does mean that nobody of note has said publicly that he did not , and that some of the ways he ways he won all those bets do n't add up .
If you want to know the mind of God – look in the mirror .
That is the conclusion of Nicholas Epley and his team who studied people ’s beliefs about God ’s beliefs .
They asked subjects a series of questions about controversial moral issues , such as the death penalty and abortion , and also asked them about beliefs on those issues of famous people and of God .
Not surprisingly , subjects ’ own beliefs mirrored the beliefs they attributed to God .
This , of course , can have multiple interpretations .
It may indicate that people tend to attribute to God their own moral beliefs .
But it may also result from people acquiring their moral belief from the teachings of their faith .
Also , culture or other factors may influence both moral beliefs and beliefs attributed to God .
So Epley added a control – he used an already established technique to alter the beliefs of the subjects .
People are more malleable than we would like to think – our beliefs can be manipulated simply by asking leading questions .
In fact , political campaigners have applied this to what is called “ push polling ” – conducting a poll or survey , the purpose of which is not to gather information but to plant thought in the minds of those polled .
“ Are you bothered by the accusations of a sex scandal with candidate X ? ”
We are more susceptible to such suggestions when we are not aware that they are being made – when we think we ’re just answering a survey , not the target of attempts to change our opinion .
Epley used these techniques , for example having subjects write an essay espousing the opposite opinion to the one they expressed on initial questioning , on the subjects .
On re-questioning about belief he found that subjects shifted the beliefs that they attribute to God , but not to other famous people .
This means that beliefs about what God believes can be shifted by the same techniques used to shift our own beliefs .
Epley ’s team then did an fMRI study ( I guess no psychological study today is complete without some fMRI correlate ) and they found that when contemplating their own beliefs and the beliefs of God the same part of the brain became active , and that this was distinct from when they were contemplating the beliefs of the “ average American . ”
These two lines of evidence both suggest that people tend to project onto
God their own moral beliefs .
This , of course , does not mean people of faith make up their moral beliefs without any influence from faith or culture – it ’s likely a dynamic process .
But it does imply that people can change their moral beliefs first , and then attribute those changing beliefs to God after the fact .
People of faith synchronize their moral beliefs with those they attribute to God , and the influence is at least partly from the faithful to the imagined deity .
This , of course , becomes the ultimate argument from authority for the faithful – you cannot argue with an omniscient deity .
I suspect , however , that the same psychological processes are at work even in those without faith .
It would be interested to repeat this study but substitute some other authority for God , like the scientific consensus , leading experts , or Einstein .
The reason for my suspicion is other psychological experiments that show that we tend to arrive at conclusions for mysterious ( to us ) subconscious reasons and then rationalize those conclusions , mainly to convince ourselves that we are rational beings .
This is why questioning our own motives , and our own process , is critical to a skeptical and scientific outlook .
We must realize that the default mode of human psychology is to grab onto comforting beliefs for purely emotional reasons , and then justify those beliefs to ourselves with post - hoc rationalizations .
It takes effort to rise above this tendency , to step back from our beliefs and our emotional connection to conclusions and focus on the process .
The process ( i.e. science , logic , and intellectual rigor ) has to be more important than the belief .

He was at a building in Newbury Park , California , doing electrical work on a roof , when he fell 30 feet from a skylight .
He died December 20 .
Gates was an owner of Gateco Electric , which was employed at the site .
On its Twitter page , " MythBusters " tweeted , " Team MB wishes to express our deepest sympathies on the passing of our beloved rocket expert , Erik , " followed by " You were an honorary MythBuster and will be sorely missed . "
Gates and his brother also ran Gates Brothers Rocketry .
( CNN ) -- Iranian authorities confiscated the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize given to human rights activist Shirin Ebadi , Norway said Thursday .
" The medal and the diploma have been removed from Dr. Ebadi 's bank box , together with other personal items .
Such an act leaves us feeling shock and disbelief , " Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a written statement .
Norway did not explain how it had learned of the alleged confiscation , and there was no immediate reaction from Iran .
Norway 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a written statement that it " has reacted strongly " and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires on Wednesday afternoon to protest the move .
During the meeting with the Iranian charge d'affaires , State Secretary Gry Larsen also expressed " grave concern " about how Ebadi 's husband has allegedly been treated .
" Earlier this autumn , he [ Ebadi's husband ] was arrested in Tehran and severely beaten .
His pension has been stopped and his bank account has been frozen , " the statement from Norway said .
Store said in the statement that it marked the " first time a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities . "
The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm , Sweden .
The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine , physics , chemistry and literature .
Starting in 1969 , the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded .
While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden , the peace prize is determined by a five - member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament .
Ebadi received the prize for her focus on human rights , especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children .
A statement from the Nobel committee at the time said , " As a lawyer , judge , lecturer , writer and activist , she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country , Iran , and far beyond its borders . "
What does a guy have to do to get an affordable , efficient , tiny house around here ?
Something about the size of the average two car garage , say , 400 to 500 sq. ft .
It would be nice to have some space outside for a large garden , a few solar panels , a compost pile , and a bit of nature .
Somewhere to escape the crushing burden of rent or mortgage payments and live a simple low - impact life .
I dream of a home that is different from the ubiquitous boxes that cloak our landscape as monuments to the dinosaur of for - profit housing .
These McHomes may not be energy efficient , or have room for a garden , or encourage community , but they sure do maximize profits for developers , builders and realtors .
Why is a gargantuan mortgage the only option for securing shelter ?
Shackling yourself to the Big Banks for 35 to 40 years is not my idea of freedom .
What if you do n't want a 3000 sq.ft .
cookie - cutter house in a prestigious neighbourhood with a front double garage and postage stamp yard ?
What happened to reasonable sized houses ?
What is wrong with tiny homes ?
Across the land where the average size of new homes is growing ( currently about 2500 sq. ft. ) , you will find it is illegal to build a house smaller than about 15 oo sq. ft.
Architectural restrictions in your enclave ensure any individuality is banned along with outdoor laundry lines .
We know that monocultures are very susceptible to disruption .
Diversity is the key to survival .
But you will not find that in your regular development .
No orientation for maximum solar gain , no solar water heaters , no straw bale , no grey water systems , no wind turbines , no tiny homes .
No , you are not going to see any alternative , forward - thinking innovations here , because these homes and developments are about one thing , and one thing only - maximum profit .
Do n't look for answers from the private sector .
They are unwilling to provide affordable housing , and are not concerned with providing solutions to our environmental challenges .
A local developer recently quoted in the Sooke News Mirror said , " the imposition of affordable housing makes our business unsuccessful .
" It is time to set aside self - interest and think instead about our survival .
Securing shelter , a basic human need , should not make one a slave to the bank for half a lifetime .
And those with cash on hand should have more of a choice than the unimaginative , expensive , inefficient wastes of space currently offered .
If the private sector can't , or wo n't , provide affordable housing , then the government should .
If they refuse , then they should let the people organize and support their efforts , because the people CAN provide affordable , sustainable housing when profit is not the number one motivating factor .
All I want is my little hobbit house , in a cooperative community of forward thinking individuals willing to show that housing for all is not just a dream .
It is attainable if we stand together and work toward that goal without greed in our hearts .
The imposition of unaffordable , inefficient housing makes us , and our planet , unsuccessful .
This is a serious dessert mousse , friends .
A chocolate experience so rich , velvety and decadent , a few tablespoons is really all that any one person needs .
I usually chuckle when I watch Mrs. Pastry eat chocolate bars , because she nibbles them like a mouse , savoring every tiny morsel .
However even I — a man known to wolf chocolate bars down by the handful — eat this only incrementally , off the tip of a spoon .
slow down , mind traffic .

Why is it so hard to think without words ?
Try it .
Where do these ideas come from , when language fades away ?
Beneath the flimsy veil of language , there appears to be a collection of potent symbols that seal off “ meaning ” .
Conscious use of language allows one to directly access the symbols , and therefore , “ meaning ” which directs her life .
Uncritical use of language imprisons one within a psychological prison constructed by symbols imposed upon him from without .
“ Enchantment ”
Language is magic .
The moment you name something , you differentiate it from everything else in the world .
I ’d imagine that when humans first learned to do it , that it would have been quite magical indeed .
I ’m not just talking about public language either , as communication between others … .
I ’m also talking about the interior language of mind , which allows you to communicate with yourself .
Language is a matter of difference .
You see a crowd crossing the street , they are humans as separate and different from nature ( everything else ) .
In this crowd of humans , there are females , as separate as different from males .
And in this group of females , there is your girlfriend , as separate and different from all the other females .
This is where the “ magic ” happens : she ’s separate because she “ loves ” you , and you “ love ” her , and you can have “ sex ” etc … that ’s how most girlfriends are , right ?
Oh , she ’s different also because she ’s not allowed to love / fuck other guys .
She is now bounded in relation to you by title of “ girlfriend ” .
Magic grants access , but it also places restrictions .
The assignment of subjective qualities and boundaries upon an “ object ” , or something , “ out there ” in reality … is a fucking ridiculously powerful tool .
Look how language has transformed our lives …
I ca n’t believe I ’m wearing “ pants ” .
How absurd is that ?
What is this “ computer ” thing and “ internet ” thing that allows me to perform the “ magic ” of communicating language -> symbols -> “ meaning ” ” that affords me so much more “ power ” than I could ever “ imagine ” ?
Who “ invented ” this shit , and what the fuck is “ invention ” anyway ?
I might as well put quotations around every word , “ fuck ” !
Speaking of “ fuck ” , and “ cunt ” for that matter , why is it that the dirtiest words in “ Western Civilization ” always refer to something sexual ?
Beyond that , why is the absolute worst word as “ judged ” by the masses , the word “ CUNT “ , a word that refers to / ” enchants ” the female sex organ ?
Could it possibly have anything to do with the “ demonization ” ( the assignment of negative value to “ something ” ) of sex in Western Civilization / Religion / Culture / Whatever ?
I think the “ feminists ” are onto something here .
Notice , in Chinese , the worst swears are always “ curses ” ( wishing of bad fortune upon “ something ” ) against the family .
Could it possibly have anything to do with the fact that family is a concept that is elevated to the greatest heights of value in Chinese culture ?
To think of language as magic ( incantations , enchantment , mantras etc. ) which influences both outwardly to manipulate the environment and inwardly to channel certain emotions / energies / whatever … makes me think that perhaps the first and final frontier of power in the story of humanity remains the landscape of mind with language as the collective weapon with which we use to conquer nature / reality .
No scientific development , cultural symbol , material product of human manufacture of any kind could exist today without the development of language and consequently , or perhaps precedently , imagination .
I look around me , surrounded by magic .
I look inside my head , and it ’s as if the industrial machine of “ language ” has transformed the natural landscape ( perhaps even , a “ Garden of Eden ” ) of my mind into a tub of lego bricks .
Now , I melt down the lego bricks to see what I can salvage , knowing that to build with the lego bricks produced by this so - called “ English language ” , I would be limiting myself to construct only constructs of the system which produced me .
Much like the guy who decides to “ fight the system ” by selling t- shirts that say “ fuck capitalism ” .
I ’m much more okay with uncertainty , than I am with certain emptiness .

" We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do .
While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way , we constantly strive to find a better solution to a client 's problems .
We pride ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques that have become standard in the industry .
- Goldman - Sachs Website , 2009 .
1928 :
" Goldman , Sachs , and Company ( GS&C ) created a new venture called " Goldman , Sachs , Trading Company " ( GSTC ) and originally issued 1 M shares at $ 100 / share on Dec 4 , 1928 but GS&C bought it all and then sold 90 % of it to the public for $ 104 [ apparently thinking this was a way to make a quick buck -- they had not yet learned about the concept of " leverage " as it is used / abused today ] .
Only 2 months later ( Feb 21 , 1929 ) GSTC merged with a company called Financial & Industrial Securities Corp. -- the resulting assets were $ 235 M .
Just before the merger , Feb 2 the stock was $ 136.50 and 5 days later on Feb 7 it was $ 222.50 "
Massive value increase even though tangible real value was much less .
Incredible spikes seem to follow the firm .
Maybe they have the Midas touch ?
“ This remarkable premium was not the undiluted result of public enthusiasm for the financial genius of Goldman , Sachs .
Goldman , Sachs had considerable enthusiasm for itself , and the Trading Corporation was buying heavily of its own securities .
By March 14 it had bought 560,724 shares of its own stock for a total outlay of $ 57,021,936 .
This , in turn , had boomed their value .
However , perhaps foreseeing the exiguous character of an investment company which had it investments all in its own common stock , the Trading Corporation stopped buying itself in March .
Then it resold part of the stock to William Crapo Durant , who re-resold it to the public as opportunity allowed . ”
1929 :
Seven months later , after the October crash ( including a 2:1 stock split ) , the price of the stock ultimately fell to approximately 1 3/4 .
The Goldman - Sachs Trading Corporation ( GSTC ) was an investment trust , a forerunner of the modern mutual fund .
According to Galbraith , Goldman - Sachs ' stock lost 97 % of its going - public value . , less than a year after its public offering .
1932 :
But in a time with no SEC , virtually anything went on Wall Street during the Great Depression .
Of course , we all know how the story ends .
Years later in Washington Mr. Sachs had this to say to Senator Couzens at the Committee of United States Senate Hearing :
Senator Couzens : Did Goldman , Sachs and Company organize the Goldman Sachs Trading Company ?
Mr. Sachs : Yes , sir .
Senator :
And it sold its stock to the public ?
Mr. Sachs : A portion of it .
The firm invested originally in 10 percent of the issue .
Senator :
And the other 90 percent was sold to the public ?
Mr. Sachs : Yes , sir .
Senator :
At what price ?
Mr. Sachs : At 104 ... the stock was later split two for one .
Senator :
And what is the price of the stock now ?
Mr. Sachs : Approximately 1 3/4 .
Deja -Vu perhaps ?
2008 :
Goldman
Sachs seems to have a pattern of passing the proverbial buck after they have rinsed all profits from their venture and moved out of the way before the train derails .

“ Scientists have identified the gene that keeps females female , ” according to The Times .
The newspaper says new research has found that the action of a single gene may be all that stops females from developing male physical traits , including testes and facial hair .
This news was based on a mouse study that looked at the effect of switching off a gene that is involved in the development of ovaries in embryos .
They found that by switching off this gene during adulthood , the cells in the ovaries of these mice developed characteristics more like testicular cells .
This research furthers our understanding of how genes control the attributes of male and female reproductive cells in mice .
News reports have suggested that the research could eventually revolutionise gender reassignment therapy and improve treatments for babies who are born with a mixed gender .
However , it is too early to say whether this experimental animal research will have direct applications to people with developmental abnormalities of the reproductive organs , or people wanting to undergo gender reassignment .
Where did the story come from ?
The research was carried out by Dr Henriette Uhlenhaut and colleagues at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Germany and other research centres in Germany , the UK and the US .
The study was funded by the German Research Foundation , the Medical Research Council in the UK and the Louis - Jeantet Foundation .
It was published in the peer - reviewed journal , Cell .
The press generally presented the scientific content well .
They focused on the implications for gender disorders in children and gender reassignment therapies , although they did state that this was a long way off .
The genetics underlying gender development are complex and involve many more genes than the two given focus in this study .
Although mice and humans share some of these genes , this research is too preliminary to be directly applicable to treatments for human gender conditions .
What kind of research was this ?
This was an animal study that used genetically engineered mice , and looked at the genes that control whether a cell is an ovary cell or a testicular cell .
It is known that in embryos there are precursor cells that can develop into either ovary cells or testicular cells .
In female embryos , the Foxl2 gene is active , causing the cells to develop into ovaries .
In male embryos , the Sox9 gene is active , causing the cells to develop into testicular cells .
The proteins produced by the Foxl2 and Sry genes can in turn switch on the action of other genes .
It had been assumed that once these precursor cells had developed into either type then they could not change back , but the current research addressed whether this was actually the case .
What did the research involve ?
The researchers created a strain of genetically engineered female mice in which the action of the Foxl2 gene could be switched off using injections of the chemical tamoxifen .
This allowed the researchers to switch the gene off when the mice had reached eight weeks old , an age at which they are adults with developed reproductive systems capable of having offspring .
The researchers looked at the appearance of the ovary cells three weeks later and for changes in which genes were active .
The researchers compared the genetically engineered mice to both non-genetically engineered male mice and non-genetically engineered female mice that were exposed to tamoxifen .
What were the basic results ?
The researchers found that three weeks after the Foxl2 gene had been switched off , the ovary cells of the genetically engineered mice looked more like testicular cells .
They also found that genes that are normally active in testicular cells had become active in the ovary cells .
For example , they found that switching off Foxl2 allowed the activation of the Sox9 gene , which is involved in testicular development .
The researchers found that the cells that had changed from ovary cells to look more like testicular cells also contained the same amount of testosterone as the testicular cells from males .
How did the researchers interpret the results ?
The researchers concluded that their research demonstrated that the loss of Foxl2 in mature ovary cells causes the cells to develop the characteristics of testicular cells .
They say that this is one of the few documented examples of a cell type that is determined in the embryo that can change in an adult organism .
They also conclude that in order to maintain the normal ovary cells throughout adulthood there must be active repression of the Sox9 gene .
If this gene is not repressed then the ovary cells will develop testicular characteristics .
Conclusion
Whether a certain type of precursor cell develops into an ovary cell or a testicular cell is determined in the womb .
This study shows that in order to maintain these ovarian cell characteristics , genes that cause testicular cell development need to continue to be suppressed .
The authors highlight that although mice and humans both have Foxl2 and Sox9 , as well as other genes involved in sex organ determination , how they interact seems very variable and is far from being fully understood .
In addition to these genes , hormones also play a role in determining which genes are active , and this also varies between animal species .
This research furthers our understanding of how genes control the attributes of male and female reproductive cells .
However , it is too early to say whether this research will have direct applications to people with developmental ovarian or testicular abnormalities or people wanting to undergo gender reassignment .
It will , however , undoubtedly be followed by further research into these intriguing biological properties .

The city of Tel Aviv continued its year - long centennial celebration on Wednesday , with the installation of a sweeping carpet of flowers in the city ’s Rabin Square , received as a gift from the city of Brussels .
The half - million flowers used to compose the colourful carpet arrived from Belgium on Wednesday morning , after being held - up in the airport overnight due to aircraft problems and bureaucracy .
Annette Katz works for the mayor ’s office in Brussels , and helps oversee a flower carpet they produce in Belgium every couple of years .
She travelled to Tel Aviv help install the floral display .
“ It was a little complicated , you know , over the rules of bringing flowers .
And first we start with Israeli flowers because – it will be much interesting , but they could n’t have enough flowers at the same time .
They do n’t have enough flowers , and they do n’t have begonias , which is a flower which can stay in the heat for one or two days without water , ” Katz said .
More than a 100 volunteers , under the supervision of a special team of experts from Brussels , helped to place hundreds of thousands of daliah and begonia flowers .
The carpet ’s design is a homage to the history of Tel Aviv and is inspired by the classic tiles and murals found in the homes of the city ’s founders .
“ This design is very special , by an artist by the name of Adi Yekutieli , and it ’s a kind of the old tiles they used to build the old houses of the city of Tel Aviv , ” Tel Aviv ’s mayor Ron Huldai said .
“ I think it ’s a great thing .
The colours are great .
And the motifs of the Middle East – like camels that I see here , Tel Aviv motifs , some other things – it ’s nice .
It ’s special , ” Eyal Cohen , a Tel Aviv resident said .
“ It ’s very beautiful , this flower carpet .
I want to thank very much , to the Brussels municipality , for the present to Tel Aviv for hundredth birthday .
It ’s really beautiful , ” Varda Biran , another Israeli visitor to Rabin Square said .
Tel Aviv municipality ’s website says the city was founded in April 1909 by a group of Jewish residents of the nearby Arab city of Jaffa .
They were tired of their harsh living conditions under Ottoman Turkish rule so sixty families signed up for the new neighbourhood , that was set to be independent of Jaffa city .
The website adds that land was purchased and the plan was to build a wide and green city , unlike the urban density they knew in Jaffa .
The land was divided to 60 plots .
About 2 million people live in the greater Tel Aviv area – about 30 percent of all Israelis .
Of these , 380,000 live in the city of Tel Aviv , which now incorporates the ancient port of Jaffa .
Tel Aviv is largely a secular city and Israel ’s business capital .
The area is home to the Jewish state ’s main international airport and stock exchange , as well as many of its biggest companies .
Also dubbed the “ White City ” , Tel Aviv boasts many 1930s Modernist - style buildings inspired by Germany ’s Bauhaus school and was declared a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO .

LIUYI VILLAGE , YUNNAN PROVINCE --
In a courtyard of her crumbling house , Wu Liuying lifts her favorite pair of shoes from a dusty cardboard box .
Hand - sewn from navy - blue cloth , embroidered with pink flowers , they are no bigger than a small child 's slippers .
But they slip easily over the gnarled shrunken feet of the 90 - year - old Ms. Wu .
From the age of 5 , her feet were bound tightly with cotton strips , warping them .
The four smallest toes folded under the sole , which was squeezed into a high arch , creating a crevasse between the heel and the ball of the foot .
Hers was among the last of countless generations of Chinese women who bound their feet in search of an idealized form of beauty .
Though banned in 1912 after the Qing dynasty fell and the Nationalists established a republic , the practice lingered , especially in remote areas of China .
A 1928 census in rural Shanxi province found that 18 % of women had bound feet ; binding also hung on in Liuyi , in the frontier province of Yunnan .
" When the Nationalists came here we would undo our feet in the daytime , " says Ms. Wu . " Then , in the night , we would bind them again . "
In time the Communist government , which took power in 1949 , succeeded in stigmatizing foot - binding as backward and shameful .
Today , like Ms. Wu's tumbledown house -- where cobwebs cloak the rotted eaves -- the millennium - old custom is slipping into history .
Few of the elderly survivors care to try to explain to their grandchildren how they came to wear such dainty shoes , the agony they endured and what exactly was so sexy about a 10 - centimeter foot that -- being hard to clean -- usually gave off a tangy smell and was prone to decay .
NEW YORK – Who said you ca n’t beat City Hall ?
In the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx , a predominantly Hispanic working - class neighborhood , people are feeling good these days about what they accomplished when they organized against powerful business interests allied with City Hall ’s current occupant , billionaire media mogul Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Bloomberg and the Related Companies , a real estate corporation with nationwide investments , were planning to retrofit the landmark Kingsbridge Armory , no longer in use , with a mammoth shopping mall in one of New York ’s most densely populated and impoverished neighborhoods .
The community needed decent jobs at living wages , not the part - time , minimum wage , no - benefit version of employment for which shopping malls , housing national chain stores , are notorious and which Related , the Bloomberg administration and its defenders insisted was better than nothing at all .
In fact , nothing is better , the community reasoned , because the race - to - the - bottom model meant working more than one job just to be able to pay the rent , and because the volume of trade the developers were hoping to generate would inevitably mean more traffic , more congestion , and more pollution .
If the jobs produced paid only the minimum wage , then instead of prosperity all around , the community agreed , the future would bring more poverty as well .
And as everyone knows , the Bronx has more than enough of that .
But first , some of the history .
The Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance ( KARA ) , a coalition of community residents , churches , and labor unions , led by the Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union ( RWDSU ) , was formed in 2005 , after the Bloomberg administration launched the latest in a series of redevelopment plans for the armory .
KARA struggled for the better part of this year just to get the developer to meet with it to negotiate a binding settlement involving jobs at living wages , preferential hiring for Bronx residents , non-interference in unionization , recreation space for families and other community benefits , under what has come to be known among grassroots organizers as a Community Benefits Agreement ( CBA ) .
The demand by KARA for a living wage of $ 10 per hour with benefits and $ 11.50 per hour without benefits for all workers hired by the developer or any of its retail tenants became the centerpiece of its proposed CBA .
As community residents see it , a living wage agreement means escaping poverty without having to work multiple jobs and without having to double up in order to keep a roof over their heads .
For Related , the living wage was a non-starter .
The developer , in lockstep with the Bloomberg administration , stubbornly refused to discuss the subject .
Related , confident that it had the backing of City Hall , arrogantly refused to talk directly with the community regarding the living wage or any other subject .
So KARA lobbied its elected representatives in the City Council to vote down the proposal , hoping that the threat of a red light would bring Related to the table .
Related hardly budged .
In the end , with the very vocal and steadfast support of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. , the Bronx delegation led by the Working Family Party ’s Anibal Palma , and the rest of the City Council sided with the community in rejecting the armory redevelopment 45 to 1 during a highly publicized City Hall vote on Dec. 14 .
It sided with the community again on Dec. 21 when it voted , this time by 48 to 1 , to override Bloomberg ’s veto .
“ We applaud all our elected officials for taking a stand against powerful developers who want to take public subsidies without giving anything in return , ” was the reaction of Ava Farkas , lead organizer for KARA , to the original vote .
“ The council vote was a victory for community organizing , for democracy , and for the dignity of the people of the Bronx , ” she added .
The vote was , to many observers , a truly game - changing development .
Never before , in the eight years of the corporate - friendly and seemingly invincible Bloomberg administration , had the New York City Council dared to vote “ no ” to a redevelopment proposal bearing Mayor Bloomberg ’s seal of approval .
It was a major defeat not only for the administration , but also for the lopsided , unsustainable economic development that makes millions for corporations with access to public subsidies and tax abatements , but does nothing good for the communities it claims to serve .
Helping to change the balance of power in favor of the City Council that made the reversal possible was the very narrow margin by which Bloomberg was reelected in November despite his having outspent his Democratic / Working Family Party rival , Bill Thompson , by 14 to 1 .
“ It is no longer an acceptable business model to allow billionaire companies to take major tax breaks to do business in our borough while they create little more than part - time , low wage jobs without benefits or much chance for advancement , ” said Diaz regarding the significance of the City Council vote .
“ What we wanted all along was to have the armory developed in such a way that not only the developer and the tenants benefit , but also the people of the Bronx .
What today ’s vote confirms is that we can no longer support any project that only ensures profits for the developer while leaving the people of the Bronx in poverty . ”
“ This is a bittersweet victory , ” said Desiree Pilgrim - Hunter , KARA leader and community resident .
“ We want the armory developed .
Unfortunately , the Bloomberg administration chose to kill the project rather than require the developer to sign a binding Community Benefits Agreement that guaranteed living wages and other benefits for the community .
Our billionaire mayor pulled the plug on the redevelopment to prevent a publically subsidized development from including living wage jobs , the right to join a union , community and recreation space and the exclusion of a big box grocery store .
He believes government has no role in setting mandatory wage requirements .
According to him , there should be no minimum wage law , no child labor law , and no protections for working people .
He is on the wrong side of history . ”
KARA ’s forceful advocacy of the living wage during City Council hearings produced even more dividends .
The arguments garnered such widespread and partisan support for the living wage among the progressive , predominantly Hispanic and African American City Council members that they rushed to introduce living wage legislation during the same week as the Dec. 14 vote .
The bill ’s sponsors , with KARA ’s enthusiastic support , hope to make New York one of over 200 cities across the countries that have now adopted living wage ordinances .
KARA and the working families it represents have put New York ’s real estate developers on notice : our communities reject one - sided , unsustainable economic development by corporate fiat .
Redevelopment projects paid for with our tax dollars must make life better for working families , not worse , for our communities will unite in opposition to them .
RWDSU president and KARA co-convener Stuart Appelbaum summed it up , “ It ’s time for developers to live up to their responsibilities to the community .
New York needs a development strategy that puts people first , and that begins with the developers guaranteeing the rights of workers to a living wage . ”

Boyle 's new album is outselling Rihanna , Lady Gaga and 50 Cent Singer Susan Boyle 's album is number one after it became the best - selling debut in UK chart history .
Boyle , runner - up in ITV's Britain 's Got Talent , has sold 410,000 copies of I Dreamed a Dream , beating the likes of Leona Lewis , Lady GaGa and Rihanna .
Pop mogul Simon Cowell said he was proud of his protege , adding : " She did it her way and made a dream come true . "
The Official UK Singles Chart was topped by Peter Kay 's charity single for the BBC's Children in Need appeal .
The Animated All Star Band , featuring a host of children 's characters from Postman Pat to the Wombles , climbed to the top spot from last week 's number 18 .
The highest new entry was Rihanna 's Russian Roulette at number six .
Boyle also made an appearance in the singles chart , entering at number nine with her Rolling Stones cover Wild Horses .
FASTEST -SELLING ALBUMS OF 2009 1 Susan Boyle - I Dreamed A Dream 2 JLS - JLS 3 Robbie Williams - Reality Killed The Video Star 4 Eminem - Relapse 5 U2 - No Line On The Horizon Source : Official UK Charts Company Boyle , 48 , said the news was " fantastic " .
Her album is also expected to top the charts in the US .
The huge first - week sales have already smashed several records , giving Boyle the fastest - selling album of the year so far , and one of the biggest first week sales for any artist album in chart history .
Cowell said : " In Britain 's Got Talent she opened her mouth and the world fell in love with her , which is why her album has been the fastest selling of any woman making her debut . "
Martin Talbot , of the Official Charts Company , described Boyle 's achievement as " phenomenal " .
BIGGEST FIRST WEEK SALES FOR A DEBUT ALBUM 1 Susan Boyle - I Dreamed A Dream ( 2009 ) 2 Leona Lewis - Spirit ( 2007 ) 3 Arctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am , That 's What I 'm Not ( 2006 ) Source : Official UK Charts Company Sales trends suggest the album is largely being bought by the over - 30s market .
Supermarket chain Tesco , which has sold 100,000 copies , says that just 3 % of its sales were downloads - a method favoured by a younger audience .
By comparison , about 9 % of Tesco 's sales for X Factor winner Alexandra Burke 's debut album were downloads .
High Street retailers HMV indicated that their sales figures showed about one album download for every four CDs sold .
Health fears Boyle , from West Lothian , struggled to handle the worldwide attention she gained after her first audition was watched by millions on television and online .
In June , she was admitted to The Priory clinic after suffering an anxiety attack in the aftermath of the Britain 's Got Talent final , where she lost out to dance troupe Diversity .
She also missed a number of live shows on the Britain 's Got Talent tour after suffering from exhaustion .
Cowell , who judges on Britain 's Got Talent as well as being its creator , admitted that mistakes were made in handling Boyle 's speedy rise to global fame .

Battered sharks get critical listing
Spiny dogfish .
Four commercially valuable shark species have just been recognized as being “ of conservation concern ” under the international Convention on Migratory Species .
The listing applies to northern hemisphere populations of spiny dogfish , a common ingredient of food staple fish and chips , and global populations of Porbeagle shark and both species of mako shark .
Intense debate saw southern hemisphere populations of spiny dogfish excluded from the listing on the agreement that a comprehensive population review will be conducted for the next meeting of the convention .
"
WWF welcomes this listing by the CMS -- the first listing by an international conservation convention of commercially utilized shark species , ” said Dr Susan Lieberman , director of WWF International ’s Species Programme .
“ This shows that the world community now recognizes that sharks are over - fished , declining , and worthy of the kind of conservation concern afforded to other species .
"
The sharks have been listed under Appendix ll of the convention , which supports co-operation between range states on conservation plans for listed species .
For migratory species it focuses attention on the status of the species and can help trigger other regional and international initiatives in fisheries management and trade .
The sharks , which are among the most valued of shark species for both meat and fins , suffer from excessive levels of targeted fishing as well as being bycatch casualties of other fisheries such as purse seining and long - lining for tuna .
The slow growth , late maturity , small litters and long lives of sharks make them vulnerable to over - exploitation .
Porbeagle sharks gather together , making them especially easy targets for fishing – a critical factor in the collapse of their populations in the 1970s and continuing failure to demonstrate any lasting recovery .
Listing of all four species across their entire ranges was proposed but the porbeagle shark and the compromise on spiny dogfish were only agreed after intense negotiation .
WWF has also raised concerns over declining populations of Mediterranean bluefin tuna – subject of a recent International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) decision to continue fishing at well over scientifically recommended levels – as a species of concern before the migratory species convention .

We tried to hide our biases slightly by only allowing one pick per series ( Otherwise , you 'd get a Fables and 100 Bullets gallery , most likely ) , and limited our choices to books that fall squarely into io9's wheelhouse ( Thereby missing such great covers as Ryan Kelly and Brian Wood 's Local , many things from DC's Minx line or Jock 's Losers covers ) , but if you 're still not getting a visual feast from everything below , we advise you to go and see a specialist immediately .
( Covers are in something approaching alphabetical order , and not in order of how much we love them , before anyone wonders . )

WARREN , Mich. , Dec. 22 ( UPI ) --
Police in Michigan said a man with a 5 - inch knife lodged in his chest walked into a restaurant , called 911 , ordered coffee and sat down to wait for paramedics .
Warren police said the 52 - year - old man told the 911 operator he had been stabbed in Warren and walked half a mile to Bray 's Hamburgers in Hazel Park to use the telephone , WDIV - TV , Detroit , reported Tuesday .

Restaurant employees said the man then sat down and ordered a coffee while waiting for the ambulance .
" It was like out of a movie , " said George Mirdita , an employee at the restaurant .
" It kind of freaked us all out here .
Then , the customers realized it and they were all turning their heads in disgust . "
Police said the man , who told officers he was stabbed by a mugger for refusing to hand over money , was treated for his injury and is expected to make a full recovery .
Mainstreaming the Mad Iran Bombers
Today ’s New York Times runs what I believe is its first op - ed explicitly advocating a military campaign against Iran .
Such agitation for war is n’t new — John Bolton and friends have been obsessively demanding such an attack for a long time , adapting the argument for war as the only solution to whatever the current situation may be .
It ’s one thing when the Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , Fox News or other conservative outlets advocate such a war .
You expect that , and discount accordingly ; an op -ed in Fred Hiatt ’s Washington Post demanding war on Iran is like a DC - based blogger complaining about the Redskins … it happens constantly , nobody takes it very seriously and it does n’t accomplish anything .
But the New York Times doing so is a serious step towards mainstreaming the idea , akin to how Ken Pollack and Tom Friedman ’s support for the invasion of Iraq persuaded a lot of centrists and liberals .
It ’s as if we as a country have learned nothing from the Iraq war debate .
Alan Kuperman , the NYT op - ed ’s author , is best known for defending the U.S. non-response to the genocide in Rwanda ( leading the late , lamented Alison Des Forges to accuse him of playing " word games to rationalize the West ’s ignominious failure to halt genocide in Rwanda " ) .
While he has no evident expertise in Iran , he has determined that Iranian domestic politics and a few months of negotiations conclusively prove that negotiations can never work and that there ’s only one way to stop Iran — war .
His argument is like a caricature of such war advocacy , hitting each predictable theme like a sledgehammer .
Does he rule out the alternative policy by default ?
Yes he does !
" peaceful carrots and sticks cannot work . "
Does he reduce the policy options to two extreme positions , one of which is guaranteed to be rejected ?
Yes he does !
" the United States faces a stark choice : military air strikes against Iran ’s nuclear facilities or acquiescence to Iran ’s acquisition of nuclear weapons . "
Does he warn that Saddam , um , Ahmedenejad will give WMD to terrorists ?
Yes , yes he does .
" if Iran acquired a nuclear arsenal , the risks would simply be too great that it could become a neighborhood bully or provide terrorists with the ultimate weapon , an atomic bomb . " ( the " neighborhood bully " is a nice touch . )
Will , pray tell , the smoking gun be in the shape of a mushroom cloud ?
Does he exaggerate the prospects for success ?
Yes , he does .
Well , first he says " As for knocking out its nuclear plants , admittedly , aerial bombing might not work . "
But he quickly moves on from that , since that will not do .
Oddly , his main example of success comes from Iraq , where he claims that the first Gulf war led to the uncovering of the Iraqi nuclear program — not the Osirak raid — which is accurate , but rather completely contradicts his argument .
Does he minimize the risks of military action ?
Yes , he does .
" Yes , Iran could retaliate by aiding America ’s opponents in Iraq and Afghanistan , but it does that anyway . "
Try telling that to U.S. military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan , or to leaders in the Gulf , who are slightly less cavalier with the lives of their people .
Does he suggest that if all else fails regime change would be easy and cheap ?
Yes , dear lord , he does .
" If nothing else , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that the United States military can oust regimes in weeks if it wants to . "
Truly , this was the lesson to be drawn from Iraq and Afghanistan .
I ’m still marveling over how easily we overthrew Saddam and the Taliban and got out of Iraq and Afghanistan more or less costlessly .
That was special .
On the other hand , as Matt Duss helpfully points out , " if we do n’t have an Iran war , how are we supposed to have an awesome Iran surge ? "
Does he accuse those who oppose military action of appeasement ?
Yes , yes , of course he does .
" in the face of failed diplomacy , eschewing force is tantamount to appeasement . "
Why spend so much time on a mediocre , unoriginal op - ed ?
The better question is why the NYT published it .
Advocates of such a military strike have been agitating tirelessly for years to mainstream and normalize an idea once seen as mad , using precisely these arguments so often that their deep weaknesses may not even register anymore .
Opponents of such a military strike — on the grounds that it would not likely stop the nuclear program , would kill lots of innocent Iranians and inflame Iranian public opinion , would destroy Obama ’s hopes to transform America ’s relations with the Islamic world and inflame anti-Americanism back to Bush - era levels , and so on — may not take this seriously enough .
The Obama administration almost certainly does n’t want to make such a wrong - headed move — but , then , there are a lot of things which the Obama administration does n’t want to do but has been forced into by political realities ( Gitmo , the public option , escalation in Afghanistan ) and intentions are n’t enough .
Many people may have assumed that the legacy of Iraq would have raised the bar on such arguments for war , that someone making such all too familiar claims would simply be laughed out of the public square .
The NYT today shows that they are n’t .
I suspect that one of the great foreign policy challenges of 2010 is going to be to push back on this mad campaign for another pointless , counter - productive war for the sake of war .
UPDATE : see also Matt Duss , Heather Hurlburt , Joe Klein , Steve Saideman and Dan Drezner .
This kind of sustained pushback is exactly what is needed to prevent this dangerous idea from being mainstreamed .
Houston 's rare snowfall led to slippery conditions overnight that forced road closures and contributed to several serious accidents , including one that killed a driver and another that injured a Houston police officer .
An officer investigating a minor traffic accident on 610 above the Gulf Freeway sustained injuries from a passing motorist who lost control around 7:30 a.m. , Houston Police Department spokesman Kese Smith said .
That driver , who was not involved in the initial accident , saw the investigation , tapped their brakes and skidded into the patrol car – pinning the officer between his cruiser and the guard rail .
The officer was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital with leg injuries that are not believed to be life - threatening , Smith said .
The officer ’s name is not being released pending notification of family .
He is assigned to the Eastside Patrol Division .
In another incident , a man died overnight in a one - car accident on North Wayside near the North Loop .
Around 11:30 p.m. , a green Cadillac Seville was traveling southbound on North Wayside at a high rate of speed when it struck a curb , crossed a grassy median and continued into other lanes of traffic , Smith said .
The car eventually stopped in a wooded area .
The driver was killed at the scene and his passenger was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital .
KHOU reported several additional accidents and closed roads .
Around 9 p.m. , several cars lost control and slammed into each other late Friday on the elevated part of Studemont over White Oak Bayou near I - 10 .
A pickup headed southbound on I - 45 near Crosstimbers hit a patch of ice and spun out around 10 p.m .
An 18 - wheeler behind the truck could n’t stop and the two collided .
One person was transported to a hospital with minor injuries .
The freeway was shutdown for about an hour for cleanup and sanding .
KHOU is reporting that about 6 a.m. today , a multi-car pileup on a Gulf Freeway overpass at Griggs prompted police to shut down all inbound lanes of I - 45 .
At least one person was killed , but further details were not yet available .
Traffic is being diverted to the feeder road , and inbound traffic quickly backed up .
Officials urged drivers to use caution , especially when navigating bridges and overpasses .
Many flights were delayed Friday because of mandatory de-icing procedures , and more than 100 were canceled .
Emergency officials voiced concerns that melted snow could turn to ice , especially on bridges and overpasses , but few drivers were seen testing the road conditions Friday night .
Even before the snow began falling , work crews already had applied a magnesium - chloride solution to places likely to be trouble spots for freezing .
“ That 's when it 's most effective — we apply it when the roads are dry and give it time to set in , ” said Sanchez .
“ We 're going to monitor it tonight and keep a pretty close eye on our roadways , especially the bridges and overpasses . ”
Sand truck crews from the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation were on standby .
The most pressing concern overnight was patches of difficult - to - detect “ black ice ” forming on the roadways as the temperature dropped , Sanchez said .
“ You do n't always see the black ice and that can be deceptive , ” he said .
“ We just do n't want folks to get overconfident .
The danger is still there . ”
The area 's greatest snow accumulations came about 60 miles southwest of Houston , where the National Weather Service reported 4 inches near Lane City and Boling .
Wharton got 3 inches .
Closer to Houston , Pearland got 2.5 inches of snow .
Officially , George Bush Intercontinental Airport recorded less than half an inch .
Houston 's snowfall this year was unprecedented .
It beat the previous record for earliest snowfall of Dec. 10 , set in 1944 and 2008 , by nearly a week .
It also was the first time accumulating snow has fallen in consecutive years .
Take that , Chicago
For what it 's worth , Houston 's seasonal total of snowfall this winter now exceeds that of Chicago , which has had just a trace so far .
There 's a pretty good chance Houston will not lead that race for long , as the city averages one snowfall about every four years .
To get snow in the Houston area , weather conditions have to be almost perfect : arctic air must arrive at the same time as moisture in the middle and upper levels of the atmosphere .
Usually , the cold , dry air gets to Houston before the atmospheric moisture , which erodes it , or it arrives too late .
This time , a low - pressure system in the mid- to upper - levels reached our area right along with the Arctic air Friday morning .
No blizzards forecast
Looking ahead , meteorologist Fred Schmude of ImpactWeather said he does not expect another freeze tonight .
The forecast shows highs in the upper 40s and lows in the low 40s .
A modest chance of rainfall will return to the forecast Sunday through early next week as temperatures gradually warm .

WASHINGTON 
As diplomats might say of a meeting between rivals that is just short of undiplomatic , President Obama and Congressional Republican leaders had a full and frank discussion at the White House on Wednesday when they met to discuss how to create more jobs .
The 90 - minute session , while described by both sides as cordial over all , was a bit testy at times .
Mr. Obama and the Republicans aired their philosophical differences over whether the government should keep spending money for stimulus measures to spur employers to hire , as Democrats favor and the Republicans oppose .
The meeting came on a day when the House voted to extend $ 31 billion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals , while the Treasury secretary announced an extension of the bailout program for banks , small businesses and troubled mortgage - holders .
According to Republicans ’ reconstruction of the session , Mr. Obama started it .
In opening remarks , they said , the president , who campaigned on a pledge of bipartisanship , suggested that Republicans , by their refusal to work with him , “ seem to be almost rooting against recovery ” and for high unemployment in an effort to make gains against Democrats in the midterm elections next year .
" We are all civilized people , which means that we are all savages at heart but observing a few amenities of civilized behavior . "

WASHINGTON  Government regulators have found high levels of manganese , a dangerous metal that can affect the brain , in the air outside a school in eastern Ohio .
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials cautioned Monday that the results outside LaCroft Elementary in East Liverpool , Ohio , were still preliminary .
Even so , the samples — taken this summer and fall — averaged well above the level that the government considers safe for long - term exposure .
The monitoring is part of a $ 2.25 million EPA effort to examine the air outside 63 schools in 22 states .
The program was launched in response to a USA TODAY investigation that identified hundreds of schools across the nation where the air outside appeared to be rife with toxic industrial chemicals .
FULL COVERAGE : Smokestack Effect : Toxic Air and America 's Schools Long - term exposure to manganese can cause mental and emotional problems .
Manganese often comes from metalworking factories .
The EPA expects to issue more thorough reports in the next two months about what it found outside schools .
" If we find potential health concerns at any schools , our next steps may include additional monitoring , " EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said .
Drawing conclusions about health risks from a small number of samples is ill - advised , he said .
This year , monitoring revealed elevated levels of manganese outside two other schools where the EPA monitored — one in Marietta , Ohio , and another in Vienna , W.Va .
The levels found outside LaCroft Elementary in Ohio were even higher .
In nine samples at LaCroft , officials found levels of manganese that averaged almost double what the EPA considers safe for long - term exposure .
One sample , taken in September , showed levels 12 times higher than that threshold .
The school 's principal , Linda Lindsey , said the school 's 415 students are scheduled to move next year to a different building about 8 miles from the current building .
The EPA also said Monday that it is invalidating the results of some samples taken at 25 other schools .
That 's because regulators discovered mechanical problems with the monitoring equipment .
Tests at 24 sites will be repeated , Gilfillan said .
At the other school , Spain Elementary in Detroit , the EPA plans to evaluate samples taken by Michigan regulators .
At Spain , the EPA samples showed high levels of one chemical , acrolein , which exacerbates asthma .
The state readings were lower than the EPA 's but showed levels that exceeded what the agency considers safe for long - term exposure .

I 'm blown away .
Stunned .
Totally dumbfounded .
And I 've easily rocketed past all of you chumps as the luckiest Reddit Secret Santa .
By far .
The box art alone would 've sufficed as a super bomb present .
After doing a bit of e-spying , PippyROX found out that I drive racecars and drew up some super cool car art and witty phrases .
Inside was three individually wrapped packages and a card .
The card said wait on the card - so I did .
First , I noticed the pack of Bacon Ginger Snaps .
Awesome .
I tried them very quickly - and they 're SUPER BACONY .
I was suspicious at first ; I mean , come on , bacon cookies ?
I 'm not a big cookie guy - BUT THESE ROCK !
They 're greasy .
They 're crunchy .
They 're very , very bacon flavored .
Even CHUNKS of bacon pop out at you with FLAVOR .
As a matter of fact , these are an ALL ACCESS PASS TO FLAVOR TOWN !!
So , I 'm totally psyched .
I did n't think I could handle any more win until I unwrapped the tubular green thing .
Smiling out at me was a happy Chinese woman and some cryptic characters .
Turns out , they 're colored pencils !
Colored pencils , cool .
But NOT JUST ANY COLORED PENCILS .
These are made from newspapers .
CHINESE NEWSPAPERS .
They 're pressed so hard that there 's no difference between these and wood .
Super ultra awesome .
And then , I moved onto the DVD - shaped item .
I thought , " Sure , this will be the gag gift .
This will be a copy of Twilight or something kitchsy . "
No .
Nope .
Not even close .
It 's a new copy of Gears of War 2 .
Not just any copy .
A SIGNED copy .
SIGNED BY THE DEVS !
Pippyrox 's boyfriend went around and got the signatures of the whole dev team in Sharpie .
It 's beyond comprehension .
I do n't have words for it .
So , I 'll close with a simple , " Thank you so much Pippyrox and company .
I simply could n't be happier . "
Oh , and the rest of you got screwed .
Chumps . :D
WASHINGTON – House lawmakers are gearing up for a vote as soon as next week on a bill aimed at forcing a national college - football playoff .
Approval of the legislation by an Energy and Commerce subcommittee would represent the most significant action yet by Congress in its oversight of college football .
The plans for a markup next week – still tentative as of late Friday – appeared to signal growing congressional support for the idea , which President Barack Obama also backed during the 2008 campaign .
For ...
The healthcare reform debate could soon bring many Roman Catholics to a wrenching moral dilemma :
Should they support a bill that expands healthcare to the poor , even if it involves so many uncertainties surrounding access to abortion ?
For months , bishops have made their guidance plain :
If the final bill weakens a ban on public funding for abortion , then Catholics should oppose it .
But they are finding many of their antiabortion adherents willing to embrace what they see as a greater good – improving access to healthcare – even if it undercuts the church ’s stand against abortion .
For Chris Korzen , executive director of Catholics United , a 50,000 - member lay movement that pushes for public policy to reflect Catholic social teachings , Catholics must have open minds :
“ The wrong thing would be for anyone to be so firmly entrenched in their positions on federal funding of abortion that they ’re not willing to come to the table and talk about a compromise . ”
Healthcare reform is a historic opportunity , adds Victoria Kovari , interim president of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good , a 45,000 - member advocacy group informed by Catholic social teachings .
“ We share all the bishops ’ concerns , ” she says .
“ The difference is [ our ] feeling that we would be morally remiss if we walked away from all of healthcare [ reform ] .
We have to take seriously our call to be about what ’s good for the whole human family . ”
Strong support of healthcare reform
During the past decade , Catholics have overwhelmingly supported a government guarantee of healthcare access for all citizens – regardless of cost .
More than 70 percent of US Catholics supported such a guarantee in 2002 and again in 2006 , according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) at Georgetown University in Washington .
Catholic opinions on abortion rights have been more evenly divided .
But opposition to abortion rights has been growing , and certain types of Catholics – such as minorities who struggle to pay for medical services – are likely to be especially conflicted about the tension between healthcare and abortion , says John Green , a political scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio who studies religious dynamics in politics .
The issue is contentious in congressional debates , too .
The question is not whether tax dollars ought to directly fund abortion ; most lawmakers and President Obama agree they should not .
Rather , the question is how to limit public money for insurers who cover abortions while still guaranteeing access to the procedure .
When the House passed its version of a healthcare reform bill in November , it included an amendment that explicitly bans federal funding of abortions through the new insurance exchanges created by the law .
The Senate has also struggled with the abortion issue in its version of the bill , currently under debate .
A similar amendment to restrict abortion funding has been proposed , but is not expected to be a part of the Senate ’s final version of the bill .
According to Catholic social teachings , both access to healthcare and the right to life are basic human rights .
The church requires Catholics to oppose abortion .
But it also compels them to search their consciences for how best to advance the common good – without cooperating with evil – in societies where abortion is legal .
In practice , that means grappling with shades of gray , says Thomas Massaro , a professor of moral theology at Boston College School of Theology and Ministry .
“ It ’s a very difficult struggle , ” he says .
“ There ’s no formula ... for a legislator to vote up or down based on a simple , cookie - cutter determination . ”
Rep. Patrick Kennedy ( D ) of Rhode Island made news last month when he upbraided his bishop for counseling him not to take communion , because Mr. Kennedy has consistently voted for abortion rights .
Kennedy also criticized bishops for threatening to oppose the bill over abortion .
The moral battle lines
But Catholic bishops say it ’s paramount to give no ground on one principle :
No one should be compelled to help pay for anyone else ’s abortion .
“ There ’s leeway in terms of supporting legislation that does good things , but not as much good as we hoped , ” says Richard Doerflinger of the Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
“ There is n’t any leeway on changing the law to promote direct killing more widely ” through abortion .
Other antiabortion Catholics , however , note that governments are not individuals .
Everyone is apt to have moral qualms about something in a trillion - dollar budget , Mr. Massaro says , but that does n’t make taxpayers as morally culpable as , say , individuals who have abortions .
Moreover , the federal government already supports abortions in some ways .
Women are permitted to deduct the cost of an abortion on their tax returns as a healthcare expense , says Mr. Korzen .
As Catholics debate the issue , pragmatic concerns compete with philosophical ones .
Korzen suggests that healthcare reform could actually cut the number of abortions .
If more women had health insurance , he explains , then bringing pregnancies to term would be more affordable and therefore more common .
But defenders of the church ’s position do n’t buy that argument .
The church does n’t take moral positions on utilitarian grounds .
The church urges people to shun evil – even if a measure of good could come from an evil act .
“ There are moral absolutes that we ca n’t get beyond , ” Mr. Doerflinger says .
Al Gore ’s new book had a problem – no big hurricanes since Katrina to put in the book to look “ threatening ” to the USA .
Any imagined link between hurricanes and global warming has evaporated .
Solution : the artists airbrush .
Ryan Maue , hurricane expert from Florida State University writes :
Anthony ,
The cover opens and closes half and half — so you only see one hurricane …as in the press release photo or the one on Amazon .
But this is the real picture sequence from the book which I looked at Borders today and took cell - phone pictures , original ( before the retouching by some “ artist ” )
Note all of the Arctic ice and the size of the Florida Peninsula …
and the final product :
WUWT ?
A midget Southern Hemisphere cyclone is off the coast of Florida , another hurricane is sitting on the equator off the coast of Peru — and the Arctic Ice is gone ( perhaps it is summer ) and the Florida Peninsula is half gone
There are other differences I am sure you can find — but the hurricanes are just nonsense …
Ryan
Here ’s the book cover :
Nonsense ?
No more like scaremongering , especially when it has been shown time and again that there is no hurricane to global warming linkage , and we are at a 30 year low .
Mr. Gore , you are a charlatan .

Nichtraucherschutz-Volksbegehren nimmt Unterschriftenhürde Peter Muehlbauer
Mit fast 1,3 Millionen übersteigt die Zahl der Unterschriften die geforderten 10 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten deutlich
Heute Mittag gab das Bayerische Landesamt für Statistik und Datenverarbeitung bekannt , dass insgesamt 1.298.746
Personen beziehungsweise 13,9 Prozent der wahlberechtigten Bayern für das Volksbegehren zum Nichtraucherschutz unterschrieben .
Das sind deutlich mehr als die geforderten 940.000 Stimmen .
Nun muss das Parlament die Initiative prüfen und sie um - oder eine Volksabstimmung dazu ansetzen .
Der bayerische Innenminister Joachim Herrmann hat bereits mitgeteilt , dass sich die Regierungsmehrheit auf die letztere der beiden Optionen geeinigt hat .
In Bayern sind die Hindernisse für ein Volksbegehren durch den Zwang zur Amtseintragung und die kurze zweiwöchige Frist relativ hoch .
Vor dem Nichtraucherschutz - Volksbegehren hatte zuletzt eines zur Abschaffung des Senats vor 12 Jahren diese Hürden genommen .
Bei dem darauf folgenden Volksentscheid stimmten die Bürger dann mit deutlicher Mehrheit für eine Abschaffung der Ständekammer .
Vor diesem Hintergrund gehen die Nichtraucherschutz - Organisatoren davon aus , dass auch ihre Initiative ein Erfolg an der Urne wird – allerdings könnten sie sich mit dieser Einschätzung täuschen .
Der Erfolg bei den Unterschriften zeigt zwar , dass das Begehren Nichtraucher mobilisieren kann – gleiches dürfte jedoch auch für die Befürworter der bisherigen Regelung gelten , die vor der Landtagswahl im Herbst 2008 ebenfalls bewiesen , dass sie ein durchaus kampagnefähiges Völkchen sind .
Der Ausgang der für Mitte 2010 erwarteten Volksabstimmung steht also alles andere als fest .
Schon während der Abstimmungsfrist hatte die Initiative die Unterschriften auf ihrer Website hochgerechnet .
Allerdings war diese sehr oft nicht erreichbar .
Die Gründe dafür bleiben im Unklaren : Bei der ÖDP in Passau erhielt man die Auskunft , dass das Problem auf DDos - Angriffe auf Russland zurückzuführen sei .
Beim Verein Pro Rauchfrei , auf deren Server die Website vor dem Umzug zu Hetzner untergebracht war , zeigte man sich dagegen der Auffassung , dass die Rückmeldungen der Gemeinden für die Zugriffsprobleme verantwortlich waren .

Chat not working ?
Also an update on music uploads .
( Update 7-02 ) Many of you have been asking me why the java fix that we originally found is not working anymore .
We do not know for 100 % why this is happening , or how to fix it .
We have found a few things that work for some people , from reinstalling java to trying to new browsers .
Unfortunately , we do not have solutions for every person , and again , we do not know why .
We suspect that the chat itself needs an update , though this has not been confirmed by anybody .
We understand the chatroom has been slow lately as well , and this is obviously part of the reason .
I apologize about this , but if the solutions we have found do not work for you , then there is nothing more we can do to help you get into the chatroom .
As for uploads , many of you have been asking why they have n't been happening .
I am VERY sorry about the long wait , but the wait is almost over .
I have been extremely busy moving states , and it 's taken me a lot longer than I would like to admit .
The short story is that the apartment I 'm going to move into is still being renovated , and I 've been living in a place where my computer does not have an internet connection .
This will be remedied here in about a week .
I move into my apartment in less than a week from now , and then as soon as I get an internet connection set up , I will be taking my first day off after that just uploading all day .
I hope to get at least 30 songs out that day , so be ready for that .
Afterwards , uploads will continue at a regular pace .
Please just be a little more patient , and songs will be back soon .
I promise !
Some of you have been asking why I do n't let other people upload songs , and the simple answer is that I do n't own the site .
That is not my choice to make .
If any of you have questions about any of this , or anything at all for that matter , please feel free to
UPDATE : 7/3 is my first day off after getting internet , so I will be keeping my promise and uploading a crap load of songs for you all .
Keep your eyes out all day for them !

- InuyashaUPDATE : 7/3 is my first day off after getting internet , so I will be keeping my promise and uploading a crap load of songs for you all .
Keep your eyes out all day for them !
Uploads every day ?
Let 's hope so .
January 19th , 2014
I have reached the point where I am going to attempt to upload at least one song every single time I visit the website .
What does this mean ?
It means that every time I open the internet , I open up five or six different pages , Gendou being one of them .
Thus when I open Gendou to check my messages , I will also upload AT LEAST one song as well .
The songs chosen will be 100 % random .
I will open a random page , click on a random song , and upload it .
( NOTE :
This is not necessarily true anymore .
I am starting to use the voting system more so now that I 've got back into the groove of things .
Please keep voting for songs you want released ! )
I open the internet multiple times a day on occasion , and will also attempt to upload a song every time I open the internet every day .
This could mean just one song a day , or maybe even six songs a day .
Only the future knows for sure , but expect to see more songs regularly from now on ! -
P.S. I have made a thread in the forums specifically to discuss anything posted on the home page .
Find it
P.P.S.
If no songs are uploaded on any given day , it means I was extremely busy that day and just had no time .
If this happens , I will attempt to make up for it by releasing more than one song .

Update 12/22 December 9th , 2013
Merry Christmas , all !
Or Happy Hanukkah , or Happy Kwanza !
Or whatever you do or do not celebrate , have a good week regardless !
I 'm posting this update to let you all know that there will be no updates to the music this week because I am going on vacation .
To make up for this , I will double the releases to six on the first week of January .
I 've been receiving LOADS of videos you guys want added to the GendouTV stream , and I'm LOVING IT !
Please keep sending them !
My current goal is to reach about 12 hours of content , and right now it 's at 5 1/2 hours .
Just in the past few weeks it 's risen about an hour , so we 're doing well !
I 'm making it a point to respond to every message now , just so you all know , so please message me if you have any questions or recommendations about the site and the stream .
Update 12/10 November 1st , 2013
Hello !
It 's time to start downloading !
To start things off , Gendou himself uploaded about twenty songs just before December , and now that December has started , I will be uploading three songs every week .
This may increase to four in the future , but for now we 'll see how things go with three weekly .
If you have any suggestions regarding this , please keep them to yourself .
The three songs I pick to upload will be chosen at random , but they will for certain not be " new " songs .
The songs I pick will at least be past page 5 ( for now ) on the request list .
This is so that I can catch up with last season and start getting more into this season which is just ending .
By doing this , I will easily be able to keep up after just a few months without stressing out the release page and your download limits .
Regarding GendouTV , thank you all for the many requests you guys have made !
I have recieved on average about one request per day , and I 'm absolutely loving it !
Please keep requesting more videos !
You can find the request form inside of the GendouTV page itself , or you can scroll down two posts and click the link in Update 8/29 .
The more requests you guys make , the longer and more variant the stream can become .

Update 11/1 August 29th , 2013
Hey everyone !
Hope you had a great Halloween !
I am posting to clear a few things up .
I have been receiving a lot of questions regarding music update schedule and also requests to put titles up on the livestream .
Let me answer these as simple as possible for you all .
1. Music updates will be updated weekly starting the beginning of December .
Please be patient .
We are all very busy and have things to get finished in our own lives .
We do not make money off this site , so we have jobs and bills to keep up on as well .
We can not always come here to update music .
It 's not as easy as some of you may think , and sometimes it can take a while to upload a song properly .
2 . We can not put titles of any of the songs playing in the livestream at any time .
Livestream has no option for us to be able to do that , so please stop asking about it .
Believe me , I would certainly like to have titles up if possible , but right now we just can't do that because of the capabilities of livestream .
The only way is to either search on your own or ask the chat .
You do not need to create a livestream account in order to chat in the livestream chat .
Just click the area and create a nickname , and you 're good to go .
The more people that talk in there , the more answers we can all have .
All in all , just keep the community active .
It 's you guys , the users that keep everything active and make everything possible for this site .

* it 's snowing * man : oh .
hello snow man : i really thought we had something special last year man : but then you just stopped coming to see me ... man : i hope you do n't expect things to go back to normal after me not hearing from you for the past eight months * later * man : oh snow !
i just can't stay mad at you !
* man is sticking his tongue out and catching snow on his tongue * man passing by : get a room
Assuming no bugs in the code or anything done " fancy " , is the following code Perl ?
$ cssClass = " " ; if ( $ element -> isOpen ( ) ) { $ cssClass = ' class= " selected " ' ; } if ( ! $element->isHiddenInNavigation ( ) ) { $ filepath = $ element -> getId ( ) .
" .html " ; if ( substr ( $ element -> getFilePath ( ) , 0 , 4 ) == ' http ' ) { $ filepath = $ element -> getFilePath ( ) ; } $ result .= ' < li ' .
$ cssClass . '> < a href= " ' .
$ filepath . ' " >' . $ element -> getLabel ( ) . '</a>' . $ this -> generate ( $ element -> getChildren ( ) ) . '</li >'; }
Look at that code carefully .
Really carefully .
If we assume it does not have bugs , then we know this is probably not Perl ( I 'm not telling you the giveaway in case it takes you a while to see it ) .
That language is PHP , yet clearly the sigils have n't killed PHP .
Due to PHP 's extremely arbitrary case and argument ordering conventions , it seems to require more memorization than Perl does , thus suggesting that for two cleanly written pieces of code , the PHP might actually be harder to understand than Perl .
So why have they cleaned Perl 's clock in the Web space ?
I think there are two reasons .
First , when Perl hit it big in the late 90s , we were the easiest way to get CGI code up and running fast .
PHP clearly wins in this area now .
Second , let 's take a look at some more PHP , something which makes the distinction much clearer :
public function setHiddenInNavigation ( $hideInNavigation ) { return $ this -> hideInNavigation = $ hideInNavigation ; }
Can you do that in core Perl ?
No , you can 't .
It 's an embarrassment .
We 're harder to use for the uses many ( most ? ) people want and our language is so primitive in one of the most fundamental ways that we sort of deserve some of the harshness we get .
Moose ( and maybe MooseX : : Declare ) needs to be in the core , or at least something along those lines .
ALBANY , New York ( AP )  New York lawmakers rejected a bill Wednesday that would have made their state the sixth to allow gay marriage , disheartening advocates already stung by a similar decision by Maine voters just last month .
The New York measure failed by a wider - than - expected margin , falling 12 votes short in a 24 - 38 decision by the state Senate .
The Assembly had earlier approved the bill , and Gov. David Paterson , perhaps the bill 's strongest advocate , had pledged to sign it .
D.C. GAY MARRIAGE : Archbishop wields charity services in fight against it New York also does n't allow civil unions , but has several laws , executive orders and court decisions that grant many of the rights to gays long enjoyed by married couples .
The vote comes after months of delays and arm twisting of lawmakers sympathetic to the bill but representing conservative districts .
It also follows a referendum in Maine that struck down a gay marriage law before it took effect .
Immediately after the vote , gay rights advocates chanted : " Equal rights now ! "
Many said they were n't surprised by the decision .
Most , including Paterson , said they at least wanted a floor debate and vote .
Senate sponsor Thomas Duane , a Manhattan Democrat and the Legislature 's first openly gay member , vowed not to give up his life 's goal .
" I 'm like a dog with a bone , " said Duane in his closing remarks on the floor , when defeat was becoming clear .
" I would n't let go of anyone ...
Because I do n't give up .
I do n't know how to ! "
Gay marriage is legal in Connecticut , Iowa , Massachusetts and Vermont .
A New Hampshire law takes effect Jan. 1 . " It 's certainly disappointing , " said Richard Socarides , a 55 - year - old Manhattan lawyer and resident and former President Bill Clinton 's senior adviser on gay rights issues .
" I 'm surprised that it was not closer .
We 'll have to take a hard look at what went wrong . "
Sen. Eric Adams , D - Brooklyn , challenged lawmakers to set aside their personal religious beliefs .
He asked them to remember that once even slavery was legal .
" When I walk through these doors , my Bible stays out , " Adams said .
" That 's the wrong statement , " said gay marriage opponent Sen. Ruben Diaz , a conservative minister from the Bronx .
" You should carry your Bible all the time . "
Diaz was the only opponent among the 38 to speak .
Eighteen senators gave impassioned speeches , often about family members who survived the Holocaust and discrimination and would want gays to be equal under law .

IN THE 12 months since Israel 's devastating assault on Gaza in Operation Cast Lead , conditions in the Strip " remain wretched " , to use Amnesty International 's phrase .
The Israeli economic siege has remained in place since Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections and enforced its rule within Gaza .
Almost no work has been done to repair an estimated $ 1bn worth of damage because of restrictions on the import of building materials .
Indeed , since the end of the conflict in January , only 41 truckloads of building materials have entered Gaza when thousands are needed .
The economy is dependent on the Hamas - regulated warren of tunnels on the southern border with Egypt .
For Israel itself , the consequences of its war on Gaza have been more difficult to assess .
Rocket fire by the Palestinian factions has finally been halted , but the cost to Israel of a war that claimed almost 1,400 Gazan lives has been serious .
The use of white phosphorous against civilian targets , as well as other suspected breaches of humanitarian law , have corroded the country 's moral standing even among its most robust supporters .
Israeli politicians and officials have been forced to confront the fact that they risk arrest in a number of countries including , for now at least , the United Kingdom .
The impact on Israel has been pernicious in another way .
The principle of deterrence has been crucial for its defence .
So its failure to dislodge Hamas from Gaza , coming so close after the disaster of its adventure in Lebanon in 2006 , has seen its military diminished .
But the assault on Gaza had other consequences that it is , perhaps , easy to forget .
The conflict was conducted in the febrile conditions of an Israeli general election which saw all main parties aggressively endorsing the war .
It returned Binyamin Netanyahu as prime minister in a coalition that has included Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister , a man notable for demanding Israeli Arabs swear an oath of loyalty or face expulsion .
Unsurprisingly a peace process , already moribund , has faltered further .
Netanyahu has carefully managed a new style designed to derail US demands for a freeze to further settlement in the West Bank by offering the most partial of freezes , in the knowledge it cannot possibly be acceptable to the Palestinian leadership .
If Netanyahu has succeeded in this policy thus far it is because he has been allowed to by an American president who promised so much in his Cairo speech and yet has delivered so little .
While it is fair to say Barack Obama has been preoccupied with other issues , it is a truism in Israeli - Palestinian negotiations that no movement has ever been achieved without the full , vigorous engagement of the US president .
So what we have is an increasingly dangerous stasis in which all issues , save for the stop - start negotiations for prisoner exchange , are on hold .
Palestinian national reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah , the West Bank and Gaza , has made little headway ; Israeli - Palestinian talks are on hold ; the economic stranglehold of Gaza goes on .
All largely ignored by the international community .
The peril of this lack of movement has been starkly visible in the last week , as Israel yesterday shot dead six Palestinians in two separate incidents in the West Bank .
What is required , if there is to be any movement , is an urgent new sense of commitment that must begin in Washington .
But equally , there needs to be moves to relieve the plight of Gaza 's 1.5 million residents .
They must be allowed access to markets so that they can rebuild , and at least makes some attempt towards lives of dignity .
Moreover , stasis suits Hamas , its enemy a sense of opportunity and purpose among those it governs .
It is not good enough for the world to ignore this problem while a new generation grows up frustrated and alienated in what is effectively an enormous prison .
That is no solution , merely tragedy deferred .
Violence will follow .
Washington , D.C. -- Scientists at the Carnegie Institution have found for the first time that high pressure can be used to make a unique hydrogen - storage material .
The discovery paves the way for an entirely new way to approach the hydrogen - storage problem .
The researchers found that the normally unreactive , noble gas xenon combines with molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) under pressure to form a previously unknown solid with unusual bonding chemistry .
The experiments are the first time these elements have been combined to form a stable compound .
The discovery debuts a new family of materials , which could boost new hydrogen technologies .
The paper is published in the November 22 , 2009 , advanced online publication of Nature Chemistry .
Xenon has some intriguing properties , including its use as an anesthesia , its ability to preserve biological tissues , and its employment in lighting .
Xenon is a noble gas , which means that it does not typically react with other elements .
As lead author Maddury Somayazulu , research scientist at Carnegie 's Geophysical Laboratory , explained : " Elements change their configuration when placed under pressure , sort of like passengers readjusting themselves as the elevator becomes full .
We subjected a series of gas mixtures of xenon in combination with hydrogen to high pressures in a diamond anvil cell .
At about 41,000 times the pressure at sea level ( 1 atmosphere ) , the atoms became arranged in a lattice structure dominated by hydrogen , but interspersed with layers of loosely bonded xenon pairs .
When we increased pressure , like tuning a radio , the distances between the xenon pairs changed - the distances contracted to those observed in dense metallic xenon . "
The researchers imaged the compound at varying pressures using X - ray diffraction , infrared and Raman spectroscopy .
When they looked at the xenon part of the structure , they realized that the interaction of xenon with the surrounding hydrogen was responsible for the unusual stability and the continuous change in xenon - xenon distances as pressure was adjusted from 41,000 to 255,000 atmospheres .
Why was the compound so stable ?
" We were taken off guard by both the structure and stability of this material , " said Przemek Dera , the lead crystallographer who looked at the changes in electron density at different pressures using single - crystal diffraction .
As electron density from the xenon atoms spreads towards the surrounding hydrogen molecules , it seems to stabilize the compound and the xenon pairs .
" Xenon is too heavy and expensive to be practical for use in hydrogen - storage applications , " remarked Somayazulu .
" But by understanding how it works in this situation , researchers can come up with lighter substitutes . "
" It 's very exciting to come up with new hydrogen - rich compounds , not just for our interest in simple molecular systems , but because such discoveries can be the foundation for important new technologies , " commented Russell Hemley , director of the Geophysical Laboratory and a co-author .
" This hydrogen - rich solid represents a new pathway to forming novel hydrogen storage compounds and the new pressure - induced chemistry opens the possibility of synthesizing new energetic materials . "

Drug users are well informed about the harms associated with the drugs they use , and perceive alcohol and tobacco to be amongst the most dangerous substances , according to a survey by UCL ( University College London ) and Imperial College London researchers .
The findings , published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology , suggest that the current system of classifying psychoactive drugs in the UK may need to be revisited .
The study , led by Dr Celia Morgan and Professor Valerie Curran at UCL , surveyed 1,500 UK drug users via the website www.nationaldrugsurvey.org.
Drug users were asked to rate twenty psychoactive substances on a ' rational ' scale previously developed by Professor David Nutt , Imperial College London , who collaborated on this study .
Heroin , crack and cocaine topped the list in terms of harm , but alcohol was rated fifth , solvents seventh and tobacco ninth .
Ecstasy came 13th in the harm rating , LSD 16th and cannabis 18th .
Thus , the survey found no relationship between the drug 's legal status , based on the current classification system , and users ' ratings of harm .
In the UK , the Misuse of Drugs Act ( 1971 ) currently classifies psychoactive drugs as A , B or C , though alcohol and tobacco remain unclassified .
Dr Celia Morgan , UCL Clinical Psychopharmacology
Unit , says : " Given that the Misuse of Drugs Act aims to signal to young people the harmfulness of drugs , this suggests a flaw with the current classification of drugs .
We found that drug users rated legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco as more harmful than Class A substances like LSD and ecstasy .
We found a high correlation between harm ratings by users and those made previously by scientific experts across all substances , suggesting users are well informed about the harms of drugs .
" The reported prevalence of use of each substance also suggests that the classification of drugs has little bearing on the choice of whether to use substances or not .
For example ecstasy , a Class A substance , was the fourth most regularly used psychoactive drug , according to our survey .
" We also asked drug users about their perceived benefits of taking psychoactive substances , as this is clearly important in a person 's decision of whether to take a drug or not .
Psychoactive substances LSD , cannabis and ecstasy were consistently rated as having the highest short and long - term benefits .
These findings add to the debate on the validity of the current classification of drugs in the UK .
" Worldwide , there are an estimated two billion alcohol users , 1.3 billion smokers and 185 million users of other drugs .
Despite public health campaigns , levels of substance misuse continue to rise .
One of the reasons for this may be the public 's confusion about the actual risks of different drugs as they often receive conflicting messages from the legal system , the media and health campaigns .
We recommend that future health campaigns consider whether to include the benefits of some drugs .
By only citing harms , such campaigns likely represent - from a user 's perspective - an unbalanced view and may mean that the overall message is more likely to be ignored . "
The authors are following up the study with the launch of a new larger survey , in collaboration with the Beckley Foundation , hosted at internationaldrugsurvey.org .
The 20 substances surveyed in the 2009 study were alcohol , alkyl nitrates , amphetamines , anabolic steroids , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , buprenorphine , cannabis , cocaine , crack , ecstasy , GHB , heroin , LSD , ketamine , khat , 4 - MTA , methylphenidate , solvents , street methadone and tobacco .
Participants were asked to rate them according to physical ( acute or chronic ) harm , psychological or physical dependence , intensity of pleasure , intoxication and social effects , including costs to the health service .
A similar survey of experts including psychiatrists and pharmacologists led by Professor Nutt in 2007 found that , of the same 20 psychoactive substances rated on a ' rational ' scale , experts rated alcohol as the fifth most dangerous drug , whereas MDMA / ecstasy was rated 18th out of twenty , despite its Class A status .
Overall , there was no relationship between a drug 's legal status and its rated harmfulness .
The 2007 study was published in the Lancet .

As the great Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement would say :
0 , 001 , 001 !
Come on sucker , lick my battery !
We 're no experts on translating binary rock 'n roll into modern day English ( or Russian , for that matter ) , but we 're guessing that the boys from New Zealand would most certainly approve of a guitar pick crafted from recycled motherboards .
Etsy member The BlueKraken seems capable of churning these guys ( and many other wares ) out in almost any hue of PCB , and at just $ 7 or $ 8 apiece , they 're hardly a rip off .
In fact , we 'd wager that these are pretty much the most awesome stocking stuffers of all time .
Boogie , boogie , boogie , robo boogie , all after the break .
Congressman David Obey , a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee , has come up with a novel idea : American should pay for the wars they are waging .
Obey ’s proposal , which is backed by ten other congressmen , sounds startling — until one realises that both the Bush and Obama administrations have never properly financed their foreign wars by forcing Americans to pay for them through higher taxes .
Instead , Washington has deferred the $ 1 trillion to date costs of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars by simply adding them to the national debt , and paying interest on the balance owing .
So very few Americans feel the real financial costs of these wars .
Future generations will get stuck with the bill .
But this kind of deceptive national accounting is becoming increasingly difficult in the face of President Barack Obama ’s $ 1.4 trillion deficit this year , and his impending decision to send 30,000 to 40,000 more US troops to Afghanistan .
Each American soldier in Afghanistan costs $ 1 million per annum , according to the US Congress Research Service .
Thirty or forty thousand more US troops will thus cost $ 30 to $ 40 billion in additional war costs on top of the $ 200 billion annual cost of garrisoning Iraq and Afghanistan .
Much of this money will have to be borrowed from China and Japan .
Obey and his allies want to impose a graduated surtax on Americans of 1 - 5 per cent , depending on their income level , to fund the actual costs of what are now Obama ’s wars .
Otherwise , warns
Obey , the huge cost of keeping up to 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan will ‘ destroy the other things we are trying to do in our economy .
’Chief among which is health care .
In a clear choice between guns or butter , Obey estimates ten years of war in Afghanistan will cost the same $ 900 million as providing a comprehensive health plan for all Americans .
Unfortunately , chances of a war surtax passing Congress are nil .
While the Afghan and Iraq wars are increasingly unpopular among Americans , a tax increase at a time of over 10 per cent unemployment will ignite the same kind of furious reaction that met President Obama ’s proposed national health plan , and endangerDemocrats facing midterm elections .
As the Obama administration appears set to plunge deeper into the Afghan morass , the real costs of Afghanistan and Iraq are still being concealed from the public and Congress .
The $ 200 billion annual cost for both wars is only a part of the growing expenses faced by Washington .
The annual bill for US intelligence , which employs over 200,000 people , has doubled to $ 75 billion , in large part to support foreign wars and operations against anti-US Muslim groups .
Costs of occupying Afghanistan rose to $ 300 billion this year , and will increase sharply next year .
Operations in Iraq will cost $ 684 billion in 2009 .
Washington spends $ 25 billionfunding foreign armies , the bulk of which goes to the Mideast , Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan .
Aid to Islamabad will rise to $ 15 billion over the next five years , including secret ‘ black ’ payments .
The US supports 168,000 ‘ contractors ’ in Iraq , many of them gunmen .
CIA runs 74,000 mercenaries in Afghanistan .
The new fortified , 50 hectare US Embassy in Baghdad will cost $ 700 million ; the new embassy in Islamabad , $ 800 billion .
Islamic militants call them ‘ crusader castles . ’
Add to these costs the expense of maintaining fleets in the Gulf and Indian Ocean , and military bases in the Gulf and Diego Garcia to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan ; hugely expensive military airlift ; $ 100 per liter fuel delivered to US forces in Afghanistan ; and , of course , financial inducements to many smaller nations to send handfuls of troops to Afghanistan and Iraq .
Thus the real cost of Afghanistan and Iraq is much higher than $ 200 billion annually .
Yet President Obama , heedless of such costs , appears determined to expand the Afghan War .
It seems clear that ‘ peace candidate ’ Obama has fallen increasingly under the influence of America ’s powerful military - industrial - financial complex andneoconservative ideologues .
In short , the same calculus of forces that guided the Bush administration !
Even America ’s mighty economy cannot for long support waging wars across the Muslim world .
Unaffordable wars have been the ruin of many an empire , and the American Raj seems headed in the same direction .
Eric Margolis is a veteran US journalist who reported from the Middle East and Asia for nearly two decades
Earlier this week we wrote in a research note :
" The market flutter caused by the unilateral debt moratorium by Dubai suggests to us is that the illusion of stability created by the Federal Reserve Board over the past year is starting to dissipate .
Specifically , there are many Dubai type situations in the global markets , both sovereigns and corporates , that are over - extended and are unable to service their debts at par .
The corporates will end up in restructuring but the sovereigns are an open question . "
" We would not be surprised to see more sovereign debtors make unilateral announcement of debt moratoriums and / or restructurings , perhaps including even oil rich Venezuela .
We notice in that regard that Venezuela ’s lider maximo , Hugo Chavez , is preparing to nationalize the few remaining private banks of that nation , usually a good indicator of an approaching sovereign default . "
I have been following VE , both as a journalist and professionally , for many years .
While Chavez does have a reasonably tight grip on the security situation , c/o his Cuban trained praetorian guard , the economy is a mess , even with plentiful oil .
Indeed , not only has Chavez managed to wreck the state oil company so that VE barely meets half of its OPEC production quota , but inflation is running wild .
The Chavistas thought that oil prices would stay near the highs of the past two years , a dream that they share with the rulers of Dubai it seems .
But with oil below $ 100 and the political opposition in VE starting to get organized , it may be time for Chavez to go for the whole ball game , nationalize the banks and take control over the rest of the economy that the government does not already control .
Keep an eye on VE as the next soveriegn flash point .
As the WSJ reported today : " Upping the ante significantly , Chavez said he would not hesitate to intervene in the country 's whole banking system .
" You can be sure that if I need to intervene in all the banking system , I will do it , " the self - declared socialist revolutionary said in a televised address Wednesday . "
Chris
( CNN ) -- James Gordon
Meek was standing over the gravestone of a friend killed in Iraq when he noticed a familiar figure walking near him .
President Obama was walking through what 's called " the saddest acre in America , " Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia .
The section is the burial ground for U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Obama hugged graveside visitors , shook hands and listened to mourners while a " bone - chilling drizzle " fell , Meek says .
As he watched Obama , Meek says he saw his commander in chief take on a new role : the consoler in chief .
" He absolutely seemed sincere , " Meek says about Obama and his Veterans Day visit to Arlington .
" What I sensed is that this was a man who is carrying the full weight of command .
He gets it . "
Obama must now convince the rest of America that he gets this sacrifice .
As Obama announces 30,000 more troops for Afghanistan , he also is preparing to fight another battle on the home front , some say .
He must learn how to command and console at the same time .
It 's a challenge every war president from Abraham Lincoln to George W. Bush has faced -- some better than others , historians say .
A president must project confidence and resolve .
But he must also project empathy without appearing weak or politically calculating .
The father of a fallen soldier whose Arlington grave site Obama recently visited says the president got the balance right .
David H. Sharrett Sr. is the father of David H. Sharrett II , a U.S. Army soldier who was killed last year in Iraq .
He says he was touched by Obama 's visit to his son's grave site because it did n't seem planned .
Obama had been at Arlington that day to lay a wreath but apparently detoured from his schedule to talk to graveside mourners .
" So often we 're looking for unscripted moments from our leaders that really give us a glimpse into who they really are , " Sharrett says .
" I wish every parent who experienced my sacrifice had that kind of moment . "
Roles of Lincoln , Reagan cited as ' griever in chief '
In the days ahead , Obama must master those moments to sustain support for the war in Afghanistan , says Jerald Podair , a history professor at Lawrence University in Appleton , Wisconsin .
Podair says Lincoln did this during the Civil War when he wrote a tender letter to the widow Lydia Bixby , who had lost five sons in battle .
( During his recent speech on Afghanistan , Obama said that he had to sign letters personally to every fallen soldier 's family . )
President Reagan was also at his empathetic best when he honored the victims of the space shuttle Challenger disaster with a tender , poetic speech , Podair says .
" Grief is the one part of a president 's job that can not be spun .
It must be personal and come from the heart , " Podair says .
Yet the cool and cerebral Obama is not known for opening his heart , Podair says .
" The griever in chief must articulate an uncompromising commitment to the cause for which so much was sacrificed , " Podair says .
" Can Obama do this for soldiers who die in an Afghanistan war to which his commitment is clearly lukewarm ?
This may be a bigger challenge than heath care for a president more comfortable with intellect than emotion . "
It 's a challenge that Obama can meet though if he learns from previous presidents , presidential scholars say .
Michael Wagner , a political science professor at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , pointed to one of the signature moments from George W. Bush 's presidency .
Many Americans still remember Bush standing at the rubble of the World Trade Center with a megaphone after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
He vowed to go after the people who attacked his country and sent a message to grieving Americans .
" He was n't just mourning ; he was outlining his plan to respond to the attack when he said that the U.S. would be coming after those that attacked the World Trade Center , " Wagner says .
Should Obama publicly salute soldiers ' coffins ?
How Obama displays his public grief is a more delicate matter , Wagner says .
Obama recently visited Dover Air Force Base in Delaware in the predawn darkness to salute the coffins of soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
Under his predecessor , no coffins of fallen soldiers were photographed .
Obama was criticized for trying to score political points off his Dover and Arlington visits .
But Wagner says Obama handled both occasions with the right tone because he refused to make a major speech or take reporters ' questions .
" Silently honoring the fallen and greeting mourners at Arlington are smart strategies , " Wagner says .
" But using , say , a day where 10 soldiers die as a backdrop to make a speech about a new direction in war policy is usually a bad strategy . "
If Obama bungles a public occasion for mourning , he can permanently damage his ability to lead , some historians say .
President George H.W. Bush was joking with reporters during a televised press conference in 1989 when several news stations decided to show a split - screen image of the coffins of U.S. soldiers recently killed in Panama being taken off military planes , says Gary Woodward , a professor of communication studies at The College of New Jersey .
The elder Bush had no control over the broadcast decision , but the damage was done , says Woodward , who later wrote about the incident in an essay .
It reinforced the perception that Bush was out of touch with ordinary Americans , something that would haunt him during his re-election campaign , he says .
" Bush asked that the networks be more careful , " Woodward says .
" He said , " I could understand why the viewers were concerned about this .
They thought their president , at a solemn moment like that , did n't give a damn . ' "
How other war presidents bungled their public roles
Other war presidents have misplayed their role as consoler in chief because they seemed to grieve too much , one historian says .
President Lyndon Johnson wrestled so much with the Vietnam War that some of his closest aides wondered if he needed psychiatric help , says Robert Dallek , a presidential historian .
" If a president comes across as breaking down or becoming so emotional by these [ war ] losses , people lose confidence in his ability to lead the country , " Dallek says .
The president who mastered the art of command and consolation was Lincoln , Dallek says .
Lincoln 's masterful speeches showed Americans why he was determined to win the Civil War .
But the way he visibly aged in a few short years showed Americans that he felt their pain , Dallek says .
" He could communicate his sadness and his sense of loss over the terrible suffering that went on , " Dallek says .
" But he was also able to show at the same time that he was very determined to win the war .
It was a combination of humanity and resolve . "
Meek , the visitor to Arlington cemetery , says he saw some of the same qualities in Obama .
After Obama visited mourners that day , he spun away from his motorcade and approached Meek with an extended hand .
Meek was there to visit the grave site of David H. Sharrett II , the soldier who died last year in Iraq .
Meek , a correspondent covering national security for the New York Daily News , says he was so moved by his conversation with Obama that he wrote a column about this exchange .
( Obama did n't know who he was , Meek says . )
The reaction was massive .
He received about 900 e-mails , most of them positive , Meek says .
" I heard a lot from people who said I do n't like Obama 's politics and I'm a Republican , but I have no doubt that he really cares about our men and women in uniform , " Meek says .
David H. Sharrett Sr. , the father of the fallen soldier at Arlington , shares the same sentiments .
He says he once met the younger Bush at a private White House ceremony and both choked up as he talked about his son .
After reading Meek 's column , Sharrett says he is convinced that Obama , too , feels the weight of his war decisions .
Sharrett , a retired high school teacher who taught Shakespeare , says he thought about a character from Macbeth when he read about Obama 's visit .
The character , lamenting the loss of a friend , says it was right for him to show " manly grief . "
And it 's right for Obama to show the same kind of grief , even if he is the president , Sharrett says .
" There is such a thing as manly grief , " Sharrett says .
" I do n't see it as a weakness .
I see it as an enormous strength . "
If you played video games in the nineties , you played Mortal Kombat .
It did n’t matter if you actually liked it or not because , well , goddamn :
That ’s the kind of violence that turns a seven year - old child to Satanism and it ’s awesome .
Can Mario freeze another human being alive before tearing their torso in two ?
Of course not , because Mario is a tremendous puss .
Eventually Mortal Kombat spawned a movie which is fondly remembered for having only one redeeming quality : Sonya Blade committing the act of murder with just her thighs .
Sadly , Mortal Kombat and its sequel would go down in history as being terrible films .
However , they could have been much , much worse , as evidenced by the Mortal Kombat Live Tour , a stage show devised to advertise the first film .
The tour managed to bring everything we loved about Mortal Kombat to the stage , sans the blood - lust , decapitations , fire balls , inexplicably strong uppercuts , laser eyes or anything else that would have made it even remotely interesting .
The segment starts off strong enough ; Sub -Zero and Kabal are combating ( kombating ? ) one another while techno blares through the sound system .
True enough to the source material .
It ’s sort of odd that Sub - Zero never actually freezes his opponent but you ’d have to be pretty unreasonable to expect amateur martial artists to practice sorcery in their down time .
After a few more seconds of no one landing hits the whole thing ends with a war dance and a draw before Shang Tsung steps forward , sporting what can only be assumed to be a bad wig or less - than super cut .
After introducing the cast the newscaster asks the most obvious question you can pose to a grown man pretending to be a Chinese wizard : what can children learn from this ?
This is the first real clue that maybe these people are n’t entirely sure what they are doing or why .
When the subject of Mortal Kombat ’s violence comes up Shang Tsung does everything he can to talk himself right out of a job .
According to him , Mortal Kombat is full of positive messages for kids , helping them differentiate between “ violence ” and martial arts .
Somehow the art of bloodsport helps children obtain their goals and overcome any situation that may come up in their daily lives .
To illustrate this point , here ’s an example of how Goro goes about solving his day - to - day problems :
Okay , so Shang Tsung is a terrible liar .
Rather than punch the newscaster in the throat and haul ass out of there , he continues the painful charade , allowing it to accumulate into the most clumsy fifteen seconds of sexual harassment basic cable has ever known .
Sonya
Blade steps forward for another demonstration but before she can even speak the newscaster feels the need to comment on her stomach as though it were a common point of casual conversation .
“ That is the ultimate six pack of a stomach ! ” he opines , “ That ’s like an eight pack ! ” Sonya smiles , but if you watch closely enough you can actually see her rethinking every career decision she ’s ever made up to that very moment .
The demonstration goes on without any trouble or pending restraining orders .
Shang Tsung babbles on about codes in Mortal Kombat 3 and the station cuts to commercial , but not before the newscaster attempts to kill Sonya with what would appear to be jazz - hands .
The promo ends far too soon and we ’re left only to speculate what could have been .
Could Mortal Kombat have been more terrible than it already was ?
We like to think “ yes , very yes , ” and we ’re pretty sure that wigged Shand Tsung would agree with us if he were n’t silently sobbing a Stuckys restroom right now .
It just goes to show you that no matter how bad an actor ’s performance may be or how poorly a script may have been written , there will always be a group of people clad in fake armor and spandex whose mere presence can make it seem like “ Citizen Kane ” in comparison .
Q&A with Vigil Games on Darksiders
by Brian Bentley [ Thursday , 10th of December 2009 - 02:50 PM ]
designer of the game at Vigil , took a few moments to answer some of the burning questions surrounding the game .
Then , he answered my questions , too .
Darksiders is receiving a lot of comparisons to God of War and Legend of Zelda ; do you look at these as compliments or insults to what you are trying to accomplish ?
Haydn Dalton :
They ’re two great titles , so for people to see us in the same light as they 're seen is obviously a very high compliment indeed , especially with our being a new studio .
We do need to point out , though , that even though people may see God of War or even Devil May Cry , the game plays very differently , and we ca n’t stress this enough .
The exploration and role - playing elements in Darksiders give a greater feeling of variety than a pure combat - driven game .
Aggrogamer :
What technical achievements are you most proud of in developing Darksiders ?
Haydn Dalton :
There are a few technical achievements we ’re quite proud of .
One is that we seamlessly load the entire world , so the only load screen you ’ll see is when you load up your game file .
We wanted to make sure that the player experience was n’t ever broken while moving through the open environments .
The second achievement would be Ruin [ War 's horse -- ed. ] : the fact that you can summon / banish it at will and switching easily between on - foot and riding .
We think players will love this feeling of empowerment and flexibility .
The Gear Items , I do n’t want to go through all of them , but they all had lots of technical hurdles and gameplay problems we had to solve , and one of the biggest challenges technically , was the VOIDWALKER ( portal device ) … you ’re going to love it .
Aggrogamer : Did you find the 360 or the PS3 more difficult to develop for ?
Haydn Dalton :
The PS3 was harder to develop for , mainly because we started the development of Darksiders on the PC as that is what our initial tools were developed for , which just inherently shifts over better to the X360 , rather than the PS3 .
Aggrogamer :
You ’ve recently released the achievement / trophy list .
Was this something you looked forward to putting into the game or was it just an expected requirement ?
Haydn Dalton :
They ’re expected requirements in games now , and even if they were n’t , we would ’ve still wanted to add them anyway .
I think the introduction of Achievements & Trophies has been the next - gen step of the old faithful HIGH - SCORE tables , but now it ’s a global element instead .
Aggrogamer : Your release in January is console - only .
Is a PC - version in the works at all ?
Haydn Dalton :
We ’ve flip - flopped on the PC version several times , first we were , then we were n’t … currently , there are no plans for a PC version at launch , but who knows after Darksiders ‘ release , we may look at producing a PC version if it ’s well received .
Aggrogamer : Even considering Darksiders has n’t been released yet , I ’m sure you ’ve received a lot of questions about sequels .
How does dealing with the consumers ’ extremely high expectations affect your work ?
Haydn Dalton :
Yes , we have had plenty of questions and ideas about what could happen in a sequel , and more than anything , it just excites us that people are already talking about one .
After completing Darksiders , we know where we can excel and where we want to expand the game , plus we have tons of content we had outlined ( and functional ) for Darksiders 1 that could also bleed into another one .
Aggrogamer : How accessible is the combat system to a total n00b ?
Could anyone be able to pick this up and play ( assuming the person knows how to operate a controller to play the game ) ?
Haydn Dalton :
The combat is very accessible to players of any level .
Our goal in combat was to make it so new players looked cool with very minimal effort , but also create the depth for experienced players to go absolutely crazy at a whole new level with how they could combo attacks and gear items together .
Our combat designer pulls off some intensely insane moves that really showcases how deep players can get with it .
Aggrogamer :
On the flip side , how customized and complex could a master make his / her experience ?
Haydn Dalton :
Once a player gathers some of the major gear items , unlocks some new moves and boosts up their wrath powers , they become an unstoppable force and it's awesome to watch .
By blending these things together , they can evade , aggressively attack and clear out enemies in a ballet of destruction .
The Tremor Gauntlet , for instance , has a “ sweet spot ” that , if timed correctly , releases a more powerful and devastating blow , rewarding the more skilled gamer .
The Abyssal Chain allows
War to drag small enemies to him , or latch onto larger ones to chase them down from the air .
There are so many options available to those who wish to master what we ’re giving them in Darksiders .
Aggrogamer : Approximately how many weapons are at War ’s disposal and what kind of variety does he have ?
What is your favorite weapon to use ?
Haydn Dalton : War has his Chaoseater Sword , a gauntlet and a scythe as main melee weapons , but he can also wield a pistol and two types of dual - handed cannons .
The Crossblade gear item can be used as a weapon , as can objects from the environment , like cars , lampposts , dumpsters and whatever else can move in the scene .
War can also use supernatural Wrath attacks to quickly clear enemies around him , like Blade Geyser or take them out at distance with Affliction ( demon spirits that track enemies ) and he gains the ability to use his Chaos Form , turning War into a huge , fiery demon , in which he can inflict huge amounts of damage and repel most damage from attacks .
So he has a few options there .
Aggrogamer :
What has been your single greatest inspiration in creating Darksiders ?
Haydn Dalton : Probably Zelda , with a little bit of Castlevania and Metroid mixed in for good measure .
They ’re just great games that excel in level design , item / ability use and character progression .
We felt that the action adventure genre of today could benefit greatly from taking a few cues from these great titles .
Aggrogamer :
What made you want to work in the video games industry ?
How did you get to where you are today and what was your “ big break ? ”
Haydn Dalton : I originally started out in the C64 demo scene back in the early - mid 80’s .
After creating graphics on several demos I decided to send some samples to Ocean Software Ltd , and they offered me a job there .
It was one of the greatest moments of my life back then .
Working in games had always felt like something “ other ” people worked on , anyone but me .
Aggrogamer : If Darksiders were optioned for a movie , whom would you want playing the lead character , War ?
Haydn Dalton : Mmmm , that ’s an interesting one .
I do n’t think his voice fits , but the ROCK in the Rundown was pretty good , he has the right physique and presence … with the voice of a younger Clint Eastwood .
I ’m sure others on the team may think differently though .
Lastly , 3 quick decisions , go : Pac - Man or Ms. Pac - Man ?
Pac-Man
Mario or Luigi ?
Mario
Ginger or Mary Ann ?
Mary Ann
Aggrogamer would like to thank Haydn for taking a moment to speak with us .
Look for Darksiders to be released on January 5 , 2010 , on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 .
Rupert Murdoch and his henchmen have repeatedly bad - mouthed Google as a “ tech tapeworm ” and a “ parasite ” , guilty of “ false gospel ” and , according to the media mogul himself this week , “ theft ” .
That war of attrition is starting to have an effect .
After the drip , drip of abuse , Josh Cohen , Google ’s senior business product manager , has announced a change in policy that will do something towards closing a loophole that threatened Murdoch ’s plans to charge for the online content of his newspapers , including The Times and The Sun .
Google said it will allow publishers to limit the number of free news pages users can access per day .
The change means that Google News will become less effective as a back door way of reading news articles produced by websites that normally require a subscription .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Internet users have found that by repeatedly using Google ’s “ First Click Free ” feature they could continue to sample content that news providers wished to charge for .
Under the new arrangement , users of the aggregator will be redirected to a payment screen after accessing five articles from the same publisher on the same day .
The gesture by Google comes in the wake of reports that Murdoch has been in discussions to make the content of his publications only available through Microsoft ’s rival , though infant , search engine Bing .
The News Corporation chairman and chief executive increased the pressure on Tuesday by telling a conference in Washington : “ To aggregate stories is not fair use .
To be impolite , it is theft . ”
But Cohen argued that some publishers might benefit from having a hybrid of free and paid - for content available on Google News .
“ The two are n’t mutually exclusive , ” he wrote on a blog .
“ If you 're a Google user , this means that you may start to see a registration page after you 've clicked through to more than five articles on the website of a publisher using First Click Free in a day ... while allowing publishers to focus on potential subscribers who are accessing a lot of their content on a regular basis . ”
This is just one step in what will be a long and difficult period of negotiation between News Corp and the aggregators , a process that will gather pace ahead of the planned introduction of charging for Internet access to The Times and The Sunday Times , which will decouple online in the spring and erect a pay barrier .
Sources at News International , the News Corp division that oversees Murdoch ’s British newspaper titles , view Google ’s concession as having little value , except as an apparent indication that the search engine recognises there are problems with the current system .
“ They ’re still dictating the business model and failing to grasp that when you deal with commercial partners it is on terms that are mutually rewarding , ” said one executive .
“ That said , it ’s the first time there has been some sort of recognition of the damage that their unrestricted use of content might be having . ”
News media businesses are desperately wrestling with the problem of trying to make money from the online provision of often expensively - produced content .
Murdoch ’s Wall Street Journal is one of only a few newspapers that charges for online content , and has accrued 1 m subscribers .
But News Corp suffered a £ 2 billion loss in the year to June .
One of Britain ’s largest regional newspaper companies , Johnston Press has this week decided to introduce charging for access to some of its sites , including those of the Northumberland Gazette and the Worksop Guardian .
John
Fry , the company ’s chief executive , said that Google ’s initiative would be of limited value in enforcing his pay walls .
“ Restructuring to five [ articles ] a day does n’t really resolve the issue of Google News , ” he said .
“ The good news is that Google have recognised there is an issue and have started to think of ways of dealing with it .
I suspect that matters being highlighted by people in the newspaper industry have helped to make this progress . ”
* Some internet users had found they were able to circumvent the barriers around subscription - only news sites by exploiting a “ First Click Free ” feature that gave them access to the content .
This feature was introduced by Google partly to prevent the practice of “ cloaking ” , whereby a website uses one form of content to allow it to be indexed by the search engine but then offers the user different content , such as a payment page or spam , including porn .
Under the new Google system , users would be able to access only five articles per day from a subscription - charging publisher , before being redirected to the payment page .
Though a minor concession , the gesture itself is seen as a significant attempt to placate content publishers .
Dublin's € 60 million Samuel Beckett Bridge , designed by internationally renowned architect Santiago Calatrava , opened to traffic this morning .
The 120 - metre long , 48 - metre high bridge spans the river Liffey from Sir John Rogerson ’s Quay near Macken Street on the south side to Guild Street at the site of the new National Convention Centre on the north side .
It was one of two bridges commissioned from Calatrava by Dublin City Council 10 years ago .
The other , the James Joyce Bridge , opened at Blackhall Place near Heuston Station on Bloomsday , June 16th , 2003 .
The new bridge was projected in 1998 to cost £ 10 million , but the costs ultimately rose to almost € 60 million .
Designed to represent a harp on its side the cable - stayed bridge was made in the Netherlands and arrived in Dublin last May .
It had a difficult introduction to the city , with two failed attempts to put it in place on the river due to high winds and generally poor weather .
However , it opened slightly ahead of schedule , having been due to open in early 2010 .
The bridge will be capable of rotating through an angle of 90 degrees to facilitate maritime traffic .
It has four traffic lanes , cycle tracks and footpaths and will be capable of accommodating a Luas track .
Motorists have been advised that there is no right - turn from the bridge on either side of the river and there is no left - turn from North Wall Quay onto the north side of the bridge .
It was opened to pedestrians yesterday by Lord Mayor of Dublin Emer Costello .
Relatives of Samuel Beckett attended the event as did actor Barry McGovern , known internationally for his Beckett performances , and poet Seamus Heaney .

Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro said Tuesday that Sen. Joe Lieberman should be recalled from office over his opposition to the Senate health care bill .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Conn. colleagues ' fed up ' with Joe
Liberal anger at Sen. Joe Lieberman spread across Capitol Hill on Tuesday , with a House Democrat from Connecticut calling for his recall and Lieberman himself acknowledging the angst he has caused .
“ No individual should hold health care hostage , including Joe Lieberman , and I ’ll say it flat out , I think he ought to be recalled , ” Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) told POLITICO .
Advertisement
Connecticut has no recall law for state officials , and the Constitution does not authorize states to recall members of Congress , since each house has the authority to police its own members .
DeLauro acknowledged that she did n’t know if it was possible to oust Lieberman from office .
But her comments reflected the deep frustration many Democrats felt after Lieberman told Senate Majority Harry Reid that he ’d join Republicans in filibustering the Senate health care reform bill if it included either a public insurance option or a provision allowing people ages 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare .
“ There ’s huge concern that borders on frustration , ” Rep. John Larson ( D - Conn . ) said of Lieberman ’s position .
“ It goes beyond frustration in Connecticut in terms of the way people feel , ” Larson said .
“ I have a great deal of respect [ for ] and I have long admired Joe Lieberman .
This goes against the grain of most of what he ’s fought for and stood for all of his life .
It ’s thoroughly frustrating and disappointing for so many of us . ”
“ People are fed up in Connecticut , and it ’s maddening to those of us who feel we have a pretty clear sense of where people in Connecticut are , ” said Connecticut Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy .
He added : “ I have no idea what Sen. Lieberman ’s agenda is .
I have stopped trying to be Sherlock Holmes . ”
At a White House meeting Tuesday with the Senate Democratic Caucus , Lieberman said he “ understood how people were upset with the position I took . ”
“ But like each of them , I had to do what I thought was right , ” he said he told the group .
“ I did n’t run for reelection — and no one here did — asking the voters of my state to vote for me because I would always do what a majority of members of the caucus did , even if I thought some of those things were wrong .
None of us would pledge that to our constituents . ”
Lieberman said he told his colleagues that he has n’t “ really had a lot of fun ” in recent days .
“ One thing he acknowledged , which is important , is how difficult this has been for people on both sides of it , ” said Sen. Bob Casey ( D - Pa. ) .
“ I was struck by how human that moment was . ”
Even Lieberman ’s wife has become a target , with liberal blogger Jane Hamsher calling on the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation to cut its ties to Hadassah Lieberman because of her prior work for the pharmaceutical industry .
Lieberman has called the attacks on his wife “ outrageous and insulting , ” and his spokesman , Marshall Wittmann , denied that the senator was trying to block health care legislation .
“ The truth is that Sen . Lieberman is seeking to pass a health care bill as soon as possible that will provide coverage to millions of Americans who lack health insurance , Wittman said . ”
Asked about his colleagues ’ anger , Lieberman said Tuesday : “ I do n’t like getting attacked personally , but I ’m used to it .
...
We have a disagreement , but our relations continue to be cordial . ”
Liberal blogs and others have argued that Lieberman has flip - flopped on the Medicare buy - in proposal ; he supported the idea when he ran for vice president in 2000 .
But Lieberman issued a statement Tuesday in which he said that the national debt then was less than half what it is now , that Medicare was not on the cusp of going broke and that there was no “ viable ” proposal like the one being considered on the floor .
He said comments he made to the Connecticut Post in September endorsing the idea were “ before we had a bill for consideration on the Senate floor that contains extensive health insurance reforms , including limiting how much more insurance companies could charge individuals based on age and providing subsidies that would specifically help people between the ages of 55 and 65 to afford health insurance . ”
Lieberman added : “ I look forward to passing a bill that will give the American people genuine health care reform without impeding our recovery from the current recession or adding to our exploding national debt . ”
Lieberman ’s home - state colleague , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd , said the frustration aimed at Lieberman arose mostly out of support for the public option back in Connecticut .
“ It ’s just people ’s frustration for getting a bill done and strong support for a public option , ” he said .
North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad , a Democratic centrist , said Lieberman has actually made it easier to reach a deal on the health care bill .
“ In a curious way , it may make it more possible to get something done , ” Conrad said of Lieberman ’s position .
“ Because he was n’t the only one with these concerns , it ’s very clear — he vocalized concerns many were having . ”
WASHINGTON -- The White House said late Friday that President Barack Obama now expects a " meaningful " climate deal at a United Nations summit in Copenhagen , possibly involving a commitment for rich nations to provide $ 10 billion a year by 2012 to help developing countries fight climate change .
The White House said the U.S. is prepared to pay its " fair share " of the $ 10 billion .

The rivalry threatening to destroy Arsenal
Does £ 300 m worth of debt sound good to you ?
How about £ 500 m worth of bank loans whose interest takes up a large proportion of a wealthy club ’s profits ?
No , it does n’t sound too appetizing to me either .
These are the sum totals of debt that two separate American consortiums have saddled on two of the world ’s most wealthy clubs .
Now the same menace haunts the boardroom at the Emirates Stadium where a certain man from Missouri wants to buy an English “ soccer team ” estimated to be worth £ 400m .
Only a few Arsenal fans , if any , would argue that a takeover by Stan Kroenke would be beneficial to the club , that he would spend a greater deal more on players than the current board and bring the trophies back to the Emirates .
Others would have you believe that there is no takeover imminent , such as board member Danny Fiszmann and Chairman Peter Hill - Wood .
Both assumptions are wrong ; the real issue at hand is the dangerous rivalry which has been going on in the board room since the departure of David Dein as vice - chairman in 2007 .
The acrimonious split , based around Dein ’s anger at the lack of spending power that the Arsenal board were prepared to hand Arsene Wenger , has grown ever deeper in the two year period .
In recent times , Dein has described Arsenal of living in the “ stone age ” compared to other top flight clubs , that Arsenal ’s conservative business model is allowing other Premier League clubs to catch up while they are standing still .
An accusation disputed by others on the Arsenal board such as Fiszmann and Hill - Wood who believe paying off the club ’s debt over the new stadium was the priority .
What has fuelled the rivalry is the share gathering which has allowed Stan Kroenke to acquire an almost controlling stake in the club .
29.6 % is 0.3 % away from initiating a takeover bid for the club .
Danny Fiszmann started it all off by selling 659 shares to Kroenke two years ago .
This inevitably led to a response from Dein who did not want Arsenal to fall into American hands .
But to finance his own share buying , he needed a wealthy backer , a Russian oligarch by the name of Alisher Usmanov was the answer , a man who has acquired 23 % of the club up until the present .
Both Kroenke and Usmanov have been used as pawns in a bitter power struggle within the Emirates , but one of them , Kroenke , to the surprise of both Fiszmann and Hill - Wood , will soon be in the position to buy the entire club under their noses .
Up until this point it has been assumed that Kroenke did not have the finances to buy Arsenal at the £ 375 m it has been valued at , but with the sale of the NFL franchise St Louis Rams which it holds a majority stake in , he will be able to buy the club out .
As with both the Glazer family and the Gillet - Hicks partnership , the large assets that Kroenke owns , such as the Denver Nuggets , will allow him to borrow the required amount to buy and put the debt on the club .
Kroenke cannot win for the sake of Arsenal ’s future .
He would saddle the club with an enormous debt which has burdened both Liverpool and Manchester United and squeeze the club for greater profit to reduce the debt ’s size .
A message to the Arsenal board : learn from the mistakes of other clubs , do n’t allow your petty rivalries to allow an outsider in through the back door , think of the club first .
A parent in the Issaquah School District in King County , Washington requested that the school board eliminate the Pledge of Allegiance from their regular business meetings .
“ It is inappropriate for the school board to ask atheists to stand and proclaim they are ‘ under God , ’ ” said [ Matthew ] Barry , a self - proclaimed atheist .
“ Atheists do n’t believe in gods , so they certainly do n’t think they or the nation are under a god . ” …
“ It ’s none of the government ’s business what our private religious beliefs are , if any , and certainly none of the government ’s business to ask us to stand and publicly proclaim what those beliefs are , ” he added .
“ Most would agree it ’s even worse if the government asks someone to stand and say something that contradicts their belief system . ”
And , not surprisingly , the article quotes someone who has no clue what he ’s talking about :
“ If I understand his logic correctly , simply because something is offensive and unnecessary , it should be removed , ” said Jared Spataro , a parent and Boy Scout Leader whose Scouts presented the colors that night . …
“ I understand many things we do are offensive to people , ” Spataro added .
“ But just because a small group of people , or even a large group of people , are offended it does n’t mean they are right . ”
Spataro does n’t understand his logic correctly .
Offensive is ok .
Let people be challenged .
But to proclaim we ’re a nation under a god violates the idea of church / state separation .
It ’s unconstitutional .
That ’s why it ’s wrong .
End of story .
No word on whether the school board will change their ways .
Unfortunately , I ’m not hopeful .
But kudos to Matthew Barry for being the voice of reason .
It ’d be nice if others knew their history as well as he does .
Iran Is n't Stalinist Russia
In the October 12 issue of Newsweek , Fareed Zakaria makes a case for containing rather than confronting Iran , partly because he expects “ a massive outpouring of support for the Iranian regime ” if its nuclear - weapons facilities are attacked by the U.S. or Israel .
“ This happens routinely when a country is attacked by foreign forces , no matter how unpopular the government , ” he writes .
As a precedent , he cites how Russians rallied to Stalin when Germany invaded in 1941 .
But of course Russians rallied to Stalin .
No viable political opposition existed as it does today in Iran , and besides : they were attacked by the Nazis .
The Germans were n’t liberators .
Russia was not going to be treated better by foreign totalitarians than by its own .
Even the U.S. and Britain backed Stalinist Russia under those circumstances .
The people of Afghanistan , on the other hand , were euphoric when NATO demolished the Taliban regime in 2001 .
The Taliban has since reconstituted itself as a terrorist and insurgent militia , but its approval rating among Afghan civilians is by some reports as miserable as 6 percent .
Support for the U.S. and NATO has slipped recently , but it ’s still telling that , according to an ABC News poll of public opinion , 58 percent still say the Taliban is the greatest threat to security , while only 8 percent say the same of the United States .
Very few Iraqis outside the relatively small Sunni community threw their support behind Saddam Hussein when President Bill Clinton bombed Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction facilities in 1998 or when President George W. Bush finished off his Baath party regime once and for all in 2003 .
Meanwhile , the various terrorist and insurgent militias that later rose up were almost exclusively sectarian and Islamist , not Baathist .
Even the Shia of south Lebanon — today ’s Hezbollah supporters — initially hailed the Israelis as liberators in 1982 when they invaded to oust Yasir Arafat ’s Palestinian Liberation Organization from its state - within - a - state along the border and in West Beirut .
Only later , when the Israelis did not leave as expected , did the prototype of Hezbollah begin to take shape .

It 's a match made in hell -- a popular adultery website is offering Tiger Woods a whole lotta moolah to be the new face of Internet - based cheating ... and the offers do n't stop there .
TMZ has obtained a contract sent to Tiger by the people over at AshleyMadison.com -- a website for people who want to secretly cheat on their spouses -- offering him $ 5 million to provide services in connection with the " advertisement , endorsement , sale and promotion " of the website .
The site 's honchos never call Tiger out for cheating ... they just think Tiger and his self - proclaimed " personal sins " are a perfect match for their cheeky agenda .
Now for Round Two :
The porn company Vivid Entertainement is offering up their own $ 1 million purse ... to " any woman who has proof she was a paramour of Tiger Woods and will sign a contract with the studio . "
Sounds like a raw deal .
The movie studios have a new Holy Grail , it seems : Federal Communications Commission permission to cable companies to shut down the analog streams on video - on - demand movie programming .
As Ars readers know , we 've been covering this issue for a while .
But the Motion Picture Association of America 's latest letter to the FCC pulls out all the stops , rhetoric - wise , calling criticisms of this scheme " complete and utter nonsense that only can be intended to stir up baseless fears among consumers that their equipment will suddenly go dark and be unusable for any purpose . "
These are " deplorable claims , " the MPAA told the FCC on Monday .
Plus they " distort the truth . "
They 're also " simply and irrefutably untrue , " the trade association adds ( in case you did n't get it yet ) .
False untruthfulness
The main target of MPAA 's outrage is the advocacy group Public Knowledge , one of whose spokespersons , Harold Feld , has an ongoing video series called " Five Minutes With Harold Feld , " in which the aforementioned offers his takes on " incredibly boring and wonky things " and tries " to make them slightly less boring , because this stuff is important . "
The allegedly offensive five - minute video in question deals with what MPAA wants , which is technically called " Selectable Output Control " — shutting down the analog stream to HDTVs and other devices because it is less secure ( copyable ) than digital streams , which can be scrambled .
The FCC currently prohibits the practice .
The studios say they want to plug the " analog hole " with SOC because it will allow them to offer the public pre-DVD VoD movie releases with less threat of piracy .
The problem , as Feld 's video on this subject points out , is that a considerable amount of analog only connected equipment wo n't be able to receive these offerings .
" And for this , " Feld skeptically declares , " we 're going to break 25 million television sets , and break your TiVO , and break your Slingbox , and make sure you can't use it on VoD anymore , because [ Feld looking especially skeptical here ] it 's so important to get these movies to video - on - demand earlier . "
Feld 's " deplorable claims " are " absolutely , 100 percent untrue , " MPAA counters .
" The use of SOC would have no impact whatsoever on the ability of existing television sets , Tivos , Slingboxes or any other consumer product to work in exactly the same fashion that such devices work today .
While products with only unprotected outputs and inputs would not be able to receive the new early window offerings that would be made possible by the SOC waiver , no device would be broken .
Nor would any consumer be unable to receive traditional VOD in the same way that he or she does today . "
A considerable amount of time in this debate is being spent rather theatrically denouncing words that clearly function as metaphors .
As we 've pointed out , although SOC wo n't render analog - only HDTVs and other home theater equipment " broken , " as in " physically damaged with wires poking out of the set , " it will disable the ability of this gear to access what will immediately become the most valuable offering on television : pre-DVD release VoD movies .
What 's the problem anyway ?
The rest of MPAA 's filing is a long list of ways that movies are copied and illegally distributed on the Internet — further proof positive that the studios need SOC .
Among other claims , the filing insists that real time duplication of HBO per - per - view events on various websites represents clear evidence that " thieves steal this content through unprotected outputs . "
From this litany , a disinterested reader might conclude that Hollywood 's efforts to stop this activity have been amazingly unsuccessful , and the producers might want to reconsider their approach to the problem .
MPAA , for example , decries the fact that " literally every DVD that MPAA member studios released for rental or purchase during the past year has been made available for unlawful downloading or streaming online . "
If that is the case , why does the MPAA extol the virtues of its DVD Content Scramble System ( CSS ) before the United States Copyright Office ?
CSS and other " protection technologies " have allowed content producers to " distribute their valuable content in higher quality , more convenient digital formats , " MPAA wrote in the office 's latest proceeding on exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
As a result , " DVDs have become one of the most widely adopted consumer electronics products in history , and the pace of adoption has been unprecedented .
Consumers have greater access to movies and TV shows than ever before . "
It does n't seem to matter .
In Hollywood - think on this issue , the solution to each apparent technology / regulation failure is a new tech fix that requires new rules and a new explanation of why it wo n't hurt consumers .
TV watchers , MPAA notes , are already used to not seeing stuff on their cable boxes .
So what 's the problem ?
" A typical subscriber today already encounters numerous instances where a particular channel or service is not available .
For example , a given consumer might not subscribe to a cable company ’s high - definition service or might not receive premium channels ( such as HBO ) .
In either case , if consumers were to attempt to access one of these channels , they would receive an on - screen message advising them that their service does not include access to the requested content . "
MPAA goes so far as to suggest that if SOC is n't granted , individual movie studios will begin releasing pre-DVD content on non-cable distribution alternatives — such as SONY 's experiments with encrypted Internet streams sent directly to its Bravia HDTVs ( Hancock already streams and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is coming next ) .
Thus , the trade group warns , " it is denial of the waiver that could result in a scenario in which millions of consumers would have to buy new equipment to receive new content offerings . "
That is , of course , assuming that consumers would bother to do so , given the enormous amount of content they can already get over the ' Net .
Not -so - subtle
Needless to say , Public Knowledge is taking strong exception to statements that pretty much call the group a pack of liars .
MPAA 's latest commentary " utterly fails to demonstrate that anybody steals content through the analog hole , " PK's Gigi Sohn declared in a commentary published this morning .
And " by attacking Public Knowledge and specifically Harold 's integrity , it is a not - so - subtle effort to spin the debate over this waiver as ' copyleft ' Public Knowledge versus ' reasonable '
Hollywood , which only wants this itsy bitsy waiver so that it can provide the ' pro- consumer ' benefit of making movies available on video on demand a few weeks earlier than they are now . "
Sohn notes that a wide variety of organizations besides PK oppose SOC , including the Consumer Electronics Association and the Independent Film and Television Alliance .
No one knows how much their concerns count with the new FCC , which has yet to take a stand on this controversial issue .
To send a quantum message , it helps to have a photon six - pack .
When bound together by a process called quantum entanglement , a set of six photons can withstand the hard knocks that ordinarily would erase quantum information , researchers have shown .
Papers describing the new experiment appear in the Oct. 9 * Physical Review Letters * and the October Physical Review A .
“ This is an exciting landmark in experimental capabilities , ” comments physicist Aephraim Steinberg of the University of Toronto , who was not involved in the work .
Creating the six - photon entanglement is an impressive technical achievement , he says .
“ This is the first demonstration of such large entangled states ” with high quality .
Quantum communication offers an absolutely secure way to send secret messages , such as encoded military secrets or financial transactions .
But quantum information is fragile , quickly destroyed by even slight interactions with the environment .
While a conventional bit of information can have only one value , 0 or 1 , a quantum bit , or qubit , exists as a combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously .
A qubit stays in this undecided state until something , whether a stray atom or a scientist trying to measure its properties , interacts with it , forcing it into a single state .
This collapse of possibilities , known as quantum decoherence , can be detected farther down the line to catch eavesdroppers .
But it can also keep qubits from reaching their destination intact .
Fortunately , theorists have shown that some quantum - mechanical systems are immune to certain interactions .
One of these resilient systems is a set of four or more photons that are intimately bound , or entangled , a property of quantum systems that links particles ’ fates even when they are separated by large distances .
Delicate quantum bits find safety in numbers .
The more photons are entangled , the more data can be encoded and transmitted reliably .
Four photons can encode one robust qubit of information , and six photons can encode two , theorists have calculated .
Now , a team of physicists led by Magnus Rådmark of Stockholm University has experimentally demonstrated a set of six entangled photons that can fly down flawed , noisy fiber - optic cables and emerge unscathed .
“ You ’ll get exactly the same state out as you sent in , even if the fiber is being stressed and the temperature is changing , and all of the environmental factors that would normally make it a no - go , ” Steinberg says .
The key to preserving the state is to make sure all six photons are altered in exactly the same way .
Temperature changes around the fiber - optic cable can alter the way it bends light , which in turn can rotate photons unpredictably .
But if the photons travel in a close pack , they will all feel the same twists and bends .
“ If I take all six photons and rotate them in the same way , I will get exactly the same state I started with , ” says Mohamed Bourennane of Stockholm University , a coauthor on the papers .
“ It ’s like nothing has happened . ”
As a bonus , this property means that the sender and receiver do n’t need to agree on which way is up .
Changing the reference frame is just another rotation , the same kind of noise the photons ignored in the fiber .
The photon sextet could also be useful in quantum computing , which could in principle manipulate entangled qubits to solve certain problems that are impossibly difficult for conventional computers .
It is one of the world 's last great wildernesses , a 435 - mile long peninsula of lakes and squelching tundra stretching deep into the Arctic Ocean .
For 1,000 years the indigenous Nenets people have migrated along the Yamal peninsula .
In summer they wander northwards , taking their reindeer with them , across a landscape of boggy ponds , rhododendron - like shrubs and wind - blasted birch trees .
In winter they return southwards .
But this remote region of north - west Siberia is now under heavy threat from global warming .
Traditionally the Nenets travel across the frozen Ob River in November and set up camp in the southern forests around Nadym .
These days , though , this annual winter pilgrimage is delayed .
Last year the Nenets , together with many thousands of reindeer , had to wait until late December when the ice was finally thick enough to cross .
" Our reindeer were hungry .
There was n't enough pasture , " Jakov Japtik , a Nenets reindeer herder , told the Guardian .
" The snow is melting sooner , quicker and faster than before .
In spring it 's difficult for the reindeer to pull the sledges .
They get tired , " Japtik said , speaking in his camp 25 kms from Yar - Sale , the capital of Russia 's Arctic Yamal - Nenets district .
Herders say that the peninsula 's weather is increasingly unpredictable – with unseasonal snowstorms when the reindeer give birth in May , and milder longer autumns .
In winter temperatures used to go down to - 50C .
Now they are typically - 30C , according to Japtik .
" Obviously we prefer - 30C .
But the changes are n't good for the reindeer and ultimately what
is good for the reindeer is good for us , " he said , setting off on his sled to round up his itinerant reindeer herd .
Japtik lives on the tundra in a reindeer - skin tent or chum ( ital ) with his wife , mother , and three - year - old nephew Albert .
There is also baby Pasha .
The Japtiks live with three other families ; the group has around 600 reindeer .
The family slaughters a reindeer every couple of weeks , eating it raw and with pasta .
They also catch fish – slicing off filets of sushi- like whitefish , taken from the thousands of virgin - lakes across the peninsula .
Here in one of the most remote parts of the planet there are clear signs the environment is under strain .
Last year the Nenets arrived at a regular summer camping spot and discovered that half of their lake had disappeared .
It had drained away after a landslide .
While landslides can occur naturally , scientists say there is unmistakable evidence that Yamal 's ancient permafrost is melting .
The Nenets report other curious changes - fewer mosquitoes and a puzzling increase in gadflies .
" It 's an indication of the global warming process , like the opening of the Arctic waters for shipping this summer , " says Vladimir Tchouprov , Greenpeace Russia 's energy unit head .
The melting of Russia 's permafrost could have catastrophic results for the world , Tchouprov says , by releasing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and the potent greenhouse gas methane , that was previously trapped in frozen soil .
Russia – the world 's biggest country by geographical area - is already warming at one and a half times the rate of other parts of the world .
If global temperatures do go up by the 4C many scientists fear , the impact on Russia would be disastrous .
Much of Russia 's northern region would be turned into impenetrable swamp .
Houses in several Arctic towns are already badly subsiding .
Many Russians , however , are sceptical that climate change exists .
Others rationalise that it might bring benefits to one of the world 's coldest countries , freeing up a melting Arctic for oil and gas exploration , and extending the country 's brief growing season .
Russia 's scientific community seems sceptical of global warming and the Kremlin does n't appear to regard the issue as a major domestic problem ; public awareness of climate change in Russia is lower than in any other European country .
Western politicians , however , point out that it is in Russia 's interests to take action on climate change and to push for ambitious targets at December 's Copenhagen summit .
" There is 5,000 miles of railway track built on permafrost .
It could crumble as a result of melting , " Ed Miliband , the secretary of state for climate change , pointed out during a recent visit to Moscow .
However , even Russians working in the Arctic are unconvinced that their country faces a serious climate - change problem .
" It 's rubbish .
It 's invented .
People who spend too long sitting at home have made up climate change , " Alexander Chikmaryov , who runs a remote weather station on the Yamal peninsula , said , standing in his dilapidated station strewn with rusting engine parts and a broken - down wind turbine .
Chikmaryov lives in Marresale , an outpost on the Yamal peninsula 's north - west coast overlooking the Kara Sea .
A small community of Nenets hunters live nearby ; otherwise there 's nobody for a hundred kilometres .
The weather here is , not surprisingly , bitterly cold ; the sea freezes nine months of the year .
The word Yamal means " end of the world " in Nenets language , and in Marresale you see why .
In fact , Chikmaryov 's own data suggests that global warming is a real problem here too .
In 2008 the ice was 164 cm thick ; this year it is 117 cm .
Winter temperatures have gone up too – from lows of - 50C in 1914 , when the station was founded , to - 40C today .
Every year large chunks of the coast on which the station is precariously perched fall into the sea .
On the beach there is a jagged layer of thawing permafrost .
And there are other unnatural signs .
On 15 August a large polar bear ambled into Marresale and started rooting through the station 's rubbish bin .
" It was 7 pm .
The bear was enormous .
We set off a flare .
It ran off , " she recalled .
Polar bear sightings are becoming increasingly common – with the bears apparently venturing south from their far - northern habitat in search of food .
" They are an impudent lot .
They are n't afraid of humans , " Ludmilla says , gleefully recalling how one polar bear ripped the scalp from a Russian scientist living on Franz Josef Land .
Back on the tundra Japitik was rounding up his reindeer .
Some were already back at the camp ; their munching resembled the soft clicking of a thousand knitting needles .
" I 've lived all of my life in the tundra , " he said .
" The reindeer for us are everything – food , transport and accommodation .
The only thing I hope is that we will be able to carry on with this life . "

Formula 1 will introduce a new points system from 2010 after the FIA World Motor Sport Council approved the F1 Commission 's proposal to award points to the top 10 finishers in each race .
A statement from today 's meeting of the World Council said : " Due to the expanded grid of 13 teams , and further to the recommendation of the F1 Commission , a new points system will be in place for the 2010 season . "
The new system will award points in the following order : 25-20-15-10-8-6-5-3-2-1 .
The change was proposed to take into account the increased field for 2010 , when the addition of the new entrants will take the grid up to 26 cars - its highest figure since 1995 .
It is the first amendment since the current system came into force in 2003 .
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - General Motors has extended a December 31 deadline for bids for its Swedish car brand Saab , which will restart some production lines in January after a shutdown , Saab said on Wednesday .
GM had given itself to the end of this month to consider bids for loss - making Saab while continuing a process to wind down the company , which has drawn interest from Dutch luxury carmaker Spyker Cars and others .
Spyker Cars Chief Executive Victor Muller said in a text message GM had extended the deadline for a final offer from Spyker Cars until January 7 , in an extension of GM ’s original December 31 deadline for a deal .
Muller added he believed there are multiple bidders for Saab .
A spokesman for GM in Europe said he had no information on the deadline being canceled and could not immediately comment .
The Swedish government has said it would allot 542 million Swedish crowns ( $ 75 million ) to measures , mainly for education and job schemes , to help deal with the thousands of jobs set to disappear if Saab shuts down .
Abandoning the 60 - year - old Swedish auto brand would eliminate 3,400 jobs in Sweden and hit 1,100 Saab dealers .
In the meantime , Saab will restart some production lines again in January for its new 9 - 5 model and Cabrio , Saab spokesman Eric Geers said .
“ We have the orders and we have to deliver them as usual .
We also have the orders for the 9 - 3 and others .
The factory has to continue again , ” Geers said .
“ We are preparing the wind - down process .
At the same time we are open to options , to bids that come in .
Therefore the deadline has also been dropped , ” Geers said .
GM was still in talks with potential bidders but Geers only named Spyker Cars and declined to talk about other parties .
Loss - making Spyker has been keen to buy Saab to benefit from its technical resources and its distribution network .
Spyker , backed by Russian and Arabic investors , lodged a renewed fast - track offer to buy Saab on Dec 20 .
The surprise new offer from Spyker -- which made 43 luxury cars last year against Saab ’s sales of 93,295 -- came just two days after talks with GM over a rescue of the loss - making Swedish manufacturer collapsed .
Spyker ’s Muller has said if a deal is achieved , Saab and Spyker would operate as sister companies where Spyker could benefit from Saab ’s technical resources and its distribution network , while Spyker would bring entrepreneurial skills to Saab .
China ’s Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corp bought a number of car designs from Saab earlier this month .

Once again , the problem was n’t gathering intelligence .
We already had all the information we needed to know that Abdulmutallab should n’t have been allowed on that airplane .
Heck , his father even went to the US Embassy to warn us about him .
We did n’t need to torture anyone ( or even violate anyone ’s rights ) to get this information .
But having the best information in the world does n’t do any good if you fail to act on it , or even share it with the people who could have acted on it .
PokerNews Exclusive : Isildur1 Speaks About Playing The Big Games on Full Tilt Poker
December 23 , 2009 Matthew Parvis
Yesterday we exclusively brought you the first - ever interview with international mystery man " Isildur1 " where he discussed his $ 4.2 million losing session with Brian Hastings .
Today we reconvened to talk about why he played so high , his thoughts on some of the opponents , and more .
Tell us about when you first decided to play at Full Tilt , and what you were playing prior to getting involved on Full Tilt .
It was in October that I first played on Full Tilt .
Prior to that , I primarily played $ 200 / $ 400 no- limit hold 'em on a number of other sites .
You had a lot of success in the early goings , were there any players you felt you had a particularly big edge over ?
Out of all the players I faced , I felt as if I had the biggest edge over " durrrr . "
He tends to make some stupid plays , and I was able to take advantage of them .
Who was the toughest opponent at these stakes ?
Phil Ivey was tough for me as he only likes to play two tables at a time .
But for me two tables is not enough action , and I had to play others at the same time .
Did you ever sell any of your action , or were you ever staked ?
Recently , I have never sold a piece of myself .
When I was younger , I would sell like 5 % or something to some friends , but on Full Tilt Poker I always played for 100 % of myself .
A few times if I had a friend over when I was playing , I would give him like 1 % or something for fun .
If you had a friend beside you , did your friend ever have any input on the decisions your were making in the game ?
No , they never helped me .
Do you regret not playing more cautiously , and trying to hang on to some of your winnings ?
Honestly , I do n't think about it so much anymore .
It 's been like that all my life .
When I start playing a new level , I feel like I am taking a shot .
I usually lose at first , but I always come back .
I learn so much playing , that I feel like I will win in the long run .
I think it was really good playing durrrr as he does so many good things and I learned a lot from him .
It 's OK , even though I lost so much money .
I was really down for a while , but it was not a big problem .
Talk to us about the other mysterious Swedish player " Martonas . "
Martonas is honestly my enemy in poker .
I did win about $ 400 k off of him last month on various sites not including Full Tilt .
So the rumors about you being Martonas , or being very close friends with him are false ?
Yes , they are 100 % false .
Are you currently broke ?
No , I still have a bankroll and will be back .
My problem is I play every game available , even if I am not as good at some of them .
That is why I lose .
Also , playing 15 hour sessions without eating or sleeping has not helped me .
What game are you the least experienced in ?
I only have been playing pot-limit Omaha for eight months .
Before that I did n't even know the rules for it .
I honestly think pot -limit Omaha is so much luck .
Will you be playing again on Full Tilt Poker ?
Yes , I just did recently .
I played a small number of hands with durrrr .
I had no money on Full Tilt Poker , but I got staked by a friend for $ 50,000 .
It was mostly just for fun .

Fears of Eurabia How Much Allah Can the Old Continent Bear ?
Switzerland 's recent vote to ban the construction of new minarets has shocked and angered Muslims around the world .
But the controversial move also reflects a growing sense of unease among other Europeans who have trouble coming to terms with Islam 's increased visibility .

A couple of young Baha ’is from Los Angeles recently created this video which includes a reading of Haleh Rouhi ’s letter from prison .
Rouhi was arrested in May 2006 in Shiraz along with other 53 Baha ’is and charged with offenses relating to state security .
These young people , along with Iranian Muslims , were engaged in a teaching project benefiting underprivileged children in Shiraz .
In August 2007 three of the group , Raha Sabet , Haleh Rouhi and Sasan Taqva , were sentenced to four years in prison for “ organizing illegal groups ” and “ propaganda on behalf of groups that are opposed to the Islamic regime ” .
In her letter from prison , dated 21 May 2009 , Rouhi shared the story of her arrest and imprisonment .
The video - slideshow below includes a reading of the English translation of that letter .
This new French carbon tax was scheduled to go into law on Jan1 , 2010 .
The tax was steep : 17 euros per ton of carbon dioxide ( USD $ 24.40 ) .
In a stunning move , and surely a blow to warmists everywhere , the tax has been found unconstitutional and thrown out .
Originally found here ( Google Translation ) .
Lord Monckton was kind enough to assist me in deciphering the meaning of the ruling and writes :
In France , if at least 60 Deputies of the House and 60 Senators appeal to the Constitutional Council , it has the power to pronounce on the constitutionality of a proposed law – in the present case , the 2010 national budget of France , which contained enabling provisions ( loi deferee ) for a carbon levy .
The Council found that these enabling provisions were unconstitutional on two grounds : that the exemptions contained within the provisions for a carbon levy vitiated the primary declared purpose of the levy , to combat carbon emissions and hence “ global warming ” ; and that the exemptions would cause the levy to fall disproportionately on gasoline and heating oils and not on other carbon emissions , thereby breaching the principle that taxation should be evenly and fairly borne .
The Press release from the French Constitutional Council is here in English ( Google Translated ) and in original French
Here ’s a Deustch - Welle news article on the reversal .

The council said the tax had too many exemptions France ’s Constitutional Council says the country ’s proposed carbon tax is illegal .
This is a severe blow to French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plans to fight climate change .
France ’s Constitutional Council has struck down a carbon tax that was planned to take effect on January 1st .
The council , which ensures the constitutionality of French legislation , said too many polluters were exempted in the measure and the tax burden was not fairly distributed .
It was estimated that 93 percent of industrial emissions outside of fuel use , including the emissions of more than 1,000 of France ’s top polluting industrial sites , would be exempt from the tax , which would have charged 17 euros per ton of emitted carbon dioxide .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has argued the tax is necessary to combat climate change and reduce the country ’s dependence on oil .
However , the council ’s ruling is a severe blow to both Sarkozy ’s environmental plan as well as France ’s budget for 2010 .
The government now has to find a way to come up with about 4.1 billion euros in revenue that was expected from the tax .

If you spend your time working toward greater knowledge and clarity , you will some day stand on a promontory of realizations high above the thronging masses .
If you are also learning for “ inside out ” reasons , meaning you want to improve yourself and make yourself more effective , this will be painful .
You will see how easily human life could be more meaningful , less wasteful , and more fruitful ; you see the gap between that plan and any plan your fellow citizens will invent to be painful .
After all , if you ’ve made it that far , you recognize their motivations and see why they wo n’t ever really change , even as they make nearly infinite motions of radical change .
They ’re like the college hipster : wearing outlandish clothes , doing the opposite of what is expected , and always into some “ outside the norm ” topic like Buddhism , eye booger recycling or the martial arts of the ancient but tiny Huakading tribe of the South Pacific .
It ’s gotta be different , you see .
Of course , if your motivations are “ outside in , ” meaning that you are trying to make yourself gain social status so that in turn you become more powerful , as soon as you get learning you ’ll start feeling really good about yourself .
Look at how far you left those others behind !
They ’re peons compared to you .
You know the truth , and it does make you a better person .
So any time they bring up their dingy and stupid ideas in conversation , you ’ll set them to right .
But then that defines the crowd and the thinker : the crowd is outside - in , and the thinker , inside - out .
The thinker has transcended a need for self - affirmation through external objects ; the thinker assesses whether a thought has validity , and then truth , and moves on from there .
The crowd wants to use thoughts that seem true as a means of advancing themselves .
It ’s the same sad old human tale of a bucket full of crabs , each trying to climb to the top , not realizing that real power is outside of the bucket .
They will however continue to use their “ ideas ” against you , and will hoodwink others into believing these ideas , which they will then repeat in their attempts to rise in the crab bucket .
They feel that if they get in a sharp word , a clever retort , a moral judgment or a zippy comeback , they have Won .
In the game of immediate social discourse , they have ; people laugh , and opinions are formed .
In the long term however , they have only won with that insular , inbred and self - affirming group of low - confidence people who fear reality .
The best word for these people is “ sophomoric , ” from the Greek terms for wise fool , because they like so many others have gained enough knowledge to think they know what they ’re talking about , but not to recognize the patterns and life cycles of their topic .
As a result , they are like superstitious witch doctors , saying “ before it rained last time , we killed a virgin .
If we do it again , the rain will come ” — they have compared one detail in a before / after setting , and made the conclusion that this detail is the cause of their desired outcome .
Our most popular sophomoric “ wisdom ” today :
Liberalism and science are an antidote to Christianity .
Rather silly , if you read history .
The Enlightenment came about because … the church got liberalized , and individuals not priests interpreted the Bible .
What did they seize on ?
Perfection of the human form and equality of individuals .
That ’s the same as liberalism , which argues for equality of individuals and humanism , or praise for the human form and mind , except that instead of using “ God ” it uses moral “ good . ”
Otherwise , there ’s no difference .
Liberals like to claim that Christians are ignorant bumpkins who take their orders from a mysterious sky - god .
But if the orders are the same as those they get from their personal Reason , what ’s the difference ?
Darwinism is not a happy philosophy in which we are all the same .
In fact , it asserts the fundamental ambiguity of life : whatever breeds more , has more of its traits prevail .
That does n’t necessarily mean combat .
It may mean some creatures nurturing their offspring in a more effective way .
It can also be random and pointless , as in a case where a bird species that prefers blue berries to red suddenly replaces others when a new species of poisonous red berry is introduced to their island by a wandering hobo .
Darwinism does not affirm equality .
Instead , it points out that a struggle against equality is what enables species to have health at all .
Anarchy is a complete and total failure .
Many anarchist communities have been tried ; all have failed , except those subsidized by income from “ outside , ” usually drug or tourism related .
Even the encyclopedia of wishful thinking and fantasies by unemployed post - grads has to admit that none survived , and so has to expand its definition of anarchy to mean “ free market ” and “ female empowerment . ”
Anarchy means rule by theft and violence ; civilization is its antidote .
Liberal states tend to be collapsing states .
Throughout history , we see liberal states pop up to the praise of the cosmopolitan , over - educated , make - work job holding class .
They clap their little soft hands and praise the progressive alternative !
But then as time goes on , the liberal society slides into either third - world levels of disorganization , or collapses outright .
Even without the examples of France and Russia , who liberalized and dropped their average IQ by ten points , we can see a history of liberal states being a sharing of good feelings before the collapse .
Life is struggle .
So much of our human discourse involves trying to find a safe answer where everyone comes home alive and is presumed to live forever .
We hate destruction , so we avoid destructive - seeming acts , not realizing that life is like a forest : if something does not periodically burn out the underbrush , we set up the conditions for a massive fire .
Avoiding struggle is setting up the underbrush and lining it with napalm .
Our voters and marketers are afraid of wars , deprivation and conflict because they are unpopular , but they are necessary to avoid even bigger conflicts .
Power is literal .
We fear Malthus , realpolitik and Machiavelli because they affirm something we know in our inner hearts : the struggle for power is merciless , and it is merciless so that a decision is always reached .
A world of compromise and safe accords would be a boring one where dynamic change was impossible .
Malthus shows us that often succeeding is the worst kind of failure , because we can drown in our own successes ; realpolitik tells us that there must always be a big boss in any theatre of power , and that others will try to exterminate him ; Machiavelli ( and Homer , come to think of it ) reminds us that crafty manipulation and ruthless seizure of power are often the best path to the stability for everyone .
Diversity of all forms is destructive .
Although I ’m not the biggest Ann Coulter fan , she nails it :
Never in recorded history has diversity been anything but a problem .
Look at Ireland with its Protestant and Catholic populations , Canada with its French and English populations , Israel with its Jewish and Palestinian populations .
Or consider the warring factions in India , Sri Lanka , China , Iraq , Czechoslovakia ( until it happily split up ) , the Balkans and Chechnya .
Also look at the festering hotbeds of tribal warfare — I mean the beautiful mosaics — in Third World hellholes like Afghanistan , Rwanda and South Central , L.A. “ Diversity ” is a difficulty to be overcome , not an advantage to be sought .
True , America does a better job than most at accommodating a diverse population .
We also do a better job at curing cancer and containing pollution .
But no one goes around mindlessly exclaiming : “ Cancer is a strength ! ” “ Pollution is our greatest asset ! ”
At the End of the Day , Diversity has jumped the shark , horrifically
This applies to all forms in which we can have diversity : of values system , of opinion , of religion , ability ( IQ and otherwise ) , of ethnicity .
This does not mean we favor “ monoculture , ” but that everyone be pulling in roughly the same direction .
Right now , there is no greater taboo than speaking against diversity , because it ties in to two of our biggest sacred cows : first , equality as a means of class warfare , or protecting the masses of us against those who have higher ability and might take it all ; second , the idea of the individual as coming from a “ blank slate ” in which we are each the architects of ourselves , nevermind that the best evidence suggests we inherit our personalities , intelligence and bodies and make only minor modifications in our lifespans .
There is no way we are not affecting our world .
You have a straw man in the public eye , global warming , which is used as a surrogate for all of our impact on the environment , and which has become a political pawn for third - world financial revenge against the first world .
But think of all we do n’t mention : the overfishing , the loss of natural habitats , the inability to find a square foot of earth without a crushed coke can or cigarette butt , the pollution and the trace elements we have rearranged .
Climate change is bad news , surely , but it ’s probably more complex than just carbon — most likely , the real culprit is our concrete cities reflecting heat while we remove the forests that renew moisture and oxygen while we also pollute .
Global warming is like blaming our fingernail polish color for ruining an hideous outfit : many things are wrong , but it makes us feel comfortable to zero in on one .
All of these fears — fear of the more competent , fear of lack of autonomy of the individual , fear of power — boil down to a single human trait : fear of incompetence .
I do n’t think any longer that death is what we fear ; in fact , I think many embrace death because it ends their lives without requiring their own intervention .
What we do fear is powerlessness , insignificance , being left out , and so on .
So we create a herd mentality that obligates others to include us , immediately fostering an environment of servile insincerity .
Our sophomoric reasoning may have arisen from any number of potential causes that are also its effects , like egalitarianism , religious strife , class warfare , lowered intelligence , populism and so on .
But decay is a complex process that rarely has a single starting point ; instead , it has many potential starting points from which the disease spreads to all others .
Think of the organ systems : if the heart starts to fail , so do the lungs , and eventually the brain , and if any of those started to fail first , the process would happen in reverse .
It ’s not a linear process but a parallel one , like all complex things in life .
We insist on a reality that feels good to us .
We use it to make others feel happy so we can sell them products or ideas .
Then , we are dismayed that we have obscured actual reality , and people prefer the fake reality .
It ’s like the mice in the lab experiment where pushing a button gets them cocaine ; well , who wants to go back to dreary lab cage reality when there ’s coke around ?
They push the button until they starve .
The smartest among us have been talking , for many centuries , about “ waking up . ”
We live in a dream , they remind us ; a dream made of our combined populist notions , democratic votes , consumerist marketing and social / politeness viewpoints which we trade around like Monopoly money .
Our decline has gotten to the point where we cannot talk honestly about even the most basic aspects of our society , so we do not make decisions , so the process continues unraveling while we sit in the middle like neurotic rape victims wondering what ’s happening to us .
Each generation passes these problems to another .
The positive way to look at this is that they solved the problems they could , but are leaving the ones they could not .
It ’s time for us to accept the fear of speaking taboo , and very professionally sidestep it , so we do n’t leave our children even bigger problems .
Life is worth living and so it ’s worth living well , which means we need to abandon the sophomoric tendency of picking only the few attributes of reality we want to see , and instead , we need to start thinking structurally about it , considering every factor at once — but that requires that first we get honest with ourselves .

Obama ‘ giving his generals a little too much leeway ’
Congressman Dennis Kucinich says President Barack Obama ought to fire the generals who publicly aired their views on the war in Afghanistan during this fall ’s deliberations on a troop surge .
The Ohio Democrat known for his anti-war views said there is “ no question ” that the president was pressured by the military into approving a 30,000 - troop surge .

“ Some of [ Obama ’s ] generals made remarks publicly , which is unheard of , ” Kucinich told Russia Today .
“ Generals are subordinate to the Commander - in - Chief .
When generals start trying to suggest publicly what the president should do , they should n’t be generals anymore .
That ’s the way it works .
And frankly , President Obama , who is a good man , has given his generals a little too much leeway . ”
Kucinich also said that the Constitutional mechanism for declaring and waging war , which gives authority over the issue to Congress , has been eroded by successive presidencies that have not seen fit to ask Congress for permission for military campaigns abroad .
“ We ’ve had a series of presidents who have basically taken the initiative to go to war and had n’t really checked with Congress , ” Kucinich said .
“ Richard Nixon prolonged a war in Vietnam and he did so when many efforts were made by members of congress to cut off funds . ”
Kucinich has tabled a resolution in Congress that calls for a vote on a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan .

The old old time religion Theold time religion
Ross Douthat ,
But as the Pew chart suggests , there is one sense in which religion was less influential in mid-century American life than it is today , and that 's the realm of personal mystical experience .
Slightly more people went to church in 1962 , but many fewer people went out looking for their own private encounters with the numinous .
This is n’t a surprising correlation , since the traditional Christian churches tended to either discourage mystical freelancing or ( in the case of Catholicism ) encourage it only within the framework of monastic discipline .
The churches constrained and channeled Americans ' religious impulses ; their declining influence let a hundred mystic flowers bloom .
Christianity became less culturally powerful , but religion itself - whether you were a tongues - speaking Pentecostal , a Gaia - communing pantheist , or some combination thereof - became much more freewheeling and intense .
Whether atheists , agnostics , and secular - minded Americans should prefer this dispensation depends on which raises their hackles more :
Having laws and moral norms that are heavily influenced by Christianity , or having a culture that 's heavily influenced by mysticism and supernaturalism .
If you favor legal abortion , no - fault divorce , and easy access to pornography , today 's America is a more pleasant place to live than the America of mid-century .
( Especially if , like some atheists , you find pantheism to be the most congenial form of theism . )
But if you do n't like having your seatmate on an airplane ask if you 've been born again ... if you do n't like being harangued at cocktail parties about the Mayan apocalypse or the healing power of crystals ... if you do n't like seeing the shelves at your local bookstores filled up by authors who claim to have conversed with the Almighty ... well , then you might legitimately feel nostalgia for an earlier , less mystical America .
I recently recorded a diavlog with Nicholas Wade on More often when you strip away adherence to theology you do not get atheism , you get animism .
Is this good for the small set of atheists and asupernaturalists ?
On an interpersonal level it might add a bit more confusion to one 's life , as you never know which direction someone trying to sell you on supernaturalism is going to come from .
But on a societal level it probably reduces the ability of religious elites to manipulate sects as cohesive functional units toward their ends .
Ross Douthat , Into The Mystic I recently recorded a diavlog with Nicholas Wade on The Faith Instinct .
In that book Nicholas outlines the change in religion from its " primitive " state to what we would term " higher religion . "
Higher religion is built on the foundations of primitive religion , as institutional religion becomes less powerful in the lives people in the Western world people seem to be reverting back to their cognitive " default " settings .

An eye - wateringly accurate reproduction of the Back To The Future DeLorean recently popped up on eBay .
The photo shoot took place at Gamble House , the Pasadena home that once served as Doc Brown 's residence .
Mega - gallery below .

Biff Tannen gettin ' you down ?
Too many screen doors on your battleship ?
Do n't sweat it , McFly — there 's somebody home at eBay , and they want to sell you one of the coolest DeLorean time machine replicas ever built .
It 's the Libyans !
The car in question , a 1981 DeLorean DMC - 12 , was built by Gary Weaver , a Back to the Future enthusiast widely hailed as the leading authority on DeLorean time - machine replicas .
( There 's an authority on such things ?
Who knew ? )
Weaver has an extensive connection to the BTTF brand ; he owns BTTFparts.com and is often described as the go - to guy for parts sourcing and true - to - film accuracy .

The car you see here is the result of six years of research , not to mention countless hours of painstaking construction .
It was built on commission for a California owner who requested that no expense be spared and no corners be cut .
Everything from the 95 - mph speedometer ( U.S. - spec DMC - 12s are equipped with an 85 - mph unit ) to the programmable time circuits ( they light up and make the proper sheeow noise ) is blindingly accurate .
Here are a few of the key details , borrowed from the auction 's description :
• Built on a beautiful , super - clean , stock 1981 5 - speed DMC - 12 with over $ 16,000 of mechanical work and upgrades performed at DMC California in September of 2008 .
Approx . 78 K miles on vehicle .
• Programmable time circuits which function just like those in the film .
• Functioning digital speedometer on the dashboard ( reads actual vehicle speed ) .
• Main Time Circuit switch functions just like in the film , with all sound effects .
• All interior indicators and switches light up , just like in the film .
• Sound effects upon door opening .
• Screen-accurate " OUTATIME " metal - stamped license plate with 1986 registration tag .
• Eagle Goodyear GT tires , as seen in the film ( not pictured ) .

Yeah , we know : Ninety grand for a kitbashed DeLorean is one hell of a lot of money , and by and large , movie cars are pretty stupid .
Think of what you 're getting , though — this is n't just a period piece .
This is one of the few film vehicles that transcends the movie it appeared in .
It speaks to you .
It means something .
It does n't hate manure .
It 's also staggeringly well - done .
Most hacked - on DMCs are little more than a pile of neon tubing and some label - maker tape held together with baling wire and love .
The car you see here is as close as you 're likely to get to the real deal , and it's far more realistic than the two much - spanked stainless tramps that live on the Universal Studios backlot .
Buy it .
Love it .
Call us up and let us play with the time circuits .

Random Technical Accuracy Point :
The residence in the attached gallery is known as the Gamble House .
It was built in 1909 , from a design produced by architectural firm Greene and Greene , for Procter & Gamble 's David Gamble .
It 's located in Pasadena , California , and appears in the Back to the Future trilogy as the exterior of Doc Brown 's mansion .

Oh my goodness , you are going to die when you hear these ...

The girl did n't call him back , of course , but she did call her local Canadian radio show and had them play the messages on the air !
Oh my goodness , the insanity .
Email this to your friends -- he is still out there ! :)
Are n't the messages the worst ?!
They made me laugh and cringe at the same time .
Have you ever gotten a horrible message from a guy ?
Or a really great one ?
Once a guy had to call me back because he had forgotten to leave his number , and he apologized for the " Swingers " moment , which I thought was cute .

Iranian students were commemorating three scholars who were killed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi 's security forces on Dec 7 , 1953 , as they protested the ouster of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh .
Opposition websites announced plans to hold rallies this year to reinvigorate protests prompted by Iranian officials said 36 people were killed in the clashes that followed the election , while the opposition put the toll at 72 and said some of the deaths were the result of beatings during detention .
Meryl Dorey -- the truth - impaired mouthpiece of the Australian Vaccination Network , a group of antivaccination conspiracy - mongers who could n't find reality with both hands , a compass , and detailed instructions -- was " honored " by the Australian Skeptics this week .
Richard Saunders and Rachel Dunlop ( pictured ) , on behalf of the AS , gave Dorey their annual Bent Spoon award , awarded to " the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo - scientific piffle " .
Dorey certainly fits that bill !
She has n't met a conspiracy theory she has n't loved , or could n't use to threaten the public health with :
Meryl appeared on national television telling a reporter that “ we did n’t die from ( these diseases ) thirty years ago and we ’re not going to die from them now ” , juxtaposted alongside footage of babies gasping for breath as the journalist detailed the story of the death of Dana McCaffery from the vaccine preventable disease , whooping cough .
Dorey is also an HIV denier , and , as you can see from reading those links , doing her damndest to threaten public health .
It 's a shame someone like that has any voice at all in the media , as she spreads misinformation that can lead to the deaths of many people , and we know for a fact that the drop in herd immunity in areas where the AVN is loudest has resulted in deaths from preventable diseases .
The Skeptic Lawyer has more to say about her as well .
Dorey is going on the offensive , issuing a press release , going on radio , and being interviewed in papers saying how she 's proud to get this award , since skeptics are obviously just dogmatic shills for Big Pharma , etc .
And while she says this , people -- including babies -- sicken and some die due to vaccine - preventable illnesses .
Nice work , Dorey .
I 'm so glad you 're proud of the damage you 've done .
It 's a relief to finally lay hands on the Nook .
The dual - screen reader was just a prop at its unveiling so I 'm happy to report it works ( pretty ) well .
It ca n't kill Kindle yet , but it's an alternative worth considering .

A Two - Horse Race
Do this now : Disregard all other ebook readers on the market besides Nook and Kindle .
Unless you plan to get all of your books from back - alley torrents , or stick to self - published and out - of - copyright PDFs , you are going to need a reader with a good content - delivery system , one it connects to directly via wide - area network .
And as long as you 're set on e-ink as your preferred means of digital reading — and it 's still the choice that 's easiest on the eyes and the battery — you 're going to need a reader that is n't crapped up with gimmicks that supposedly compensate for the slow display .

But more on the Nook .
The thing that makes it special is its two screens : one e-ink for reading books , one touch LCD for navigating and buying books on .
More on that later , but basically , the setup works better than the single screen setups on the competition .
Sony messed up by putting a glare - inducing film over its screen to provide questionably beneficial touch controls ; iRex avoided that , but made a " touch " interface that requires a stylus .
Kindle plays it straight , developing a user interface that works well enough with physical buttons and e-ink ( as long as you do n't use the " experimental " browser ) .
Nook preserves the same pleasurable reading experience , but tucks in the capacitive - touch LCD screen for added control .
In its 1.0 implementation , Nook is not as fast or as smooth as it should be , but already it 's showing that the second screen is not a gimmick .

Still , I need to get this out of the way :
The second screen is not a sudden and miraculous cure for what ails ebook readers .
It may prove to be , but B&N 's current implementation is conservative .
As yet , there are too few occasions on the Nook when I notice an LCD feature and say " Kindle ca n't do that . "
In fact , the Kindle development team has n't been sitting on their asses — the latest firmware makes Kindle more sprightly than ever , with subtle but awesome user - interface improvements .
But Barnes & Noble is itself promising round - the - clock enhancing , optimizing and debugging over the next few months , and I would n't be surprised if there were three or four updates pushed through the Nook by March — the first possibly before Christmas .

Is it Good Enough Now
Does that mean it 's not ready now ?
Let me put it this way :
If you are lucky enough to have pre-ordered one in the first wave for the Dec. 7 shipping , or patient enough to wait until mid-January for the next wave , you are going to get a gadget worth being excited about .
And when Barnes & Noble gets its in - store offers and book - lending operation underway , Amazon will have to step up , or sit down .

Big Screen , Little Screen
The first thing I noticed about the LCD was that it was too bright .
E-ink is all about eyeball comfort , and I had n't really thought about how the LCD underneath would compromise that .
Because you do n't want your eyes to have to adjust every time you look down and back up again , it turns out you want that thing a lot dimmer than you might if it was a standalone device .
The automatic brightness adjuster is n't really up to the job , but I found that by dialing it all the way down when reading in bed , and bumping it up a tad , like to 20 % , when reading in sunlight , my eyes could look up and down without any annoyance .
Advertisement
The second thing I noticed about the LCD was how nice its keyboard was .
Unlike the Kindle , the Nook 's keyboard is only visible when you need it , and as an iPhone user , I found it natural and accurate .
The capacitive touch is a real boon , especially on a screen so small .
Besides the keyboard and assorted lists of settings and files , the little screen can display a directional pad for moving around text when highlighting or looking up words in the dictionary ; it can give you a search box and a place to type notations ; it can pop up the music player without leaving the page ; it flows book covers in your library and in the store .
And when the screen goes dark , you can make horizontal swipe gestures to turn the pages of the e-ink screen above .

Between the LCD and the e-ink screens is a little upside - down U , actually an " N " from the Nook 's logo .
This is covered with a capacitive - touch layer too , and serves as the " home " button , which wakes up the LCD with a tap , and takes you to the home screen with a double - tap .
( There are physical buttons , too : Two page - turn buttons on each side , and a power button on the top , which work as billed and have no hidden features . )

I found the capacitive interface to be handy , but it also revealed the bugginess of the early software .
Scrolling could be sticky , tapping the home button or the screen occasionally did nothing , and using the directional pad to navigate text made me yearn for the Kindle 's physical mini-joystick .
The biggest disappointment was the page - turning swipe gesture .
It failed to work half the time I tried it , and when it did work , I noticed that it responded slower than pressing the physical page - turn buttons .
I raised all of these issues with Barnes & Noble , and fortunately they are on top of this .
Fixing bugs and speeding up the UI are the primary goals for the first software revision , and I have no doubt that they will achieve their goals in due time , probably before most people can even buy their Nooks .

While You Read
The Nook wo n't beat the Kindle if all that LCD is for is facilitating navigation — the interface is n't a bad one , but in its current implementation , it 's just an alternative , not an upgrade .
The way B&N will beat Amazon is by making that damn screen do crazy stuff .
It should start by targeting people who read while doing 12 other things .

Me , I require concentration to get through a page , and even music is a distraction .
But for some people , it 's not hard to read a book while jamming to tunes , periodically glancing at news tickers , and responding to email or text messages .
This is the promise of Nook 's second screen .
It already does this to some extent .
The music player is n't much yet — and has a few kinks B&N is still working out , like automatically and unpleasantly alphabetizing all your songs — but it 's a real applet , unlike the Kindle's .
On the Kindle , you type Alt - Space to get a song to play , and you click F to advance to the next song .
That 's about it .
With the Nook , you can load up songs and then scroll through them all , picking one you want to hear , or shuffling the tracks .
There 's no physical volume button , but you can pull up a slider to adjust it , and another slider to jump around a song .
And you can do all of this without leaving the page of your book .

But when you look up a word in the dictionary , the definition pops up on the e-ink screen , not the LCD .
When you get an error message , again , the pop-up is on the e-ink .
Barnes & Noble designated the e-ink as the place where all " reading " would be done , and that includes messages and sidebar content .
I disagree with this , if only because the second screen seems tailor - made for alerts and other pop -up info .

The second screen is also a place for third - party developers to create fun and unexpected applets .
Barnes & Noble loves to remind reviewers and customers alike that this baby is powered by Android :
In other words , Nook may not look like a Motorola Droid , but developers could write apps for it just as easily .
Right now , the integrated Wi-Fi does n't feel like much of a bonus .
( Though it offers certain benefits when abroad , it only works with Wi -Fi networks that do n't require a pop-up webpage .
Free or not , those are few and far between . )
But Wi-Fi means that developers could write internet apps without fearing a crackdown by AT&T , which provides the no-fee wireless connectivity .
Paging Pandora !

When it comes to shopping for books ( and reading them ) , the Nook is the Kindle 's equal , and may soon leverage Barnes & Noble 's 800 physical locations to knock it out of first place .
I was not able to test these features , because they are only starting to roll out this week , but when you take a Nook to a B&N , it will automatically jump on the store 's Wi -Fi network , and offer you free goodies — not just downloads but cookies from the café and other treats .
Soon , there will be a way to skim an entire ebook while you 're in the store , too .
You might say , " Big deal , if I 'm in the store , I 'll just look at the real book . "
But that 's just the point :
How nice will it be to compare real and ebook editions before you buy ?
I asked B&N about bundles of real book and digital download , and they said discussions with publishers are underway .
Advertisement
Needless to say , one of the biggest advantages the Nook has over the Kindle is the chance for people to touch it before buying it .
B&N will start showing off
Nooks this week , and will add a few more ebook readers to its lineup , too .
People who were afraid of taking the plunge will see the benefits and buy .
( My pet theory as to why Sony and others have sold any ebook readers at all in the US is that they appear in retail locations , unlike Kindle .
Because if anything but the Nook was showcased side - by - side with the Kindle in a showroom , the decision to go with Amazon would be easy . )
Advertisement
Barnes & Noble has adopted a more natural attitude toward the books they sell , too , allowing you to access what you buy via ebook readers on Macs and PCs , iPhones and BlackBerrys ( and in a few months , Android phones ) as well as the Nook .
Amazon has an iPhone app but as yet there 's no way to read your Kindle book purchases on your own computer , and is now ( finally ) rolling out PC and Mac Kindle clients , as well as a BlackBerry app .
Advertisement
Speaking of Kindle downloads , some noise has been made about Kindle books being cheaper than B&N ebooks , but Barnes & Noble says that they are in the process of correcting their prices , basically evening them all out so that they 're no higher than Amazon's .
In my own experience , I found David Foster Wallace 's Infinite Jest for $ 10 and George RR Martin's A Game of Thrones for just $ 7 .
I was pretty pleased , though I was a tad annoyed that sales tax was n't included in the base price .
Be warned there .
Lending is another non-Kindle function rolling out this week that I 'll be following up on .
You select a book from your collection , lend it to someone listed in your Nook contacts , and they receive a message via email and on their Nook 's " Daily " screen , where periodicals , offers and other notices show up .
When they accept , they can read the book for two weeks .
During that time , you can't read it , and when it reverts back to you , they get a notice to buy .
You can't lend the same book to the same person twice .
Advertisement
You can also lend books to someone who does n't have a Nook , to read on their computer or iPhone or BlackBerry , though the notification only comes from email .
( Expect a radically redesigned iPhone client in January with lending and other features . )
The new readers from iRex and Plastic Logic will include the Barnes & Noble store , and all your purchases will be accessible on those devices .
However , at this point , those two devices wo n't have the lending capability .
Work in Progress
If I have n't said much about reading books on the Nook itself , it 's because it feels very much like a Kindle , right down to the page - turn buttons .
The screen is the same — there 's no discernible difference whatsoever .
Advertisement
Aesthetically , the Nook is better looking , less busy , with a more proportionate bezel ( and a wee bit more girth ) .
I like the gray rubber backing as much as I loved in on the original Kindle — I still do n't know why Amazon abandoned that .
Advertisement
The only hardware bummer was the sound of the integrated speakers — Kindle beats Nook here ( soundly ? ) , but since both have a 3.5 mm jack for headphones , it 's mostly a moot point .
The hardware is fully baked , but as I have mentioned the software is n't .
Aside from the stickiness of the interface and the flaws in the music player , I found a definite bug in the highlights - and - notes system .
I have already listed a what feels like a hundred tiny gripes , but I still have more , like why is n't there AAC playback ?
And why do I have to get to the home screen to see the clock ?
( Kindle now shows the time with a single tap of the Menu button , no matter where you are . )
I do know why there 's no Audible DRM support — because even the devices that supposedly support Audible files do n't support the ones most people buy from iTunes , so it 's a confusing mess for customers .
But I 'd still expect the nation 's biggest bookstore chain to get serious about audiobooks .
Advertisement
The great thing is that the fixes will come fast and steady , and like the iPhone , this thing will grow .
For those of you who took the plunge already , I do n't need to tell you to be careful with 1.0 software , because as early adopters you are prepared .
And for those of you who missed out on the first batch , guess what ?
That just means you can wait for the key bugglies to get fixed before you pony up $ 259 .
And for those who went for the Kindle this season instead ?
Congratulations , you have a very nice ebook reader too — for exactly the same price .
In fact , if you have to pick one right now , stick with the Kindle .
It 's a tough call , because I see a lot of potential in Nook that might not be in Kindle , but damn if the Kindle has n't grown to comfortably inhabit its e-ink skin .
As long as you do n't expect apps and extras on a Kindle , it delivers the best ebook experience there is at this moment .
And it just went international .
But while the limitations of a Kindle are clear , the limitations of the Nook are hazier , presumably further out .
Advertisement
For now , no one will laugh at you for owning either , though you will now surely be ridiculed for spending $ 400 on a Sony with glare issues , or — pardon me , iRex — anything that requires a stylus .
And since many third - party readers are going with the Barnes & Noble store , you'd be dumb to buy any of them instead of the Nook .
That may change in the future ( can you believe I made it this far without mentioning Apple Tablet ? ) but for now , in the ebook department , there 's just these two big dogs surrounded by a bunch of poodles .

In Brief
Advertisement
Great all - around ebook reader
Advertisement
Second screen serves useful purpose
Advertisement
Expansion and evolution possibilities of this very device are great , especially with touchscreen and Android OS
Advertisement
Lending and in - store Barnes & Noble action will be huge
Advertisement
A little thicker than Kindle , but as a tradeoff , it 's a little smaller footprint
Advertisement
Wi-Fi does n't seem to matter now — hopefully it will prove to be an advantage later
Advertisement
LCD and other features mean less battery life than Kindle , but still adequate , " measured in days "
Advertisement
Many of the Kindle killer functions , like lending and in - store perks , were n't tested , as they are rolling out this week

Current software is buggy and sluggish in spots ; hopefully fixes and optimization will come soon

Second - screen possibilities are great , but current implementation is cautious and conservative
Update 1 : Unboxing Pics , that I wanted to include because the packaging is just so classy :

Update 2 : A word on PDF viewing , which was brought up in comments .
Although PDFs are supported natively and use Adobe 's mobile PDF system , I can't say I was terribly impressed .
Page layout is easily mussed up , and instead of zooming , your only option is to change the font size , in so doing , re-flowing the text and adjusting the picture size .
In some ways this is better than on the Kindle , which appears to only offer a screen rotation option .
( Tap the font size button and you 'll see what I mean . )
In all truth , PDFs containing anything but text look pretty grim on either device , but for text - only ones , Nook seems to be a wiser pick .
Update 3 : Re : discussions of who has the better catalog , B&N 's is being overhauled this week , so expect to see a lot of new pricing and perhaps some newly available titles .
We 'll do some spot checking later on , but in the meantime , do n't be surprised if you see a lot of sudden changes to the lineup .
Advertisement
Update 4 : Some of you have asked me about the ePub format , which the Nook does natively support .
Third - party non-DRM
ePubs can be downloaded from the internet , and side - loaded into the documents folder inside the Nook .
When you look at your Documents screen , you 'll see them listed with the appropriate metadata .
When on screen , they are as adjustable as B&N - purchased ebooks , and generally look just as nice .
This image , the first to be released publicly from VISTA , the world ’s largest survey telescope , shows the spectacular star - forming region known as the Flame Nebula , or NGC 2024 , in the constellation of Orion ( the Hunter ) and its surroundings .
In views of this evocative object in visible light the core of the nebula is completely hidden behind obscuring dust , but in this VISTA view , taken in infrared light , the cluster of very young stars at the object ’s heart is revealed .
The wide - field VISTA view also includes the glow of the reflection nebula NGC 2023 , just below centre , and the ghostly outline of the Horsehead Nebula ( Barnard 33 ) towards the lower right .
The bright bluish star towards the right is one of the three bright stars forming the Belt of Orion .
The image was created from VISTA images taken through J , H and Ks filters in the near - infrared part of the spectrum .
The image shows about half the area of the full VISTA field and is about 40 x 50 arcminutes in extent .
The total exposure time was 14 minutes .

VISTA is the latest telescope to be added to ESO 's Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile .
It is housed on the peak adjacent to the one hosting the ESO Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and shares the same exceptional observing conditions .
VISTA 's main mirror is 4.1 metres across and is the most highly curved mirror of this size and quality ever made -- its deviations from a perfect surface are less than a few thousandths of the thickness of a human hair -- and its construction and polishing presented formidable challenges .
VISTA was conceived and developed by a consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by Queen Mary , University of London and became an in - kind contribution to ESO as part of the UK 's accession agreement .
The telescope design and construction were project - managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council 's UK Astronomy Technology Centre ( STFC , UK ATC ) .
Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at a ceremony at ESO 's Headquarters in Garching , Germany , attended by representatives of Queen Mary , University of London and STFC , on 10 December 2009 and the telescope will now be operated by ESO .
" VISTA is a unique addition to ESO 's observatory on Cerro Paranal .
It will play a pioneering role in surveying the southern sky at infrared wavelengths and will find many interesting targets for further study by the Very Large Telescope , ALMA and the future European Extremely Large Telescope , " says Tim de Zeeuw , the ESO Director General .
At the heart of VISTA is a 3 - tonne camera containing 16 special detectors sensitive to infrared light , with a combined total of 67 million pixels .
Observing at wavelengths longer than those visible with the human eye allows VISTA to study objects that are otherwise impossible to see in visible light because they are either too cool , obscured by dust clouds or because they are so far away that their light has been stretched beyond the visible range by the expansion of the Universe .
To avoid swamping the faint infrared radiation coming from space , the camera has to be cooled to - 200 degrees Celsius and is sealed with the largest infrared - transparent window ever made .
The VISTA camera was designed and built by a consortium including the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , the UK ATC and the University of Durham in the United Kingdom .
Because VISTA is a large telescope that also has a large field of view it can both detect faint sources and also cover wide areas of sky quickly .
Each VISTA image captures a section of sky covering about ten times the area of the full Moon and it will be able to detect and catalogue objects over the whole southern sky with a sensitivity that is forty times greater than that achieved with earlier infrared sky surveys such as the highly successful Two Micron All - Sky Survey .
This jump in observational power — comparable to the step in sensitivity from the unaided eye to Galileo 's first telescope — will reveal vast numbers of new objects and allow the creation of far more complete inventories of rare and exotic objects in the southern sky .
" We 're delighted to have been able to provide the astronomical community with the VISTA telescope .
The exceptional quality of the scientific data is a tribute to all the scientists and engineers who were involved in this exciting and challenging project , " adds Ian Robson , Head of the UK ATC .
The first released image shows the Flame Nebula ( NGC 2024 ) , a spectacular star - forming cloud of gas and dust in the familiar constellation of Orion ( the Hunter ) and its surroundings .
In visible light the core of the object is hidden behind thick clouds of dust , but the VISTA image , taken at infrared wavelengths , can penetrate the murk and reveal the cluster of hot young stars hidden within .
The wide field of view of the VISTA camera also captures the glow of NGC 2023 and the ghostly form of the famous Horsehead Nebula .
The second image is a mosaic of two VISTA views towards the centre of our Milky Way galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius ( the Archer ) .
Vast numbers of stars are revealed — this single picture shows about one million stars — and the majority are normally hidden behind thick dust clouds and only become visible at infrared wavelengths .
For the final image , VISTA has stared far beyond our galaxy to take a family photograph of a cluster of galaxies in the constellation of Fornax ( the Chemical Furnace ) .
The wide field allows many galaxies to be captured in a single image including the striking barred - spiral NGC 1365 and the big elliptical galaxy NGC 1399 .
VISTA will spend almost all of its time mapping the southern sky in a systematic fashion .
The telescope is embarking on six major sky surveys with different scientific goals over its first five years .
One survey will cover the entire southern sky and others will be dedicated to smaller regions to be studied in greater detail .
VISTA 's surveys will help our understanding of the nature , distribution and origin of known types of stars and galaxies , map the three - dimensional structure of our galaxy and the neighbouring Magellanic Clouds , and help determine the relation between the structure of the Universe and the mysterious dark energy and dark matter .
The huge data volumes — typically 300 gigabytes per night or more than 100 terabytes per year — will flow back into the ESO digital archive and will be processed into images and catalogues at data centres in the United Kingdom at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh .
All data will become public and be available to astronomers around the globe .
Jim Emerson of Queen Mary , University of London and leader of the VISTA consortium , is looking forward to a rich harvest of science from the new telescope : " History has shown us some of the most exciting results that come out of projects like VISTA are the ones you least expect — and I 'm personally very excited to see what these will be ! "

Shifting focus , they followed the events as they occurred .
During their filming , the crew recorded images of the events that they say contradict explanations given by Chávez opposition , the private media , the US State Department , and then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer .
The documentary says that the coup was the result of a conspiracy between various old guard and anti-Chávez factions within Venezuela and the United States .
Back in 2003 , John Hargrave of Zug.com posed as a 10 - year - old schoolboy and sent a written request to 100 U.S. Senators .
Armed with a mythical ‘ government project ’ set by his Social Studies teacher , Hargrave ’s temporary alter - ego politely asked each Senator to reply to him with his or her favourite joke .
Thankfully , some responded .
Below is my personal favourite , written by a certain Mr. John McCain a few years after his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2000 .
Unfortunately for McCain , following his second campaign in 2008 , the joke still stands .

UNITED STATES SENATE May 8 , 2003 Mr. John Hargrave
PO Box 57013
Babson Park , MA 02457-0012 Dear John :
Thank you for contacting my office to request a joke for your project .
I am happy to oblige .
Here is my favorite joke : I feel terrible for all the mothers in the state of Arizona .
Because , as you know , Barry Goldwater from Arizona ran for President of the United States , Morris Udall from Arizona ran for President of the United States , Bruce Babbitt from Arizona ran for President of the United States , and I , John McCain from Arizona ran for President of the United States … Arizona may be the only state in the nation where mothers no longer tell their children that some day they can grow up and be President of the United States .
It was a pleasure to hear from you .
If you would like information regarding my interests and history as a Senator , please refer to my website : mccain.senate.gov .
Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future .
Sincerely , ( Signed ) John McCain
United States Senator JM /amj

Parents are being urged to boycott shops selling pink toys and gifts by a campaign group .
Pinkstinks says the " pinkification " of little girls causes them to choose less challenging careers and pass up opportunities as they grow up .
Polly Toynbee and Justice Minister Bridget Prentice are among those backing the campaign .
The Government of Spain , one of the last bastions of legal peer - to - peer file sharing , has approved a law that 'll obliterate some of the most basic human rights , like freedom of speech and due process .
All in the name of money .

There 's a whole bunch of greedy " artists " — represented by the SGAE , the Spanish version of the RIAA , and some cinema associations — who most of the times are used by the Spanish socialist government to support their political agenda .
I say greedy because , in Spain , there 's an " artist tax " on everything that can be used to record something .
You buy a CD to do data backup at work ?
Does n't matter , the government 's friends assume you are a thief copying stuff , and charge you an extra for it .
Maybe you want a new camera to record your newborn baby ?
Well , that 's more expensive too because of the " artistic " tax .
Want an iPod ?
Pay extra .
A DVD-R unit ?
Give them more money .
Their argument for that tax was that , since people were pirating music and movies using the internet , the artistic associations should get a cut of all media and gadgets that could be used to copy music and movies .
I can argue that I do n't give a rat 's ass about the mostly lousy music produced in Spain , not to talk about their craptastic movies , but it 's ok .
Let 's say that I accept that premise and gladly pay the extra , even while it destroys the presumption of innocence .
P2P was legal in Spain — and still is — and everyone was happy .

Everyone but them .
They wanted more , and they got it as an obvious favor , returned by the socialist government now in power .
After passing the law hidden in another law , the artist associations can now close any web site they want , without a court order .
They only have to argue that the site may be used to share media , and the Minister of Culture will have to the power to close the site without any judge giving the go ahead , a true " Cultural Police . "
Goodbye democracy , hello National Socialism .
What 's more , they also want to be able to close the Internet connection of any user who uses the internet for P2P sharing , also without any due process .
This leaves everyone without any defense .
The artists associations and the Minister of Culture can shut down a business that can be perfectly legal , without having to answer to anyone .
Just because they say so .
Or they can close the internet connection of someone who was n't doing anything wrong .
All without confronting any judge with any solid evidence .
This means that the business or user would have to go to court to defend themselves after the damage is done , something that requires money .

In other words , no due process , no presumption of innocence , just shutting down web sites because someone with no judicial power says so .
They want to get their money from the artist tax and destroy P2P at the same time , demolishing some Spanish Constitutional rights in the process .
Needless to say , this has originated a huge response by Internet users , Human Rights activists , journalists , and bloggers , who have signed a manifesto against it .
Also needless to say , nobody in the government will do anything about it , which is one of the reasons why I do n't live in my home country anymore .

WE end this extraordinary financial year with news that the Treasury is in discussions with American International Group about selling the taxpayers ’ 80 percent ownership stake in that company .
The government recently permitted several banks to break free of its potential oversight by repaying loans made during the rescue .
But with respect to A.I.G. , the Treasury should not move so fast .
There is one job left to do .
A.I.G. was at the center of the web of bad business judgments , opaque financial derivatives , failed economics and questionable political relationships that set off the economic cataclysm of the past two years .
When A.I.G. ’s financial products division collapsed  ultimately requiring a federal bailout of $ 180 billion  those who had been prospering from A.I.G. ’s schemes scurried for taxpayer cover .
Yet , more than a year after the rescue began , crucial questions remain unanswered .
Who knew what , and when ?
Who benefited , and by exactly how much ?
Would A.I.G.’s counterparties have failed without taxpayer support ?
The three of us , as experienced investigators and prosecutors of financial fraud , cannot answer these questions now .
But we know where the answers are .
They are in the trove of e-mail messages still backed up on A.I.G. servers , as well as in the key internal accounting documents and financial models generated by A.I.G. during the past decade .
Before releasing its regulatory clutches , the government should insist that the company immediately make these materials public .
By putting the evidence online , the government could establish a new form of “ open source ” investigation .
Once the documents are available for everyone to inspect , a thousand journalistic flowers can bloom , as reporters , victims and angry citizens have a chance to piece together the story .
In past cases of financial fraud  from the complex swaps that Bankers Trust sold to Procter & Gamble in the early 1990s to the I.P.O. kickback schemes of the late 1990s to the fall of Enron  e-mail messages and internal documents became the central exhibits in our collective understanding of what happened , and why .

[ Author ’s Note : ]
This post , reacting to the findings of a University of California , Davis , study on fructose , quoted and relied heavily on an error - laden Times of London story .
That said , the post generated a lot of valuable discussion in the comments section below , including a critique of the Times piece by Dr. Kimber Stanhope , one of the authors of the Davis study .
In response to another comment , Dr. Stanhope agreed that the question remains how much fructose is safe to consume and she indicated that a current project of hers involves testing that question with HFCS itself .
As I said at the end of the piece , the fundamental issue is that we consume too much sugar in any form .
However , total fructose consumption has also increased dramatically thanks to juices and , yes , HFCS .
While the simple answer going forward is to consume less sugar period , looking backward , it seems to me that we will indeed discover that changes in consumption patterns in different type of sugar over the last thirty or so years played a significant role in the current obesity / diabetes epidemic .
Oh , and in case anyone from the Times of London is reading this , if you think I will ever link to or quote from one of your articles again , then you ’ve been drinking too much of the Kool - Aid that your boss Rupert Murdoch hands out .
Last year , a set of studies came out suggesting that the problem with high - fructose corn syrup was simply that people consumed too much of it .
There was , according to these studies , nothing unique to the chemistry of HFCS that suggested it played an oversized role in the current obesity epidemic ( aside from HFCS ’s little mercury problem , of course ) .
Even at the time , however , there was a tantalizing suggestion in the media coverage that maybe , just maybe there was still some special risk to consuming HFCS due its higher fructose concentration :
[ T ]he research appears to show that sucrose and high - fructose corn syrup are not that different , [ Professor of clinical nutrition Elizabeth ]
Parks says .
She believes there ’s some evidence that the way they are metabolized in the liver is different , but not in a way that makes the calories from high - fructose corn syrup more likely to be stored as fat .
Well , would n’t you know it , some resourceful scientists in UC Davis recently decided to look into that .
And here ’s what they found :
Scientists have proved for the first time that a cheap form of sugar used in thousands of food products and soft drinks can damage human metabolism and is fuelling the obesity crisis .
Fructose , a sweetener derived from corn , can cause dangerous growths of fat cells around vital organs and is able to trigger the early stages of diabetes and heart disease .
… Over 10 weeks , 16 volunteers on a strictly controlled diet , including high levels of fructose , produced new fat cells around their heart , liver and other digestive organs .
They also showed signs of food - processing abnormalities linked to diabetes and heart disease .
Another group of volunteers on the same diet , but with glucose sugar replacing fructose , did not have these problems .
Okay then .
This could be big .
The issue , by the way , is n’t so much the difference in the amount of fat fructose consumption produces .
It ’s what it does to our metabolism the way it ’s metabolized and where it puts the fat it creates goes that matters .
And I do n’t use the word “ our ” lightly .
Significantly , this is one of the first studies not to use what scientists refer to as an “ animal model , ” aka rats — this study was performed in humans .
And here ’s where the liver comes in [ UPDATED : this section adjusted and erroneous information , along with the quote from the source article , removed based on the study author ’s comment below ] – unlike glucose , some of which passes through the liver and is then excreted , 100 % of fructose that ’s consumed is taken up by the liver .
This is turn leads to increased fat deposition in the abdominal cavity and increased blood levels of triglycerides — both of which are risk factors for heart disease and diabetes .
To be clear , this is something other sugars do n’t do .
It ’s a special feature of fructose .
And once scientists started looking more closely at the metabolic changes process and the way the fat was distributed , they saw the damage fructose can do to the human body .
Now , as Fooducate observes the study used 100 % fructose to test this effect , not HFCS itself , which is 55 % fructose .
A common observation is that white sugar is 50 % fructose and thus will cause some of this as well , so what ’s the difference ?
Well , that extra bit of fructose in HFCS [ not to mention the other sources of fructose in our diets ] may be all the difference we need over a lifetime of consumption to create serious health problems .
It ’s both tempting and misguided to search for a silver bullet for obesity epidemic and there ’s no question that reducing or removing added sugar from our diet is a necessary step .
But a lingering coincidence remains that the obesity epidemic exploded around 1980 — the same time that HFCS was introduced into our food system on a mass scale .
And it ’s not hard to come up with a scenario where the introduction of HFCS changed not only the total amount of sugar that we consumed but also the percentage of that sugar that was fructose in a way that meaningfully affected our metabolisms .
And that effect may have been large enough to push rates of diabetes and obesity to unsustainable levels .
As a result , I do believe it ’s fair to say that the causal arrow for that marginal increase in serous health effects from obesity is starting to point in the direction of HFCS .
The industry , of course , will continue to obfuscate , as this UK group did in its immediate response to the new data :
Rejecting the California research , a spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation , a UK industry trade group , said : “ It makes no sense to highlight one single ingredient as a cause of obesity . ”
On the other hand , sometimes the shoe simply fits .
I have no doubt that now that scientists know where to look , HFCS is in for some serious science - based trouble .
Not that our government will bother to help us on this front , no matter how dangerous to our health HFCS may prove to be .
But how does it make you feel to know that not only is that bisphenol A - lined can of soda altering your hormones , it ’s changing the way your digestive and metabolic systems function , too !
My advice : next time you ’re tempted to grab an HFCS - sweetened soda ( which is to say pretty much any soda ) , just watch this .
It ’s been awhile since I ’ve been here , particularly in this manner .
It ’s a little stressful .
Stressful because I want to make it so astonishingly interesting that everyone who reads this will get so overwhelmed with excitement that they ’ll write it backwards on their face to remember to come back or who cares just curious enough to consider coming back that they put a note in their phone or something .
Because of the work behind it .
Because of all the hours of planning and all the hours of writing and then that feeling when it comes together or when sound is just right , or when someone hits that part and everybody shouts , those feelings .
Because it had to be mixed in 5 days .
Because the master was n’t quite right .

You ’d be hard - pressed to find a bigger Matt Hughes fan than me .
But after reading Hughes ’ latest blog entry , you have to wonder if he is the world ’s greatest company man or if he is suffering from some delusional disorder .
He writes about pal Robbie Lawler being pulled off the card when opponent Trevor Prangley was hurt just days before the event .
Last week I was in California with Robbie , Pena , and Foster , hoping they would find a replacement so Robbie could fight .
It did n’t happen and I guess I ’m just spoiled being with the UFC .
From what I understand , Showtime really likes to stick their nose in Strikeforce ’s business and because of that I do n’t think that Strikeforce will be around for much longer ; but enough with that .
Strikeforce has grown from a solid regional show to a national dynamo in short order .
On their roster they have :
The world ’s greatest mixed martial artist in Fedor Emelianenko
Their own Brock Lesnar in Bobby Lashley
One of the all - time best MMA fighters in Dan Henderson
Exciting , young fighters like Gegard Mousasi , Brett Rogers , King Mo Lawal , Jacare , Nick Diaz and many more
The best female fighters in the world : Cris Cyborg , Marles Coenen , Sarah Kaufman , Gina Carano and others
Strikeforce is here to stay .
And you do n’t have to pay $ 50 bucks to see it .
To say that they wo n’t be around for long is just stupid .

This is a guest post by Phil Scadden , a regular commenter at Hot Topic ( bio at the end of the post ) .
Phil ’s interested in energy issues , and has spent a considerable amount of his personal time developing an overview of New Zealand ’s energy issues , inspired by the approach used by Cambridge physicist David MacKay in his recent book Sustainable Energy – without all the hot air .
I ’m very pleased to say that Phil is making his work available via Hot Topic ( PDF here ) , because the perspective he brings provides a starting point for the strategic energy debate we need to be having .
Over to Phil :
Sustainable Energy – without all the hot air by Cambridge physicist David MacKay is an excellent and highly readable book of numbers about the questions associated with sustainable energy ( available as a free download at www.withouthotair.com).
As an advocate of sustainable energy , he describes himself as “ pro-arithmetic ” rather than a campaigner for one type of energy production over another , which is surely what informed debate needs .
Rather than dealing with daunting numbers , he reduces energy calculations to units of kWh / person / day .
1kWh is the unit we pay for in our electricity bills — the energy used by one bar heater switched on for one hour .
If you want to prioritise savings then you need to read this book .
Turning off a cell phone charger when not in use for a year saves the energy found in one hot bath .
“ If everyone does a little , then we will achieve only a little ” .
The majority of MacKay ’s calculations are done for the UK , and I was interested in a New Zealand perspective .
To this end , I have used a similar approach to look at two questions .
Can New Zealand maintain its current per capita energy consumption without fossil fuels and , in particular , can we live on renewable energy sources alone ?
How can we achieve a BIG reduction in our personal and national energy consumption , in order to reduce our power requirements ?
The detailed document ( about 20 pages ) can be downloaded here , but this is a quick overview .
Currently 30 % of NZ ’s energy comes from renewable generation .
My calculations ( based mainly on 2007 data ) show that NZ has the potential to increase this to nearly 100 % over the next few decades , thus eliminating fossil fuel use , while still maintaining our current per capita energy consumption ( assuming no significant population growth ) .
We could do this initially with new hydro , geothermal and wind generation , while large - scale solar and marine technologies are promising options for the future .
Biofuels are feasible but only at the expense of considerable agricultural intensification .
NZ is energy - rich , but every option using renewable sources has its own problems .
If we do n’t like the environmental and other consequences of the available generation options , the only alternative is to reduce our power requirements .
Vehicle fuel is NZ ’s largest energy use ( about a third of our total ) so savings in this area have the potential for greatest significance .
Optimistically , we might be able to reduce our energy needs by up to 25 % by 2030 , by savings and improved technology ( especially electrification of transport ) .
I have also constructed an example plan that could be reasonably executed by 2025 , incorporating both generation and conservation measures .
This plan includes a huge number of windmills ( 10,000 + ) , the 8 highest priority hydro schemes ( including Lower Waitaki and Clutha ) , all geothermal schemes which could be consented within current resource management law , solar hot water and solar photovoltaic panels for half the homes in NZ , completion of home insulation , and large - scale adoption of electric cars .
These combined measures could potentially allow NZ to operate on all - renewable energy , at an estimated cost of $ 91 - 174B .
( Compare this with NZâ€™s GDP of $ 177B , or Sustainable Energy R&D of $ 0.032B ) .
Note that , if we want to live on renewable energy , we donâ€™t have to say yes to every wind and hydro proposal but we have to say yes to a great many of them .
And if we want power to be affordable for everyone , we have to say yes to proposals in places where it is cost - effective to generate power .
Living on renewables is relatively easy for our current population of 4 million .
Doing the calculations for 14 million would be more difficult .
To maintain the country in even close to its current state , we need to constrain population growth as a priority .
In addition to energy sourced in NZ , New Zealanders also contribute to overseas energy use , with opportunities for considerable savings .
This applies particularly to air travel and imported â€œstuffâ€ ( eg the embodied energy in our imports from China ) .

The Magical Power of Attributes in Spirit – Primitives By Hartmut Kaiser
Spirit V2.1 has been released only a couple of weeks ago .
The first feedback we have gotten so far was overwhelming !
Many people seem to quickly understand the concepts of the new library , being able to apply its power to their needs .
We try to follow people ’s comments and watch for reported problems .
There is one theme recurring over and over again : attributes .
This new ( for Spirit ) concept turns out to be the most difficult idea to understand , especially for somebody starting to work with the library .
While writing the article I realized that it may be too long for a single entry .
So , I decided to split this article into several parts which will be published over the next couple of days .
The additional benefit of splitting the article is to have more room for detailed descriptions and examples .
My plan is to write three articles : about primitives , operators , and non-terminals .
Introduction
So here is the breaking news : all components in Spirit expose their specific attributes , all grammars are fully attributed .
This is different from earlier versions of the library , where almost all parsers exposed the pair of iterators pointing to the matched input sequence .
Only very few parsers exposed an attribute ( most notably the numeric parsers ) .
Additionally , Spirit is not only about parsers anymore , so I will explain the concept of attributes applied to Qi ( the parser library ) and Karma ( the generator library ) at the same time .
Generally , the idea to work with attribute grammars is not new .
Let me quote Wikipedia :
An attribute grammar is a formal way to define attributes for the productions of a formal grammar , associating these attributes to values .
The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the abstract syntax tree , when the language is processed by some parser or compiler .
The attributes are divided into two groups : synthesized attributes and inherited attributes .
The synthesized attributes are the result of the attribute evaluation rules , and may also use the values of the inherited attributes .
The inherited attributes are passed down from parent nodes .
The key to understanding all this is that all elements of a grammar have their associated , synthesized attribute .
For parsers ( Spirit .
Qi ) this is the value matched from the input .
For generators ( Spirit . Karma ) this is the value for which to emit output , and as in this case it is not really ‘ synthesized ’ anymore we call it the consumed attribute .
As quoted above , in attribute grammars all elements additionally may accept inherited attributes .
Inherited attributes are additional arbitrary values passed down from parent nodes during parsing or output generation .
These are used to pass along additional contextual information .
In Spirit almost all components support receiving inherited attributes as well .
We will see examples of that later .
Different Spirit components handle attributes differently .
Some parser components directly generate their attribute from the input , other parsers combine attributes synthesized by more primitive components based on well defined rules .
Generators are similar .
Some generators directly consume their attribute converting it into the character stream passed to the output , other , more complex generators , split their attribute into smaller pieces .
These smaller pieces serve as consumed attributes of more primitive generator components being invoked as a child .
All this happens based on well defined attribute propagation rules .
Below we will explain those attribute propagation rules for all different types of components ( parsers and generators ) .
We will use the following functions in the examples below .
The first pair of functions will be used to demonstrate different concepts for parsers .
They take some input , a parser component and ( optionally ) the expected attribute .
Both will return true if the given input has been successfully matched .
template < typename P > bool test_parser ( P const& p , char const* input ) { using boost : : spirit : : qi:: parse ; char const* f( input ) ; char const* l(f + strlen ( f ) ) ; return parse ( f , l , p ) ; } template < typename P , typename Attr > bool test_parser ( P const& p , char const * input , Attr const& expected ) { using boost : : spirit : : qi:: parse ; char const* f( input ) ; char const* l(f + strlen ( f ) ) ;
Attr attr ; return parse( f , l , p , attr ) && f == l && attr == expected ; }
The second pair of functions are simple wrappers to demonstrate generators .
They take the generator , the ( optional ) attribute to output , and the expected output .
The function succeeds if the expected output has been successfully emitted .
template < typename G > bool test_generator ( G const& g , char const* expected ) { using boost :: spirit :: karma:: generate ; std::string s ; std::back_insert_iterator<std::string > sink (s ) ; return generate ( sink , g ) && s == expected ; } template < typename G , typename Attr > bool test_generator ( G const& g , Attr const& attr , char const* expected ) { using boost :: spirit :: karma:: generate ; std::string s ; std::back_insert_iterator<std::string > sink (s ) ; return generate ( sink , g , attr ) && s == expected ; }
Primitive Components
The primitive components are the basic building blocks for any parser or generator .
Primitive parsers are used to match the input stream based on their settings and usually convert the matched data into their attribute .
Primitive generators do the opposite : they convert their attribute into a character stream based on their settings .
The attribute type is component specific .
For example the primitive parser qi::int_ tries to match a character sequence comprising an C++ integer ( int ) .
In case of a match it exposes the matched integer as an int attribute .
At the same time the primitive generator karma : : int_ expects an int attribute which will be converted into a character sequence .
Here are two examples using int_ :
assert ( test_parser ( qi::int_ , " 1234 " , 1234 ) ) ; assert( test_generator ( karma : :int_ , - 12 , " - 12 " ) ) ;
Other primitive components have equally intuitive attributes : char_ has char , double_ has double , and ulong_ has an unsigned long .
For a full list of available components and their attributes please see the documentation ( Qi parsers and Karma generators ) .
In addition to the type of the synthesized attribute for parsers and the consumed attribute for generators we have to consider whether a given ( user supplied ) attribute is compatible with the component .
For primitive components this means that the usual C++ convertibility rules apply .
For parsers you can use any attribute type as long as the attribute of the component is ( C++ ) convertible to it .
For generators any attribute type can be used that is ( C++ ) convertible to the generators consumed attribute .
For instance , it is possible to pass a long to an int_ parser ( parsing an integer into a long ) , or to pass a short to an int_ generator ( emitting output for a short using the integer component ) :
assert ( test_parser ( qi::int_ , " 1234 " , long ( 1234 ) ) ) ; assert ( test_generator ( karma : :int_ , short ( - 12 ) , " - 12 " ) ) ;
Some primitive components do not expose any attribute .
Well , actually these expose a special attribute type spirit :: unused_type , but all parts of the library treat this as if the component did n’t expose any attribute at all .
The most notable example is the lit ( ) component which takes character , integer , or string arguments .
The qi:: lit parser matches it ’s literal parameter and the karma : : lit generator emits it .
Both versions do not expose / consume an attribute .
We will see later why this is needed and very useful .
Here are two small examples :
assert ( test_parser ( qi:: lit ( " abc " ) , " abc " ) ) ; assert ( test_generator ( karma : : lit( - 12 ) , " - 12 " ) ) ;
Semantic Actions
I ’m planning to write an entire article about Spirit ’s semantic actions , which are the major means of attaching code to components .
Semantic actions give you the ability to execute user defined code either after a parser component has successfully matched its input ( qi ) or before a generator gets invoked ( karma ) .
Their relation to attributes is simple : semantic actions for parsers are getting called with the parser ’s synthesized attribute , while those attached to generators are responsible to return the value the generator is supposed to emit output from ( the generator ’s consumed attribute ) .
The syntax for attaching semantic actions is : qi::int _ [ … your code here … ] .
In the context of the articles about attributes I will demonstrate their usage and the implications for attributes based on constructs implemented with Boost .
Phoenix .
In short :
The Phoenix library enables functional programming ( FP ) techniques such as higher order functions , lambda ( unnamed functions ) , currying ( partial function application ) and lazy evaluation in C ++.
If you need more information about Phoenix , please refer to the documentation .
Let me give you an example :
assert ( test_parser( qi::int_[std::cout << qi::_1 ] , " 1234 " ) ) ; // 1234 assert(test_generator( karma::int_[karma::_1 = - 12 ] , " - 12 " ) ) ;
Spirit introduces special constructs allowing to seamlessly build semantic actions with Phoenix .
The qi::_1 and karma::_1 used in the example above are Phoenix placeholders referring to the parser ’s synthesized attribute ( and the generator ’s consumed attribute ) .
The expression std:: cout << qi::_1 will be executed after the parser qi::int_ matched its input and , as the placeholder qi::_1 refers to the synthesized attribute , it will print 1234 to the standard output .
Correspondingly , the expression karma:: _1 = – 12 will be executed before the generator is invoked and , as the placeholder karma:: _1 refers to the consumed attribute of the generator , it will emit – 12 .
Those placeholders represent the corresponding attribute literally , that means they have the type of the attribute they refer to .
You can think of the Phoenix expressions inside the semantic actions as of special purpose lambda functions which ‘ know ’ how to access the attributes of the components they are attached to .
Conclusion
So far no magic has shown up , but we covered the basics needed to understand the attribute handling and propagation rules of Spirit ’s operators , directives and non-terminals .
Stay tuned !
Honduras : The Coup That Never Happened
Latin America • December 22 , 2009 • Tyler Shipley
“ When the media goes quiet , the walls speak . ” — graffiti in Tegucigalpa .
What strikes a visitor to the Honduran capital most immediately in this moment is the degree to which the social and political conflict that has erupted since the golpe de estado ( coup d’etat ) on June 28th is actually written on the walls , the fences , the rockfaces , bridges , errant bits of siding , abandoned buildings , and even the concrete upon which one walks .
Though the discourse in the international press is muddled and misinformed , the situation in Honduras is very obvious to those who are here – as a quick taxi ride around Tegucigalpa demonstrates .
Honduras has been long dominated by a handful of some ten to fifteen wealthy families .
Everyone here knows their names – Facusse , Ferrari , Micheletti – and now they are scrawled on walls everywhere , next to accusations of golpista ( coup - supporter ) and asesino ( assassin ) .
These oligarchs used to be satisfied by controlling the economy and buying off the politicians , but they now increasingly insist upon exercising direct political control themselves , and their names show up more and more in congress , in the supreme court and now even in the executive branch .
It is in that context that an event that fit perfectly the definition of a coup is being recast by the Honduran elite , and its foreign allies , as a constitutional transfer of power .
Never mind that the democratically elected President was abducted from his home and flown out of the country in his pyjamas on the morning of a non-binding referendum on re-opening the constitution to reform .
Never mind that the movement to reform the constitution was driven by a social movement that wanted to re-found the country along more equitable lines , breaking the decades of uncontested dominance by the few over the many .
Never mind that President Manuel Zelaya ’s only transgression was that he was appealing directly to the people , in defiance of a congress and supreme court that was subservient to the oligarchy and would never consent to reforming a constitution that was written to serve their interests .
These details – say the golpistas – are not important .
Instead , they spin a tale in which Zelaya was a minion of Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chávez ( who according to this discourse is inherently bad ) and claim that Zelaya intended to change the constitution to make himself president - for - life .
In order to preserve democracy , the story says , the congress and supreme court proceeded with a legal process to remove the elected president and replace him until new elections could be held .
This story has been taken up by the international press , despite its being patently untrue , and repeated ad nauseam in the hopes of giving legitimacy to a process that seeks to re-entrench an oligarchy feeling its power threatened for the first time in decades .
The U.S.S. Honduras
The central issue at stake in Honduras today – and the spark for the oligarchy ’s risky decision to carry out the coup in June – is the increasingly adamant insistence on the part of Honduran social movements for a constituyente , the striking of an assembly to re-write the constitution .
It was , indeed , this very question that was to be put to a non-binding referendum on the morning of the coup and it was expected that the people would support the idea overwhelmingly .
Like many of its Central and South American neighbours , Honduras ’ principle legal code was written during a period dominated by U.S. Cold War imperialism and local comprador quasi- fascists .
The legacy of the Operation Condor / School of the Americas era was , among so many other tragedies , legal and political structures that ensured the continued dominance of the elite few and Honduras was a perfect case study .
In fact , the current constitution of Honduras was ratified in 1982 , during the period in which it earned the nickname ‘ U.S.S. Honduras . ’
The most successful resistance group in Honduras in the 1970s was called the National Federation of Honduras Peasants ( FENACH ) and was n’t able to muster the kind of strength that the Sandinistas in Nicaragua built , nor even to achieve the limited level of challenge of the guerillas in Guatemala or El Salvador .
As a result , Honduras became the perfect base for U.S. operations in Central America , and indeed the Contra Wars against Nicaragua were waged from the U.S. military base at Palmerola , just outside of Tegucigalpa , among countless other interventions and terror campaigns in the region .
In addition to the 18 military bases it established and the 10,000 American troops stationed there , the U.S. also provided the Honduran armed forces with over $ 100 - million between 1980 - 84 .
This infusion of money and technical support to the military and business elite reinforced the strength of the oligarchy in Tegucigalpa and led to dramatic increases in poverty , inequality and political repression .
The 1982 constitution was written after decades of military dictatorship while Honduras was playing host to a U.S. - led paramilitary contra force of over 15,000 soldiers trained in what we now call ‘ counter - insurgency ’ – specializing in campaigns of terror against primarily poor and ill - equipped guerilla forces and their supporters .
During that period , according to Joan Kruckewitt , “ the use of repression , instead of concessions and reform , became the norm ” and that “ the military emerged from the period of U.S. - led militarization as the most powerful sector in the country , with few checks and balances to restrain them . ”
Indeed , between 1981 - 84 , while the new constitution was being written , ratified and established into political order , the military carried out 214 political assassinations , 110 ‘ disappearances , ’ and 1,947 illegal detentions .
Given that context , calling the 1982 constitution ‘ representative ’ of any but the most elite strata of Honduran society would be patently absurd ; the vast majority of people in the country were living in abject poverty and ceaseless fear of their own soldiers and police .
But as the political climate in Latin America has shifted , and as new openings for emancipatory projects have emerged , Hondurans have become increasingly insistent on the need to re-establish the country on their own terms .
Social movements centered around trade - unions , human rights and campesino groups increasingly drew people from a wide variety of Honduran civil society into a broad movement for significant reform , and had their greatest successes between 2005 - 2008 under President Manuel “ Mel ” Zelaya .
June 28th and the Demise of Democracy
Perhaps the most interesting thing about June 28th was the way that it created Mel Zelaya as a popular figure in Honduras .
He was elected President in 2005 as a member of the Liberal Party , one of the two primary parties , neither known for any history of radicalism .
Zelaya ’s own background was as a junior - member of the oligarchy , a wealthy rancher from the south , and his long political career had never shown any signs of divergence from the standard conservatism of Honduran politics .
In fact , the only thing that separated Zelaya from someone like Roberto Micheletti – the tremendously unpopular figure who emerged as de facto President after the coup – was that he recognized the growing popularity of the movements for social reform .
His decisions to raise the minimum wage , to declare a moratorium on foreign mining concessions and to veto a law banning birth - control pills were not simply manifestations of his own radical spirit , no matter how noble his intentions may have been .
No , Zelaya executed in a calculating way – through undeniably positive – political decisions that kept him palatable to the people on whom his support relied .
Indeed , he relied on that support increasingly after his support for the constituent assembly broke him from his allies in the Liberal Party .
But Zelaya before June 28th was simply a means to an end for the social movements in Honduras – a politician who had proven to be malleable to demonstrations of popular politics .
His endorsement of the constituyente was the most important move he made and , in fact , he conducted the process with due diligence to the existing constitution and , despite its being repeated in every AP news bulletin since the coup , it never contained even the possibility of giving Zelaya another term in office .
The process was to be as follows : on June 28th , Hondurans would vote in a non-binding referendum on whether they supported the addition of a fourth ballot in the general elections scheduled for Nov. 29th .
Normally , Honduran elections feature three ballots , corresponding to each of the three levels of government .
If the referendum came back with a strong ‘ yes , ’ Zelaya would have added the fourth ballot asking the question “ do you support the creation of a national constituent assembly to re-draft the constitution ? ”
Accordingly , the constitution could not have possibly been changed before the Nov. 29th elections , and so Zelaya could not have possibly stood for re-election .
Furthermore , the primaries for that election had already taken place and , again , Zelaya ’s name was not put forward – even had he wanted to , it was illegal .
The notion that Zelaya intended to manipulate the process to stay in power is patently absurd .
But the Honduran Congress , packed with members of the oligarchy , felt that the re-opening of the constitution could represent a real threat to their stranglehold on power and refused to accept the idea .
Zelaya , in response , appealed directly to the people – implicitly rejecting the legitimacy of the Honduran form of representative democracy that had brought him to power in the first place – and vowed to pursue the constituyente if the people asked for it .
Of course , that process never went ahead , because the morning that the first non-binding poll was supposed to happen , Zelaya was abducted by the military and flown to Costa Rica .
Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as de facto President , and the referendum was cancelled .
Dramatic footage from that morning showed people in the early hours of the day , coming out to vote and finding the military in the streets – outrage turned to despair which , in turn , was channeled into absolute determination to resist this transparently coercive undermining of popular will .
Demonstrations erupted in the immediate aftermath of the coup , and the golpista regime expected them to last for only a few days .
Unlike Zelaya , they underestimated the strength and commitment of the Honduran movement for reform .
Resistencia !
“ I ’m proud that Hondurans are usually so peaceful , but I ’m even more proud that we ’re finally standing up for ourselves . ” – Rosa Mayda Martinez , office worker , Jutiapa .
What followed was the largest sustained demonstration in Central American history .
For 156 straight days , Hondurans took to the streets of Tegucigalpa .
The numbers fluctuated from as high as hundreds of thousands to the still impressive thousands that were protesting right up to the day of the ‘ elections ’ on Nov. 29th .
Predictably , they met widespread and violent repression .
Between June and November , 33 people were killed in political violence and hundreds more were detained , beaten , kidnapped , raped and otherwise victimized by an increasingly militarized state apparatus .
In September , President Zelaya returned to the country and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy , where he still remains , guarded by police who are under orders to arrest him the moment he leaves Brazilian territory .
There is much more to be said about the nature of the resistance than space here permits .
For the time being , it will have to suffice to say that the coup produced the unintended consequence of uniting an otherwise fragmented group of organizations into a broad coalition – the Frente Popular Nacional de Resistencia ( National Popular Resistance Front ) – which has become the most important popular organization in Honduras .
Its members come primarily from the poorest classes – workers and campesinos – but are also drawn from the relatively small ‘ middle ’ classes , including teachers , lawyers , doctors , left - liberal politicians and civil servants etc .
They have worked closely with local human rights organizations and some foreign NGOs , but they have maintained absolute autonomy from foreign interlocutors ( whatever their intentions ) in defiance of the characterization of the Frente as a Chávez - exported ring of professional troublemakers and socialists .
The demonstrations have not been limited to Tegucigalpa .
The second largest city in Honduras , San Pedro Sula , is a major industrial center and is the epicenter of foreign - owned Honduran maquiladora - style production .
Protests have erupted there regularly , including one on the day of the Nov. 29th ‘ elections . ’
It was repressed with tear gas and rubber bullets injuring dozens of people , including a Reuters photographer from Brazil .
Furthermore , rural Hondurans have been active in the resistance , blocking highways , distributing information and protesting outside government offices .
Only a few areas of Honduras have not seen major movements against the coup – primarily Roatan and the Bay Islands , a ring of tropical island destinations off the north coast , dotted with , and politically controlled by , foreign - owned resort hotels ( many of them Canadian ) .
The foreign and local elite who have turned the islands , and most of their inhabitants , into tools for their personal profit have been the most vocally supportive of the coup .
They pump out misleading or , at best , willfully ignorant anti-Zelaya rants everywhere they can , notably on internet news sites ; my own reports have been consistently attacked and , in one instance , they even went as far as to threaten my life .
These attacks are most likely motivated by the insistence of the social movements for tax reforms that would bring a share of their profits back to the state for the purposes of re-distribution through increased support for education , housing , health care and other social programs .
Foreign - owned companies currently operate in an almost - entirely tax free environment , one of the many grievances that the proponents of the constituyente were hoping to redress .
The Re-Emergence of State Terror
“ In my case , I am known by the police , they can do anything to me .
I thought about moving to a new house with comrades , do you think this is a good idea ? ” – Rosner Giovanni Reyes , member of Resistance , in a meeting with COFADEH representatives , Nov. 28th , 2009 .
But the golpistas and their beneficiaries are bound and determined to block that process indefinitely .
Repression of the resistance has been violent and thorough .
Human rights groups like the Committee of the Families of the Disappeared and Detained in Honduras ( COFADEH ) have worked tirelessly since June 28th to produce detailed documentation of the brutality .
Their reports , not surprisingly , fall on deaf ears .
The campaign of state terror they have documented is too far - reaching to possibly reproduce here , but they provided a very useful summation in a report on Nov. 28th .
This report , produced by the five leading human rights groups in Honduras , was presented to the Tribunal Supremo Electoral ( TSE ) on the day before the ‘ elections ’ in a formal declaration demanding that the elections be cancelled on account of the impossibility of their being fair and free in the context of the coup and state terror :
“ ( These elections are being conducted ) in a context of grave and systematic violations of human rights .
Since the day of the coup , we have documented 33 violent and politically motivated deaths , torture , cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment , sexual assault and restrictions on freedom of association , assembly , expression , opinion and more . ”
They go on to note that holding elections under these circumstances is absurd , given that the same people who are committing this violence are those who are supposed to be responsible for running fair elections .
They also note some of the most high - profile cases of repression .
Carlos H. Reyes , a member of the social movements and initially an independent Presidential candidate , was hospitalized after a brutal blow from police in a peaceful demonstration .
Ulises Sarmiento , a well - known member of the Liberal Party who sympathized with the resistance had his home ransacked by soldiers with automatic weapons in the province of Olancho .
Eliseo Hernandez Juarez , a vice - mayoral candidate , was assassinated .
Not surprisingly , the violence has not been limited to high - profile politicians .
Victor Corrales Mejia and his son , members of the resistance , were arrested the night before the elections and beaten in their home .
Police came to their home , hit Victor in the head and spine with batons and threatened to kill him .
“ They kicked in my door , they threw me out like I was a sack of corn , they want to intimidate us , ” he told me .
“ But our desire for democracy is stronger than they are . ”
In Comayagua , where the resistance is strong and led by teachers , campesinos and women ’s and indigenous rights activists , the Mayor threatened to give the names and addresses of anyone who interfered with the election to the military .
In fact , the military sent a letter a month before the elections demanding such lists from all the Mayors across the country .
Meanwhile , state henchmen shot Alejandro Villatoro , the owner of Radio Globo – one of the few media outlets brave enough to speak out against the coup – and stole the computer from which the station was broadcasting .
Indeed , Radio Globo had by that point resorted almost exclusively to broadcasting online from secret locations , after months of repression .
Radio Globo , along with Radio Progreso and Radio Uno , television station Canal 36 and newspaper El Libertador are among the media outlets that have faced relentless repression since the coup .
Some , like Canal 36 , have shut down altogether after having equipment destroyed , signals interrupted , offices ransacked and editors assassinated .
Even organizations that are not directly linked to the resistance are being targeted in the context of police impunity .
Red Comal , a campesino organization that helps small farmers to market their produce and runs educational campaigns designed to build networks between campesinos and social movements , had its offices attacked , computers and money stolen , and employees beaten .
Miguel Alonzo Macias , the director of the organization , explained to me , “ we teach people why they are poor .
For that , we are a threat . ”
Whitewashing the Coup
“ No to the coup regime elections !
Free men and women of Honduras , they want to use your vote to legalize the coup .
Each vote is a blow to your freedom . ” – Resistencia poster .
Given the context described above , it is hard to imagine how anyone could seriously claim that ‘ the event ’ on Nov. 29th could be called a free or fair election .
On the day of the vote , the Frente urged Hondurans to stay home and boycott la farsa ( farce ) .
And that is precisely what happened – on a day that is normally a boisterous street party filled with red or blue flags representing to the two primary political parties , Honduras was quiet and subdued .
Most polling stations had more military and police than civilians .
The TSE itself admitted that only around 1.7 million people voted , in a country of nearly 8 million , with 4.6 million eligible to vote .
That makes a turnout of around 35 % , the lowest since the end of military dictatorships in the early 80s .
Inexplicably , on the night of Nov. 29th , the TSE announced a projected turnout of 60 % , which became the number repeated in almost every international news source .
Fox News in the United States was one of the few exceptions , reporting the absurd figure of 70 % – no one has yet been able to explain where that number came from .
A few days after the election , video journalist Jesse Freeston of the Real News was able to get into the TSE headquarters and produced a video documenting fraudulent reporting of voter totals , designed to create the illusion that Hondurans had not boycotted the election .
This documentation is important in demonstrating to the international community that these elections should never be recognized as legitimate in any way .
But it is totally unnecessary for Hondurans themselves , who knew long before the elections ever took place that they would be a sham , and had that knowledge confirmed on Nov. 29th .
As the human rights organizations explained in their Nov. 28th document :
“ holding reliable elections does not depend solely on the implementation of sophisticated technology , international observers or the strict adherence to the formal process ; it also requires knowing that there was a clean process preceding the elections , produced by a climate of full freedom , one where candidates and the electorate can express themselves openly and in a context of absolute equality , without fear of assassination , torture , detention and incarceration . ”
Indeed , an interview I conducted with Edward Fox , a former USAID official , Republican campaign financer and an elections observer sent from Washington to legitimate the process , demonstrated quite plainly that the few organizations who went to Honduras for Nov. 29th were not interested in investigating what was happening away from the polling stations .
As we spoke on camera from Miami International Airport on Dec. 1st , Fox claimed to know nothing about “ alleged ” human rights violations , cast suspicion on the groups documenting the violence despite not being able to name a single one of them , and justified his endorsement of the elections by telling me that he had spoken to the U.S. Ambassador who is , Fox reminded me , “ there all the time . ”
His organization , the Washington Senior Observer Group , reported that they :
“ witnessed the enthusiastic desire of thousands of Honduran citizens to cast their ballots .
Many took time to thank us for our presence today .
Without exception , they expressed confidence in the electoral system , pride in exercising their right to vote , and a profound hope that their election is a decisive step toward the restoration of the constitutional and democratic order in Honduras . ”
They further asserted that they saw “ no voter intimidation by any group , individual , or party ” and that their observations “ coincide with those reported by other observers and by the media throughout Honduras . ”
Nonetheless , when I asked Edward Fox about those other observers , the groups who have been documenting the violence and terror , he admitted that he had not spoken to any of them .
Avoiding them must have taken some effort , because when those groups presented their report to the TSE on Nov. 28th , the U.S. observers were there ; in fact , the human rights delegation had their meeting scheduled for 2:00 p.m. but had to wait until well after 4:00 p.m. because TSE officials were meeting with the U.S. observers .
We were all there together , and at one point I overheard the U.S. observers chatting amongst themselves derisively about the human rights group and about Honduras in general .
Looking Ahead
“ Where are the people ?
The people are in the streets , struggling for their freedom ! ” – Resistencia chant .
Sadly , though not surprisingly , reports like Fox ’s bolstered the positions taken by governments of the global North and their right - wing allies in Latin America .
Both have fallen all over themselves to legitimate the election process and , in so doing , legitimate the coup itself .
Canada ’s foreign affairs minister Peter Kent responded to the elections announcing that Canada :
“ congratulates the Honduran people for the relatively peaceful and orderly manner in which the country ’s elections were conducted .
While Sunday ’s elections were not monitored by international organizations such as the Organization of American States , we are encouraged by reports from civil society organizations that there was a strong turnout for the elections , that they appear to have been run freely and fairly , and that there was no major violence . ”
Much more needs to be said about Canada ’s relationship to Honduras and the golpistas .
A petition , calling for non-recognition of the elections is circulating and has garnered nearly 400 names – a small step toward building public awareness of Canada ’s complicity in this desecration of democracy and human rights .
In the meantime , a death squad killed five more people on a street corner on Dec. 6 .
A human rights worker with links to Amnesty International was murdered on Dec. 14 .
The teenaged daughter of a critical journalist was found dead on Dec. 16 .
Repression has increased and turned even more vicious and calculated since the farce elections ; the regime has evidently been emboldened by their successful misrepresentation of the fiesta democratica and the willingness of the international media to ignore the reality facing the majority of Hondurans .
Nonetheless , the resistance continues , having realized long ago that this will be a long struggle .
It is hard to predict at this point what shape the struggle will take in the coming months , though it is clear that the Jan. 27th transfer of power to golpe - President - elect Pepe Lobo – Pepe Robo ( the Robber ) as the walls call him – will be another flashpoint for the resistance .
“ The police keep telling us they will come to our homes and take us away , and it makes us want to run , ” says Francisca , a high school teacher in Comayagua .
“ But we have worked too hard for too long to build the homes we have . ” •

Remember Aiko , the fembot created by amateur inventor Le Trung ?
Well , apparently she and his boyfriend / creator spent Christmas with his family , and he even got her presents .
He claims that she 's exactly like a real woman .
Seriously , Le ?
Let 's review :

" Aiko can recognise faces and says hello to anyone she has met . "
OK .
Sounds good enough .
" She helps me pick what to have for dinner and knows what drinks I like . "
Hmmhmm .
" Like a real female she will react to being touched in certain ways . "
Right .
" If you grab or squeeze too hard she will try to slap you . "
Correct .
" She has all senses except for smell . "
Fine .
That can be convenient at times .
" [ Walking ] is the most difficult thing for any inventor to do .
The problem is finding a way for Aiko to walk that looks human - like without impacting on any of her other abilities .
I have spent the last six months taking her apart and trying out lots of different systems , but I have n't been able to get it right yet . "

Ooooooook .
So she does n't walk and you can take her apart to rebuild her .
" But Aiko is always helpful and never complains .
She is the perfect woman to have around at Christmas . "

Come on , Le , you had me until you said that .
That 's not very realistic .
But then again , whatever rocks your world , dude .
If you are happy , Aiko is happy , and we are all happy .
Just do n't have another heart attack while working on her , like you had two years ago .
I wish the New Year brings you both happiness and no tight white jackets .

Good stalking by my SS !!
I was either going to get something fantasy football related or FSM ... great choice !
My fiancee loves it hanging on the wall :P
One of the most pernicious clauses of the Constitution that has , through creative interpretation led to an expansion of the power of the Federal Government far beyond where it was intended is the Necessary and Proper Clause , which sits at the end of Article I , Section 8 and states as follows :
To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof .
When James Madison wrote about the clause in Federalist No. 44 , it was clear that the Founders viewed the clause as merely granting Congress the authority it needed to carry out the powers set forth in remainder of Section 8 :
The remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings which are either so obvious , or have been so fully developed , that they may be passed over without remark .
The SIXTH and last class consists of the several powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the rest .
1 . Of these the first is , the “ power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .
“ Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this ; yet on a fair investigation of it , no part can appear more completely invulnerable .
Without the SUBSTANCE of this power , the whole Constitution would be a dead letter . \ (…)
If it be asked what is to be the consequence , in case the Congress shall misconstrue this part of the Constitution , and exercise powers not warranted by its true meaning , I answer , the same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them ; as if the general power had been reduced to particulars , and any one of these were to be violated ; the same , in short , as if the State legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional authorities .
In the first instance , the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments , which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts ; and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can , by the election of more faithful representatives , annul the acts of the usurpers .
The reality of just how flexible the clause was , though , became apparent only thirty - one years later when the Supreme Court handed down it ’s decision in McCullouch v. Maryland :
It was the first example of a Constitutional clause being used to read into the Constitution increased powers for Congress beyond those set forth in the text of the document , and it would n’t be the last .
Now , it appears that the Supreme Court may have the opportunity to rein in the damage the McCulloch did :
In 2006 , Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act .
One provision of the law authorizes the federal government to civilly commit anyone in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons whom the attorney general certifies to be “ sexually dangerous . ”
The effect of such an action is to continue the certified person ’s confinement after the expiration of his prison term , without proof of a new criminal violation .
Six days before the scheduled release of Graydon Comstock — who had been sentenced to 37 months in jail for receiving child pornography — the attorney general certified Comstock as sexually dangerous .
Three years later , Comstock thus remains confined in a medium security prison , as do more than 60 other similarly situated men in the Eastern District of North Carolina alone .
Comstock and several others challenged their confinements as going beyond Congress ’s constitutional authority and won in both the district and appellate courts .
The United States successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case .
Cato , joined by Georgetown law professor ( and Cato senior fellow ) Randy Barnett , filed a brief opposing the government .
We argue that the use of federal power here is unconstitutional because it is not tied to any of Congress ’s limited and enumerated powers .
The government ’s reliance on the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I , Section 8 , is misplaced because that clause grants no independent power but merely “ carries into execution ” the powers enumerated elsewhere in that section .
The commitment of prisoners after their terms simply is not one of the enumerated powers .
While the government justifies its actions by invoking its implied power “ to establish a federal penal system ” — itself a necessary and proper auxiliary to certain enumerated powers — civil commitment is unrelated to creating or maintaining a penal system ( let alone any enumerated power ) .
Nor can the law at issue fall under the Commerce Clause , because civil commitment involves non-economic intrastate activity .
Here ’ s hoping that the Court takes this one , admittedly small , step toward reining in an out - of - control Federal Government .
Ending out 2009 , Gamasutra puts together the definitive compilation of our year - end lists , from disappointments through game of the year and beyond , with bonus reader feedback from the charts ' original posting in the site 's news section .
While the year has seen the world slowly recovering from the grip of financial recession , the video games created this year and resulting creative and business trends have been as vital -- if not more so -- than previous years , and we 're delighted to present our impressions of 2009 in this format .
You can also compare this year 's set of charts against 2008 's ' Top 5s ' compilation and 2007 's similar compendium to see what has changed -- and what overarching trends have ended up staying the same over the years .
Without further ado , here are the charts :
Top 5 PC Games
In more ways than physically , the PC is something of a black box .
Gaming 's only true open platform can be a tough nut to crack for developers .
Its install base is ostensibly enormous ( Steam alone , just one of its many communities , numbers over 20 million gamers ) but success on the PC can be elusive , and it lacks the plug - and - play simplicity of its console cousins .
Triple - A big - budget action experiences have clearly found their place on consoles , and those games are becoming less common on the PC ( although sometimes they 're just a few months late ) .
But the platform is increasingly emerging as fertile ground for an astonishingly wide breadth of games that do n't fit that particular mold .
This year 's best offerings included games that play to the system 's strengths -- either by demanding high levels of input precision or by being so accessible that only minimal computational hardware is required , and everything in between .
The PC in 2009 saw a front - loaded schedule .
It was the first half of the year that was most densely packed with ambitious and quirky exclusives , bolstered by some notable multiplatform standouts in the fall .
As a result , the PC 's year in gaming ranged from Empire : Total War 's grand strategy to Dawn of War II 's RPG - like strategic micromanagement ; from Dragon Age : Origins ' epic fantasy to Torchlight 's bite - sized lootfest ; from The Sims 3's single - player interpersonal relationships to Left 4 Dead 2's online zombie - killing cooperation .
This year , the strongest case yet has been made for the PC as the affordable gaming platform , despite its costly image .
Cutthroat competition between digital distribution operators ( with more on the way ) has resulted in nonstop rotating deep discounts , without the permanent devaluation that comes with retail 's bargain bins .
At any given moment , the PC gamer has access to amazing deals on a wide array of games , from the most mainstream to the most obscure .
Finally , it 's worth pointing out the originality on display this year ; of the 15 games highlighted here , more than half hail from newly - created properties .
And take heart , PC fans : nearly all had PC as the lead development platform , with the majority exclusive .
Top 5 PC Games of 2009
5. Torchlight ( Runic Games )
Torchlight offers proof that a game 's pedigree makes a huge difference .
When you put the founders of Diablo creator Blizzard North in the same room as the guy responsible for Fate , you get the most fluid and addictive action RPG since the mighty Diablo II itself .
( Well , first you apparently get a public beta of another game .
Then you get a new studio and Torchlight . )
What makes a good loot - driven action RPG is hard to pin down -- there have been several solid efforts in the genre over the last decade , but until Torchlight , none of them resulted in the same satisfied , sleep - deprived nights to which Diablo II subjected me beginning in 2000 and lasting longer than I would like to admit .
And it 's certainly not a complete coincidence that neither of them have featured the wonderful music talent of original Diablo composer Matt Uelman until now either .
Impressively , Torchlight succeeds even without a multiplayer component , an omission that was worrisome when first announced but which ended up detracting little from the game 's charmingly cocaine - like old - school dungeon - clearing .
And its system requirements are soft enough that the game 's option screen even includes a " netbook mode " !
4. Empire : Total War ( The Creative Assembly )
Grandeur is the touchstone in the Total War series , and The Creative Assembly more than lived up to that reputation with its latest entry , Empire .
Encompassing a massive geographical scope during a period that was immensely formative in modern civilization , the game 's many systems interweave to create an incredible historical narrative -- or a plausible portrayal of what might have been .
And as is customary for the series , its extensive automation options mean Empire stays accessible without forcing a reduction in depth .
It 's a game of uniquely PC scope .
In a creative medium so dominated by fantasy , science fiction , and Rambo - esque combat theatrics , there is something laudable about a developer like The Creative Assembly that pursues an entirely different , and more accountable , kind of wish fulfillment .
Such ambitious depictions of vast swathes of history rarely receive such lavish production values .
The game 's launch was unfortunately marred by technical issues for many users , some of which have reportedly persisted .
But The Creative Assembly has n't abandoned the game , even after announcing next year 's Napoleon : Total War : Empire 's long - promised multiplayer campaign enters beta today .
3. Left 4 Dead 2 ( Valve )
Last year 's excellent Left 4 Dead ( which ranked # 2 on the 2008 list ) demonstrated how much room for exploration is left in the multiplayer shooter arena .
A genre - defying mashup of round - based multiplayer and cooperative campaigning , it carved out a unique place for itself in the unforgiving marketplace of online gaming .
Left 4 Dead 2 , which famously sparked an ultimately short - lived protest against its year - later development cycle , demonstrates the abilities of a team that , having worked through the establishment of a successful subgenre , has been able to explore the space in a deeper , more confident , more fleshed - out way .
Its setting reflects a more perceivable geographic progression , its levels house a broader array of inventive gameplay conceits , and its mode and playstyle options are more numerous .
Along with Valve 's neverending Team Fortress 2 content and the pseudo - episodic Half - Life 2 series , Left 4 Dead 2 provides yet more evidence that Valve understands the value of iteration better than most .
2. Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War II ( Relic Entertainment )
Real - time strategy does n't occupy the same headline - grabbing position it once did ( except when StarCraft II is delayed again , anyway ) , but for the past decade , Relic Entertainment has been creating some of the most progressive , fun RTS games around .
A few years ago , it received well - deserve acclaim for Company of Heroes , and this year it continued to take liberties with established strategy game design in Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War II , which pushes even further away from the base - management norm to great effect .
The single - player campaign , which can be played solo or cooperatively , offers an engaging persistent loot and leveling system informed by Diablo and its ilk , with the map and control mentality of an RTS -- a formula that pays off .
And the multiplayer mode is a heavily teamwork - driven action - strategy experience that can seem initially unfamiliar , but whose fast pace and roots in well - established gameplay underpinnings lends it to quick learning .
Like a couple other games on this list , Dawn of War II is an admirable reminder that design risks can pay off , and there 's no such thing as permanent standardization for a genre .
1. Dragon Age : Origins ( BioWare )
Dragon
Age is a game full of compelling contradictions .
Its gameplay paradigm is a revival of the kind of systemic , arcane PC RPG that BioWare previously revived in the late 90s with Baldur 's Gate -- but its finely - tuned modernization and playability deflect anachronistic impenetrability .
At first glance , its setting seems like forgettable boilerplate fantasy -- but that surface level belies a slate of unexpectedly engaging and believable party members , and well - integrated undercurrents examining its world 's class and race relations .
These days , not many multiplatform games feel so intrinsically native to the PC as Dragon Age .
Some elements play equally well on any system -- characters , dialogue , situations , choices -- but the intended feel of the game is best conveyed with a mouse and keyboard , and the more complete UI .
Using the mouse wheel to seamlessly scroll between the modern chase cam and the old - school remove - the - ceiling top - down view is oddly satisfying in its own right , and is endlessly practical as the game flows between exploration and tactical combat .
Characters can be direct - controlled , clicked - and - dragged , given automated tactics ; as with the narrative situations , player choice is the name of the game .
Dragon
Age 's pre-release marketing implied tired , shallow characters and situations .
The game itself has an uncommon smartness and genuineness .
Rarely have I grown as attached to virtual characters in video games , or developed distaste for them based on something other than poor writing .
Even better , they convincingly engage in their own independent banter as you lead them around the world .
The game and its setting are n't devoid of cliche , not by a long shot ; but few games offer such a volume of well - conceived interaction and observation .
( Those driven to the game solely by its current angry - bloodbath television campaign are likely to be confused by the thoughtful experience with which they are presented upon startup . )
Like Fallout 3 , last year 's winner , Dragon
Age promises a life beyond its shipped content with official PC modding tools ( and the inevitable paid content ) .
And yet again , it 's great to see the characteristically PC - derived traditions of player - driven systemic worlds available in many genres and on multiple systems .
But Dragon
Age is still best experienced on the platform that gave rise to its kind .
Honorable Mentions ( listed alphabetically )
AAaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA !!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity ( Dejobaan Games ) :
Many hours were spent playing this surprisingly compelling BASE jumping simulator , which brilliantly conveys the fun Dejobaan must have had making it .
Batman : Arkham Asylum ( Rocksteady Studios ) :
It 's the first good Batman game possibly ever , and it 's supremely playable , setting the template for good multiplatform PC conversions .
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 ( Infinity Ward ) :
In the end , Infinity Ward 's proprietary online backend is n't ideal in all respects , but it gets the absolutely top - shelf multiplayer across well enough .
Dawn of Discovery / Anno 1404 ( Blue Byte / Related Designs ) :
This city builder 's preoccupation with economic micromanagement pays off in satisfaction when you get everything running like clockwork .
League of Legends ( Riot Games ) :
One of several companies hoping to inherit the Defense of the Ancients crown , Riot has crafted a tight , polished ( and free ) strategy / RPG effort .
Plants vs. Zombies ( PopCap Games ) :
It turns out turret defense design had n't been exhausted ; PopCap makes a strong , playable argument here for conciseness of design .
Risen ( Piranha Bytes ) :
This deep RPG inherits both the ambition and the slight jankiness of its Gothic forbear , still doing cynical roleplaying better than most .
The Sims 3 ( Maxis ) :
If you want what The Sims does , the original series is still the only real choice around , and this entry is admirably polished and expanded .
Tales of Monkey Island ( Telltale Games ) : Impressively , Telltale has made one of gaming 's most resolutely stagnant genres feel much fresher , while keeping a venerable license largely intact .
Trine ( Frozenbyte ) :
This clever single - player - cooperative ( or same - screen ) sidescroller offers fun platforming innovation , pretty visuals , and a wizard .
Zeno Clash ( Ace Team ) :
Do n't try to figure out what the hell is going on , just enjoy the imaginative surrealism and brutal first - person face - punching .
- Chris Remo
You said :
Mathieu Marquis Bolduc : " About Empire Total War ...
I love the Total War series , but I think you understate the scope of the ' technical problems ' .
It took 4 patches before the AI was functional enough to make the grand campaign playable , and cannons defending a fort still think its a good idea to fire at enemies through their own gates .
AI was never the strong point of the series , but its the first time it really broke the game .
I hope Creative Assembly rethink their approach to AI in the next game . "
Richard Putney : " Trine and Borderlands are my picks for outstanding titles this year .
These titles were both incredibly fun to play , quirky , and innovative .
DoW II was great fun , but I really dont think their redefinition of RTS did as much for the genre as the original DoW . "
Donald McArthur : " Am I the only one who enjoyed Demigod ?
It was my go to game for two months and I still enjoy going pack for a quick match . "
With rumors of the Apple tablet reaching new highs , MacRumors has found evidence that Apple acquired the domain name iSlate.com presumably in preparation for the new device .
The iSlate.com domain was originally registered in October 2004 by a company called Eurobox Ltd .
It later changed hands to Data Docket , Inc. in 2006 .
In 2007 , however , the domain was transferred to registrar MarkMonitor.com .
MarkMonitor handles domain name registrations and trademark protections for many companies , including Apple .
As is typical , however , the name of the actual registrant was initially hidden to obscure the identify of the actual owner .
Up until this point , one could still easily dismiss all this as a simple coincidence .
However , after further investigation of the domain name registrant history , it seems Apple 's name was temporarily exposed as the actual owner of " iSlate.com " for several weeks in late 2007 .
It was changed back within a few weeks , but using DomainTools , MacRumors has found the historic record proving Apple ownership of the iSlate.com domain :
iSlate.com currently points to no website .
Apple is rumored to be announcing an Apple tablet in early 2010 and given this evidence " iSlate " seems a likely candidate for the device 's name .
Thanks to Mark Gurman from AppleRejectedMe.com for first pointing us in the direction of iSlate.com

Chris Shaw was n’t always skeptical about vaccines .
The neuroscientist at the University of British Columbia had his teenage son vaccinated with most of the recommended shots .
But then he started studying some of the ingredients commonly found in vaccines .
What he discovered caused him to go cold turkey on all shots for his six - year - old daughter .
And that includes the vaccine for the H1N1 flu .
“ I am not convinced H1N1 is sufficiently hazardous to most people to risk the potential downside of the vaccine , ” Shaw said over the phone from his office in the research pavilion at the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority .
Shaw is n’t an easily dismissed vaccine conspiracy theorist .
He is a leading expert on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , or Lou Gehrig ’s disease ) and Parkinson ’s disease .
While investigating unusually high rates of ALS and other neurological disorders among veterans who have Gulf War syndrome , he found evidence that the cause may have been aluminum salt , an ingredient in the cocktail of vaccines given to soldiers before deployment .
Although aluminum salt is n’t present in the H1N1 vaccine , Shaw ’s discovery made him concerned about other vaccines , including the swine - flu shot .
He is n’t alone in his thoughts .
Despite a full frontal assault of news about the dangers of the flu and the importance of vaccination , a survey in late October revealed that only 36 percent of Canadians said they would get the shot .
Lack of trust in the vaccine was cited as the main reason for vaccine opposition .
Another poll in November found that 65 percent of Canadians believe the media has overreacted to the threat of swine flu .
Even many health workers are n’t convinced .
In two separate surveys , in the U.K. ( Pulse ) and Hong Kong ( British Medical Journal ) , published in August , half of health - care professionals said they did n’t intend to get the vaccine .
Canadian health officials and some newspaper columnists have reacted by accusing vaccine opponents of being conspiracy mongers or just plain irresponsible .
Who is right ?
Is the cure really worse than the disease ?
Let ’s look at some numbers .
First , the disease .
Swine flu had killed 161 Canadians as of November 12 .
That works out to one death per 200,000 Canadians in the past six - and - a- half months .
Over the same period of time , major cardiovascular diseases typically claim 240 times more Canadian lives ( about 39,000 ) , cancer claims 230 times more ( 37,000 deaths ) , pneumonia kills 18 times more ( 2,800 ) , and accidental falls claim eight times more ( 1,260 ) , according to calculations based on 2005 Statistics Canada figures .
H1N1 has about the same death rate as hernias .
But we do n’t see scary front - page headlines for months on end about hernias , pneumonia , or falling down .
“ It ’s really not causing — and is not going to cause and nowhere has caused — significant levels of illness or death , ” Dr. Richard Schabas , Ontario ’s former chief medical officer of health , told the CBC on November 12 .
Schabas said H1N1 “ has ultimately turned out to be , from a pandemic perspective , a dud ” .
What about the vaccine ?
Is it safe ?
Despite the onslaught of confident pronouncements from health officials and doctors , Shaw says he has n’t seen enough information on the safety of the vaccine .
“ If the science were there , we could make a rational decision .
But it ’s a coin toss . ”
Looking for answers ,
Shaw turned to the 24 - page product - information leaflet on the vaccine released by drug giant GlaxoSmithKline .
Health Canada used this document in approving the shot .
The leaflet leaves Shaw cold .
“ You could n’t turn this in as a master ’s thesis anywhere I know of and get a passing grade , ” he said , calling the leaflet a “ shocking document ” .
Shaw said the material lacks basic information .
For example , there is no safety data at all for several groups of people — pregnant women , people aged over 60 , kids aged 10 to 17 , and children under three .
For kids three to nine years old , there is only “ very limited ” data .
“ Where is the safety data that the government used to license the vaccine ? ”
Shaw asked .
Health Canada would not talk to the Straight , and the Public Health Agency of Canada did not respond to a request for an interview .
The H1N1 vaccine includes a component called an adjuvant — which is used to boost the drug ’s effectiveness — that has raised a lot of questions .
GlaxoSmithKline says the adjuvant has been tested on 45,000 people worldwide and that clinical trials are now being done on children .
In an e-mail , spokesperson Melanie Spoore said the company is planning 25 trials of its various H1N1 vaccines before November 2010 .
She also said a different but closely related vaccine made by the company , for the H5N1 flu , includes the same adjuvant and “ is generally well - tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile ” in both kids and adults .
But Shaw has concerns about the company ’s trial results for the H5N1 vaccine .
The product leaflet mentions a study in which the company injected the vaccine into pregnant rats .
It found “ an increased incidence of fetal malformations ” and “ delayed neurobehavioural maturation ” .
Another study did not produce the same outcome .
But Shaw says the rat results deserve more study .
“ Anytime you observe such outcomes , it is a concern , ” he said .
The leaflet also mentions a study on ferrets .
The animals were given adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted H5N1 vaccines and then exposed to the flu .
The ferrets that got the adjuvanted vaccine were protected by the vaccine .
But those that got the nonadjuvanted vaccine all died .
This result could be a concern , Shaw said , because Canadian authorities are telling pregnant women to get the nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine since the adjuvanted version has n’t ever been tested on pregnant women .
Shaw also said the animal - study information in the leaflet lacks many important details and would be “ unpublishable ” as presented .
“ Any [ medical - journal ] referee would kick this out the window . ”
The company ’s leaflet also paints a picture of the vaccine ’s side effects in humans somewhat different than the usual line from health authorities .
The Public Health Agency of Canada says on its
Web site that the adjuvanted vaccine is as safe as the nonadjuvanted shot .
It also says the rate of “ serious adverse events ” from vaccination is extremely low — typically “ about one for every 100,000 doses of vaccine ” .
What we do n’t often hear is that the adjuvanted vaccine caused dramatically more side effects than the nonadjuvanted version .
Ninety percent of 62 subjects reported pain ( versus 37 percent of 62 people for the nonadjuvanted vaccine ) , 34 percent had muscle soreness ( compared to 8 percent with the nonadjuvanted shot ) , and 14 percent experienced a headache ( as opposed to 8 percent for the nonadjuvanted shot ) , according to the product - information sheet .
Although these reactions are minor , the leaflet also says four of 253 people studied experienced “ severe adverse reactions ” .
Three of the four were deemed to be unrelated to the vaccine , but one case of hypersensitivity ( which can mean anything from an allergic reaction to autoimmune disease ) was determined “ to be related to vaccination ” .
That one serious reaction might not sound like a lot , but it actually translates into a rate of 395 cases per 100,000 people .
That ’s more than 50 times the rate of hospitalization due to H1N1 itself : 7.3 per 100,000 Canadians .
Sucharit Bhakdi is concerned some serious vaccine reactions could go unnoticed .
He is a professor of medical microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany .
In October — in a coauthored paper in the journal Medical Microbiology — he warned of a possible increase in the risk in heart problems due to mass H1N1 vaccination .
Speaking by phone from his office , Bhakdi cited the higher rate of heart problems when 1.4 million U.S. soldiers were vaccinated for smallpox before the 2003 Iraq war .
Soldiers who received the vaccine had almost 7.5 times the rate of heart inflammation of nonvaccinated personnel , according to a study by U.S. military medical researchers in 2004 in the American Journal of Epidemiology .
“ Unexpected serious adverse effects thus may follow in the wake of a general vaccination program , ” Bhakdi ’s paper said .
Yet health authorities and doctors are urging people with heart problems to get the H1N1 vaccine on a priority basis and do not appear to be monitoring them for possibly elevated risks , he said .
Shaw is also concerned about Canada ’s monitoring of the side effects of vaccinations , calling the system “ flimsy ” .
What especially worries
Shaw is the possibility of longer - term side effects from the vaccine .
Most vaccine safety studies monitor patients for a few days or , at most , several months .
That is n’t enough , Shaw says .
With some vaccines , the most serious reactions have taken years to surface .
“ Neurological problems do n’t happen overnight , ” he said .
“ It took five to 10 years to see the bulk of the Gulf War–syndrome outcomes . ”
One of the best examples involves a controversial ingredient present in the H1N1 vaccine : thimerosal .
Thimerosal is a form of mercury used in some vaccines as a preservative .
Drug makers agreed to phase it out of most vaccines after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found in 1999 that mercury levels in children who had gotten multiple shots often exceeded safety levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Nonetheless , thimerosal still remains in many flu vaccines .
Controversy has raged for years about whether or not thimerosal is behind soaring childhood autism rates .
While that debate continues , a 2008 study in the U.K. journal Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry found that boys who were given a vaccine containing thimerosal were nine times more likely to have developmental problems than unvaccinated boys .
The Public Health Agency of Canada says on its
Web site that thimerosal is safe and that the amount in the H1N1 vaccine is below Health Canada ’s daily safety limit set for mercury .
“ There ’s significantly less mercury in the vaccine than you would find in a can of tuna fish , ” the site states .
In fact , the amount of mercury in the nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine does actually exceed the daily safety level for pregnant women .
Health Canada has established the safe dietary level of mercury for pregnant women at 0.2 micrograms ( millionths of a gram ) per kilo of body weight .
The nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine contains 25 micrograms of mercury .
Simple math tells us an average Canadian pregnant woman — weighing 80 kilograms at term — gets about 56 percent more than the daily safe level of mercury when given a dose of the nonadjuvanted vaccine .
By the EPA ’s stricter standards , that same dose is actually triple its daily safe level .
What ’s more , Shaw notes , those daily safety levels were set for consumption of mercury in food , not for injection directly into the body .
Injecting a neurotoxin like mercury has much more impact than eating it , he said .
Squalene is another controversial component of the swine - flu vaccine .
It ’s an oil found in animal livers and is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and also as a moisturizer in cosmetic products .
It is primarily gotten from shark livers — a fact that has upset conservation groups worried about endangered shark populations .
Some companies , like Unilever and L’Oréal , have agreed to stop using squalene in cosmetic products .
Debate has raged for years about whether or not squalene is responsible for Gulf War syndrome .
Most research suggests that ’s not the case , but in recent years much more solid evidence has found squalene can cause autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis in animals .
Still other questions have been raised about polysorbate 80 , another component of the H1N1 vaccine adjuvant .
Studies have found it can cause severe allergic reactions and hypersensitivity .
In the end , we might only get a good picture of the vaccine ’s side effects long after swine flu has run its course .
Then again , with Canada ’s lax monitoring system for side effects , we may never know which was worse .
Hacking C++ From C
For a long time , LiveDictionary used deeply unwholesome methods to do its work .
Version 1.2.5 , just released , now uses nothing but public methods .
This means vastly improved stability , but it also means that LiveDictionary 's evil WebKit text grabber , once considered the app's crown jewels , is no longer useful .
I 'm going to use it as an object lesson on how to do evil things with C++ applications from pure C .
Motivation
This code was initially developed over the course of about one week , and then took approximately two months of debugging before it became stable .
Since then Apple has broken it several times with Safari updates , with the changes required being anything from a simple change of offsets to a large re-engineering of the function .
The prototype of the function is thus :
void LiveDict_1_3_WebViewGetTextAtPoint ( id webHTMLView , NSPoint point , NSString ** text , int * offset )
Given an instance of a WebHTMLView ( the thing inside a WebView that does all the work ) and a point , the function is to return the text at that point , and the offset into that text which represents where that point is located inside it .
This is then used to look up the appropriate word in LiveDictionary .
( The 1_3 thing is a version numbering scheme so it does n't conflict with nearly identical functions made for other versions of Safari . )
You would think that this would be easy , but at the time I originally wrote this function , there was no public way to obtain this information .
Obviously there is some way to do it , since WebKit itself does it , for example when you drag to select some text .
So I dove into WebCore to see how it was done .
After much digging , I found the KHTMLPart class which has a method called isPointInsideSelection that does basically the same thing .
I ripped out the bits I did n't need and came up with the following C++ code :
id bridge = [ webHTMLView _bridge ] ; KWQKHTMLPart * part = [ bridge part ] ; DocumentImpl * impl = part -> xmlDocImpl ( ) ; khtml :: RenderObject * r = impl -> renderer ( ) ; khtml :: RenderObject :: NodeInfo nodeInfo ( true , true ) ; r -> layer ( ) -> hitTest ( nodeInfo , ( int ) location .
x , ( int ) location .
y ) ; NodeImpl * nodeImpl = nodeInfo . innerNonSharedNode ( ) ; if ( ! nodeImpl || ! nodeImpl -> renderer ( ) || ! nodeImpl -> renderer ( ) -> isText ( ) ) return ; Position position = innerNode -> positionForCoordinates ( absXPos - renderXPos , absYPos - renderYPos ) ;
Not too bad , right ?
Most of the code is just drilling down to the object I need to interrogate , and then asking it .
( There 's a little bit at the end to get the actual text of the node that I left off . )
But ... I can't just write that code .
All of these classes are private and buried in WebCore so I can't link against them .
I can't just copy the headers because that still requires linking against them .
So I decided to replicate the entire thing in C .
The only thing is , it 's a bit complicated to do from C .
The entire file , which contains nothing but the above function , its support functions , and comments , is 340 lines long .
Over 10 kB of source code just to replicate that straightforward C++.
I 'm going to show you exactly how it 's done .
Virtual Reality
As you probably know , C++ has two types of methods ( C++ - ites like to call them " member functions " , but that 's not the sort of foolishness you 'll see me spouting ) , virtual methods and the regular kind .
Virtual methods are like the methods in other OO languages , in that the implementation is looked up at runtime .
The regular kind is this weird abomination where the implementation is looked up entirely at compile time based on the declared type of the object .
Since these two types of methods act so differently , we have to invoke them differently when we 're hacking from C .
Static Hiss
Regular C++ methods are pretty easy to call from C , as long as you can get a pointer to them .
They 're actually just regular C functions with funny names and a single implicit parameter ( this ) .
So , for example , the xmlDocImpl method is non-virtual .
Declared as a function pointer , it looks like :
void * ( * KHTMLPart_xmlDocImplP ) ( void * ) ;
You 'll see a lot of void * in this article .
This is because I completely do n't care about types ; if I 'm slinging pointers around , I 'll just use void * for convenience .
So here we see that it returns a pointer , and takes a single parameter , the implicit this pointer .
If I 've assigned the function pointer to the right value , then I can perform the equivalent call from C as :
void * xmlDocImpl = KHTMLPart_xmlDocImplP
( part ) ;
The only remaining piece is to get the right pointer .
Here , I use the APEFindSymbol function from Unsanity 's APELite .
( Note that this function requires having the mach_header of WebCore ; getting this is left as an exercise for the reader . )
All you have to know is the symbol name , which is easy to find by just dumping the symbols in WebCore using nm and looking for one that seems to fit .
The code is :
KHTMLPart_xmlDocImplP
= APEFindSymbol ( header , " __ZNK9KHTMLPart10xmlDocImplEv " ) ;
And that 's all there is to it .
The C++ code contains two other references to non-virtual methods , the renderer method , and the hitTest method .
They are used similarly .
Static Interference
Unlike certain other dynamic languages , C++ allows for stack - allocated objects .
The NodeInfo instance is an example of this .
Creating a stack object translates to C fairly directly .
First you need to allocate space , which is done by creating a struct with the right memory layout .
Then you need to construct the object by calling its constructor .
However , in this case , I noticed that the constructor does nothing but set everything to zero .
I do n't know exactly what is in a NodeInfo but I know that it 's five pointers .
So my NodeInfo declaration in C looks like this :
struct NodeInfoStruct { void * dummy1 , * dummy2 , * dummy3 , * dummy4 , * dummy5 ; } nodeInfo = { 0 } ;
Of course if WebCore 's NodeInfo definition ever changes significantly I 'll be in a world of hurt .
Oddly enough this never happened , though ....
Inline Fun
C++ also likes inline methods that are declared in the header .
I , however , hate them because they do n't actually get a symbol in the built library .
This means that their implementation is something I can't invoke .
However , I can see what they do and copy them .
The renderer method is one of these .
All it does is return an instance variable of the object .
So I just figured out the offset of that instance variable and ripped it out .
It turns out that it 's 22 pointer - sizes into the object , so my replacement function is just :
static void * Function_DocumentImpl_renderer ( void * obj ) { void ** objLayoutPtr = obj ; return objLayoutPtr [ 22 ] ; }
Ugly but effective .
Again , if the internal layout of the object ever changes then I 'm screwed , but this never happened .
Virtually Impossible
Unfortunately calling virtual methods is ever so slightly harder .
I 'll cover the theory first , then get into how to call them .
A C++ object that contains virtual methods has as its first four bytes a pointer to its class 's vtable .
A vtable is a big array of function pointers which exists on a per-class basis .
Each virtual method is assigned an index in this table .
A virtual method is invoked by indexing into the vtable , getting the function pointer , and then calling it .
Once you have a pointer to it , a virtual method works just like a non-virtual method , in that it looks like a C function with an extra parameter stuck on the front .
So a function that does all this work to invoke the correct implementation looks like this :
static void * RenderObject_layer ( void * obj ) { const int layerVtableOffset = 7 ; typedef void * ( * LayerFptr ) ( void * ) ; LayerFptr ** fakeObj = obj ; LayerFptr fptr = fakeObj [ 0 ] [ layerVtableOffset ] ; return fptr ( obj ) ; }
There is a constant for the vtable offset , and a typedef for the function pointer that will be invoked .
Next I treat the object as if it were just a vtable , since I do n't care about the other parts of it .
Then I just index into the object to get the vtable , index into the vtable to get the function pointer , and finally invoke it .
Debugger ?
What 's
That ?
Now if you 've been paying close attention , right about now you 're thinking , " Where did he get that 7 from ? "
And a very good question that is !
The answer is basically trial and error .
From looking at the headers you can count the virtual methods and make a guess , but this is unreliable .
Virtual methods get laid out in the order that the compiler encounters them , so you can just count them off starting from the very first method in the highest superclass , working your way down , and find the offset .
The trouble with that approach is two - fold .
First , people suck at counting , especially when you 're counting stuff in mountains of evil C++.
Second , if you get it wrong , you 'll crash in horrible and weird ways .
You 'll be invoking a completely different function which probably takes completely different arguments and returns a completely different values .
Debugging that error will not be fun ; this is already difficult enough as it is , without adding another layer of undebuggability .
So ideally we'd want to come up with a guess , and then check it .
We can use our friend the debugger to tell us what the offset is .
I set a breakpoint in a location where I had a pointer to the object I wanted to investigate .
In this case it 's obj , which is a RenderObject ( or an instance of a subclass ) .
I 'll find the offset of the layer function that I used in the previous example .
( gdb ) p obj $ 1 = ( void *) 0x55127c0
Here we can see the object as a plain old void * .
We 'll have to do some creative casting to dig into it .
( gdb ) p *( void **) obj $ 2 = ( void *) 0xa5ca0e38
There 's the vtable .
( gdb ) p **( void ***) obj $ 3 = ( void *) 0x95e5deb0
And that 's the first entry in the vtable .
But it 's just another address , not very informative .
( gdb ) p /a 0x95e5deb0 $ 5 = 0x95e5deb0 < _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD1Ev >
Ah hah !
If we tell gdb to format it as an address ( the / a thing ) then it looks up the symbol .
And so now we know that the function at offset 0 is " _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD1
Ev " .
That 's probably a constructor or something of that nature .
( gdb ) p /a ( *( void ***) obj ) [ 0 ] $ 6 = 0x95e5deb0 < _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD1Ev >
Here 's a nicer way to look into the vtable .
Instead of chasing pointers and manually printing addresses , I 'll grab the vtable and then treat it like an array .
I do n't want to manually print off vtable entries until I find the right one , so I 'm going to see if I can get gdb to print a bunch of them for me .
( gdb ) set $ i = 0 ( gdb ) p /a ( *( void ***) obj ) [ $ i ] $ 7 = 0x95e5deb0 < _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD1Ev >
Better , it will print the entry at the index in $ i .
Now I just need a loop .
( gdb ) while $ i < 10 > print $ i > p /a ( *( void ***) obj ) [ $i ] > set $ i = $ i + 1 > end $ 29 = 0 $ 30 = 0x95e5deb0 < _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD1Ev >
$ 31 = 1 $ 32 = 0x95d5e130 < _ZN5khtml12RenderCanvasD0
Ev >
$ 33 = 2 $ 34 = 0x95cef53c < _ZN5khtml12RenderObject9setPixmapERK7QPixmapRK5QRectPNS_11CachedImageE >
$ 35 = 3 $ 36 = 0x95e31ea8 < _ZN5khtml18CachedObjectClient13setStyleSheetERKN3DOM9DOMStringES4 _>
$ 37 = 4 $ 38 = 0x95cef538 < _ZN5khtml18CachedObjectClient14notifyFinishedEPNS_12CachedObjectE >
$ 39 = 5 $ 40 = 0x95 f1e24c < _ZNK5khtml15RenderContainer10 firstChildEv>
$ 41 = 6 $ 42 = 0x95f1e254 < _ZNK5khtml15RenderContainer9lastChildEv>
$ 43 = 7 $ 44 = 0x95 f1dd80 < _ZNK5khtml9RenderBox5layerEv>
$ 45 = 8 $ 46 = 0x95 f1d7a0 < _ZN5khtml12RenderObject19positionChildLayersEv>
$ 47 = 9 $ 48 = 0x95c9d7b8 < _ZN5khtml12RenderObject13requiresLayerEv >
The number 10 was arbitrary , somewhat informed by my guessing from reading the headers .
You can keep going higher if you do n't find it .
But in this case we hit the jackpot ; we see a function called layer at offset 7 .
And that is the story of the 7 in the vtable example above .
Insects and Other Horrors
This is n't exactly a technique to use , but it 's a cautionary tale .
One of the C++ lines reads :
Position position = innerNode -> positionForCoordinates ( absXPos - renderXPos , absYPos - renderYPos ) ;
This gets translated into C as :
struct DOMPosition position = RenderObject_positionForCoordinatesP ( parentRenderer , absXPos /*- renderXPos*/ , absYPos /*- renderYPos*/ ) ;
The original definition of struct DOMPosition was :
struct DOMPosition { void * m_node ; long m_offset ; } ;
This worked fine for a long time , but this past winter it came time to make a Universal binary of LiveDictionary .
I groveled through the source code , checked it over with a fine - toothed comb , made sure all of my endians were swapped , and then sent off a build to somebody with an actual Intel Mac .
And of course , it crashed almost instantly .
And as I 'm sure you 've guessed , it crashed on that very line .
I spent a while not finding very much , just verifying that the PPC and Intel versions were doing the same thing .
This line was suspicious because it 's the only hacked C++ method that returns a struct .
On PPC , struct returns are done by using an implicit parameter and returning by reference .
If you write this :
struct Point p = Function ( x ) ;
It gets translated internally to something like this :
struct Point p ; Function ( & p , x ) ;
With the return being done by having Function write to the struct via this implicit first parameter .
I thought that Intel might be different , and it is just a little bit .
It turns out that on Intel , this convention is only used for structs that are longer than 8 bytes .
Small structs are returned just like primitives .
But still , there was no difference in calling convention between C functions and C++ methods , so things should still work even if this struct was only 8 bytes .
After some more digging I discovered the problem .
At some point , DOMPosition had gained a third member .
Doh !
My struct was 4 bytes too short .
It had continued to work on PPC through sheer luck ; either the new member was n't used , or the four bytes following the struct on the stack were something that could be harmlessly overwritten .
But on Intel , those extra 4 bytes were enough to push the function over the edge ; WebCore was returning the struct using the implicit parameter , but LiveDictionary was expecting a normal return , and so was n't passing an implicit parameter .
The result was a nasty crash .
The latest definition of the struct looks like :
struct DOMPosition { void * m_node ; long m_offset ; int m_affinity ; } ;
With that fix , the Intel build worked fine .
Conclusions
Hacking on private C++ classes is harrowing and dangerous but doable .
With the proper care , it can form the backbone of a whole application , so long as frequent updates are part of the plan , and the application is suitably paranoid .
LiveDictionary would put up a very dire warning and disable itself by default if it detected a version of Safari that was newer than what it knew about .
While I recommend this as the absolute last resort , and all other avenues should be explored first , it can be done if it 's necessary .

The publisher of the second - biggest German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( FAZ ) , Frank Schirrmacher , recently published a book that was widely discussed not only in Germany , but also in the US among the likes of George Dyson , John Perry Barlow , Nick Carr and the Guardian 's Annalena McCafee .
Now there may be a danger that you 'll find his arguments about machines taking over a bit over the top , but do n't let that put you off as there is undoubtedly a transformation going on that needs to be discussed .
Schirrmacher believes we are experiencing a profound change at the moment , an industrialisation of information – an " age of informavores " – and journalism is one of the first fields to undergo the change .
Indeed , companies such as the profitable Demand Media , which recently entered Comscore 's list of top 20 internet properties alongside the likes of Google , AOL , or Facebook , already let algorithms calculate what journalists should write about .
In an interview with the Guardian , Schirrmacher explains what his theories are all about .
A core focus of your book is the rise of algorithms .
What new role do they play in general and for journalism ?
With the internet , we are experiencing the industrialisation of information and communication .
Algorithms are used more and more to produce information that used to be created by journalists , or humans in general .
More and more of these algorithms are being used to find out what people are thinking .
At the moment , the material foundation of journalism is n't cracking because readers are going elsewhere , but because the advertising market has shifted its interest to issues of attention .
The advertising market today calculates the attention of potential clients in a new way using algorithms .
This is ruining journalism .
In addition , more and more journalists are writing their headlines not for humans any more , but for Google News .
Experts are telling them not only the keywords , but the structure of sentences that will be found by the algorithms of Google .
You write that journalism , among other fields , is experiencing a ' Darwinism of information ' .
What do you mean by that ?
That refers to a book by George Dyson .
Today , the factors that are important in journalism are still speed and automatisation – factors , by the way , that were responsible for starting the financial crisis .
Now , it makes a big difference if you have 30 seconds to make a decision or a tenth of a second .
The path we face in journalism is one in which there are fewer humans and more machines – and if you look at all the inaccurate news reports already , that is grotesque .
Humans have an intuitive awarness that has been of vital importance up till now : whoever has the information first has an advantage .
But look at the financial crisis that was started by computers selling automatically .
It does n't work like this anymore .
I believe , what we will experience now will be the automation of all possible spheres , starting with journalism .
Right now in terms of the constant reduction of cost we are experiencing in journalism the human component is regarded as cheap and exchangable , but in the end it will be the most expensive .
I believe that in the future of journalism there will be fewer players , but the ones who invest in the human factor are going to be big ones .
The well - educated , more complex human will be very expensive .
But only a few of them will be needed .
Journalism is one of the first fields to experience this transformation .
I believe medicine will be next .
Recently I talked with the CEO of Google , Eric Schmidt , and he explained to me that Google is not only heading towards real - time internet , but towards predicitive search .
He asked me whether I knew Apple Genius and whether I bought books at Amazon and then he said : " Now think of software that does that for your DNA – algorithms that can predict which disease patterns are likely .
We will program it . "
I answered that I was not going to use that .
He said : " You will , if it helps you . "
Should journalism give in to that ?
You have to understand that after Google everything was different .
Google itself did n't know the technical intelligence we are starting to experience , because nobody knew that there would be so much data .
In Germany you have publishers like Hubert Burda , who already knew in the 1990s all of the important media players of the future .
He had all the information and knew all the founders from Google to Twitter .
Now you can say that it is a problem within his enterprise , but I do n't believe that .
Nobody in the industry from Germany to the UK to the US knew how to react to the change .
That makes me think .
What do you think of the Murdoch debate that is going on , the plan to shut out Google ?
What I do n't understand is something more fundamental .
I can't understand why we are having a debate about the most important medium of the next few centuries with people who are enemies of technology , machine breakers so to speak , who want the paper back .
This is such a fake debate and it leaves me speechless .
While there might be some 80 - year - old publishers who do n't understand what 's going on you could expect that journalists write about what is going on .
Everything is changing at the moment .
But instead of journalists reporting on that and leading the debate , they are engaging in a banal debate .
What do you think of Schirrmacher 's thesis ?
Are we experiencing the industrialisation of information ?
Is it just a horror story to scare adults away from technology , or do any further examples come to mind ?

The Bush administration permitted the world ’s most notorious terrorist mastermind to escape because it needed additional justification to invade Iraq , according to a Democratic lawmaker from New York .
Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) leveled the allegation during an interview with MSNBC host David Shuster on Monday afternoon .
“ Look what happened with regard to our invasion into Afghanistan , how we apparently intentionally let bin Laden get away , ” he said .
“ How we intentionally did not follow the Taliban and al - Qaeda as they were escaping .
That was done by the previous administration because they knew very well that if they would capture al - Qaeda , there would be no justification for an invasion in Iraq . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They deliberately let Osama bin Laden get away ? ” asked an incredulous Shuster .
“ They deliberately let the head of al - Qaeda get away right after he , right after the 9/11 attacks ?
You really believe that ? ”
“ Yes , I do , ” Hinchey replied .
“ There ’s no question about that .
The leader of the military operation in the United States called back our military , called them back from going after the head of al - Qaeda because there was a sense that they did n’t want to capture him . ”
“ … To suggest that they deliberately let Osama bin Laden get away so they could invade Iraq , that will strike a lot of people as crazy , ” Shuster countered .
“ I do n’t think it will strike a lot of people as crazy , ” Hinchey said .
“ I think it will strike a lot of people as very accurate and all you have to do is look at the facts of that set of circumstances and you can see that ’s exactly what happened .
When we went in there , when our military went in there , we could have captured them .
We could have captured most of the Taliban and we could have captured the al - Qaeda .
But we did n’t , and we did n’t because of the need felt by the previous administration and the previous head of the military — that need to attack Iraq , which is completely unjustified . ”
Hinchey apparently based his allegations on a recently released Senate report that found then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld rejected calls for reinforcements in December 2001 , when the military allegedly had bin Laden trapped in Afghanistan .

“ The vast array of American military power , from sniper teams to the most mobile divisions of the marine corps and the army , was kept on the sidelines , ” the report says .
“ Instead , the US command chose to rely on airstrikes and untrained Afghan militias to attack Bin Laden and on Pakistan ’s loosely organized Frontier Corps to seal his escape routes . ”
Entitled “ Tora Bora revisited : how we failed to get Bin Laden and why it matters today , ” the report — commissioned by Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — says Bin Laden expected to die and had even written a will .

“ But the Al - Qaeda leader would live to fight another day .
Fewer than 100 American commandos were on the scene with their Afghan allies and calls for reinforcements to launch an assault were rejected .
“ Requests were also turned down for US troops to block the mountain paths leading to sanctuary a few miles away in Pakistan .

“ The decision not to deploy American forces to go after Bin Laden or block his escape was made by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his top commander , General Tommy Franks , ” the report says .
“ On or around December 16 , two days after writing his will , Bin Laden and an entourage of bodyguards walked unmolested out of Tora Bora and disappeared into Pakistan ’s unregulated tribal area .
Most analysts say he is still there today . ”

It ’s cold , it ’s snowy , and Christmas is fast approaching .
All of this means one very important thing to me : the Sam Adams ’ Winter Classics
Pack is finally available .
As a native of Boston , Sam Adams is basically my tap water , and their winter selections are by far my favorites .
Unlike many other breweries , who give you three - four if you ’re lucky - different brews in a mix - pack , Sam Adams fully embraces the spice of life with six different styles ranging from dark to light to spiced to fruity .
So what better way to enjoy the blizzard than to curl up with a half - dozen bottles , a perfect pint glass , and my laptop ?
Boston Lager
Let ’s start off with the original .
Boston Lager was introduced in 1984 , although the original recipe dates back to the 1860 ’s ‘ Louis Koch Lager ’ .
It is a Vienna Lager and sticking with the German tradition , is brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot .
Pours a deep golden color with a decent amount of off - white head .
Great retention , tons of nucleation .
Clearly the glass helps this beer .
Aroma is caramel malt , some grain , and hop .
Very straightforward .
Flavor is crisp .
Initial sweetness somewhere between pale and caramel malt .
A characteristically English style bitterness follows .
Hops last well into the aftertaste .
It ’s fairly light on the mouth .
The flavor is bigger than the mouthfeel , which in this case is good as it leaves the beer refreshing and very drinkable .
This is what ‘ beer ’ tastes like .
Simple , straightforward , no frills , but no compromises .
An old school beer , no doubt , but one that deserves to be revisited often .
7.25/10
Winter Lager
Moving down the spectrum of availability , we reach the seasonal Winter Lager .
Available on its own from approximately November thru January ( not nearly long enough ) , Sam Winter is a German - style Bock spiced with orange zest , cinammon , and ginger ( among other things ) .
Pours a clean caramel , two fingers or so of froth .
Pretty nice retention , and once again lots of nucleation in the Perfect Pint .
Light aroma , there ’s not a lot there , but what I can smell is more hoppy than expected .
Taste up front is a big wallop of carmel malt .
Malt & hop are far more distinguishable than spices , which is rare for Sam Adams .
Flavor turns a tad metallic after the initial malt hit .
Spicyness shows in the aftertaste .
Very earthy , with a bit of cinammon & ginger .
Interestingly similar to the Fezziwig ( scroll down ) , but lighter and crisper .
Medium - bodied , high carbonation , very clean on the tongue .
My second - favorite Sam Seasonal ( I ’m counting down the days until White Ale hits the shelves ) , Winter Lager is definitely a great beer for a cold night , and my favorite Sam Adams to pair with dinner ( it seems to work with just about any red meat ) .
Again , a fairly straightforward beer , but a great standby .
7/10
Cranberry Lambic
Alright , let ’s get one thing straight before I get to the tasting .
This is not a Lambic !
Do you hear me Jim ?
A lambic is - by definition - a sour ale ( usually fruity ) produced by spontaneous fermentation .
Read about it .
What we have here is a wheat - based , [ likely artificially ] fruit - flavored ale .
To call it a lambic would be to call a piece of Veal Filet Mignon .
They might both be good in their own right … but they are n’t the same thing .
Ok , now that I ’ve got that off my chest …
Pours a hazy , murky rust with a thick white head .
Bubbles are big and pop easily , leaving a medium ring beyond the initial pour .
Sweet , fruity smell , surprisingly not of cranberry .
I detect more cherry and sugary malt than anything else .
Carmel flavor , some wheat backbone .
Again more generic fruit … it just does n’t taste like cranberry to me .
No tartness whatsoever , from the fruit nor the expected - but - nonexistent “ lambic . ”
There ’s more bitterness about this beer than in this beer .
Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy , similar to a good wit .
I enjoy this beer less and less every year .
I think as my palate grows used to hops and brettanomyces , the idea of an overly sweetened wheat ale loses it ’s appeal .
2/10 ( Would have been 3 - 4/10 if they ’d just own up and call it what it is : Cranberry Wit )
Coastal Wheat
Coastal Wheat is an American Wheat Ale ( which is different from a German Hefeweizen or Belgian Wit ) brewed with lemon peel .
Why such a decidedly summer style found itself in a winter mix - pack is beyond me .
It ’s Sam Adams ’ newest release , so I ’m guessing they ’re just trying to publicize it .
Coastal
Wheat is a translucent pale yellow .
Very little head , but consistent lacing .
Aroma is not very pleasing , kind of like rotten citrus .
Flavor is bready , with a bit of lemon juice .
Kind of like a blue moon with lemon already added .
… and that ’s it .
To be frank , this is a simple , uninteresting , and underwhelming beer .
Not what I ’ve come to expect from the Boston Beer Company .
I hope I ’m wrong , but I ca n’t help see this as anything other than a knee - jerk marketing reaction to the recent success of faux - craft brews like Blue Moon & Shocktop ( and a few other generic wheat ales ) .
Of course , this is ironic because those beers were the macro breweries ’ attempts to combat the growing popularity of craft breweries like Sam Adams .
Go figure .
Poor marketing decisions aside , this is the worst Sam Adams beer I ’ve ever had .
Even as a summertime ale it ’s not very good , but to jam it in a winter pack ( replacing the always - excellent Black Lager , even ) is downright insulting .
1/10
Old Fezziwig
Now that we ’ve got the unpleasantness out of the way , let ’s move on with the real winter beers .
Old Fezziwig is a Winter Warmer with cinnamon , ginger , and orange peel added ( sound familiar ? ) .
Pours caramel color with an inch or so of bubbly head .
Quickly dissipates , but nucleation continues .
The beer has a dark fruit & cinnamon smell .
Flavor is roasty , with a bit of smoke .
Full flavored dark malts , some chocolate .
There are definitely hops in there , but they ’re balanced .
Spices show up toward the end , cinammon & citrus ( more from orange peel than from the hop ) , very faint ginger at the end .
A very well spiced winter warmer .
One of my favorite things about December .
8.75/10
Holiday Porter
Holiday Porter is an American Porter brewed with four types of malt and English Noble hops .
Compared to the other beers in this pack , it ’s among the more straightforward .
Pours a deep blackish ruby , near opaque .
An inch of thick beige sticky foam insulates the beer and coats the glass from start to finish .
Aroma is roasty and metallic , with some molasses sweetness .
Flavor is n’t as sweet or malty as you ’d expect from the aroma .
Roasted chocolate & bitter coffee dominate up front .
Some figgy or rasiny sugars sneak in there as well .
A bit astringent towards the middle .
A big diacetyl presence as well .
Aftertaste is espresso bitter and a little burnt .
Medium - to - heavy body .
Diacetyl adds a creaminess that matches perfectly with the bold flavors .
This , plus a looong lasting , near nitro level of froth makes for an excellently well rounded porter .

56 days . . . 55 days . . . 54 days . . .
Chelsea Caudle began signing her text messages this summer with a countdown .
At 14 years old , she knew no better way to express what was coming .
Day Zero was to be Oct. 7 , the day Dad left for Army basic training in Fort Jackson , S.C.
He was moving 950 miles from their home in Watertown , 950 miles from Mom .
He was leaving , even though Mom was sick with ovarian cancer .
Even though he had been at her side through two long , miserable rounds of chemotherapy .
Even though she now faced the likelihood of a third .
In fact , Dad was leaving because Mom was sick .
In March , he was laid off from his job as a raw materials coordinator for a plastics company called PolyOne , where he 'd worked for 20 years .
His severance package had provided several months ' salary , but by August the paychecks were winding down .
Soon the cost of his family health coverage was going to triple , then a few months after that , nearly triple again .
They needed coverage so Mom could fight her cancer .
Dad 's solution : a four - year hitch in the Army .
So Chelsea counted down the days to his departure .
When the countdown reached 49 , the text message signature began to annoy and depress her , so she stopped .
High school was beginning , her freshman year .
In the first week of class , one of the teachers asked :
What do your parents do ?
The question jolted Chelsea back to the shifting ground of her family .
Mom was working part time at a Culver 's restaurant , preparing for more chemo , worrying about how to pay the bills .
In less than six weeks , Dad would enter the Army and her care would be covered .
The tradeoff was that he would be far away when Mom needed him home , when Chelsea needed him , too .
He would miss all of her high school years .
The band performances .
Prom .
Chelsea thought of all his absence would mean .
When she sent her next text message , she resumed the countdown .
36 days .
***
Mom and Dad are Michelle and Bill Caudle , high school sweethearts now 40 and 39 , respectively .
They have three children : Chelsea , the youngest ; Alysha , a 21 - year - old working at a nearby Holiday Inn ; and Little Bill , an 18 - year - old ex-high school wrestler .
The Caudles are not fond of politics .
Michelle and Bill have paid little attention to the shouting this summer over health care reform .
They have not gone to any of the town hall meetings .
They are well aware that politicians and interest groups would like to trumpet their story or dismiss it to score points in the debate - and they would just as soon avoid all of that .
" We 're not activists , " Michelle said .
But this year the national story of lost jobs became their story .
And the saga of families losing health insurance was about to become theirs , too .
Except that Bill would n't let it .
True , he had been interested in the Army for years .
And he could always request an emergency leave to come home if Michelle 's condition grew dire ( Army regulations allow this if a family member 's death is imminent ) .
But for weeks before enlisting , Bill had sought other options .
He revised his résumé .
He answered " help wanted " ads , then watched the companies cut workers instead of hiring them .
He interviewed for one job that would have paid $ 13 an hour - less than half of what he was making at PolyOne .
He did n't get the job .
Finally , on May 13 , his 39th birthday , he signed the Army papers .
He remembers thinking : What did I do ?
Chelsea learned about her dad 's decision when Michelle picked her up from school .
It had been a bad day already : a problem with one of her teachers , then she had to do the mile run .
" I have something to tell you , " her mom said after Chelsea slid into her seat .
" Your dad enlisted in the Army .
There 's more :
He 'll be gone for four years . "
Chelsea started to cry .
Two weeks later , Michelle Caudle sat in the office of her doctor , Peter Johnson , at Aurora Women 's Pavilion in West Allis .
Johnson has been an oncologist for 13 years , and despite the immeasurable sorrow that comes with treating cancer , he loves the work for the hope in it .
He has shared the joy of patients who 've lived to see birthdays , anniversaries , and the graduations and weddings of their children .
On this particular day , Michelle 's latest tests had come back .
Just six months earlier she 'd celebrated the end of her second chemotherapy treatment .
Now , the tests revealed tiny " spots , " or changes on her abdomen , neck and lungs .
Not a good sign .
The measure upon which cancer hopes rise and fall , the CA125 number - Please , let it stay low - was climbing .
" I could lie to you but I 'm not going to , " Johnson told Michelle .
Although he could not say for certain the cancer was back , this early sign pointed to that possibility .
The doctor compared her cancer to a chronic disease that would never be completely vanquished from the body .
Michelle broke down .
For three years she 'd been nurturing her hope in the face of uncertainty .
" I 'm not going to beat this , " she said .
***
Ovarian cancer is a stealth disease , shadowy and overshadowed .
Years of publicity about breast cancer have empowered women with the knowledge that they can catch the disease early by performing a self - exam .
Ovarian cancer has garnered just a fraction of the publicity , and the message has been decidedly more negative .
There is no self - exam .
By the time ovarian cancer has announced its presence , the disease has often progressed to the third of the four cancer stages .
Once a woman has been diagnosed , her odds of surviving five years are less than 50 - 50 .
All told , the disease kills about 15,000 American women every year .
On Nov. 14 , 2006 , the day Michelle first walked into Johnson 's office , she thought she had a cyst .
Her abdomen felt tender and she was constipated .
No one had said " cancer . "
Still , she had been referred to an oncologist and she was scared .
A CT scan showed a large mass , about 8 inches in diameter .
Her CA125 level , which measures cancer antigens , was 21 times higher than it should have been .
The next day she went into surgery .
Johnson spent more than four hours removing as much of the cancer as he could .
From that day forward , Michelle and Bill had a new job that superseded any other : fighting cancer .
Although the disease was hers , he would assume responsibility for meals and laundry and the things she 'd always done but was too tired and sick to do now .
Michelle passed some of the days curled up on the recliner , drained and queasy .
Bill worked around her , cooking hot dogs and other simple meals .
Chelsea made spaghetti and chicken .
Bill went with Michelle to her doctor appointments , surgeries and chemotherapies .
When the cancer returned in 2008 , he sat beside her as the doctor discussed what to try next .
He felt he had to be " the strong one , " so when she cried , he did not .
Of all Bill 's responsibilities , one rose above the others :
Health coverage .
***
The March 2009 layoff was announced months before it took place .
Though the news was jolting , Bill thought maybe it would n't be so bad .
He 'd wanted a job a little closer to home than PolyOne , 30 miles away in Sussex .
Now he could find something better .
But it had been a long time since he applied for work or sat for an interview .
What do you tell people about yourself ?
After sending out résumés , he got the feeling it did n't much matter .
Even companies that had advertised for staff were changing their minds .
By the second week at home , he was struggling to find things to do .
He cleaned the kitchen .
He vacuumed .
He exercised .
He logged onto the computer and checked job sites .
The president 's stimulus bill was helping laid off workers pay for the health coverage they had while employed .
Between this assistance and Bill 's severance package from PolyOne , the Caudles initially paid $ 136 a month for their coverage .
But in September , when Bill 's severance package ended , they would pay $ 497 .
In January , when they would be on their own : $ 1,370 .
Bill needed a job .
He needed health benefits .
And a cursory look persuaded him that the answer would not be BadgerCare Plus , Wisconsin 's public health insurance program .
Besides , he was leaning toward another idea , one that presented the Caudles with a quandary .
The Army would solve their health coverage problem .
In years past he would have been too old , but in 2005 the age limit for enlistment was increased from 35 to 40 , and a year later it was raised again to 42 .
The tradeoff would be his absence from home .
In the end , although he risked leaving Michelle to fight cancer on her own , Bill chose the Army .
He signed on for a job as a signal support systems specialist , a soldier who works with communications equipment .
" Seventy percent of the reason is for the insurance , " said Bill 's mother , Marguerite Hemiller .
" He told me , ' I 've always wanted to do something for my country and I have to help Michelle . ' "

Enjoy the summer , Johnson had advised Michelle in May when they got the first inkling her cancer might be back yet again .
There was no emergency , no need to hurry into another round of chemo .
Not yet .
So Michelle tried to live her life as if cancer and health coverage were not calling the shots .
She continued working at Culver 's in Watertown .
She enjoyed the return of her auburn hair after the previous rounds of chemo .
She spent time with her husband and children , though it was not always easy to avoid reminders of what they were facing .
Bill began a vigorous program of jogging , pushups and exercises to prepare for basic training .
Once a week , he went to the Army recruiting office in Watertown to train with other recruits .
In August , they celebrated a friend 's wedding .
As they slow - danced at the reception , Michelle wondered how many dances they had left .
She leaned close to Bill 's ear .
" That 'll have to be good for the next four years , " she said .
Bill reminded her they had another wedding in two weeks .
Also , they had a week coming up at a cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains with Chelsea , Little Bill and Michelle 's parents .
The vacation in Tennessee was a last chance for the kind of closeness the family would have to manage without .
Bill and his son went four - wheeling in the mountains .
He took Chelsea horseback riding along a forest trail .
Riding single file was not conducive to long conversations , so they savored the quiet .
Michelle and Bill had their time , too , sitting together at the cabin , then white - water rafting down the Pigeon River .
Michelle enjoyed the cool spray on her face .
The future stretched only as far as the next bend in the river .
One day they all hiked up Clingmans Dome , an elevation of 6,600 feet .
There were benches every tenth of a mile or so .
Michelle had to sit frequently .
She found it hard to watch her parents , both in their 60s , waiting for her .
She had been trying to forget about being sick .
***
On Aug. 27 - 41 days - Michelle 's summer ended .
She sat with Bill in a private room in Aurora Women 's Pavilion waiting for the official word on her latest blood tests .
The doctor 's office had called to tell her that her CA125 , the cancer measure she hoped to keep low , had risen from 17 to 66 .
" Odds are he 's going to tell me it 's back , " she said .
Johnson entered the room and crouched beside Michelle 's chair .
There was cancer in her abdomen , he said .
" There 's some areas in the lung , too . "
" Oh no . "
" Not a lot , " the doctor continued .
" There 's one area in the right side .
There 's a little area on the left side .
None of these are big .
We 're talking three - eighths of an inch . "
Michelle 's eyes went watery .
The nurse reached for a tissue .
" You know what ?
I brought my own , " Michelle said , and her smile let everyone know it was OK to laugh .
For a moment they did .
Johnson said there was no single area to go after surgically , but Michelle had responded well to chemotherapy .
His soft voice outlined the chemo plan .
" I 'd suggest we start fairly soon , " he said .
Right after Labor Day .
Michelle bowed her head and Johnson leaned toward her .
" I 'm sorry , " he said .
During the car ride back to Watertown , Michelle told Bill there was one thing she wished she could do .
" I 'd like to be a grandmother .
I 'd be a really good grandmother . "
At home , Michelle wrote six words on her Facebook page :
" Cancer back .
Sucks to be me . "
***
35 days .
" I 'm going to blow the whistle and you are going to jog . "
Staff Sgt. Larry Finefield stood before Bill and half a dozen other recruits on an empty soccer field in Watertown on a cloudless September afternoon .
Finefield called out each new exercise .
The recruits shouted back in unison , then went to work .
Bill was surrounded by teenagers , kids who could have gone to school with Little Bill - in fact , one had .
After 10 minutes of pushups , leg lifts and other drills , Bill 's face reddened .
Sweat beaded along his forehead .
The teenagers were straining , too .
Each time they jogged , a chorus of panting filled the air .
An hour later , they finished by sprinting pass patterns one - by - one as Finefield hurled the football downfield .
" All right guys , " Finefield shouted finally .
" We 're done . "
This was a taste of what Bill could expect at basic training .
He was building up his body .
20 days .
Michelle was more than a week into her new round of chemo .
The exhausting ritual was familiar and she tried to approach it with humor .
" They have to draw my blood first to see if I 'm healthy enough to be poisoned , " she said one morning as she waited to be treated .
Chemotherapy destroys healthy cells as it attacks cancerous ones .
That 's why nurses had to measure Michelle 's white blood cells , red blood cells and platelets to be sure that she had recovered sufficiently from the previous dose and could receive the next without risking life - threatening complications .
And that 's why Michelle 's stomach churned and her energy vanished .
The previous Sunday , she had gone back to sleeping in the recliner for a simple reason : " When you sleep , you do n't feel sick . "
As she slept , Bill cooked and cleaned .
When she woke , he asked what she wanted .
" Who 's going to baby me ? "
Michelle asked , anticipating the days ahead .
Now , as she sat beside Bill , waiting for the next dose of chemo , she still had no answer .
The pale liquid arrived in an IV bag .
The pump pulsed , emitting a soft , mechanical whir as the liquid flowed .
Michelle talked about going to work at Culver's .
Might take her mind off things .
The bag was empty , the poison inside her .
On the way to the car , she told Bill she might look for a new hat .
" I have a feeling I 'm going to need it . "
11 days .
The cake was for Bill , but the party was as much for Michelle .
In the chemo cycle - two weeks on , one off - this was her break from the poison .
She was ready to feel good again .
Friends and relatives arrived at the Caudles ' backyard carrying dishes .
Bill shook hands .
Michelle wandered back and forth between the kitchen and the yard , smiling and laughing .
She stayed on her feet until just about everyone else was seated .
" She 's a strong woman , " said her mother , Sharon Hutchins .
Both Hutchins and Bill 's mother , Marguerite Hemiller , have accompanied Michelle to her cancer treatments .
Hemiller , a nurse for 27 years , remembered that during the first months of chemo , Michelle would stand in the parking lot crying , not wanting to go inside .
Now , Hemiller felt conflicted about her son 's decision to join the Army .
" One half of me says , ' Go . '
The other half says , ' You 'd better stay , ' " she said .
" I know he 's got to do it .
He 's got to get that insurance . "
Hemiller lived without insurance for two years after she lost her job late in 2006 .
When she did not feel well , she diagnosed herself .
That would not be an option for her daughter - in - law .
At the party , Michelle wore her birthday present from Bill : a Green Bay Packers jersey with the number of her favorite player , defensive end Johnny Jolly .
Her birthday was still a few weeks away on Oct. 20 , but by then Bill would be gone .
After dinner , friends and family sliced up a " Farewell Bill " cake decorated with an eagle clutching arrows and a shield .
There were no songs , no toasts .
" We 're kind of quiet , " Michelle said .
By evening , most of the guests were gone .
The Caudles lighted a fire in their outdoor fireplace and sat around talking until it was time for bed .
6 days .
Oct. 1 , Chelsea 's 15th birthday .
A balloon and flower bouquet waited for her on the dining room table .
Chelsea was at a football game .
In the living room , Michelle lay in her recliner , huddled under a blanket .
She had turned the television way down , but the glow from the screen flickered over her , the only light in a dark room .
The chemo , administered two days earlier , had hit full force , nausea overwhelming her .
During earlier rounds of chemo , Bill had tried to talk with her , to distract her .
Now he knew better .
He left her alone .
Posted on the door of the refrigerator were the doctor 's orders and the date of her next appointment : Oct. 6 . The same day the recruiter would take Bill to Milwaukee before his flight to South Carolina .
" It does n't seem real yet , " Bill said , coming in from the garage where he had been cleaning .
" I do n't know if I feel anything yet . "
In the dining room , he had the list of things to bring : comfortable clothing , socks , underwear , shampoo , soap , deodorant , toothpaste , disposable shaver , $ 50 , Social Security card , birth certificate and marriage certificate .
" I 'm scared for when you leave , " his daughter Alysha said .
Bill knew how the family felt .
To help them prepare , he had written lists of the tasks they would have to pick up when he was gone .
Weekly jobs : " garbage , cleaning the bathrooms and bedrooms , laundry , vacuuming . "
Biweekly : " dusting , cleaning the shower , recyclables . "
Monthly : " cleaning windows , running computer disk cleanup . "
Seasonal : " mowing the lawn , shoveling snow , switching the furnace from summer to winter , then winter to summer . "
Little Bill had arranged the night 's dinner , a rotisserie chicken that came free with the purchase of 10 packages of Rice - A - Roni .
Bill ate alone at the dining room table .
Michelle slept .
Then her cell phone began beeping .
A text message from Chelsea .
The football game was over .
" Get me . "
Michelle called to her husband .
Bill grabbed the keys and headed to the garage .
***
Day Zero .
The separation came sooner than Chelsea had expected .
Her dad was not scheduled to fly to basic training until Oct. 7 , but a day earlier he had to report to the recruiting office where a van would take him to Milwaukee .
The recruits would be driven to a hotel in the city so that early the next day , they could be processed , sworn in and flown to their base .
Bill 's family would not be there on the 7th .
Hard enough to face one farewell .
No one had the stomach for a second .
Besides , separation was n't the family 's only misery scheduled for Oct.
6 . Hours before Bill left , Michelle was to receive her next dose of chemo .
Bill planned to accompany her to the hospital .
Chelsea , too .
This time , however , Michelle 's blood tests were not good .
She was not healthy enough to be poisoned .
She would have to skip a week .
So , on a rainy morning , everyone , including Bill 's mother and stepfather , waited in Watertown , watching the clock tick closer to 1 p.m. and his appointment at the recruiting office .
Less than an hour remained .
Bill hooked up the camera to the TV and they watched a slide show of images from the past year .
Here was Little Bill at his high school prom and graduation , and Chelsea at confirmation .
Here was the Fourth of July parade , Chelsea marching with the band and holding the flag .
Here was the trip to the Great Smoky Mountains - the cabin , four - wheeling with Little Bill , horseback riding with Chelsea .
" This is me dying , " Michelle said , smiling at a photo of the climb up Clingmans Dome .
" You made it , " Bill said .
When the slide show returned to Little Bill 's prom , the family stood up to go .
Bill grabbed his backpack .
The long goodbye moved to the recruiting office .
The van was late .
Michelle straightened her husband 's jacket and hugged him .
She talked about the last few months , how strange it had felt to have him home during the day instead of away at work .
It would feel stranger still not to have him around at all .
" I 'll find out how many times I say , ' I do n't know .
Ask your Dad .
That 's your Dad 's department , ' " she said .
Just before 2:30 , the van arrived .
" Butterflies are coming back , " Bill said , excusing himself for a last trip to the restroom .
The driver checked IDs , consulted his clipboard , then eyed Bill and the other recruit .
" You ready ? "
Chelsea and her Dad hugged .
It happened so quickly ; all she could say was : " Bye . "
In the parking lot , tears streamed down Michelle 's face .
She held Bill near the van , unable to find any words at all .
" I love you , " Bill said .
" I 'll call . "
And then he was gone .
On the ride home , Chelsea texted her cousin and her best friend .
My Dad just left .
No signature this time .
The countdown was over .
***
Early the next morning , Bill Caudle learned that he would not be going to Fort Jackson , S.C.
He was headed to Fort Knox , Ky. , instead .
He would be half as far from home - 475 miles instead of 950 .
The moment he was processed at Fort Knox , his Army health coverage kicked in .
Having missed a week of chemo , Michelle is scheduled to return for treatment Tuesday .
Her birthday .
" Not exactly where you want to spend your birthday , " she said , managing a grin .
If all went according to schedule , Bill would finish basic training in mid-December .
Michelle would still be in the midst of chemo .
She hoped to make it to his graduation .
From the moment John and Edward burst onto the X Factor stage with their faux - American accents and questionable singing ability , TV viewers have been obsessed with the two spiky - haired teenagers from Dublin .
Six months ago , they were completely unknown , with little more than a few talent contests under their belts .
Now they are the talk of the tabloids -- and chat rooms .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The singing siblings have beaten thousands of wannabe stars and made it to the last 12 of ITV 's flagship weekend show .
But not all the X Factor judges were as impressed as their mentor Louis Walsh -- Simon Cowell famously branded them " vile little creatures " on the show .
In reality , identical twin brothers John Paul and Edward Grimes ( 17 ) from Lucan , Co Dublin , are well brought - up , middle - class boys .
They went to King 's Hospital , one of the country 's most expensive schools , which charges € 1,910 per term .
They are currently enrolled at Dublin 's Institute of Education , where fees are € 6,950 for an academic year .
Their odyssey began in June , when the duo travelled to Glasgow for the first round of auditions for the show and made it through the gruelling boot camp before surviving another round at Louis Walsh 's X Factor getaway in Tuscany .
Since then , they have been busy honing their act .
Tomorrow they will learn if they have progressed to the next stage when they perform in front of a live TV audience in London .
The Grime brothers wooed the Irish pop mogul with their rendition of the Backstreet Boys song ' As Long As You Love Me ' when they first appeared on the show .
Dannii Minogue ( below ) dismissed them as " the cockiest singers without a record deal " after their performance .
The first impression they left on the show 's token grouch Simon Cowell was less then flattering .
" They 're vile little creatures who would step on their mother 's head to have a hit , " he said .
Echoing Cowell 's thoughts , the twins ' inclusion as one of the 12 X Factor finalists has been met with an enormous online backlash .
A staggering 400 groups have been set up on social networking site Facebook with over 100,000 members calling for the brothers to be axed from the TV show .
Online support for the duo is not so impressive -- only 1,800 people have signed up to pledge their allegiance to them .
Among the mountain of comments left on Facebook , user Kate referred to the twins as " obnoxious , irritating little brats " .
Comments left on other pages are equally scathing : one member , Ben , pleaded " for the most insufferable contestants of all time to be shown the door " .
However , their father John Grimes was quick to hit back at his sons ' doubters .
" My lads are great .
We are all really proud of them and behind them 100 pc , " he said .
The twins ' former athletics coach Ann McGee told the Irish Independent she got the impression that they have been putting on an act with the hope of gaining a place in the final .
" From my experience they 're lovely lads , and I think they are probably playing up to the camera , " she said .
Jim D'Arcy , principal at the Institute of Education on Leeson St , Dublin , agreed : " I think their persona on the show must be a bit staged because they 're not arrogant or anything like that , but it is getting them a lot of publicity . "
The brothers have their own explanation for the polarising effect they have on viewers : " We 're like frosted flakes -- some people are afraid to admit they like us , " they told an Irish newspaper .
The public 's long - standing fascination with the legions of fame - hungry contestants who have auditioned for the X Factor -- which is now in its sixth season -- has always been fickle .
One minute , they are the darlings of tabloid newspapers , plastered to the bedroom walls of an army of teenage girls , selling out stadium concerts and signing highly lucrative endorsement deals .
Then , in an instant , they fade into obscurity .
For major record labels , the reality TV format is one way to guarantee profitability in the age of illegal file - sharing and dwindling CD sales .
The incredible popularity of programmes such as X Factor , Pop Idol and Britain 's Got Talent is a boon to the ailing music industry .
It 's certainly a much more cost - effective way of doing business than the old model of a record company investing in and nurturing an artist from scratch .
The modern formula seems a much better bet for record company executives as the acts essentially pay for themselves , through phone - in voting , merchandise , etc .
Are the Grimes brothers any different ?
Louis Walsh said that from a marketing point of view the brothers have the potential to make it in the cut - throat industry of disposable reality TV pop stars .
" They 're not great singers , but they could be great pop stars , " he said when asked if he thought they had what it takes to make it .
He added : " It 's a great marketing opportunity as we 've never had identical twins make it so far in the show . "
Whatever your opinion of the ' Brothers Grim ' , as a British tabloid dubbed them , they have made their mark .
It remains to be seen if Edward and John Grimes will end up headlining the O2 or playing weddings and kids ' parties , but the world of reality TV will no doubt have many more willing participants to take their place should their 15 minutes of fame run out .

Lotus chief Tony Fernandes has accepted fellow airline entrepreneur Richard Branson 's challenge that whoever 's Formula 1 team finishes lowest next season should act as a stewardess on one of the winner 's flights .
Fernandes - the founder of Air Asia - joked at last week 's Motor Sport Business Forum that he really wanted his Lotus squad to beat air travel rival Branson 's Virgin team in 2010 , saying : " Number one we have to be ahead of Branson , otherwise I will retire and kill myself . "
At yesterday 's Virgin Racing launch , Branson raised the stakes further by suggesting a forfeit for the losing team boss .
" Having come from a music background , I suppose we might be able to choose the music for the funeral , " Branson was quoted as saying by Reuters .
" But I like Tony a lot so I hope he does n't have to kill himself .
" At the same obviously we would like to beat him .
Maybe we can think of another challenge .
He has an airline , we have an airline and if we beat him he can come and work on our airline as a Virgin stewardess .
" We will make sure that the stewardess outfit is perfect .
I suspect that he might ask us to reciprocate .
I 'll have to check how fetching his stewardess outfits are but I 'd be game to do it while totally confident of winning . "
Now Fernandes has accepted the challenge , with Lotus publishing a mock - up picture on its website featuring Branson in an Air Asia stewardess uniform .
" It 's quite fitting , do n't you think ? " said Fernandes .
" Our passengers will be delighted to be served by a Knight of the Realm .
" But , knowing Richard , the real challenge will be to prevent him from asking our guests ' coffee , tea or me ? '
That would be scary . "
Today , we 're going to deviate from our standard review format for just a bit ... and we beg your indulgence for this exercise .
Left 4 Dead 2 is available now , and many of you have most likely already purchased the game .
Some may still have hard feelings about how quickly the game was released after the first game — which is out of character for Valve .
Some of you may still be on the fence about plopping down your money for the game .
Instead of describing the game and giving you the good and the bad , it 's time to just put the cards down : this is a great game that 's worth your time and money .
We present to you , in no particular order , the reasons you should buy Left 4 Dead 2 ... on the PC .
More content than the first game
Left 4 Dead 2 has five campaigns , each with its own distinct setting and challenges .
You 'll be fighting the infected in the dark , in the daylight , on the tracks of a roller coaster , in high places , and in low places .
You 'll have multiple paths through certain areas , and situations can be tackled in many different ways .
There will be a metal concert ... with pyro .
There will be rain .
The missions in this game are more varied , with bigger set - pieces and more asked of the player while playing .
Simply seeing all there is to see is a big job , and is a major time commitment .
In the first game , you could finish all the movies in a leisurely afternoon .
The campaign is just the beginning , though .
You also have the vs. mode with the new infected , which brings brand - new strategies and combinations into the mix .
You can use the Jockeys to nudge the survivors into traps , you can use the Spitter to control their movement or simply sap the health of a large group of players — the range on the acid projectile is surprisingly long .
The Charger is n't as strong as the Tank , but he can disrupt a large group of survivors and put the major hurt on a player if he 's not taken out quickly .
The new levels , with the new infected , give vs. mode a whole new life .
Survival mode is back , with all its frustrations ; you simply have to stay alive while wave after wave of Infected are thrown at you .
Scavenge mode tasks the survivors with collecting gas cans to refill generations while the Infected do all they can to kill them .
You can turn on Realism mode which means players wo n't respawn in closets and will have to be revived with defibrillators , the Infected are harder to kill with an added emphasis on headshots , and there are now no outlines around characters or items .
The Realism mode can be turned on during any difficulty level , in any campaign .
There are more game modes out of the box , with more campaigns to explore .
You can master the game on one difficulty level and then move to Advanced difficulty , which requires all new strategies .
Realism mode changes the game significantly .
Vs. mode is always changing as strategies spread across the Internet .
This is a big , big game .
New weapons !
Whereas the first game had a limited selection of weaponry , the sequel gives you multiple shotguns , multiple handguns , and multiple fully - automatic weapons , as well as incendiary ammunition , explosive ammo , and laser sights .
You can also find a grenade launcher that 's good for dealing with crowds — but is hell if wielded by someone who does n't respect friendly fire .
That 's not even discussing the melee weapons , which you can pick up if you 're willing to drop your handgun .
Ranging from a katana to a cricket bat to a frying pan , you can slice through large groups of Infected with ease , but by definition you have to be in close quarters ; be sure to tell your friend with the shotgun you plan on wading into a horde before you start swinging away .
I could devote a whole section to the joys of the chainsaw , with its limited supply of fuel and ability to make quick work out of anything you put in front of it .
Weapons are no longer given out in neat piles with an easy upgrade path .
Now you 'll find weapon drops throughout the level , forcing you to make hard choices about what to carry and when .
But wait , there 's more !
Now you can pick up Boomer bile as a grenade , which you can throw at any enemy or location to cause the infected to swarm to that area .
Bonus points for getting a horde to attack a Tank .
Finding your favorite loadouts by combining ranged weapons with a melee weapon , or maybe dual - wielding handguns while keeping the chrome shotgun or the AK47 , will be a fun job for the first few hours , and the game gives you a nice pile of hardware to play with .
This is a proper PC release
The 360 version is going to be fun , no doubt about it , but the PC version features support for dedicated servers — because of course that 's a selling point now — and the menu features slots for add - on campaigns and new content .
The first game already has some fun user - created levels and mods , and this game will be no different .
The ability to find the best servers creates a more consistent online experience , Steam offers a great way to make sure you always have someone you know to play with , and the mouse and keyboard are much more accurate than playing with a controller .
I do n't want to start a flame war here , but if you have a decent gaming system , the PC version is less expensive , offers more content , will be updated more frequently , and has better controls .
The game also scales wonderfully ; I can play it on my MacBook Pro at a good framerate and it looks fine , but on my desktop I can crank the detail and have it look much better than even the 360 version .
It 's harder
My regular group of teammates had a quick conversation about whether we should start the campaign on Normal or Advanced difficulty , and decided to stick with Normal to learn the ropes and fly through the campaigns .
That did n't quite happen .
The Director knows how to use the special infected in packs to break up your group , it knows how to keep you moving , and the new environmental , weather , and fire changes you 'll see in the game will keep you guessing .
Our group was ripped apart multiple times , and we learned to respect the Normal difficulty mode .
You 'll be forced to learn how to use the new items and weapons very quickly , and if you do n't work together as a team and communicate , you wo n't stand a chance .
Lastly , it 's the little things
When you throw a pipe bomb and it blows up , bodies and body parts fly in every direction .
Zombies now lose limbs , and look horrific both before and after you take weapons to them .
The weapons look and sound satisfying .
The campaign offers more than a few surprises to even seasoned players .
Despite the fast development time , this is a game filled with detail , love , and care .
You 'll be able to pour hours into any of the game modes and still feel like you have more to learn or to do .
You can boycott all you want , but you 're only hurting yourself .
The game seems to be selling well , the servers are filled with skilled and happy gamers , and the reviews have been positive .
Here 's hoping that Valve can turn around a Left 4 Dead 3 that 's just as good in another year .
Reasons NOT to buy the game ?
You do n't like playing online .
With the new infected and heightened difficulty , the included bots are much lamer .
If you do n't mind being social and have gaming friends , however , you have no excuse .

I immediately start planning to make this super easy baked pumpkin recipe or crispy candied pumpkin recipe .
How To Make Baked Pumpkin Dessert Turkish Style
Slice the pumpkin in the size you like .
Wash them well and clean their seeds and chop them big .
If you have the opportunity , you can buy it chopped .
Put them in a large pot by adding sugar between each line .
Put its lid on and wait it for one night , at least 6 hours .
During this time , pumpkin pieces release their juice , so we do n’t need to add extra water while boiling it .
After a night , put the pot on the medium heat and boil the pumpkin pieces until they get soft .
Bring it to boil a few times without the lid on .
In this way , the syrup of it will be denser .
Then let it cool in the same pot .
Do not take them on a service plate while they are still hot as they can get crumbled .
After they are cold enough , wait it in refrigerator for a while .
Then serve it cold .
If you like , you can garnish it with some nuts like pistachios or walnuts .
Topping it with clotted cream with or Turkish style ice cream would be even better .

Rachel Maddow with the latest development on the kill - the - gays bill in Uganda .
Pastor Rick Warren finally comes out and denounces the bill .
As Rachel notes , better late than never and a positive turn given Warren 's influence in Uganda .
Apparently Warren is n't too happy about Maddow 's reporting and claimed that he had been " mischaracterized by the media " .
Rachel assumed that meant her since she 's the only person in the media that has been covering this story .
She invited Warren to come on her show .
That I would like to see .
As Rachel reports James Inhofe is now trying to distance himself from the bill as well , and Chuck Grassley would n't take the time to respond , but his staff told The Rachel Maddow Show that he 's never been a member of The Family .
Jeff Sharlet said he stands by his reporting and his sources told him that Grassley travelled to Uganda on behalf of The Family back in the 80's .
Well , now Rick Warren has been implicated in much worse antigay politics as Uganda — a nation in which he has been intensely involved — is now considering legislation that would imprison and even potentially execute people for the grave crime of being gay .
MADDOW : I think that counts as an endorsement .
Rick Warren had not only been involved in Proposition 8 , he had been involved on tape .
WARREN : Let me just say this really clearly , we support Proposition 8 , and if you believe what the Bible says about marriage , you need to support Proposition 8 .
So , I urge you to support Proposition 8 and pass that word on .
WARREN : During the whole Proposition 8 thing , I never once went to a meeting , never once issued a statement , never once even gave an endorsement in the two years Prop 8 was going .
On the issue of Prop 8 specifically , Mr. Warren made the mistake of trying to deny that he ‘d ever taken a position on it .
RICK WARREN , PASTOR : I ‘m opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage .
I ‘m opposed to older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage .
I ‘m opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage .
Rick Warren is perhaps the most famous pastor in America today .
He was the source of great political controversy earlier this year when President Obama invited him to lead prayer at the inauguration , despite Mr. Warren ‘s history of antigay activism , specifically his support for Proposition 8 in California , which revoked existing marriage rights for same sex couples .
MADDOW : An update for you now on a story that we‘ve been covering for many more days in a row than I thought we would be covering it .
The story involves Rick Warren .
Uganda is the second nation in Africa that Rick Warren designated as a “ purpose - driven ” nation .
Mr. Warren launched his national “ Purpose - Driven Living ” program in Uganda last March .
Last night on this program , we spoke to an Anglican priest who has traveled to Uganda to report on the development of the “ kill the gays ” legislation there .
Among the things he brought up with us was just how influential Rick Warren is in that country .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
KAPYA KAOMA , ANGLICAN PRIEST : Rick Warren went to Uganda , you know , in 2008 .
And he made this saying that homosexuality is not a normal way of life and we have — we are n‘t going to tolerate any of this .
And then he goes to say , therefore , it ‘s not a human rights issue .
So you have another big person in terms of how Africans look at Pastor Warren .
You know , you have to go there , every church I entered , office I entered , I found his book the “ Purpose - Driven Life ” and people stare at it , it ‘s more like a second Bible .
So , he has a lot of influence , so when he makes that statement , it carries a lot of weight to the Uganda populace .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Rick Warren has used his influence in Uganda not only to promote his own programs , the purpose - driven nation stuff , but also to get involved in Ugandan religion and politics , flying to Uganda last year to announce he was on the side of the Ugandan ministers who were boycotting the Church of England for being too pro-gay .
Rick Warren also invited a virulently anti-gay pastor from Uganda to come to his own Saddleback Church in California , while that pastor was being promoted by Mr. Warren in the United States , back home in Uganda , that pastor was publicly burning condoms in Jesus ‘ name .
Rick Warren ‘s involvement in Ugandan affairs or — and his involvement in Ugandan affairs was so extensive that he even lobbied U.S. politicians to steer Uganda toward abstinence - only education rather than condom - based programs which had helped reduce the country ‘s rate of HIV infections .
Rick Warren ‘s intensive involvement in the politics of Uganda included multiple trips to that country and meetings with Uganda ‘s first lady .
Because of all of that , because of his influence in that country and his intensive involvement there , when that country including the pastor Mr. Warren had invited to his church started pushing this outrageous legislation to kill people for being gay , it ‘s natural that Rick Warren would be asked his opinion about it .
And about a week and a half ago , Mr. Warren gave his opinion on the subject to “ Newsweek . ”
He said , quote , “ It is not my personal calling as a pastor in America to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations . ”
Well , now , finally , after a little bit of attention to this subject in this country , Rick Warren has finally decided to come out against the legislation — as if he had been against it all along .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
WARREN : The potential law before your parliament is unjust , it ‘s extreme , and it ‘s unchristian toward homosexuals — requiring death penalty even in some cases .
And if I ‘m reading the proposed bill correctly , this law would also imprison anyone convicted of homosexual practice .
I urge you to speak up .
The pastors of Uganda , speak out against this proposed law .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : For opponents of this proposed law , Rick Warren ‘s intervention here , his written statement and his video statement , will be filed under the better - late - than - never category — definitely under better .
This will be very good news for people who are opposed to this law given his influence in that nation .
That said , Mr. Warren ‘s statement today included the allegation that his role in all this had been somehow mischaracterized by the media , saying that lies have been told about him and this issue in media that have covered it .
As the person who ‘s been doing the most media on this subject , at least on TV , as far as I can tell we have not said anything inaccurate about Rick Warren in our reporting .
We triple - checked everything that we‘ve said about him today , I do n‘t think we‘ve gotten one thing wrong about him .
If he feels differently , Pastor Warren , I would be happy to host you on this program to clarify anything .
Unless you know something that we do n‘t , I stand by our reporting .
Another American who has been silent on this issue for weeks is also now speaking out to us .
This happened late in the day today , Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma .
Mr. Inhofe has made repeated trips to Uganda in recent years , what he has called , quote , “ a Jesus thing . ”
And after days of silence on this issue , Senator Inhofe has finally told us this tonight , quote , “ I was shocked and appalled to learn through media reports of the legislation being considered in Uganda regarding homosexuality .
I do not , nor have I ever , supported or condoned the abhorrent legislation being considered in the Ugandan parliament , to suggest otherwise is absolutely and unequivocally false .
It is my hope that Uganda will abandon the unjust approach being considered . ”
It is unclear whether or not Mr. Inhofe plans to communicate this view to Ugandan authorities .
We have asked .
We will keep you posted as to whether we receive a response .
One final note on this : Republican Senator Chuck Grassley has also come under fire on this subject because of his alleged ties to the secretive religious organization known as the Family , most famous for operating the C Street house in Washington .
The Family has been intensely involved in Ugandan religion and politics for years , and reportedly involved in the origins of the “ kill the gays ” bill specifically .
It was reportedly announced for the first time at a Family sponsored event , the Ugandan prayer breakfast .
Mr. Grassley still has n‘t spoken out against the bill , but he did through a spokesperson today say that he has never had anything to do with the Family ever .
Senator Grassley is described multiple times as a member of the Family in Jeff Sharlet ‘s book - length expose of the group .
We contacted Jeff today to get his response to Mr. Grassley denying he ‘s ever had anything to do with the Family , Jeff told us that he stands by his reporting in his book .
He said that as recently as yesterday , he learned from Family sources that Chuck Grassley traveled to Uganda in the mid-1980s at the request of the Family .
Whether or not Chuck Grassley is a member of the Family or not , we are still very curious as to what the senator thinks about the prospect of putting people to death for being gay .
We are still waiting to hear from him on that subject and we live in hope .
Government ministers were today accused of lying in an attempt to cover up Britain 's role in the so - called extraordinary rendition of two men captured in Iraq and sent to Afghanistan for interrogation .
Both men have been detained without trial or charge at a US interrogation centre north of Kabul after British special forces troops who detained them near Baghdad early in 2004 handed them over to US forces .
The legal charity Reprieve today said John Hutton , as defence secretary , had misled parliament when he said the men were members of a banned Sunni Muslim militant organisation , Lashkar - e - Taiba .
After identifying one of the men , Amantullah Ali , and contacting his family in Pakistan , Reprieve discovered that he is not Sunni but Shia .
The charity said Hutton was wrong to suggest the two men needed to be moved to Afghanistan because the US had insufficient linguists to interrogate them in Iraq , as at least one of them spoke Arabic , and to claim that they were being held in humane conditions that met international standards .
Reprieve 's attempts to represent the two men in legal proceedings were hampered by the Ministry of Defence 's refusal to identify them , citing their " data protection rights " .
According to Reprieve , Ali is a rice merchant from Pakistan who was on pilgrimage in Iraq when he was shot in the foot and captured .
The identity of the second man has not been confirmed but he is thought to be called Salahuddin .
Reports from Afghanistan suggested he had suffered " catastrophic " mental health problems during his five - and - a - half years in detention , Reprieve said .
Clive Stafford Smith , the director of Reprieve , said Ali had five children , one of whom was five months old when he was detained .
" I hope people in government who have children will consider those five - and - a - half years of a child 's life and consider how horrible it must be to miss them . "
Reprieve pointed out that Tony Blair and Jack Straw had denied any British involvement in the US rendition programe , with Straw telling the Commons ' foreign affairs committee in December 2005 : " Unless we all start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying , that I am lying , that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States , and also let me say , we believe that Secretary [ Condoleezza ]
Rice is lying , there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition , full stop . "
The MoD has since confirmed that British officials became aware of the " intention to transfer " Ali and the second man from Iraq to Afghanistan in March 2004 , and by June that year were aware that they had been transferred .
Clive Stafford Smith , the director of Reprieve , said : " Government ministers misled Parliament and the country by denying that we had anything to do with rendition and then , when John Hutton apologised for this , he misled Parliament again .
The government now appears unwilling to admit that they are still propagating falsehoods . "
Today the MoD continued to insist that both men were members of Lashkar - e - Taiba , despite evidence that one of them is a Shia Muslim .
A spokesman said : " Their initial detention was appropriate , legitimate and targeted at saving lives . "

Ben Tornquist reports
If you 're anything like me , you probably find the global dominance of the Subway sandwich chain bewildering .
There are now 32,046 Subway branches in 90 countries , making it the biggest fast - food purveyor the world has ever seen .
But for why ?
The outlets are nothing but tiled slots with an interior design suggestive of a post - apocalyptic New York : the subway map , brownstones and Brooklyn Bridge , seared like the silhouettes of atom bomb victims into the shit - brown decor .
Many pundits attribute the success of the chain to one simple perception - Subway is the healthy option .
In marked contrast to the super - sized food fascism of the beef - farting , chicken - black - hole - of - Calcutta merchants , some joker in Florida actually lost weight on a Subway - only diet .
Needless to say , he 's been a poster - boy for the chain ever since , a sort of Horst Wessel of hearty Italian bread .
I 'm not arguing with the idea that you can eat healthily at Subway , but then you modulate your nutritional requirements just as effectively at any corner sandwich shop .
Chain gang
No , the secret of Subway 's success rests , in my view , on two things alone : first , there 's the very fact that it is a chain , offering a modular eating experience that can be simply replicated from Bloemfontein to Bangor .
Nothing succeeds like ubiquity , and the more Subways there are , the more the sandwiches they serve approach the Platonic ideal .
Then there 's the store - baked bread .
I 'm not sure what the actual mechanics of this are , but most probably the bread arrives in the form of pre-kneaded and portioned dough , and is simply popped in the ovens .
No matter : the by - product is that warm , yeasty stench that wafts from the door of every Subway , selling the scurrying punter the idea that here be Mama .
Once you 're inside , the sight of the demonstration sub - breads stuck on a board - wheat , Italian herb , honey oat , hearty Italian and Italian - is queerly reminiscent of coprolites in a dun cave ; the sandwich - makers , meanwhile , their hands gloved in translucent plastic , might be archaeologists of the present , deducing from their steely bins full of bacon shards the constitutive elements of Homo Britannicus 's diet circa 2009 .
My 12 - year - old adores Subway , but as he possesses all the gastronomic finesse of a half - starved bull calf , that says nowt about owt .
Still , I dragged him out to one for lunch and we both had the " meal option " : a six - inch sub of our choice , together with a cookie and a fizzy drink , all for £ 3.49 .
Special cocktail
I say " a " fizzy drink , but Subway , with its economies of scale , can offer unlimited fizz as part of the deal .
My boy happily mixed his special cocktail , one part Sprite to one part Coke , then topped up the 16oz bucket with Fanta .
" How is it ? " I asked .
" Too Spritey , " he grimaced .
He had the same sandwich he always does : bacon , lettuce and cheese on honey roast , then sat there giving me the sort of " healthy option " guff that would doubtless enrapture Subway shareholders .
I made my way through my own chicken pizzaiola sub with rather less enthusiasm .
There was nothing offensive about its tender chicken - breast strips , pepperoni , cheese , tomatoes and tasty marinara sauce , but that was because it was so . . . well , nothingy .
It was n't the flavours , it was the pappy consistency of the bap and its contents , which looked like it could have been premasticated .
There was a queue of little chicks waiting to be fed this easy - to - swallow fare , and I asked a young British Asian man what he saw in Subway .
" It 's like a pick ' n ' mix thing , " he said .
" Mind you , I only come in this one on a Friday when it 's the tuna option . "
Next I turned to the Dutch couple sitting next to us : did they have Subways under the Netherlands ?
" One or two in Rotterdam , " the male Cheesehead said .
" But , honestly , we do n't go in for this kind of thing . "
“ No , " his Edam concurred .
" Everyone gets free coffee at work , and people just take a bit of cheese and bread in with them for a snack at lunchtime , so we do n't need places like this . "
Do n't need !
Poor , benighted fools - no wonder they reached the zenith of their world influence in the 17th century .
Without a keen understanding of how to parlay cheese and bread into unlimited economic growth , these burghers have no place in the modern world .

The outfit came to this decision after it lost several court cases against alleged copyright infringers .
In Denmark , the local anti-piracy outfit Antipiratgruppen has given up on trying to get illegal file - sharers convicted and has announced that it will no longer take them to court .
This decision is the result of Antipiratgruppen ’s inability to gather solid evidence , which has resulted in several lost court cases in the last year .
“ It requires very strong and concrete evidence to have these people convicted .
We simply could not lift the burden of proof , ” said Antipiratgruppen lawyer Mary Fredenslund when explaining the decision to Politiken .
In just a year , four cases against alleged pirates have come before the High Court in Denmark and the overall result for the copyright holders has been negative .
Three of the defendants were acquitted due to insufficient evidence , and in the one case where a file - sharer was convicted , the defendant had confessed .
Defense attorney Per Overbeck says that in addition to these outcomes , cases against two of his clients have been dropped in recent years .
“ Antipiratgruppen has acknowledged that they can not get people convicted without either catching them in the act or threatening them to confess , ” Overbeck said .
“ In practice , this means that without a confession there is no case , ” he added .
Per Overbeck and Antipiratgruppen ’s assessment that recent High Court rulings make it virtually impossible to get individuals convicted for illegal file sharing are supported by a recent Government report from the Ministry of Culture .
According to the report , IP - addresses can only be used to identify the person paying for the Internet subscription , not the person who actually downloaded the files .
The courts have ruled several times that in terms of evidence , an IP - address alone is insufficient to prove guilt .
In one case a defendant walked free after arguing that that someone else must have accessed his wireless router to download copyright infringing material .
Despite these legal setbacks for copyright holders in Denmark , it is worth noting that Danish anti-piracy tracking company DtecNet remains the main partner of the RIAA and other music groups in countries where governments are looking to implement three - strikes policies to get alleged file - sharers disconnected from the Internet .
The evidence DtecNet gathers also consists of just an IP - address .
Indeed , there is no known anti-piracy method to discover who is sitting at a particular keyboard , on any particular computer , at any given time .
In the on - going trial of AFACT v iiNet , DtecNet gathered the evidence used in the case .
Under cross-examination a computer forensics investigator – who was previously a key witness in the 2004 KaZaA trial – admitted that any ISP account could have multiple users in the same household , and could have other unauthorized 3rd - party users if a wireless router was compromised .
WASHINGTON -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to a settlement worth more than $ 700 million over federal regulators ' charges that it made unlawful payments to friends of public officials to win municipal bond business in Jefferson County , Ala .
The scandal over the county 's $ 3.9 billion debt has pushed it to the brink of filing what would be the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history .
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday announced the settlement with JPMorgan , which canceled interest - rate swap contracts with the county worth $ 700 million in March .
The Wall Street bank did not admit or deny the SEC allegations in agreeing to pay a $ 25 million civil fine , a $ 50 million payment to the county and to forfeit $ 647 million in termination fees it claims the county owes from the canceled swap agreements .
The SEC also accused two former managing directors of JPMorgan , Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin , of securities law violations .
The agency is seeking unspecified restitution from them .
MacFaddin will contest the charges .
The SEC alleged that JPMorgan , LeCroy and MacFaddin made about $ 8 million in undisclosed payments to close friends of several Jefferson County commissioners .
Starting in July 2002 , LeCroy and MacFaddin solicited the county for a $ 1.4 billion sewer bond deal .
Swayed by the payments , the county commissioners voted to select JPMorgan 's securities division as managing underwriter of the bond offerings and its affiliated bank as swap provider for the transactions , the SEC said .
JPMorgan failed to disclose any of the unlawful payments or conflicts of interest in the bond offering documents , but passed on the cost of the payments by charging the county higher interest rates on the swap transactions , according to the SEC .
" The transactions were complex but the scheme was simple , " SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said in a statement .
" Senior JPMorgan bankers made unlawful payments to win business and earn fees . "
MacFaddin's attorney , Richard Lawler , said his client " has at all times acted properly " in his dealings with Jefferson County .
" He denies he has violated any securities laws and we 're confident he 'll be vindicated after trial , " Lawler said .
LeCroy 's lawyer did n't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Wednesday afternoon .
New York - based JPMorgan said in a statement it has since discontinued its municipal swap - exchange business .
The settlement with the SEC " does not impair any outstanding Jefferson County bonds and JPMorgan continues to work to achieve a responsible restructuring of Jefferson County 's financial affairs , " the statement said .
The SEC previously charged Birmingham , Ala. , mayor Larry Langford and two others for undisclosed payments to Langford related to municipal bond offerings and swap agreement transactions made while he was president of the Jefferson County Commission .
On Oct. 28 , Langford was found guilty in the related criminal case on 60 counts of bribery , mail fraud , wire fraud and tax evasion .
The SEC in July proposed tightening rules governing disclosures about municipal securities to aid investors in a multitrillion - dollar market used to finance schools , roads and hospitals around the country .
Brokers and dealers in municipal bonds and other securities would be required to make fuller and more timely disclosures to investors .
State and local governments raise funds for public facilities by issuing bonds , in a market estimated to be worth about $ 2.7 trillion .
Retail investors increasingly participate in the market , seeking safe investments with reliable returns .
The financial crisis and tight credit have made it more difficult for some municipal securities deemed higher risk to be sold .

Welcome to a world where a woman can model bikinis in swimsuit magazines , unveil a perfume line in a testosterone - charged arena and blaze a trail by leading the world 's biggest race .
Danica , meet Dale .
Welcome to a world where a driver races on national television every week , fans are renowned for fervent brand loyalty and Fortune 500 sponsors remain plentiful despite the economic downturn .
The NASCAR marriage of Dale Earnhardt Jr. , the most popular driver , and Danica Patrick , IndyCar 's transcendent queen , is as much about perfect timing as gargantuan personalities .
NASCAR , plagued by lagging TV ratings and crowds , gets a popularity jolt , and Patrick gains millions of eyeballs to dazzle with her emerging brand as " a beautiful revolution . "
GALLERY : Danica 's career in photos Q&A : Full transcript of Danica interview ANOTHER DANICA ? : Kelley Earnhardt looks back
It could be an ideal union — where one completes the other .
" She could be awesome for our sport , " says Earnhardt , whose team would have virtually no sponsorship absent Patrick .
" I 've always been lucky enough to thrive under pressure , " Patrick told USA TODAY after last week 's announcement . " ... I hope to kick butt right away . "
Patrick , who last year became the first woman to win an oval race in a national series and has the highest finish and only laps led by a woman in the Indianapolis 500 , is attempting a crossover to bulky , full - fendered stock cars from nimble , open - wheel vehicles .
It 's a shift that 's been daunting for more accomplished drivers , the last being two - time IndyCar champ Dario Franchitti .
But in making a part - time move to the second - tier Nationwide Series for likely a dozen races ( while continuing full time in IndyCar with Andretti Autosport ) , Patrick joins a circuit whose ratings , though smaller than the premier Sprint Cup Series , dwarf IndyCar .
Nationwide races are on ESPN , while IndyCar moved most of its races to Versus last year .
She also will be driving for JR Motorsports ( co-owned by Earnhardt and his sister Kelley ) , which receives engines and technology from Hendrick Motorsports , which has won four consecutive Sprint Cup titles with Jimmie Johnson .
The challenge starts this weekend for Patrick , who will test a Chevy at Daytona International Speedway for a debut in minor - league ARCA ( Automobile Racing Club of America ) on Feb .
6 . That debut comes the day before she appears in two Super Bowl ads , the hallowed ground that once belonged to Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon in NASCAR .
It 's coming at the right time for Patrick , 27 , who is mapping out a career after racing .
This year she turned her business and racing affairs over to IMG , a global sports - marketing behemoth that works with athletes such as Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning to build a portfolio of lucrative endorsements and ancillary product lines .
IMG already has hooked Patrick a deal with Mattel .
Though sponsor GoDaddy.com likely will market Patrick with edgy commercials counter to the more staid corporate image projected by Cup drivers , NASCAR could mark " a great platform for Danica , " IMG President George Pyne says .
The upside is high both ways .
" They can position her as girl next door , a woman in a man 's world , a competitor with a temper , " says William Sutton , a professor of sports management at the University of Central Florida .
" She 'll be a huge personality . "
A hero for female fans As Kelley Earnhardt hammered out Patrick 's contract , her daughter , Kayson , caught wind and got excited .
Not because Patrick was a driver , but because Patrick was in a " Got Milk ! " ad from a Miley Cyrus magazine owned by Kayson , 9 .
" For my daughter 's age , it 's inherent nature women are n't supposed to be as competitive , " Earnhardt says .
" I see a role model in Danica .
Young females could gravitate to that . "
According to NASCAR fan demographics , 40 % are women , and Patrick offers plenty beyond the wheel .
" Danica For Her " perfume will be launched next spring , and Patrick 's likeness has been used with a Barbie doll .
" I embrace that role , " says Patrick , whose long - term goals include a clothing line .
" There 's nothing more rewarding than seeing kids excited to meet you because they 're just so pure . "
Patrick concedes her on - track persona can be less than ladylike .
She has stomped away after running out of gas and has n't backed down from tiffs , slapping one driver ( Jaques Lazier ) and smacking another 's helmet ( Rafael Matos ) .
" I have a lot of passion that could be perceived as temper , " she says .
Such emotion is welcomed in NASCAR , which has been encouraging drivers to express themselves after complaints the sport has been whitewashed by sponsor - driven political correctness .
Sutton says Patrick could " fill that void ... because she gets upset she does n't win , and sports fans relate to that . "
Lesa France Kennedy , a member of NASCAR 's board of directors , says Patrick has a competitive fire " that 'll broaden our fan base .
She 's dynamic , interesting and very , very bright .
She 'd be a head turner . "
Earnhardt , who drives for Hendrick , suggests Patrick 's entry into NASCAR 's conservative environs might mean sponsors " change up their marketing .
Some of that stuff is a little crazy . "
In commercials for Boost Mobile and GoDaddy , Patrick has been surrounded by scantily clad men and women ( some ads were relegated to the Internet ) .
She says the new Super Bowl ads play off her " as the strait - laced one put out by these crazy girls .
...
I 'm not very funny , but I like to pretend I am .
It 's part of my brand . "
Patrick has several personal endorsements ( including watchmaker Tissot , Peak antifreeze and Kaenon sunglasses ) , and experts say NASCAR could build her marketing portfolio .
" GoDaddy has an edge , and she 's very feminine , " Sutton says .
" That balance is interesting . "
Pyne , NASCAR 's former chief operating officer , says IMG views Patrick 's move as " an endorsement of NASCAR ... because it offers enormous opportunities " through its larger audience .
In the Davie Brown Index , which measures a celebrity 's ability to influence consumer behavior , Patrick is ranked third among drivers .
She trails Gordon and Earnhardt because of a lower awareness score .
" Her awareness will go up considerably in the initial year , " says Mike Mooney , vice president of Millsport Motorsports , an agency that helps produce the DBI .
" After that , performance is the litmus test in NASCAR . "
What 's on the track matters
And therein lie the risks : if Patrick fails , her and Earnhardt 's brands could be damaged .
Says David Carter , executive director of the University of Southern California 's Sports Business Institute : " If they hang her out in the window , she has to do her part , or it 's detrimental to both . "
While considering NASCAR last summer , Patrick had dinner at the Charlotte - area home of IMG's Mark Dyer with ESPN analysts Ray Evernham ( three championships as Gordon 's crew chief ) and Rusty Wallace ( 1989 champion ) , whom Patrick peppered with questions .
Dyer toured several NASCAR shops with Patrick .
Her decision to hop between two different cars ( stock cars are twice as heavy but have skinnier tires and less braking ) has drawn skepticism , perhaps most notably from Juan Pablo Montoya , a former Indy 500 winner who needed three seasons to become a NASCAR contender .
" There 's no doubt about her abilities , " SpeedTV.com analyst Robin Miller says .
" This is something you can't do part time . "
Says Fox analyst Darrell Waltrip : " Stock cars are like wrestling bears .
They 're not precise and quick - responding like IndyCar . "
Patrick joins a team whose Chevys had four Nationwide wins in '09 and finished third in the standings .
She could be tutored by Hendrick drivers Gordon , Johnson and Mark Martin , whose Go Daddy - sponsored car is a likely destination if she moves to Cup when her IndyCar deal is up after 2011 .
( Patrick says , " It 'd be nice to have as an option . " )
For now , her part - time gig will provide a significant test for two of racing 's biggest names .
" ( Kelley's ) got a very competitive team , so that 's why I wanted to do it , " Patrick says .
" It 's really about giving me the opportunity to perform .
The very famous last name is the icing . "

Selfishness Abounds Copenhagen Reveals a Vicious Circle of Mistrust
Who is to blame for the summit disaster ?
The US ?
China ?
The EU ?
The G - 8 ?
In fact , all of the above .
It was a coming together of states that killed off a vital resource for the world : trust .
Von Christian Schwägerl
RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP )  City Councilman Cecil Bothwell of Ashville believes in ending the death penalty , conserving water and reforming government , but he does not believe in God .
His political opponents say that is a sin that makes him unworthy of office , and they have the North Carolina Constitution on their side .
Detractors of Mr. Bothwell , who was elected in November , are threatening to take the city to court for swearing him in last week , even though the state ’s antiquated requirement that officeholders believe in God is unenforceable because it violates the United States Constitution .
“ The question of whether or not God exists is not particularly interesting to me , ” said Mr. Bothwell , 59 , “ and it ’s certainly not relevant to public office . ”
Raised a Presbyterian , Mr. Bothwell began questioning Christian beliefs at a young age , he said , and considered himself an atheist by the time he was 20 .
However , He is an active member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Asheville and celebrates Christmas .
Mark Brown talks to Geoff Smith , whose reinvention of the piano allows players to alter the tuning of notes either before or during a performance guardian .
co.uk
For a non-pianist , the idea of a microtonally fluid piano might seem either no big deal or baffling .
But this weekend a composer will reveal the result of a 10 - year mission – nothing less than the reinvention of one of the most important instruments in western music .
Geoff Smith believes he has come up with the first multicultural acoustic piano – what he has trademarked as a fluid piano – which allows players to alter the tuning of notes either before or during a performance .
Instead of a pianist having a fixed sound , 88 notes from 88 keys , Smith 's piano has sliders allowing them access to the different scales that you get in , for example , Indian and Iranian music .
For good measure , Smith has included a horizontal harp .
The Guardian was last weekend given the first access to an instrument that is already generating considerable excitement – and it can be seen and heard on our website .
It will be formally unveiled at the University of Surrey on Saturday and receive a London premiere at the Purcell Room in March .
Smith , a Brighton - based composer and performer , said : " The fluid piano is a western piano as we know it , similar to an early fortepiano , but because of the tuning mechanisms , suddenly , musicians can explore scales from the Middle East , from Iran . "
Smith 's instrument has been made by the Somerset - based Christopher Barlow and a light ash has been deliberately chosen as the wood – Smith said he did not want it to look like a dark coffin .
The fluid piano has generated much interest since it was first mentioned in the Guardian six years ago – when it was Smith with little more than a one - key mechanism and an ambition .
Now he has the actual instrument he has been getting performers on board .
" I 've said to musicians they might feel insecure about this piano , they might feel scared .
But if they embrace it they will have this big feeling of liberation , a big high . "
At the premiere , three pianists will perform , including Pam Chowhan , the head of planning at the Royal Festival Hall .
She admitted to being daunted when first confronted with the piano .
" It was really scary , it is even now .
I 'm mainly a classical pianist and you kind of know what you 're doing , you know how the piano is going to respond and you spend ages and ages on tone control and knowinghow it is going to sound .
Suddenly I 've got a piano which sounds like nothing I 've heard before .
It opens up so many choices that you become almost paralysed . "
There have been all sorts of challenges , including having to come up with her own way of writing music for the instrument .
Chowhan said the internet had helped open access to all sorts of music from around the world .
" If you 're going to start delving into different cultures and bring those influences into your work you need to think about tuning and the traditional piano simply can't cut it .
The piano , for me , is absolutely useless in a non-western context because it can't respond to the subtle and fluid tuning of other cultures . "
Also performing on Saturday will be London - based jazz pianist Nikki Yeoh and the Leeds - based improvisational pianist Matthew Bourne .
He said playing the fluid piano was " like walking into a huge sweet shop .
The possibilities are endless .
Sometimes I do nothing , I just sit and stare at it " .
Smith said he had received much support – from Arts Council England for example – but had also encountered resistance .
" Instruments of the western orchestra are locked in time , ringfenced .
Why is that ?
It 's not for technical reasons , so it must be for political or cultural reasons .
There 's a lot of talk in classical music about making orchestras more diverse .
The only way you 're going to bring new people in is by changing the instruments .
To some people that is a completely alien concept .
" We are one of the most multicultural societies in Europe .
Some people need to put their money where their mouth is . "
Smith , who has written scores for silent films and is a highly regarded player of the hammered dulcimer , has been invited to take his piano to a Chopin festival in Poland .
But the dream is to get his fluid piano manufactured .
" It has become a fundamental part of my life , because it 's driven by a vision .
It 's not just about money , although I have n't got much money so of course I 'd like to make some .
Any money I have had has gone on this , " he said .
" The thing was , I always knew it would work – I was n't like some crazy inventor . "

26 August 2019 : Fifteen Years of GParted
The GParted team is proud to announce the fifteenth anniversary of GParted .
The
Over 245 people have contributed to GParted
Available in over 60 different language translations
Included in many GNU / Linux distributions
Used in over 240 countries around the world
Downloaded over 27 million times from SourceForge alone
To mark the occasion , questions were posed , and following are responses shared by some key contributors .
What do you like about GParted / Free Software ?
Emmanuel Soundias -
I like the fact that I.T. professionals as well as everyday non-professional computer users are able to use GParted .
It is a professional software tool with a friendly interface , so that most computer users can use it .
Of course , operations performed by GParted are rather special , out of the everday practice for many IT professionals as well as for most non-professional users .
I especially like that GParted seems to be a rather " strong " software , included in many popular Linux distributions , although without fancy features .
This is evident by the very small number of problems reported in the support forum , most of them related to hardware issues .
15 years is a long time in the IT world .
I love the fact that GParted is slowly but constantly changing following the IT reality , adapted to new hardware devices and software structures and including new useful features .
This is achieved thanks to the contribution of the big Free Software community all over the world and especially to the numerous developers and testers that contribute by their knowledge , experience and time .
Furthermore , GParted developers investigate and propose fixes and improvements to other free / open source related projects as well .
As a member of the GParted support team during 12 years ( since 2007 ) , I can feel the happiness of many users that had their problem solved , often saving their valuable data .
I 'm happy to be part of this small but very effective team that runs successfully this useful project .
Finally , I 'd like to thank LarryT , former project administrator , who introduced me to the GParted project and to the Free Software world .
Mike Fleetwood -
As a home user I like that Free Software is available at no cost , either up front or ongoing and these days no data mining .
As a power user I like that there are lots of people that provide help in various ways , forums , how to guides etc .
As a developer I like that ultimately I can go and look at the code and find out how something actually works and even go and fix it myself if necessary .
Curtis Gedak -
The thing I like best about GParted is that it handles all the behind the scenes math and commands to resize and move partitions and file systems .
This removes the extra effort I would expend to figure out the required terminal commands and options .
I also appreciate being able to quickly access the latest GParted features by booting computers with GParted Live , which Steven Shiau graciously maintains .
Overall I prefer Free Software because I can share it freely with friends , family , and co-workers .
Where is your development or support environment ?
( location / desktop / laptop / other details )
Mike Fleetwood -
My primary system is my desktop in my study at home , a machine put together from components .
It runs CentOS 7 .
Use VirtualBox virtualisation and have over 20 virtual machines with mostly multiple versions of Ubuntu , Debian , Fedora and CentOS plus a few other distributions too .
Used for testing as needed .
Also have a VirtualBox CentOS 7 virtual machine on my $ job 's laptop .
This is so that while commuting to and from work , for the 30 minutes each way on the tram , I can be looking into GParted .
Curtis Gedak -
My development system is in my upstairs loft and is also the computer I use for everyday tasks .
It is a custom built desktop computer running Kubuntu 16.04 LTS with a 28 " LCD monitor , a quad - core processor , and six drives which enable me to readily test various features of GParted .
I also have several older computers in addition to over 50 Virtual Machines which I use to test different hardware , operating systems , and partition / file system configurations .
The older hardware is often donated to me by friends and family , for which I am grateful .
Why do you contribute to GParted ?
Mike Fleetwood - GParted has become my niche in the Free Software world .
It is my way of contributing back to the Free Software world .
Curtis Gedak - I believe GParted enables an easier path for people to try other operating systems , and hopefully discover the wonderful world of Free Software .
By contributing to GParted I believe that in my own way I help to make the world just a little bit better .

Virgin Racing has confirmed that Lucas di Grassi is to race alongside Timo Glock at the team next year .
After what the team itself called ' the worst kept secret in F1 ' , Virgin Racing unveiled its new logo and showed off its drivers in public at a launch in Notting Hill , London , on Tuesday .
Although Glock signed for the team several weeks ago , di Grassi only recently committed to the outfit - having tested for the Renault team in the recent run out for young drivers in Jerez .
Di Grassi arrives at the team after four seasons in GP2 , and having gained experience of F1 through his role as a Renault test driver .
" It feels great to be here , it 's a dream come true for me after two years of being a test driver , and from that and from GP2 I feel I 'm ready and am very confident in this team , " said di Grassi .
" We 're here to race , not to do politics or mess around , we 're here to race . "
The team 's sporting director John Booth said he was delighted with the line - up .
" I have 20 years ' experience working with drivers , " he said .
" I have been privileged to work with some fantastic drivers in that time and I hope that 's helped in giving me an eye for a good driver .
" The four drivers we have here are the four we wanted in our line - up , they 're the perfect drivers . "

“ This year I decided we ’re going to give presents only to the children , not the adults in the family , ” said Ms. Shtainer , a real estate broker in Manhattan with Prudential Douglas Elliman , “ because everyone is making less . ”
Like any businesswoman , Ms. Shtainer also wanted to give presents to clients , so she had to be strategic .
She gathered some unopened wine and liquor from her apartment for re-gifting .
“ My husband is a physician , ” Ms. Shtainer explained , “ he gets a lot of Cognac . ”
Then she stocked up on chocolate at Costco .
The candy and spirits went into gift bags , along with hand - written notes .
And instead of paying for postage or a delivery service , Ms. Shtainer climbed into her car and dropped off each bag herself .
“ I really thought about who to give and what to give , ” she said , noting that she also donated 10 percent of what she would have spent for grown - ups to St. Jude Children ’s Research Hospital .

When you survey the trail of wreckage left by the climate emails crisis , three things become clear .
The first is the tendency of those who claim to be the champions of climate science to minimise their importance .
Those who have most to lose if the science is wrong have perversely sought to justify the secretive and chummy ethos that some of the emails reveal .
If science is not transparent and accountable , it 's not science .
I believe that all supporting data , codes and programmes should be made available as soon as an article is published in a peer - reviewed journal .
That anyone should have to lodge a freedom of information request to obtain them is wrong .
That the request should be turned down is worse .
That a scientist suggests deleting material that might be covered by that request is unjustifiable .
Everyone who values the scientific process should demand complete transparency , across all branches of science .
The second observation is the tendency of those who do n't give a fig about science to maximise their importance .
The denial industry , which has no interest in establishing the truth about global warming , insists that these emails , which concern three or four scientists and just one or two lines of evidence , destroy the entire canon of climate science .
Even if you were to exclude every line of evidence that could possibly be disputed – the proxy records , the computer models , the complex science of clouds and ocean currents – the evidence for man-made global warming would still be unequivocal .
You can see it in the measured temperature record , which goes back to 1850 ; in the shrinkage of glaciers and the thinning of sea ice ; in the responses of wild animals and plants and the rapidly changing crop zones .
No other explanation for these shifts makes sense .
Solar cycles have been out of synch with the temperature record for 40 years .
The Milankovic cycle , which describes variations in the Earth 's orbit , does n't explain it either .
But the warming trend is closely correlated with the accumulation of heat - trapping gases in the atmosphere .
The impact of these gases can be demonstrated in the laboratory .
To assert that they do not have the same effect in the atmosphere , a novel and radical theory would be required .
No such theory exists .
The science is not fixed – no science ever is – but it is as firm as science can be .
The evidence for man-made global warming remains as strong as the evidence linking smoking to lung cancer or HIV to Aids .
The third observation is the contrast between the global scandal these emails have provoked and the muted response to 20 years of revelations about the propaganda planted by fossil fuel companies .
I have placed on the Guardian 's website four case studies ; each of which provides a shocking example of how the denial industry works .
Two of them are drawn from Climate Cover - Up , the fascinating , funny and beautifully written new book by James Hoggan and Richard Littlemore .
If every allegation it contained could not be traced back to leaked documents ( I have checked all the sources ) , their findings would be unbelievable .
Nothing exposed by the hacking of the Climatic Research Unit 's server is one tenth as bad as the least of these revelations .
When I use the term denial industry , I 'm referring to those who are paid to say that man-made global warming is n't happening .
The great majority of people who believe this have not been paid : they have been duped .
Reading Climate Cover - Up , you keep stumbling across familiar phrases and concepts which you can see every day on the comment threads .
The book shows that these memes were planted by PR companies and hired experts .
The first case study I 've posted reveals how a coalition of US coal companies sought to persuade people that the science is uncertain .
It listed the two social groups it was trying to reach – " Target 1 : Older , less educated males " ; " Target 2 : Younger , lower income women " – and the methods by which it would reach them .
One of its findings was that " members of the public feel more confident expressing opinions on others ' motivations and tactics than they do expressing opinions on scientific issues " .
Remember this the next time you hear people claiming that climate scientists are only in it for the money , or that environmentalists are trying to create a communist world government : these ideas were devised and broadcast by energy companies .
The people who inform me , apparently without irony , that " your article is an ad hominem attack , you four - eyed , big - nosed , commie sack of shit " , or " you scaremongers will destroy the entire world economy and take us back to the Stone Age " , are the unwitting recruits of campaigns they have never heard of .
The second case study reveals how Dr Patrick Michaels , one of a handful of climate change deniers with a qualification in climate science , has been lavishly paid by companies seeking to protect their profits from burning coal .
As far as I can discover , none of the media outlets who use him as a commentator – including the Guardian – has disclosed this interest at the time of his appearance .
Michaels is one of many people commenting on climate change who presents himself as an independent expert while being secretly paid for his services by fossil fuel companies .
The third example shows how a list published by the Heartland Institute ( which has been sponsored by oil company Exxon ) of 500 scientists " whose research contradicts man-made global warming scares " turns out to be nothing of the kind : as soon as these scientists found out what the institute was saying about them , many angrily demanded that their names be removed .
Twenty months later , they are still on the list .
The fourth example shows how , during the Bush presidency , White House officials worked with oil companies to remove regulators they did n't like and to doctor official documents about climate change .
In Climate Cover - Up , in Ross Gelbspan 's books The Heat is On and Boiling Point , in my book Heat , and on the websites DeSmogBlog.com and exxonsecrets.org , you can find dozens of such examples .
Together they expose a systematic , well - funded campaign to con the public .
To judge by the comments you can read on this paper 's website , it has worked .
But people behind these campaigns know that their claims are untrue .
One of the biggest was run by the Global Climate Coalition , which represented ExxonMobil , Shell , BP , the American Petroleum Institute and several big motor manufacturers .
In 1995 the coalition 's own scientists reported that " the scientific basis for the greenhouse effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 on climate is well - established and cannot be denied " .
The coalition hid this finding from the public , and spent millions of dollars seeking to persuade people that the opposite was true .
These people have n't fooled themselves , but they might have fooled you .
Who , among those of you who claim that climate scientists are liars and environmentalists are stooges , has thought it through for yourself ?

Forget the thermometer , the scientists cannot add correctly .
You see 2+2 is supposed to be 4 , the way their equation worked was 2+2+ - 1=4 and that do n't work .
They lied , they cheated , they profited from the deception , thats fraud , thats taking money in false pretenses , that for you or me is jail time .
But these are big mucks , so I doubt it .
They shut off dissent by getting the others fired , or losing their credentials at their universities , they should be done the same with .
But now how can we trust science ?
To do the best for us ?
To heal , to transport and to feed us ?
These guys did the unthinkable and set science back 50 years .
And nothing is going to happen to them , their friends are the investigators , and the judges .
So I pity humanity for all they are going to do to us .

While we 've been through this --- over and over again , in multiple previous threads --- it looks like it 's necessary to keep asking , since none of the denialists here seem to be able to answer the question .
Where is the global warming science ( or any science , since you 've decided that all science is now meaningless ) that has been shown to be inaccurate by this so - called " fraud " ?
The only thing that has been " set back 50 years " as far as I can tell , is the interest in fact - based journalism from a broad swath of our citizenry .
But I 'm looking forward to your demonstrating otherwise .
With such strong opinions , I 'm sure you 'll be able to share your evidence which demonstrates that global warming facts and science are no longer valid .

Why do denialists associate climate change with the " new world order " ?
Yet they 'll ignore that private central banks now own the worlds governments including the United States govt .
Seems the corporate media machine has brainwashed them by telling them that climate change science is their real enemy .... These Elmer Fudd denialists are clueless about who owns the fist that is pounding their asses .
The corporatocracy is screwing them like a drunken prom date ... but the denialists will swallow everything their corporate masters tell them to ... and regurgitate it all over the blogosphere with no verifiable sources , facts or meaningful argument ....
I 've seen Brad ask on several threads for climate change denialists to produce one shred of verifiable evidence of their position .
I have n't seen any of them produce any respectable science to bolster their claims ...
Please post a link ... an article or something that credibly debunks global climate change ... or shut the f*ck up ...

Wow , Brad .
One of the arguments used concerns Al Gore , saying he is trying to get rich !
But , but , but , is n't that the capitalist way ?
I agree with you , call for the evidence .
Three denier websites and not one iota of fact or data .
All speculation and fantasy .
Listening to Dennis Prager , the radio talk show host , I wonder if it might be helpful to distinguish between global warming and the cause , something Dennis conflated quite a bit .
Flying over Greenland for the last twenty years , it does not take much data to see the changes .
Global warming is indisputable .
One lecture I attended at CalTech , the speaker expressed remorse over the choice of words , implying that anyone would be able to feel the difference .
He stated that , more than verifiable temperature change , one will be able to see more storms and more violent storms , at least until the Arctic ice melts .
About cause .
The hockey stick depiction is indisputable .
Never in the historical record has warming been so fast .
This would tend to lead to an external forcing function , such as human activity .
While many cannot imagine how such an apparent " small " input can influence climate , the deniers cannot put a reputable number to how much CO2 humans place into the atmosphere .
They ignore the structure of the atmosphere which behaves in to manner of a buffered system in which small , fast changes can drive the environment into a new stability , one that may not be conducive to human life , as the historical record shows .
When I point this out , many take the fatalistic attitude that whatever happens , happens .
I then point out that , if they are walking through a tunnel and ahead of them , a light grows , would they not try to get out of the way or would they accept their " fate " ?
Yes , it may be the end of the tunnel , but why take a chance ?
BTW , the email thing .
Out of 900 + emails , I only found one that " denied " global warming , written by a group of petro- geological engineers .
Yeah , no bias on that one .

The bigger sidestory , which Brad and 99 touched upon , is how the " right " has infiltrated the so - called " liberal " mainstream media to even push these lies .
Decades ago , these people were generally known as fringe radicals and laughed at .
Now they get on CNN .
Not just FOX " news " , they get on CNN .
I keep saying : the " liberal media " is n't liberal .
The only one calling the " liberal media " liberal anymore is Rush Limbaugh and the gang , in case anyone can possibly think it 's still " liberal " .

So , they have their media : FOX " news " , Rush Limbaugh , Hannity , etc ... and now they 're on what they call the " liberal media " , too .

Every time I read comments like those left here by James and Derek Franklin , I cannot help but recall Rep. Earl F. Langrebbe ( R - IN ) , who was one of only two members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote against the Articles of Impeachment of Richard Nixon .
When asked how he could vote against impeachment in the face of the " smoking gun evidence " contained in the Oval office audiotapes , Langrebbe responded : " Do n't bother me with the facts .
My mind is made up . "
It is pointless to place science before the eyes of mindless wingnuts like James and Derek Franklin .
They live within a disinformation bubble that has been erected by the hard - right echo chamber --- a bubble that is impervious to facts , evidence and logic .
They do not see the necessity of supporting their " belief " that global climate change is a hoax with scientific evidence .
If former Rush Limbaugh producer Marc Morano says global climate change is a hoax , then it 's a hoax .
In their minds , belief = knowledge .

If most of you guys did your research better or at all you would find that :
1. the emails about " hiding the decline " is about the hockey stick !
2. the " trick " referred to in some of the emails is about the hockey stick Skepticism , the scientific kind , is a very useful and necessary scientific trait .

Mike Hulme says .... ( I 'll leave to you to research who Hulme is )
Climate scientists , knowingly or not , become proxies for political battles .
The consequence is that science , as a form of open and critical enquiry , deteriorates while the more appropriate forums for ideological battles are ignored .
The problem on this thread ( and other climate change threads here ) is that the denialists are n't producing any evidence of their position ... they 're just calling climate change bullshit and we should take their word for it .
Almost ANY climatologist / scientist I can find says CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING ... the real debate is the cause , not the fact that climate change is a fact .
I find it interesting that none of the deniers cite the rising ocean temps ... the true evidence of climate change .
What scientist worth their doctorate would simply use as evidence " biased themometers " ... but that 's the level of argument that 's being fed to the ignorant .
What level of scientist would cite a themometer set close to asphalt of air conditioning ?
But the deniers want to believe so badly that climate change is bullshit that they 'll lap up those insane explanations like cats lap up gravy ...

' Fact - tards ?'** running this teabag / right wing cabal whose rabid , viral , tangent - lies end up being the main focus of media discussion .
Here you write :

Exactly !
While I know the " liberal media " Orwellian meme is the one that sumps your pump - I tend to get my naughties twisted up in a nut about the amount of coverage we give them on the internet .
The corporate media ( for you Fox - tards upthread - all of it - not just Fox tho ' your Fox is by far the most frequent and shameless liar ) is bad enough , but then to see these propaganda - distractions bouncing into the rational people 's lane like a frozen turkey dropped on us from an overpass ... ... makes me twitch .

What a tragic waste of our valuable " man-hours " ( love that term , btw ) .
Puts us ( We , the Rationals ) on constant defense , never time to advance for our own yardage .
Just look at how much of Brad's / Desi's " REAL investigation " time is now spent in these threads trying to talk sense to people , as Ernest Canning aptly puts it : " in a bubble that is impervious to facts , evidence and logic . "
( Tho ' , to be clear , they are infinitely gifted with such debate , and very , very patient with the foibles of the emotionally stunted , patsy pop -offs who offer no evidence to back their bluster .
Brad is finding a better balance , here on BradBlog , IMHO . )
I really do think it 's a worthwhile debate to have at some point : how much oxygen do they deserve ?
Why do they constantly get to drive the debate ?
Is it just because they 're louder ?
Especially timely question in light of Brad 's latest post , where he writes : " We really do now , officially , live in two different Americas .
One actual America , with all its flaws , failures and frustrations , and another world completely existing only in the minds and self - produced group hallucinations of wingnut media - addled fantasists , fear - mongers and phonies . "

Derek Franklin @ 23
My apologies also ... I lost my poise .
Although I do agree with SHORTBUS @ 26 ..... it's kinda hard to see those sites you provided as credible or unbiased .
I do want to ask you about your comment @5 :
How is climate change a " new wrold order " ploy ?
There is a new world order mind you ... but it has nothing to do with climate change ...
If you 're looking for a new world order institution then look into central banking ( Federal Reserve ) and how they 've corrupted and replaced governments around the world , including the good ol ' U.S. of A .
Actually there 's nothing new about it ... but it is a world order .
Nevertheless ... my apologies for an insensitive remark to you earlier .

I stopped watching corporate owned news , I really lump FOX , CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS all in one , it 's just that FOX is absurd , they 're not even faking being real news .
I watch Free Speech TV and LINK - TV .
I " kicked the habit " of ANBCBSNNX almost 10 years ago .
Plus , I carefully choose real news sites on the series of tubes on the internets .

Bluehawk @30
Those sites are just a few , there are some 30,000 scientists who are skeptical of man made global warming .
I just do n't trust someone like Al Gore who stands to make billions off Cap @ Trade and does n't practice what he preaches .
Climate change itself is not a New World Order ploy but when you look into the partnership between Gore and David Blood and other former executives of Goldman Sachs and their roles in the Federal Reserve you will see the connection .
I look forward to your thoughts on this .

30,000 scientists are ' skeptical ' of man made global warming ?
Yet you 're convinced it 's a sham .
All because Al Gore is the messenger ?
Please explain to me how Al Gore will profit from cap and trade ?
( mind you I 'm on the fence about cap and trade ) .
I ask you wo n't cap and trade be a government policy and is Al Gore not in the government anymore ?
Al Gore and David Blood started a sustainablity investment firm ... Big Whoop .
Blood is a former Goldman Sachs exec who sees an opportunity to capitalize on green sustainability ventures .
Is n't that the American way ?... Is n't a green - sustainability industry going to need some capital investment ?
How you conflate the Federal Reserve into this I do n't know ... unless you 're trying to trip my trigger because I cited the Fed in earlier posts .
I cited the Fed as the real fly in your soup Mr. Anderson , the real global government conspiracy .
You seem to think climate change is screwing you around because Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh said it ... The Fed simply is n't a player in the climate change debate .

My point is there is not a consensus among all scientists regarding man made G.W. yet you are convinced it is n't a sham .
The NWO agenda is implemented from both sides of the political spectrum , the Fed was the first step .
Please do n't put words in my mouth w/ regards to Beck / Limbaugh , my concern is what will happen to the American economy w/ Cap & Trade , and what will happen to America 's sovereignty if Kyoto is signed .
I seems as though anyone who disagrees w/ anthropogenic global warming theory is automatically labeled as right wing , I believe in the principals of the Constitution which these days is not represented by republicans or democrats .

Well , Derek , first of all , there will be no affect on America 's " sovereignty " if any eventual climate treaty is signed ( neither in Copenhagen , as that has been put off , or the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 ) .
The U.S. Senate must ratify any treaty first , and the provisions currently under negotiation leave the methods , means and measurements to the individual countries .
The point is to put a price on pollution , which is currently free for industry and passed on to you to clean up with your tax dollars .
It 's worked before .
The Montreal Protocol ( ozone depletion ) and the Sulphur Emissions Reduction Protocol ( acid rain from coal - fired power plants ) were both negotiated by the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations and both treaties were successful in reducing harmful pollution .
The Sulphur Emissions Reduction Protocol utilized a cap & trade scheme .
The energy industry fought hard against it , saying it would devastate U.S. economic growth , but surprise !
They were wrong .
The real costs turned out to be much lower than the projected costs , and were followed by a period of historic economic expansion during the Clinton administration .
That 's not to say that the cap & trade system currently under consideration in the Senate is perfect .
But there is ample evidence from the last thirty years of American history that shows the concept of cap & trade and international treaties to address climate issues can work .
Finally , we draw a clean line of distinction here between the scientific evidence underlying human - caused climate change and the policy implications and proposals .
Most climate change " skeptics " , " deniers " and " contrarians " conflate the two because they are unhappy with what they perceive the policy implications to be .
The two are not the same .

Yes .
There IS a consensus .
Among " all scientists " ?
Perhaps not .
Obviously there are a few fringe skeptics , but the vast majority believe in anthropogenic global warming .
Whether it 's man made , or partially man made , or not man made at all , makes little difference ( to me , as a non-scientist ) , in that the warming is undebatable , and the ways in which that , and oil dependence are being dealt with seem only to be positives to me .
To call any of it a " sham " is , well , a sham .
my concern is what will happen to the American economy w/ Cap & Trade , and what will happen to America 's sovereignty if Kyoto is signed .
Good .
Glad you have such concerns .
If they 're legitimate , you 'll be able to look at history ( as Desi pointed out briefly above ) and see that your concerns are likely merit - free .
But stay vigilant , and even skeptical .
When you become cynical however , you then do no good for anybody , IMO .

Iâd had a long day Googling synonyms for penis , when I sat down for some much deserved rest .
I poured myself a beer , settled back into my armchair and grabbed my trusty Xbox 360 controller .
I hit the power button , mentally preparing myself to spend the next hour being called synonyms for penis by 14 - year - old boys .
A lot of people complain about that kind of treatment from Xbox Live , but hell â some guys fly all the way to Bangkok just to experience it legally â I try to think of it as an honor .
There was a loud beep Iâd never heard before , and the screen froze .
Right at my favorite mission , too .
â Thatâs odd , â  I said to my dogs ( because Iâm so , so lonely ) .
â I wonder whatever that could be.â 
The controller wasnât responding anymore , so I reluctantly got up from my chair to manually press the power button like some kind of third world savage .
I powered it back on , and thatâs when I saw it :
Three sections of the ring were lit up brilliant red , flashing with vindictive mockery .
The legends were true : The Red Ring of Death .

" The Eye : that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud , and earth , and flesh , and to see you : to pin you under its deadly gaze , naked , immovable . "
â FFFFUUUUUUUUU-â *** â-UUUUUUCK , â
I finished screaming ( though this was completely unrelated to the earlier scream ; it happens a lot these days ) .
â I should probably call about that Xbox thingy , â  I suddenly remembered , letting the mailman up from my Flying Rage Tackle , â but weâre agreed , right ?
No more bills .â â I donât make the bills , â his voice broke nervously .
â Thatâs right :
You donât .
Not anymore.â 
I strode manfully ( thatâs when you walk confidently , cock - first ) into my living room and dialed the number for Xbox Support .
I cleared my throat , arranged my papers in front of me , and prepared to introduce myself to the operator .
" There is a wall of liquidity … chasing assets , " Roubini told " Squawk Box . "
" Now we are in the mother of all carry trades , " he added .
Asset prices have been inflated by the cheap funds but the dollar cannot keep falling forever , and there could be " a market crash all over the world " when the currency 's course is reversed .
But this will not happen too soon as the real economy is still very weak and the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates close to 0 percent for longer , Roubini added .
" The reality is that the dollar is the funding currency of the carry trades .
Because of that the dollar weakness is going to continue for a while . "
He reiterated his view that the recovery is likely to be anaemic , forecasting growth of between 1 percent and 2 percent for the US in the next two years compared with the country 's potential for 3 percent annual growth .
Japan and Europe are likely to grow by less than 1 percent , he said .
" The ( stock ) markets are pricing in a V - shaped recovery , " Roubini said .
" If the data surprise on the downside then there is going to be a significant correction . "
The price of oil may also be among the assets that will fall .
" It seems to me that this rally in oil prices is way ahead of the economy , " Roubini said .
More Trouble for Banks
More losses may be ahead for banks , as the residential property sector fell 30 percent and the commercial property sector is 40 percent down in the crisis , he added .
deepak chopra picks a fight with darwin ’s ghost
Deepak Chopra is out to disprove evolution using biocentrism , a meaningless collection of woo buzzwords he and his like - minded friends concocted out of nothing .
Truly there ’s no woo quite as insipid , nonsensical and self - serving as that of Deepak Chopra .
After giving his critics a tongue lashing because they dared to point out his numerous errors and must therefore be cynical , arrogant jerks , the high priest of quantum pseudoscience unleashed yet another opus of inanity .
Despite an alarming lack of education in physics , Chopra and his fellow cranks are going to upstage Newton and Darwin by revealing the doctrine of biocentrism .
What ’s biocentrism you say ?
Why it ’s the power of wishful thinking on a cosmological scale .
Apparently the universe we know was created by our conscious efforts and to prove the concept , he ’s ready to trot out New Age fluff and creationist arguments seemingly stolen from Ray Comfort .
One wonders why peddlers of woo always want to take issue with long dead scientists whose work has been significantly updated by efforts of later researchers .
Darwin ’s natural selection was merged with genetics and produced a far more complete and elaborate theory .
Newton ’s work was greatly expanded by Einstein ’s ideas about time and space .
Why not go after modern theories ?
It is a little too hard for Chopra ?
Regardless , after a posturing match with the scientists ’ ghosts , he lets fly with his first gem of imbecility .
In short , the attempt to explain the nature of the universe , its origins , and what is really going on , including evolution , requires an understanding of how the observer — consciousness — plays a role .
Ah yes , the old routine of collapsing the wave function on quantum randomness trick .
In quantum mechanics , observing and measuring a particle reduces the number of its probable states to the observer .
Note however , that it does not change the system itself .
Whether you observe the system or not , it will still exist and do what it normally does .
So where does the conscious part come in ?
Chopra does n’t explain .
Instead he goes straight into irreducible complexity arguments so broad , they would make even Behe cringe .
Here ’s a little snippet with a bit of light editing for style .
Editing for sense would ’ve been a futile effort .
There are over 200 physical parameters within the solar system and universe so exact , it strains credulity to propose that they are random — even if that is exactly what contemporary physics boldly suggests .
These fundamental constants are not predicted by any theory — all seem to be carefully chosen , often with great precision , to allow for existence of life .
What are those 200 + precise parameters exactly ?
And why only a few hundred ?
If we ’re going to start tossing out random numbers of supposedly fine tuned parameters for life , why not go for a thousand or ten thousand ?
It ’s not like he actually gives us a list , so he can throw out any number he wants .
What about alien life ?
Is that in the parameters too or are we limiting ourselves to only one planet while talking about the setup of the entire universe ?
And if those mysterious fundamental concepts are n’t predicted by any theory , from which cavity did he extract them and how does he know he measured them correctly and they really are calibrated ?
Consider the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs — if its trajectory had been slightly different , or the asteroid had been slightly larger , we might not be here .
The odds are astronomically against everything happening exactly right .
So the question is , is it dumb luck ?
But if you say something is an accident , it usually means you do n’t understand the reason for it .
This is the part where we come to the snag in Chopra ’s deterministic mindset .
He assumes that because we evolved and we ’re here , it means there must be a purpose to our existence and a process that created us .
To back this idea , he needs to prove that we ’re somehow required to be alive and evolve as we did , or the whole universe falls apart .
We did n’t have to be here and if we were to be wiped out tomorrow , the universe would go on as per usual .
Until he proves there ’s a reason for our existence with something more than wishful thinking , wild claims that he made up on the spot , and appeals to vanity , his entire argument is a non sequtur .
It ’s time to step back and take a look at the big picture .
Evolution reminds us that we evolved in the forest roof to collect fruit and berries , not to ponder the nature of life itself .
So he ’s transcended evolution because he can now ponder the complexity of life ?
Really , this vapid tripe with ridiculous claims , zero evidence and a complete and total lack of understanding of how basic physics work is the stuff that ’s going to help us grow as a species and the kind of information deserving to be printed and sold to the tune of millions of dollars ?
No wonder Chopra cranks out three or four books a year .
Those tomes do n’t require even a smidgen of thought , research or coherence .
They ’re just a rolling record of blithering nonsense as it leaks from whatever ’s left of his mind and those who buy them are in effect reading the brain dump of an ignorant , vain man who might as well have tossed his medical degree in the trash can and set it on fire since the last time he used the skills and knowledge which allowed him to earn it was a very , very long time ago .
He has written for television and screen , and as a newspaper columnist – for the Literary Review , Daily Telegraph and The Listener .
Stephen Fry 's four novels are The Liar ( 1991 ) , The Hippopotamus ( 1994 ) , Making History ( 1996 ) and The Stars ' Tennis Balls ( 2000 ) .
He has also published a collection of work entitled Paperweight ( 1992 ) ; Moab is My Washpot ( 1997 ) - an autobiography ; and Rescuing the Spectacled Bear : A Peruvian Journey ( 2002 ) – his diary of the making of a documentary on the plight of the spectacled bears of Peru .
Comedian , actor and writer Stephen Fry was born in 1957 in London and brought up in Norfolk .
He attended Queen ’s College Cambridge from 1979 , joining the Cambridge Footlights Dramatic Club where he met Hugh Laurie , with whom he forged a highly successful writing partnership .
His first play , Latin ! or Tobacco and Boys , written for Footlights , won a Fringe First at Edinburgh Festival in 1980 .
He wrote again for theatre in 1984 when he rewrote Noel Gay ’s musical Me and My Girl ( 1990 ) .
This was nominated for a Tony Award in 1987 .
Question : What philosophers influenced you ?
Stephen Fry : Philosophy is an odd thing .
When we use the word in everyday speech you know you sometimes hear it hilariously .
They say , “ Oh , it ’s never good to be late . ”
“ That ’s my philosophy . ”
You think that ’s a generous description of that rather dull precept to call it a philosophy , but it ’s odd how philosophers generally speaking , at least the ones I ’ve read or the ones I you know value , do n’t have in that sense a philosophy .
There is no particular Socratic or Dimechian or Kantian way to live your life .
They do n’t offer ethical codes and standards by which to live your life .
They do n’t offer a philosophy to follow .
They just simply raise an enormous number of questions mostly , so in the sense that you put the question is there a philosopher that ’s important to me .
Well I me I loved really the sort of the Bertrand Russell grand sort of tour of philosophy , the history of philosophy from the pre Socratics as they ’re called , Zeno and so on through to Socrates and Plato and Aristotle .
I never quite liked Aristotle .
I think that ’s partly …
Although he was obviously a genius and brilliant and he invented logic , so what ’s not to like .
I think it was his influence on the medieval mind was probably rather pernicious and unfortunate and all those categories and things , but when it opened up with I suppose Spinoza and them , but then Kant and the enlightenment era .
Oh and actually Locke .
I did like Locke .
He was a fine philosopher , but they do n’t …
I mean what is so great about them is that they just …
They ’re quite scary when you think of the word philosopher and especially if it ’s logic and symbolic logic and it gets onto Hegelian philosophies , incredibly difficult to read I find and you follow it for about …
Well it ’s like trying to grab a salmon .
You know the harder you clutch at it the more it springs , slips out of your hand and whoa , it ’s gone and you chase it again and what was that and you feel very stupid , but the… I think the beauty of questioning and simplicity that you get from Kant in particular I think is just amazing because it ’s like they say of simple mathematical laws that make fractals , the tiniest little elegant observation about or question about something just spins out these immensely complex things that make you rethink everything .
So yes , I think philosophy is a really important dimension , but I think in our age we tend to be rather sloppy about it .
We either think Buddhism is philosophy , which you know or some sort of eastern thing about being nice and spiritual and that will do , which it ’s fine .
I mean you know obviously I believe in kindness and niceness and lots of spiritual things , but the real intellectual rigor and quest of logic is something that I ’m afraid takes incredibly hard work and we live in an age in which hard work is if not actively deprecated or denigrated it is run away from or ignored .
It ’s sort of people frown at you and say , “ Well , that ’s a bit dull and stupid .
Why ca n’t we just short circuit it and talk about like spirit ? ”
Well yeah , you can say spirit , but if you think that ’s philosophy and if you think that ’s good enough .
The most important philosophy I think is that even if it is n’t true you must absolutely assume there is no afterlife .
You cannot for one second I think , abbragate the responsibility of believing that this is it because if you think you ’re going to have an eternity in which you can talk to Mozart and Chopin and Schopenhauer on a cloud and learn stuff and you know really get to grips with knowledge and understanding and so you wo n’t bother now .
I think it ’s a terrible , a terrible mistake .
It may be that there is an afterlife and I ’ll look incredibly stupid , but at least I will have had a crammed pre afterlife , a crammed life , so to me the most important thing is you know as Kipling put it , to fill every 60 seconds with you know what is it ?
To fill every unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run .
You know absolutely , so that ’s all I ’m saying I suppose .
Is that there is no point wasting time being lazy , though of course indolence in a divine way , actually has its advantages .
Oh , shut up Steve .
Okay , next one .
Question :
What do you believe ?
Stephen Fry :
It ’s interesting .
Atheism comes into rather a bad press and I suppose I ’d rather describe myself as a humanist , who human … I do n’t believe in God .
I do n’t believe there is a God .
If I were to believe in a god l would believe in gods .
I think monotheism is the really ghastly thing .
That is the absolutely staggering to me misapprehension .
I can perfectly see why anybody might imagine that each thing , each thing that grows , each phenomenon that we… that accompanies us on our journey through life , the sky , the mountains , spirits of nature .
I can imagine why man would wish to endow them with an inner something , an inner animus that they would call the god of that thing .
I can see that .
It ’s a beautiful and charming way of looking at it and I can understand the Greek idea that there are these you know these principles of lightening or of war or of wisdom and to embody them , to personify them into a Athena or Aries or whichever god you want makes enormous sense , but to say that there is one only god who made it all and who is …
Yeah , that is just …
What ?
Why ?
Who said ?
Where ?
Come on .
And I love how when people watch I do n’t know , David Attenborough or Discovery Planet type thing you know where you see the absolute phenomenal majesty and complexity and bewildering beauty of nature and you stare at it and then … and somebody next to you goes , “ And how can you say there is no God ? ” “ Look at that . ”
And then five minutes later you ’re looking at the lifecycle of a parasitic worm whose job is to bury itself in the eyeball of a little lamb and eat the eyeball from inside while the lamb dies in horrible agony and then you turn to them and say , “ Yeah , where is your God now ? ”
You know I mean you got …
You ca n’t just say there is a God because well , the world I beautiful .
You have to account for bone cancer in children .
You have to account for the fact that almost all animals in the wild live under stress with not enough to eat and will die violent and bloody deaths .
There is not any way that you can just choose the nice bits and say that means there is a God and ignore the true fact of what nature is .
The wonder of nature must be taken in its totality and it is a wonderful thing .
It is absolutely marvelous and the idea that an atheist or a humanist if you want to put it that way , does n’t marvel and wonder at reality , at the way things are , is nonsensical .
The point is we wonder all the way .
We do n’t just stop and say that which I cannot understand I will call God , which is what mankind has done historically .
That ’s to say God was absolutely everything a thousand or two thousand years ago because we understood almost nothing about the natural world , so it could all be God and then as we understood more God receded and receded and receded , so suddenly now he is barely anywhere .
He is just in those things we do n’t understand , which are important , but I think it just is such an insult to humanity and the Greeks got it right .
The Greeks understood perfectly that if there were divine beings they are capricious , unkind , malicious mostly , temperamental , envious and mostly deeply unpleasant because that you can say well yes , all right , if there is going to be god or gods then you have to admit that they ’re very at the very least capricious .
They ’re certainly not consistent .
They ’re certainly not all loving .
I mean really it ’s just not good enough .
You know if we empower ourselves with responsibility over our actions , responsibility over our destinies and responsibility for directing and maintaining and creating our own ethical and moral frameworks , which is the most important thing really is n’t it because perhaps the greatest insult to humanism is this idea that mankind needs a god in order to have a moral framework .
There is a very clear way of demonstrating logically how absurd that is because the warrant for that logical framework , for that moral framework that comes from God is always tested against man ’s own morals and it ’s a complicated argument , but I mean that ’s you know it ’s the standard one which is pretty unanswerable , but the idea that we do n’t know right from wrong , but we have to take it from words put down in a book two , three , four , five , six thousand years ago and dictated to rather hotheaded neurotic desert tribes is just insulting .
It ’s just no , I mean you know if there were a God he would want us to be better spirited than to take his word for everything .
Would n’t he ?
If he gave us free will would he really want us to say , “ No , I have to abide by everything that ’s written in this book , all the laws of circumcision and of eating and of… and what to do with menstruating women ? ”
I mean , “ I ’m going to obey those written down there . ”
“ I wo n’t think for myself because that ’s not required of me . ”
Come on .
It ’s just not good enough and you know I have no quarrel with individuals who wish … who are devout and who have faith .
I do n’t want to mock them .
I really do n’t , but damned if I ’m going to be told by them what to do with my body or damned if I ’m going to have the extraordinary battles won by enlightenment over the past 400 years , to have those battles abdicated by a new dark ages .
It ’s you know .
The battle lines must be drawn .
Question :
What is religion good for ?
Stephen Fry : Music in its time , but I mean that ’s a function of history you know .
The fact is that composers always write for the power because … or power and money and it so happened that in the period when polyphony all the way through to the classical and early romantic era all the power and the money was with the church , so some great masses and some great choir music and some great oratories were written from obviously the Baroque age being the sort of pinnacle of that , but all the way through to Mozart ’s final works and his requiem and Beethoven ’s " Missa solemnis " and Mendelssohn and so on .
There have been some marvelous religious works and in paintings similarly , but that ’s because these were princes .
They were princes of the church .
They were prince arch bishops who employed Mozart .
These were not spiritual beings who inculcated these composers with a sense of the divine that makes the music divine .
The glory of Verde ’s Requiem or Mozart ’s Requiem or Bach ’s pieces is that they are fantastic , incredibly human and like all great human ’s thing they reach for the infinite .
They reach for beauty .
A religious person would call that the divine .
You could call it the humanist .
You could call it anything else , but certainly is that .
Religion has been good for that and good for architecture because it is required that enormous …
It required enormous buildings for the shepherding of people in , in order to do the services and they spend a lot of money on it and so they are rather glorious buildings .
You ’ve got to hand them that .
Do they make the trains run on time ?
No , they did n’t do that .
That ’s about it really .
And there are some kind individual people .
I mean very kind people who give to the poor and look after the sick and so on , but it ’s not necessary and sufficient as a justification for religion because there are plenty of people who are not religious who are also kind to the sick and good to the poor and care about people ’s well - being .
Question :
Are there religious leaders you admire ?
Stephen Fry : Yes , very much so .
I mean Trevor Huddleston and Archbishop Tutu from South Africa are two good examples who were both genuine men of their church , or let me see -- Huddleston is dead , but Tutu is still alive -- and who both fought a terrible injustice and used all the authority of their position amongst their believers and but very bravely spoke out and sometimes against the wishes of the church hierarchies .
Some liberation theologist who are from , you know , some of them mad Communists , some of them just decent liberals who fought against the hideous doctrines of the Roman Catholic church for example , and there are individual voices who are raised in conscience against the bureaucracy and the dogma and the doctrine of the churches , and you know certainly of course individuals in , you know , Bonheoffer for example in Germany , the Lutheran minister who spoke out against Hitler .
There are …
Of course there have been good and fine religious people and the Dalai Lama seems rather charming .
I do n’t know .
It ’s terrible .

We 've all heard the plastic bag horror stories — the billions of bags discarded every year that wind up polluting oceans , killing wildlife and getting dumped in landfills where they take up to 1,000 years to decompose .
Researchers have been wracking their brains for years to figure out a solution .
But leave it to a Canadian high school student to leave them all in the dust .
Daniel Burd , an 11th grader at Waterloo Collegiate Institute , has discovered a way to make plastic bags degrade in as little as three months — a finding that won him first prize at the Canada - Wide Science Fair , a $ 20,000 scholarship , and a chance to revolutionize a major environmental issue .
Burd 's strategy was simple :
Since plastic does eventually degrade , it must be eaten by microorganisms .
If those microorganisms , as well as the optimal conditions for their growth , could be identified , we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions .
With this goal in mind , he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted a solution of household chemicals , yeast and tap water to encourage microbe growth .
Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for three months .
Finally , he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags , exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control .
Sure enough , the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17 percent lighter than the control after six weeks .
Once Burd examined the most effective strains of bacteria , he was able to isolate two types — Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas — as the plastic munchers .
At 37 degrees and optimal bacterial concentration , the microbes had consumed 43 percent of a plastic sample within six weeks .
Next up , maybe it 's time to put him to work on this whole carbon emissions thing .
Here 's another tale of a blue ribbon project that could have great environmental benefits : Teen 's Winning Science Fair Project Could Turn Tire Dumps Into Power Stations .

It says something about the parlous state of relations between Washington and London that a Democratic American president can use words like " lackluster , " " depressing " and " dour " to describe a prime minister from the British Labour party .
According to " Renegade , " ...
Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story has gotten a lot of Americans thinking about our monetary and banking system .
What ’s it all about and why is it screwing us ?
What is its history ?
As it turns out , we ’ve been grappling with the problem since the founding .
Here are a few among many largely unknown statements by prominent early Americans regarding the monetary system and banks :
1 .
President Andrew Jackson ( 1829 – 1837 ) ( best known , ironically , for his visage … on the paper $ 20 bill ! ) , is quoted , regarding the central banks ’ utilization of paper money :
The paper - money system and its natural associations — monopoly and exclusive privileges — have already struck their roots too deep in the soil , and it will require all your efforts to check its further growth and to eradicate the evil .
The bankers roused Jackson ’s anger to such lengths that he forced their representatives , physically , from the White House :
… You are a den of vipers and thieves .
I intend to rout you out , and by the grace of the Eternal God , I will rout you out .
( And he did . )
But imagine one of our über - scripted , contemporary U.S. Presidents doing that !
Yes indeed , Americans did things differently back then !
They ran on principle , principles that they were n’t afraid to put into action for the Republic , instead of letting them float hypothetically or as sound - bites like a Clinton or an Obama .
Leaders actually … lead … back then ?
Apparently they did .
This , in contrast to our electric - shock collared , jump - when - we - tell - you , puppet government hat passes for American democracy these days .
Of course the bankers evidently came back in due course …
President Jackson and other American statesmen were assiduously aware of the risks of a centralized banking and monetary system .
They sought to balance laissez - faire capitalism with the uniquely American agrarian ↔
manufacturing give - and - take that made the early Republic so special ; what separated it from the economically restricted and import - dependent ( from the African / Asian colonies ) Europeans .
2 .
Thomas Jefferson , in a letter from Monticello , 28 May 1816 ( see full - text at http://yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/jefferson/jefftaylor.html):
“ I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies … ”
There you are .
From Jefferson in 1816 to Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story in 2009 , not much has changed ; the central bankers are dug - in ; entrenched , and they have clawed along on the underbelly with us for 200 - plus years .
How much longer ?

Posted by John , December 31st , 2009 - under Kevin Rudd , Labor Party , Refugees , The Liberals , Tony Abbott .
Australian Opposition leader Tony Abbott wants to turn refugee boats back out to sea .
As Abbott points out this was also the position that now Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd adopted in the last days before the federal election in 2007 .
The Liberals are desperate and with a bit of refugee bashing they hope to re-connect with the backward elements of the working class who support being tough on asylum seekers .
This is essentially the same strategy of a less desperate Government , but somewhat disguised .
In fact Rudd has tried to turn one boat back .
He rang the Indonesian President to get him to intercept the Merak before it reached Australian waters .
254 people remain on the boat , anchored off an Indonesian port .
One refugee has died .
Kevin Rudd has blood on his hands .
Indonesia will never again intercept boats heading for Australia .
The Australian customs boat the Oceanic Viking picked up 78 asylum seekers in international waters and took them to Indonesia .
The 78 refused to disembark .
The UNHCR fast tracked their processing and all 78 were found to be genuine refugees .
The alternative ?
They could have and should have been bought to Australia and processed quickly ( in the community , not in detention centres . )
Instead of kowtowing to reactionary elements in Australia Kevin Rudd could make the case that we should accept all asylum seekers without locking them up , and fast track our own approvals processes in hot spots near Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , Sri Lanka and the like .
In having that discussion Rudd could follow Malcolm Fraser who took the argument for accepting Vietnamese refugees to the Australian people and won the debate .
Rudd wo n’t do a Fraser because politicians in advanced capitalist countries today want to distract us from the real enemy – our own bourgeoisie and its rapacious drive for profit and more profit .
For some workers our alienation in the productive process is somehow psychologically alleviated by attacking the poor and the defenceless , people like refugees ( and aborigines . )
Bashing asylum seekers divides workers and distracts us from the reality of the situation .
It is not refugees who sack us or pay us low wage or treat us like rubbish .
It is bosses .
Abbott ’s call , like Rudd ’s , is unworkable .
It is also the antithesis of the supposed Catholicism that Tony Abbott professes .
( The same general criticism applies to Anglican Kevin Rudd too , by the way . )
As long as workers are attracted to the Liberals and Labor on the basis of crude ( or not so crude ) anti-refugee racism the bosses will be able to undermine and on occasions openly attack our living standards with seeming impunity .
And of course supporting the architects of Workchoices or Workchoices Lite on this basis just opens the way for the Government of either conservative persuasion to continue the onslaught of the last 26 years on our living standards .
Australian society needs a strong left , not one wedded to the Labor Party , to defend asylum seekers and refugees .
To win the battle for refugees we must win the battle for the hearts of the working class by defending workers ’ jobs and conditions and their freedoms , to organise , to speak out , to strike .
A strong unified and action oriented left has the potential to focus the underlying anger with the system , and in doing that drive the racists back under their rocks .
I need hardly add such a left does not exist in Australia , yet .
Now that Canada 's border services agency has put Vancouver 's Olympic Paranoia on the radar across Canada and to our neighbors to the south , thanks to their treatment of journalist Amy Goodman , it 's probably a good time to try to explain a few things , such as why Vancouver and British Columbia are acting as paranoid as the high school pot - head trying to avoid the vice principal after a BC bud and hash brownie lunch .
To recap , Ms. Goodman was held up at the border because she was giving some talks in Vancouver and Victoria about Afghanistan , Iraq , health care , and a few other topics that could be grouped under the heading “ Not the Olympics . ”
But the only thing the border guards were concerned with was if she was planning on talking about the 2010 winter games .
She was incredulous that they were incredulous that she did n't plan on talking about it .
It was a veritable vertigo of incredulity .
The comment sections on sites carrying the story were filled with people wondering , in the manner of comedians everywhere , What 's the deal with Vancouver and the Olympics ?
Well , here 's the deal : We Canadians are a sensitive peoples .
So when we offer to host the Olympics and pass city by - laws restricting basic rights in order to satisfy corporate sponsors , our feelings get hurt when these actions are misconstrued as sinister by dirty hippies .
You see , when it comes to citizens ' rights during the Olympics , the government treats them the way I treat a red light at 4 am on empty streets – as merely a suggestion .
Granted , restricting rights and falling prostrate to the Olympic overlords may seem like conduct unbecoming of a first world country and wannabe - world - class city , but hey , we 're nothing if not polite , and we want to make the IOC happy – hence the internal conflict .
We can't stand the idea of people not liking us .
When the Beijing Olympics announced that there would be “ free speech zones ” far away from any venues , there was an international outcry against that move .
Now , Vancouver is planning to do the same thing , without the attendant dictator to say , “ Whaddaya gonna do about it ? ”
The governments ' only recourse is to try to convince us it's for our own safety , of which it is eminently concerned .
Do n't believe them ?
Their feelings get hurt .
I mean , what 's wrong with calling for celebratory - signs - only near sports venues ?
Okay , then .
So , no to “ Free Tibet ” , but yes to “ HOORAY !
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT FREEING TIBET ! ”
Now , due to public pressure , and the BC Civil Liberties Union 's lawsuit , the city is reconsidering the language in the by - law .
But still , negative press started building , and the city and the Vancouver Olympic Committee ( VANOC ) tried to play it all down ( It reminds me of a line from The Flintstones .
Barney : Hi Betty what makes you think there 's a body in the trunk ? ) .
Then , the Vancouver police buy some military grade hardware ( the LRAD ) , originally developed to combat pirates , as a public address system .
It 's main use is usually to emit ear - splitting noise , perfect for use in Fallujah and dispersing protesters , which is what it was used for at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh recently .
Some people find it hard to believe it would n't be used in this manner , and the VPD public relations department resents having to work so hard to convince us otherwise .
And , of course , there 's that other perennial problem for the Olympics – what to do with the homeless ?
British Columbia has a terrible record on dealing with the issue , but , just in time for the Olympics , it passes the Assistance to Shelter Act.
Against our own Charter of Rights , it would allow police to sweep up the homeless and deliver them to shelters against their will .
No shelter provider in Vancouver thinks this is a good idea .
Shelters are overcrowded and some people do n't like to be packed in like that unless it 's a four - man bobsled , preferring to bundle up and sleep outside .
Actually , they prefer adequate housing , and a crammed shelter does n't qualify .
“ I consider it to be a draconian piece of legislation , which I hope will receive ... a court challenge , ” said Miloon Kothari , the former United Nations special rapporteur on adequate housing .
And so the paragon of virtue becomes a parvenu with a retinue of goons , and that 's bad optics .
So , yeah , authorities are smarting a little from having their good intentions misinterpreted .
They 're terrified of protests and they do n’t want to see any embarrassment for the different levels of government ; they do n’t want to see it on the national or international news .
You have to understand , this paranoia is a particularly acute Canadian problem .
I get the feeling that China did n't give a rat 's ass what anybody thought about its “ free speech ” zones .
And when the Americans host the Olympics , well , what ? —you gonna tell the Americans what to do ?
Did n't think so .
They will not go gently into that fortnight .
And then there 's Maude , er , I mean Canada .
We care deeply about what people think about us .
“ Does France think I 'm fat ?
What does Holland think about my bong policy ?
Does hiking up my skirt to the Olympic Franchise make me look cheap ? ”
Most Vancouverites know that people are being hurt by the Olympics , but they choose to disavow this knowledge in favour of the Olympics .... ” I know what I see on the streets before my eyes , but I pretend otherwise , because the authorities tell me that the Olympics are a good thing ... ”
In psychoanalysis , this ' disavowal ' of the real has the structure of psychosis , and man , does that ever make some people PARANOID .
And that makes us feel like the Amy Goodman's of the world are out to get us .
Not gonna happen .
People will like us .
Must make people like us .
Please like us .
The beautiful thing about philosophy is that it identifies the truly great problems , ones where arguments can be made for each side with equal validity .
The website philpapers.org , an online repository of philosophy articles and books , recently conducted a very interesting survey about some of these grand debates .
It consisted of 30 questions , all current issues with well established alternative positions in philosophy under intense discussion .
They surveyed 1803 philosophy faculty members and / or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students , and then tabulated the results .
I also went through and gave each question a “ controversy ” score – the lower the score , the lower the consensus in the answers ( for the curious , via mean square error ) .
Is this the real life – or is it just fantasy ?
The least controversial issue was Question 6 , “ External world : idealism , skepticism , or non-skeptical realism ? “ .
This dealt with the structure of the external world , where and how it exists , and what we can know about it .
4.2 % of respondents believed that the external world was best described by idealism , that reality is totally dependent on the mind .
Plugged into the Matrix ?
Your “ reality ” could be described by an idealist perspective .
4.8 % chose the viewpoint of skepticism , that the external world can never really be known in its true form .
9.2 % reinforced some stereotypes of philosophers and gave an answer best described as “ other ” .
81.6 % of respondents agreed in the clearest consensus of the survey that the external world was best described by a perspective of non-skeptical realism .
This means that “ reality ” exists independent of the mind ( the realist part , we are n’t making it all up in our heads ) and that we can draw reasonable and consistent conclusions from it ( the non-skeptical part ) .
Life may not be a waking dream after all .
Now , onto controversy !
Kill one to save a thousand ?
You are a superhero .
The love of your life dangles from a fraying rope above a pit of spikes , while nearby a speeding train full of orphans rushes toward the edge of a cliff .
You only have enough time to save one of the two – what do you do ?
Normative ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with questions like these – how “ should ” you act in a certain situation ?
Is there certain approach one should use ?
This was the subject of one of the most controversial issues , Question 20 – “ Normative ethics : deontology , consequentialism , or virtue ethics ? “ .
18.1 % chose the perspective of virtue ethics , first advocated for in a significant sense by Aristotle .
Virtue ethics emphasizes the character of the person who is faced with a difficult decision .
Do you save the children in the train or your dangling love ?
It does n’t matter – what matters is your character and your intent in making the decision .
23.6 % argued for consequentialism , the philosophy that spawned the approach of “ the ends justify the means ” .
Whether an action is right or wrong depends on the outcome of the situation , not the specific actions you chose .
There are a number of different variants of this which would “ score ” the final situations according to whether it maximized happiness , economic benefit , liberty , love , or any number of possible ideals to yourself or to others .
If you were an egoist you would send the orphans over the cliff and save your love to maximize your own happiness .
If you were a utilitarianist , you would save the orphans because it would benefit the largest number of people .
25.8 % of respondents chose deontology , where it is the actions you take that are judged rather than the results of those actions .
Deontologists are concerned with rules and duties , and an action following these duties can be considered morally correct even if it produces dire consequences .
If you were a married superhero who had sworn a vow to protect his love – orphans be damned , there is a duty to perform .
32.3 % of philosophers , presumably not wanting to commit to paper their rationale as to whether they ’d kill orphans or their love , chose “ Other ” .
What about the rest ?
Here ’s a table ranking the “ consensus ” on each issue , from least to most controversial .
The lower the mean square error , the less disparity there is in the magnitude of responses – and so less consensus is reached .
I think this is a pretty decent metric , if you have any better suggestions , feel free to leave a comment .

Now you can go to fancy cocktail parties and hold your own in philisophical debates – or at least have the confidence that you ’re stating a position that can not be proven wrong .
Everybody understands that good parents have to lay down rules for their children as they grow up .
However , too many rules can be a bad thing , says a new report in Current Directions in Psychological Science .
According to the authors , numerous studies have found that in Western countries , when parents are too strict with their children , they can impede their psychological development .
It has also been suggested that this effect may not be as strong in East Asian countries — researchers have posited that certain aspects of East Asian culture may make children more accepting of their parents ' intrusive behavior .
The idea shared by many researchers examining the effects of parental control seems to be that too much may interfere with a child 's psychological development by making them feel like they do n't have any control over their lives .
They suggest this outcome may be particularly pronounced in the West , where autonomy and independence are emphasized .
Longitudinal studies have indicated that parental control in both Western and East Asian countries can have similar results on children from those regions .
For example , as children are entering adolescence , the more parents make decisions for them regarding personal issues , the more the child 's emotional suffering will be affected two years later — the size of this effect was similar in the United States and China .
However , there may be some contexts in which the effect of parental control is stronger in the West than in East Asian countries .
In Western countries , for example , parents tend to decrease control more than Chinese parents do as children go through adolescence ; Western children expect this decrease in supervision and therefore , their psychological functioning may be dependent on the extent to which parents decrease their control over them .
In addition , the negative effects of parental control over children 's academic learning may be stronger in the West than in East Asia .
In East Asian countries , there is a very strong moral aspect associated with learning and an education has much greater financial impact than in the West .
For these reasons , when it comes to academics , East Asian children may be more accepting of excessive parental involvement .
Nonetheless , the research discussed in the report seems to indicate that extreme meddling by parents can have negative effects on their children 's psychological development in both East Asian and Western countries , although the effects may not be uniform . : Eva M. Pomerantz , Qian Wang , ' The Role of Parental Control in Children 's Development in Western and East Asian Countries ' , Current Directions in Psychological Science 2009 , 18 ( 5 ) , 285-289 , 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01653.x
What was released last week from Russia was evidence that the stars of Climategate have been cherry - picking the temperature data they receive from Russia , to use only the 25 per cent of the data that makes for a warming trend .
Put it together with all the data they have suppressed and what emerges is a trend over the past 80 years that remains flat , showing no net warming at all .
Yet this is the most oft - cited of all the temperature records on which the whole global warming scare of recent decades has been built .
Beachbody helped me get healthy to start a family
Sep 25 , 2017 Beachbody
Beachbody
On Demand has helped me to lose 115 lbs , and I could not be happier .
My husband and I were ready to start a family , but I weighed in at a whopping 276 lbs , and blood work revealed that I was pre-diabetic .
I knew that being extremely overweight would put me at high risk for many complications during pregnancy .
I needed to get a grasp on my weight and become healthier before trying to conceive .
I fell in love with Beachbody 's workouts !
The first few weeks were the hardest , because I was sore and hurting all over .
As I pushed through each and every workout I found myself getting stronger , and the accountability of my Beachbody Challenge groups really helped me to overcome my obstacles .
My Coach and fellow challengers motivated me and cheered me on throughout the entire length of the challenge .
They taught me that it was okay to slip up , but instead of allowing it to defeat me , I had to get up and keep moving on .
Now that I 've lost the weight , I love what I see when I look in the mirror and no longer hate shopping for clothes !
I am so proud to say that I am no longer at risk for diabetes , and my doctor states that I am overall very healthy and cleared to begin trying to conceive a child , which was my original motivating factor .
I am excited to continue this lifestyle and maintain it through pregnancy and beyond .
I would like to be a healthy role model for my future children so that they do not have to face the same struggles that I did .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
On December 10 , 2009 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported that El Niño conditions spotted earlier in 2009 had strengthened .
From October to November 2009 , sea surface temperature anomalies increased across the eastern and central equatorial Pacific Ocean .
Predictions varied , however , regarding when El Niño would reach its peak strength .
These color - coded images show El Niño conditions in November ( top ) and October ( bottom ) 2009 .
The images are based on data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS ( AMSR-E ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite .
White areas show where sea surface temperatures were near normal , orange - red areas show unusually warm waters , and blue areas show unusually cold waters .
The animation shows daily changes in October and November 2009 .
In the later image , sea surface temperatures across the equatorial Pacific have increased .
What was a broad band of orange in October with two streaks of red in the eastern Pacific has become an intense band of red .
Increased sea surface temperatures also appear in the higher latitudes — east of Japan , around Australia , and in the South Pacific midway between South America and New Zealand .
Under normal ( non -El Niño ) conditions , waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean ( near South America ) are kept cool by regular westward - blowing trade winds .
As the winds blow surface waters toward the western Pacific , a deep pool of warm water builds around Indonesia .
Meanwhile , in the eastern Pacific , cooler waters well up from deep in the ocean to replace the water being pushed westward .
During El Niño , the easterly trade winds weaken .
The warm pool of water in the western Pacific gradually sloshes eastward , warming the central Pacific .
Without the trade winds to drive upwelling in the eastern Pacific , the surface waters become warmer than normal .
El Niño is only one facet of climate pattern that involves both the ocean and the atmosphere .
The atmospheric component is called the Southern Oscillation , which is a strengthening or weakening of the difference in air pressure between the western and the eastern Pacific .
During a negative phase of the Southern Oscillation ( which is the phase linked to El Niño events in the water ) , air pressure at the surface of the Pacific around Indonesia becomes unusually high , while the pressure at the surface over the eastern Pacific becomes unusually low .
It is the combination of ocean and atmosphere disruptions that produces such strong impacts on global climate patterns .
The NOAA Climate Prediction Center stated that this El Niño - Southern Oscillation event would likely continue strengthening or remain moderately strong over the next few months , exerting a substantial influence on global weather and climate during that time .

While there is still volatility in all of the rankings , I think the closer rankings are the ones with the most potential to change .
Where does Billy Wagner fit in now that he ’s going to be a closer ?
Should Carlos Marmol , Bobby Jenks or Trevor Hoffman be considered a top option ?
Where do we value 2009 breakouts David Aardsma and Ryan Franklin ?
These are all questions that we ’ll try to answer as we take a look at how my rankings currently stand ( remember , I ’m still fine tuning my projections so keep in mind that these are fluid ) :
Jonathan Broxton – Los Angeles Dodgers Mariano Rivera – New York Yankees Joe Nathan – Minnesota Twins Jonathan Papelbon – Boston Red Sox Joakim Soria – Kansas City Royals Francisco Rodriguez – New York Mets Heath Bell – San Diego Padres Brian Wilson – San Francisco Giants Huston Street – Colorado Rockies Andrew Bailey – Oakland Athletics Brian Fuentes – Los Angeles Angels Francisco Cordero – Cincinnati Reds Frank Francisco – Texas Rangers Trevor Hoffman – Milwaukee Brewers Mike Gonzalez – Baltimore Orioles / Rafael Soriano – Tampa Bay Rays
Thoughts :
Broxton ’s strikeout potential gives him a big edge over the rest of the field .
He ’s had over 95 strikeouts in three of the last four seasons and has a career K/9 of 11.91 .
You add that with the saves , ERA and a career WHIP of 1.16 and there is nothing not to like .
Will Mariano Rivera ever stop getting the job done ?
He seems like he could be successful for another 10 years , does n’t he ?
Wilson entered 2009 as a questionable option , considering a 4.62 ERA and 1.44 WHIP in 2008 .
He put it all together , however , while the Giants showed that they are committed to him as their closer .
That confidence , to go along with increased strikeouts and getting his control in order , makes him an awfully attractive option .
I may be one of the few , but I love Frank Francisco for the upcoming season .
The Rangers proved they were committed to him in 2009 and , when healthy , he showed that he could be a dominant backend pitcher .
Look for him to continue to thrive .
Both David Aardsma and Ryan Franklin fell short of this list .
Does anyone truly believe that they can repeat their 2009 success ?
Mediocre middle relievers turned stud closers just do n’t hold too much weight with me at this point .
Neither will likely have a very long leash , so if they revert back to their old ways in April or May , they will be replaced .
OK , so the number 15 spot is a bit of a copout , but I think both deserve to be recognized on this list .
They shared the job in Atlanta for much of the season , which hurt both of their values but allowed both to prove they were capable of excelling in the role .
Now , they ’ve both moved on and should be in line to close games with their new clubs .
That makes them both intriguing options for the upcoming season .
Carlos Marmol has a great chance of being a Top 15 option , if he can get his control in order .
A 7.91 BB/9 , however , makes it impossible to put him there preseason .
He ’s a great sleeper once the top names come off the board .
I like the promise of Billy Wagner in Atlanta , thanks to the strikeout potential , but he is a big injury concern .
I probably wo n’t get him in any draft , because the cost is going to be higher than I ’m going to pay .
Currently he ’s the thirteenth closer off the board with an ADP of 143.75 .
Taking a closer at the part of the draft , I ’d rather more of a sure thing .
That said , I do think he could be a Top 15 closer , given his impressive return last season .
He easily could find himself on these rankings next time around .
( He easily could replace Trevor Hoffman , who is another player I likely wo n’t have on any team in 2010 . )
What are your thoughts on the early rankings ?
Who is too high ?
Who is too low ?
Who was omitted that should n’t have been ?
Previous Early Rankings :

The flower delivery van had been parked across the street for far too long .
Cahey peered outside through the window blinds for the third time .
By now he was certain they had him under surveillance .
He had been careful not to discuss the subject matter of his current project with anyone , but there were a few souls at the Tribune who knew he was working on a major investigative piece .
Apparently that was enough to spike the government ’s interest .
Cahey lit a cigarette and reflected on the van ’s relatively conspicuous location .
Sloppy surveillance work or a deliberate attempt to scare him into silence ?
There was no way to know .
He was , however , sure of one thing : if they came here , they would find nothing .
Knowing that digital content was much easier to protect from prying eyes than papers , photographs and recordings , he had disposed of every physical record of his investigation , leaving only a digitized copy on the hard drive of his laptop computer .
Two days ago , he had encrypted all this data using an open - source application called TrueCrypt , making sure to overwrite the original files several times before deletion .
Now his data was unrecoverable without the password , and there was nothing anybody could do about it , not even the NSA with their army of PhD ’s and their supercomputers .
The spooks would be in for a surprise .
“ Drrrrrt ” — the sound of the doorbell pierced the smoke - infused air .
Cahey glanced through the window .
The van was gone .
As he walked towards the door , he contemplated logging out of his Windows account , but decided against it .
Bypassing that layer of security would be a trivial exercise , and it would n’t do the government much good anyway , given the fact that everything of interest was now encrypted .
He opened the door .
On his porch stood five serious - looking men in suits .
“ Stephen Cahey ?
We have a warrant to search the premises . ”

Agent Jack Trallis looked at the machine he had been ordered to process .
It was a pretty standard Dell laptop with a dual - core CPU and a 15 - inch screen that was covered with fingerprints .
“ God , do I hate those glossy displays ” , he muttered to himself .
He was alone in the room ; the other agents were in the living room questioning the suspect .
Trallis noticed the prominent TrueCrypt icon on the machine ’s desktop .
“ Uh oh .
Strong encryption . ”
He fixed his eyes on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen .
There was a row of oversized , unlabeled icons that reminded him of the Hackintosh he had once built for his girlfriend .
The guy ’s laptop was running Windows 7 .
There was still a chance .
He located the Documents folder , opened its Properties window , and clicked on the “ Previous Versions ” tab .
Just as he thought , there were five previous versions of the folder – “ shadow copies ” created regularly by the operating system as part of the System Restore mechanism .
As these snapshots were prepared silently in the background and stored on a hidden disk volume , few users were aware of them .
Agent Trallis was smiling .
The good guys from Redmond were going to make his job easy again .
He selected one of the snapshots and clicked Open .
An Explorer window popped up , showing the contents of the Documents folder exactly as it had appeared three days ago .
“ This is too funny ” , he thought .
There was a subfolder labeled Project Foxhunt full of scanned documents and audio files .
Trallis grabbed his radio .
“ Sir ” , he called out to his commanding officer , “ I ’ve got something you might want to have a look at . ”
US Online Poker Given 6 Months Reprieve As UIGEA Postponed
admin ,
Online gaming proponents were celebrating after the US Department Of Treasury and Federal Reserve Board announced implementation of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) was to be delayed by six months until June 1 , 2010 .
The act would have made it illegal for US banks , credit card and financial companies to process internet gambling transactions but it has proved an unpopular piece of legislation and been challenged domestically as well as at the World Trade Organization .
“ This is a great victory for poker but an even greater victory for advocates of good and fair public policy , ” said PPA Chairman Alfonse D’Amato , ” These additional months are critical to provide legislators time to clarify UIGEA and pass legislation to licence and regulate poker early next year . ”
The delay allows online gaming protagonist congressman Barney Frank time to further push two pieces of legislation designed to further the online gaming cause .
The passing of HR 2266 would initially delay the UIGEA by an additional 6 months while HR2267 would “ provide for the licensing of Internet gambling activities by the Secretary of the Treasury , to provide for consumer protections on the Internet , to enforce the tax code , and for other purposes . ”
Following the announcements , Frank said , they “ deserve a great deal of credit for suspending these midnight regulations promulgated by the Bush administration which would curtail the freedom of Americans to use the Internet as they choose and which would pose unrealistic burdens on the entire financial community . ”
“ This will give us a chance to act in an unhurried manner on my legislation to undo this regulatory excess by the Bush administration and to undo this ill - advised law , ” Frank commented .
The death of one star can sometimes outshine a galaxy ofbillions of stars .
That 's because when some very massive stars end their livesin supernova explosions , they release a surge of light known as a gamma rayburst .
Now scientists have found evidence that magnetic fields arebehind these rare events .
Theorists have predicted that magnetic fields couldexplain how gammaray bursts ( GRBs ) produce jets of bright radiation that shoot out into theuniverse .
But no one has observed the presence of a magnetic field in a gammaray burst until now .
On Jan. 2 , 2009 , a gamma ray burst erupted and was quicklydetected by NASA ?
sSwift satellite , which makes continuous scans of the cosmos in hopes ofcatching one of these outbursts , as they generally last only seconds .
Swiftreported the burst immediately to telescopes around the world , and the roboticLiverpool Telescope on the Canary Island of La Palma automatically beganobserving it .
The telescope was fitted with a filter that detectspolarized light , or light that is electrically and magnetically aligned in acertain direction .
Indeed , the observatory found polarized light in the gammaray burst signature , which told the researchers that the light originated in amagnetic field .
" This breakthrough observation gives us the firstmeasurement of magnetic fields in the afterglowof a GRB , " said Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA ?s GoddardSpace Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
The researchers ?
led by astronomer Iain Steele , director ofthe Liverpool Telescope and a professor at Liverpool John Moores University in England ?
published their findings in the Dec. 10 issue of the journal Nature .
" This is a first indication that magnetic fields arevery important [ in GRBs ] , " Steele told SPACE.com .
" I think this is agood step forward to understanding the energetics in the jet and the role ofmagnetic fields . "
Gamma ray bursts only occur in a small subset of supernovas , and astronomers think they might be associated with the deaths ofmore massive stars .
The researchers hope to observe more GRBs in the futurefor confirmation of the presence of magnetic fields , and to learn more aboutwhat powers these luminous eruptions .
The enemies of the Human Rights
Act are a diverse bunch , but one thing many of them have in common is a tendency to launch vicious attacks on people going about their business invoking it .
An email currently circulating around newspapers is issuing death threats to journalists who report hacker Gary McKinnon 's attempt to resist extradition to the US .
" We will start hurting British citizens every day that you continue your stance against US extradition , " the email says .
" You will be contacted when this happens so you know we are for fucking real . "
The irony is that one of the arguments being put forward by McKinnon is that such is the intensity of hatred towards him in the US that he would not be treated fairly .
Maybe death threats against journalists will end up forming part of his legal team 's submissions .
McKinnon , who relies on human rights arguments to contest his extradition , suffers from Asperger 's Syndrome and depression .
His lawyers argue that the prospect of extradition and a potentially long prison sentence have led to a deterioration in his mental health and wellbeing , engaging his right to a private life under Article 8 of the European convention on human rights , the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3 and , sadly , now that suicide is now also a risk , the right to life under Article 2 .
I can understand why this case exercises people in the US .
I have had plenty of more reasonable feedback from Americans who are , understandably , offended by arguments that their criminal justice system is unfit for British prisoners .
But the arguments in McKinnon 's favour are well - rehearsed – his offending took place in the UK , the disparity in sentences is immense , and the length of time spent anticipating removal has affected his health in a way that clearly engages his rights .
A less vulnerable but equally high profile victim of the Human Rights
Act in general , and incidentally Article 8 in particular , spoke out yesterday in response to threats – of a kind – he had received .
High court judge David Eady , one of the most demonised judges of recent times , has something in common with McKinnon .
Like the hacker , Eady has been criticised for simply using the law that is there .
The frustration vented at Eady ( the Daily Mail editor - in - chief Paul Dacre has called his judgments " arrogant and amoral " ) centres on accusations that he has single - handedly created a law of privacy through his interpretations of Article 8 .
Critics have been particularly exercised by cases such as the one brought by Max Mosley where , as Eady himself said in another speech recently " adulterous and even sadistic activities [ have been ] afforded similar legal protection to that available in the case of traditional ' family life ' " .
It 's a further irony that the judge with such a visible role in interpreting it has endured so many personal attacks that he could probably form a viable Article 8 claim himself .
Of course Eady says the unwelcome attention has done no more damage than cause " amusement " , a comment that will no doubt further irritate his critics .
Eady 's response is that he has simply been doing his job applying the Human Rights Act .
And maybe even enjoying it .
What the criticism that has attracted shows – apart from general ignorance on the part of those doing the criticising – is how strong feelings against the act run .
We can only speculate about how disappointed people will be if the act really were repealed – instead of Eady applying it , the task would fall to a judge in Strasbourg .
And instead of McKinnon challenging his extradition at the high court , he would be doing so at the European court of human rights .
Seven years from now .
Incidentally , that might make both their lives easier , but I somehow doubt it would appease critics .

There comes a time where one would need to dig beyond the abstractions to see what is really going on under the covers .
Say for example you wanted to see how a certain library computes parameters for your callback , how would you do it ?
Scanning the library and figuring out the logic step by step is one way you can do it , but that is very time consuming and with complex libraries such as jQuery , it 's nearly impossible to exactly pinpoint from where your callback function is being invoked .
In this post we will see how we can use Firebug to pinpoint exactly from where your callback functions are called in the abstraction .
Let 's take an example with a very small hypothetical " library " example :
This ' library ' offers 2 public functions ; , which takes a function and stores it into theparameter and thefunction that invokes the function that was stored previously .
Here 's how this library can be used :
When thefunction is called , the callback function that was passed previously will be invoked , passing in some parameters from behind .
The library is passing an array as a parameter and the third element of that array is a computation ofNow , as users of the library , we want to check how thatis computed from our callback function ; and we will do this with Mozilla Firefox 's best friend , Firebug Open your Firebug ( ) and head onto the Script tab and choose the script from where you are defining your callback function .
Then find your function and put a breakpoint in the function :
The next step is to perform the action that will invoke your callback , and in my case this ' action ' is a page refresh .
So now after my page refresh , the library will invoke my callback and the breakpoint will be hit :
When the breakpoint is hit , the line will be highlighted in yellow .
Now comes the part where we trace the steps back to where the callback was invoked .
If you look closely to the upper part of the Script tab , you will see the following : From there , you can now trace the path to where the function was invoked !
Now let 's click on the first step , Upon clicking , Firebug takes you directly to that function , , and now from this function we can see how our callback function was invoked :
Now although we can see from there the function was invoked , we still do n't know from where thatis coming from , and so we must check which function invokedand to do that , we move a step back through the invocation line , thestep :
From here , we can now see how thatwas being computed because we have finally arrived to the step we wanted to .
Now obviously this technique is n't that much useful for this example because the code of this ' library ' is so small that it does n't require backtracking of the function calls , but it can be used very effectively on much larger libraries to quickly identify how certain parameters are being computed and sent to your functions , amongst other uses .

WarMouse plans to ship a multi-button office application mouse by February next year .
The outfit said it would start taking orders for the pointing device , which comes loaded with 18 chunky programmable buttons and is intended for use by OpenOffice.org fans and gamers , next month .
OOMouse features a shedload of inputs .
The 18 programmable buttons can all be double - clicked , and the mouse comes with an obligatory scroll - wheel , 512 k of flash memory and support for over 60 separate configs .
Unsurprisingly OOMouse incorporates default profiles for the five core OpenOffice.org apps based on 662 million datapoints hoovered up from the so - called " usage tracking facility " loaded into OpenOffice.org 3.1 , which is free desktop software that competes with Microsoft 's Office suite .
Users can customise the profiles using OOMouse setup software , an app that will be released early next year as an OSS project under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3 .
The mouse supports up to 63 profiles to be stored simultaneously in the device 's memory .
It 's also one of the first computer mice to incorporate an analog joystick and first to permit the use of the joystick as a keyboard , claimed WarMouse .
" In the three joystick - as - keyboard modes , the user can assign up to sixteen different keys or macros to the joystick , which provides for easy movement regardless of whether the user is flying through the cells of a large spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or on the back of an epic flying mount in World of Warcraft . "
Button up
So why did WarMouse slot so many buttons into its corded OOMouse ?
" That ’s as many as we ’ve determined one can effectively use without having to look at the mouse , " explained the organisation .
" The mouse buttons really are n’t that small .
If you can use a larger digit - the thumb - on a smartphone button less than one - half the size , you ’re not likely to have any problem using your index , middle and ring fingers on the mouse buttons . "
The firm said it would provide " the most efficient finger - to - button map " at some point soon , for anyone confused about how they might go about using the mouse .
Over the weekend some tech sites pointed out that OOMouse could rival Apple 's recent release of Magic Mouse , which comes with one sleek seamless multi - touch surface .
Some suggested that OOo was also taking a catty swipe at the Jobsian firm with its own mouse .
" A difference in design philosophy is n’t personal , it ’s just a difference in design philosophy , " said a defensive WarMouse .
" To be honest , we simply do n’t care that much about Apple .
Our furiously burning hatred is already far too occupied with Microsoft . "
Anyone interested in getting their hands on the Windows , Linux and Mac - compatible device will first need to shell out $ 74.99 , which is five bucks more than Apple 's Magic Mouse . ®
Correction :
This story was updated because it had wrongly attributed OpenOffice.org as the maker of the mouse .
WarMouse , which is a private company , produced the product and designed it specifically for use with OpenOffice.org .
The son of Brooke Astor , the philanthropist and long - reigning matriarch of New York society , was convicted in Manhattan on Thursday on charges that he defrauded his mother and stole tens of millions of dollars from her as she suffered from Alzheimer ’s disease in the twilight of her life .
The jury ’s verdict means that Mrs. Astor ’s son , Anthony D. Marshall , 85 , faces a sentence of at least a year and as many as 25 years .
A co-defendant , Francis X. Morrissey Jr. , a lawyer who did estate planning for Mrs. Astor , was also convicted of a series of fraud and conspiracy charges , as well as one count of forging Mrs. Astor ’s signature on an amendment to her will .
The verdict drew the curtain on a long trial that cast an unflattering spotlight on one of New York ’s first families of high society .
Henry Kissinger , Barbara Walters and Annette de la Renta , among others , testified that Mr. Marshall mistreated his mother in her later years and conspired to inflate his inheritance from her estate  largely to appease his wife , Charlene Marshall .
Mrs. Astor died in 2007 at age 105 .
As the verdict was read , Ms. Marshall sat stone - faced ; moments later , while her husband went to meet with a probation officer , she left the courtroom , saying , “ I love my husband . ”
She and Mr. Marshall then held hands and ignored requests for comment before being whisked away in a black Town Car .
I have been meaning to write this article for a couple weeks now , ever since the recent GNU Hackers Meeting over in Göteborg .
I 'd rather be hacking tonight , but some other circumstances make such a report a bit more timely ; so , here goes !
GHM
I arrived a little late , having missed the first day 's talks .
I was particularly irked to have missed Bruno Haible 's talk on modularity and extensibility , but I understand that there will be some video up soon .
I did n't know enough at that time to miss having seen José Marchesi 's talk , but now that I know the fellow , it is a shame indeed .
Actually that was one of my biggest take - aways from that event : that I never really knew GNU as a community of maintainers .
GNU in 2009 is not the kind of organization that flies people all over to meet each other , and it's to our loss .
I hope to see much more of GNU hackers in the future .
So everyone that goes to conferences knows why they are great : the hallway track .
Or the bar track , as it might be .
So what were the topics ?
GNU is not FSF
This point really surprised me : that GNU is not the Free Software Foundation .
There a relationship , but they are not the same thing , not by a long shot .
So here 's the deal .
In the beginning , there was GNU .
But Richard realized that in the world of 1985 , with proprietary software on all sides , it would be easier to defend the small but growing software commons if hackers collaborated by assigning their copyright to one U.S. - based organization .
The FSF was set up as the legal entity associated with GNU , with RMS at its head .
25 years later it 's still like that .
The copyright assignment paperwork that every GNU contributor signs has some clauses that obligate the FSF to keep their conributions free ( in the Free Software sense ) , but ultimately trust in the FSF is a trust in RMS , and in his principles .
It is a testament to RMS 's character that there are 35000 lines in fencepost.
gnu.org:/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list , representing at least 5000 contributors .
But what 's up now ?
As free software became more and more successful , it became clear that there were other ways to get involved than just writing code .
There 's all kinds of advocacy work that needs doing , for example .
The FSF was a natural concentration point for these efforts .
However , also inevitably , with the influx of people , the composition of the FSF changed .
There are very few hackers in the FSF now .
There is RMS of course , whose work these days does n't involve programming , but that 's about it .
Recently Mako was added , which is an important step to redressing that situation , and more on that later .
I mean , look at www.gnu.org and www.fsf.org.
See the difference ?
So the advocacy and campaigning is with the FSF , and the hackers are with GNU .
I think every GNU hacker is really down with the message of freedom ; I mean , we are the ones hacking the hack .
But , as a majority , the GNU hackers are not down with " Windows 7 Sins " or " Bad Vista " or most of these negative campaigns the FSF has been running recently .
I say this as a GNU maintainer , not as a representative of GNU , but I believe I have the facts right .
GNU and RMS
All GNU hackers respect RMS .
We respect his ethical principles , his vision , his tenacity , and his hack .
I mean , GNU Emacs : this , for most of us , is the best software in existence .
The early days of GCC .
Texinfo .
Really remarkable contributions , these , without which the world would be a poorer place .
( If you disagree , that 's cool ; but I 'm just trying to explain where we come from .
I guess also I should clarify what I mean by GNU here .
I mean , " people who have signed paperwork to assign copyright to the FSF " .
I know that mentioning the FSF there is a bit ironic , but it 's a strict definition . )
But nowadays , while RMS 's principles remain strong ( thankfully ) , he 's a bit absent , technically .
That would be OK -- he has certainly put in his hack - time -- but that the GNU project does n't really have a means to make technical decisions on its own right now .
Each maintainer can mostly make decisions about their modules , and we can talk to each other ( mostly via gnu - prog - discuss ) , but there is no governance structure for the GNU project itself .
Worse , sometimes RMS decides things without any input at all , when such input really is needed .
The decision to bless Bazaar as the official GNU version control system , for example , really sits poorly with a lot of people .
The adoption of SCM and MIT Scheme as two additional Schemes in the GNU project also are real WTF decisions .
These " blessings " do n't have much of an effect on people 's behavior -- most active GNU modules use git , for example -- but they make people lose faith in GNU 's technical coherence .
The issue here is that the GNU project is a community of people working for software freedom , yes , but we have some specific values binding us together .
One , the ethical principles of supporting user freedom ; more on that later .
Secondly , there is a technical vision of a " GNU project " as a cohesive , well - thought - out , integrated technical whole .
One can now argue about the extent to which that is currently true , but it is a very important value to GNU hackers .
Things were more or less fine when there was more of UNIX that needed to be reimplemented , and when RMS himself was more on the ball .
But now there is a significant measure of dissatisfaction within GNU itself about the way decisions are made .
There are some steps being taken to fix this ( a recently created GNU advisory board , for example ) , but it is ironic that some decisions in GNU really do come from one man .
At the same time there is actually a widespread concern within GNU about what would happen if decision making were to be made more open .
No one wants outsiders making decisions , it would still have to be maintainers ; but there is concern that things might get out of hand , that there might be too many pointless discussions , that bad decisions could be made , that there would be a tyranny of the talkers , etc .
This is why things are changing really slowly .
Everyone wants more autonomy , but they do n't want to lose the solidarity .
GNU and GNOME
So what 's the deal with GNU and GNOME ?
Everything , and nothing .
Allow me to explain .
GNU people see GNOME as an " outside " thing at this point .
To most GNU hackers , GNOME is not quite GNU .
GNOME does n't follow GNU 's coding standards ( recall the point about technical integrations ) , assigns no copyright to the FSF , and seems to prefer LGPLv2 + and not GPLv3 +.
There is hardly any communication between GNOME people and GNU people .
In GNOME , people look at problems their systems are having , and decide to solve them within GNOME -- Policy Kit , for example .
( I do n't want to pick on David 's excellent software ; but I 'm equally sure that it never crossed David 's mind to suggest Policy Kit for inclusion into the GNU project .
There are many similar examples . )
Hell , many GNU people even use things like Sawfish or Xmonad or StumpWM or other such things .
Admittedly , GNU folks would be more likely to install GNOME on their cousin 's computer ; but as for themselves , Emacs is the only program many people need .
GNOME people on the other hand are in two camps , more or less .
Broadly speaking these camps correspond to Free Software and to Open Source , respectively .
The former feel a strong heart - tie with the GNU project ; perhaps they started working on GNOME back when it really was a GNU project , or perhaps they started with it because they believed in GNU 's ethical principles and chose that environment because they wanted to spread user freedom to their friends .
As I say , most GNOME people are disconnected from GNU per se , so this tie really is more cultural than practical , but it is there , and it is strong in its own way .
The Open Source people tend to value GNOME in particular from the days when Qt was GPL - only , or even proprietary , and GNOME allowed them to develop open source applications as well as proprietary ones .
Open Source people appreciate the technical comraderie , as well as the technical excellence of the platform , but often disagree with the GNU project 's copyleft principles , instead appealing to individual choice as to whether to use or make proprietary software or not .
I hope I have n't been uncharitable to anyone here .
Please correct me in the comments if so .
is GNOME GNU ?
So , Andre posts , wondering about the relationship between GNU and GNOME .
I hope I have been able to add some broader context to the question .
I think that Andre 's characterization of RMS as " fascistic " is totally wrong .
There are serious problems of decision - making within the GNU project , yes , but " fascistic " takes it a bit too far , and almost brushes Godwin's Law ;)
The particular context in which the discussion has been brought up , that nasty thread on foundation - list , is unlikely to bring about any mutual understanding .
It is ironic that the topic is the code of conduct , which was designed to promote understanding .
Bottom line , GNOME can be GNU if it wants to .
But I do n't think a decision is necessary right now , and certainly not on foundation - list , not in that thread of the talkers .
GHM redux
I promised to talk more about hallway tracks at the GHM , but I 've run out of semicolons .
Until next time !
( NaturalNews ) Researchers from Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina have discovered that the tests administered to a person undergoing a heart attack emit radioactive elements at levels equivalent to 725 chest X - rays .
The aggregate average of radiation administered is about a third of what nuclear power plant workers are allowed to be exposed to annually .
Dr. Prashant Kaul , author of the research study , indicated that doctors typically fail to identify any other tests a heart attack victim may have already received when administering their own .
As a result , patients are being exposed to high levels of radiation that far exceed safe maximum levels .
The research team accumulated and analyzed data from over 64,000 patients who had undergone treatment for heart attacks between 2006 and 2009 .
The team discovered that patients underwent an average of seven tests utilizing ionizing radiation , the kind that is capable of penetrating tissue and damaging DNA cells .
The vast majority of the tests were chest X - rays , followed by catheter procedures and computed tomography , also known as CT scans .
According to the American Heart Association , the aggregate number of medical tests given each year that involve some sort of radioactive exposure has skyrocketed , increasing 700 percent between 1980 and 2006 .
Most of these tests deal in some way with heart disease as it is one of the fastest growing disease epidemics in America .
Improvements in scanning technology have resulted in a sevenfold increase in radiation exposure compared to diagnostic scans performed in 1980 .
Thereported in August that roughly 4 million Americans are exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation each year due to such medical testing procedures .
The obvious threat from radioactive testing procedures is the potential for increased rates of cancer .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has indicated that a person subjected to a CT scan may develop cancer at some point in his or her life due to the amount of radiation emitted from the test .
For this reason , doctors should be cautious in advising patients to undergo such tests unless absolutely necessary .
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is an alternative technology that involves no ionizing radiation .
MRIs utilize magnetic fields to generate images that are typically clearer than those produced by a CT scan .
Ultrasound is another option that uses sound waves to form images .
Heart ultrasounds work especially well at assessing the heart for possible risk factors before a heart attack occurs .
Sure , disaster movies are just empty calories of mass destruction — but even when you do n't take them seriously , there are always some scenes that you just can't excuse .
We 've collected the most infuriating moments from the biggest disaster movies .

Disaster : Volcano
Our Breaking Point : The Subway Scene
How long do you think the people were sitting in that train ?
Seriously — how long ?
After a little while of watching people pass out , one after the other , from heat ?
I 'd LEAVE .
But no , this guy has to die a painful death walking through lava .
Which in itself was a horrible thing — walk faster , melty guy !

Here 's the remixed version — watch the full scene here .
Disaster : Deep Impact
Our Breaking Point : The Wave of Love
Nothing brings a daughter and a distant father back together like a giant tidal wave .
Call me black - hearted , but this whole " I 'm facing my destruction head on , and what ?
Oh hey , there 's my dad who was never around .
What the hey , I forgive you ! "
Tasted like yuck .
And to all the people loading up their cars :
Come on , it 's the end of the world , the roads are always blocked .
I bet they felt foolish when they realized they could have just stood on a high mountain to avoid the water .
But the hug - it - out wave was still the worst .
Disaster : Armageddon
Our Breaking Point : Ben Affleck
Good theme music and spaceman slo - mo walking , but even if you can convince the audience that a team of misfit drillers can be trained to do their jobs in space , there 's no way you can make me believe this scene .
Remember , the crew went up in two ships , and they get separated .
But do n't worry , Ben Affleck 's asteroid rover is n't damaged , and he and the remaining crew drive across a sharp - as - razors terrain , fly over a cannon , and find their way back to the other crew .
After they shoot their way out of the ship .
WHY DID IT HAVE GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE ?
Uh , no .
Disaster : The Day After Tomorrow
Our Breaking Point : Frost Running
I did n't think it was possible for a character to piss me off more than when Dennis Quaid announced that he would be walking from Philly to New York , through the worlds most horrific storm , ever .
And then his movie son Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends ran from frost , and a pack of wolves .
They outran cold .
You can not run from cold , and you cannot protect yourself from cold by shutting the door , nor can you breathe air that is that cold — but screw science , you just plain can't run from cold .

Disaster : Twister
Our Breaking Point : Thank God For These Leather Straps
Twister was a fun movie about lunatics who chase twisters , thus making storm - chasing look infinitely cooler than it could ever be .
But for the most part , it 's just lots of driving and yelling up at the sky and seeing cows fly past , etc — you know , good stuff .
Until the big one .
At the end , Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt chase and get chased by the really , really big tornado , and instead of dying , they tie themselves with leather belts to a pole , and survive .
Their arms remain intact and neither of them manage to get hit by any of the debris that is encircling them .
Lucky ducks , eh ?

Our Breaking Point : Dustin Saves The Town With His Words
Between a ton of accidental spills and the trained professional scientists sticking their hands into infected blood samples or falling asleep on the job , the worst moment of all is by far Dustin Hoffman 's magical speech .
Yes , it 's worse than the little girl playing with the ebola host monkey .
Never in a million years would Dustin Hoffman be allowed to sit up there in that plane .
I 'd give him two minutes before he was shot out of the sky .
Disaster : The Happening
Our Breaking Point : The Ending
First the plants attack cities , then the roads , then the small cities , then groups , then angry people , then it 's the wind .
What .
The Hell .
How can something that probably took millions of years to develop change in hours ?
Because M. Night said so , that 's why — so quit your whining and watch the big ending payoff .
Wahlberg and Zooey then decide to suicides themselves , because Zooey decided even though the plants are killing everyone , she should take their dead friend 's child outside to run amuck .
And now they are trapped — by wind .
Time to give up hope and walk towards each other with big sweeping instrumentals , what HAPPENS ?
Nothing .
" The event must have stopped before we went out here . "
Screw this movie .

Circling Yamal 3 - facing the thermometers
Let 's look closely and compare local thermometer records ( GISS ) with the Twelve Trees , upon whose treerings depend all the IPCC claims of " unprecedented recent temperature rise " .
Earlier Yamal work here & here .
WUWT presentation here .
Hockey Stick story here & here .
Salehard compared locally & seasonal .
Half the Hockey Stick graphs depend on bristlecone pine temperature proxies , whose worthlessness has already been exposed .
They were kept because the other HS graphs , which depend on Briffa 's Yamal larch treering series , could not be disproved .
We now find that Briffa calibrated centuries of temperature records on the strength of 12 trees and one rogue outlier in particular .
Such a small sample is scandalous ; the non-release of this information for 9 years is scandalous ; the use of this undisclosed data as crucial evidence for several more official HS graphs is scandalous .
And not properly comparing treering evidence with local thermometers is the mother of all scandals .
I checked out the NASA GISS page for all thermometer records in the vicinity of Yamal and the Polar Urals , in " raw " , " combined " , and " homogenized " varieties .
Here are their locations ( white ) .
The Siberian larch treering samples in question come from Yamal and Taimyr . Salehard and Dudinka have populations of around 20,000 ; Pecora around 50,000 ; Surgut around 100,000 ; all the rest are officially " rural " sites .
Some are long records , some are short .
Russia has two problems .
First , many records stopped or became interrupted around 1990 after the ending of Soviet Russia ; worst affected are the very telling Arctic Ocean records .
Second , during Soviet Russia ( and possibly now for all I know ) , winter urban records were " adjusted " downwards so that the towns could claim more heating allowances .
Nevertheless , it will become clear that these issues in no way impede the evidence regarding treerings .
Click to enlarge these graphs .
The first shows the 20 GISS stations closest to Yamal and the Polar Urals .
The second shows treering width changes over time ( only 10 of the 12 trees here ) .
This was supposedly compared with local thermometer records , and used to calibrate earlier treering widths as temperature measurements to create a 1000 - year temperature record .
It was a pig to turn these graphs into a stack of transparent lines at the same scale as the GISS records for comparison , but finally , interesting material started to emerge .
I scaled all the GISS thermometer records to the same temperature scale , and ran them all from 1880 to 2020 at the same time scale ( GISS graphs do not do this ) .
I overlaid them as transparent lines along their approximate mean temperatures for comparison .
Mean temperatures ( visually judged ) vary from around - 2 ºC ( Pecora ) to - 13 ºC ( Selagoncy , Olenek , Hatanga , and Ostrov Uedine ) and even - 15 ºC ( " Gmo Im E.K. F " ) .
The calibrations are degrees Centigrade anomaly , and decades .
Ha !
Straightway we see clear patterns emerging .
Let 's agree them :
Thermometer records : ( 1 ) time - wise , thermometers show temperatures rising from 1880 to 1940 or so ; ( 2 ) temperatures fall a little from 1940 to 1970 ; ( 3 ) temperatures then rise a little but do not quite regain the heights of the 1940's ; ( 4 ) despite mean temperatures ranging from - 2 ºC to - 15 ºC ( total means range 13 ºC ) , and a range of temperature anomalies from each mean of only 9 ºC from warmest year to coldest year , when mean temperatures are aligned , clear correlations emerge ; ( 5 ) there are high variations between adjacent years .
We shall investigate all this more closely in a minute .
Treering records : I 've shown here the full records given for the 10 trees that runs from 1800 to 2000 ; but below , I use the same timescale as the thermometer records ( 1880 - 2020 ) for comparison .
It is useful to see a few things here already : ( 6 ) treering sizes are increasing from 1830 ; ( 7 ) before that they show a decrease ; ( 8 ) they do show correlation from 1880 on ( this is NOT proof that the correlation is due to temperature ) .
Yamal area : ( 9 ) The 7 stations around Salehard seem to go in lock step with each other pretty well .
( 10 ) The five Yamal treering records ( YAD ) also correlate with each other , showing spikes around 1910 , 1925 , 1940 , 1955 , 1965 , and 1980 - 1990 .
( 11 )
But the treerings fall out with each other 1990 - 2000 ; and ( 12 ) these treering spikes do NOT correspond to the thermometer temperature spikes ; but ( 13 ) there is a slight correlation with the longterm temperature ; however , ( 14 ) crucially , there is no hockeystick blade in the thermometer record ( 15 ) nor is there one in the treering record if we remove the red YAD061 which is clearly an outlier - only a plateau 'd elevation of the peaks throughout the 20th century starting before the real CO2 / temp rise ( and this is actually matched by pre-1800 values at times ) .
Excuse me for wondering if treerings beat to a different drum than temperature - it is certainly curious that there appears to be something causing correlations in the treerings .
Wind ?
Sunspots ?
The moon ?
But let 's check by zooming in a little closer ...
Salehard close - up : ( 16 ) all the nearby thermometer records ( Mys Kammenij , Tarko - Sale , Surgut , Berezovo , Pecora , Hoseda - Hard ) mirror Salehard closely , although stations are up to 500 miles apart , the range of mean temperatures is - 2 º C to - 9 ºC , and the range of annual temperatures at each station is up to about 9 ºC - altogether a remarkable consistency .
Click to see animated version of these records .
Click to see Salehard even closer - up , compared with 6 local stations , with shared warm years and shared cool years marked .
( 17 ) The close fit of Mys Kamennij ( pale sea- blue ) is particularly significant , since it is maritime and rural , and the same distance as Salehard from the treering site ( some 120 miles ) , but in the opposite direction ; ( 18 ) Ostrov Waigatz ( Vaigach Island ) shows the same pattern but with greater extremes ; ( 19 ) in comparison with all this , the treering records show virtually no correlation at all - yet since treering differences between summer and winter exist at all , one would expect to see some correlation with warmer and colder years .
( 20 ) Perhaps if a far larger sample were used , a correlation might be detected , but clearly ( 21 ) we have trees here that are far too individual - especially YAD061 .
Polar Urals :
Here are seven station records around the Polar Urals site , compared with the five Taimyr ( POR ) treering records .
( 22 ) Mean temperatures are lower here - further North but also more continental , so perhaps the summers are as warm as Yamal , with similar near - treeline environment .
( 23 ) more noise in the temperature record , but the overall pattern is still the same ; ( 24 ) 1943 , 1967 , 1983 are warm in common with the Salehard records , and 1941 is cold ; other years are harder to compare .
( 25 )
The early fragmentary records for Dudinka and Turuhansk still fit together and overlay the Salehard records well , showing clear temperature rise between 1880 and 1940 .
( 26 )
The treering records are fairly coherent , more so than the Yamal ones , and ( 27 ) they fit the Yamal records ' spikes in around 1910 , 1925 , 1940 , 1955 , 1965 , and 1980 on , but ( 28 ) again , this does not fit the temperature record .
The best of both record series : Really rural thermometer records from the maritime Arctic : ( 29 ) show the strongest pattern yet which ( 30 ) fits the other two sets of thermometer records but ( 31 ) does not fit the treering records even though ( 32 ) the treerings show coherent patterns within themselves , despite the two sites being some 800 miles apart .
Briffa 's full chronology : The Yamal chronology Briffa used ( black ) is compared with Polar Urals ( green ) and shows recent temperatures exceeding the Medieval Warm Period but ( 33 ) this is highly questionable , as is the recent final uptick .
No MWP supports the alarmist " Unprecedented ! " yet Polar Urals generally have been shown to fit local thermometer records better than Yamal for the period of overlap .
More GISS Arctic graphs :
There are many serious problems with GISS but we can only take the evidence here .
( 34 ) GISS 64 ºN + shows a misleading trend line - temperatures rise to around 1940 , fall to 1970 , rise to 2000 but not higher than 1940 , then level off after 2000 ; ( 35 ) I do n't know what stations went into this composite - the final uptick alerts my suspicions to some UHI or other station problems ; ( 36 ) Tamino takes the biscuit for cherrypicked trends in the GISS 80 ºN + North Polar winter record ( sea green ) - it clearly opposes the general worldwide fall in temperatures 1940 - 1970 .
However , it 's interesting to see such extremes .
GISS ' homogeneity adjustments : Thankfully , only a few of these Russian records are " adjusted " .
But the alterations are telling .
Surgut spikes upwards over Salehard from about 1960 on - but ( 36 ) the adjustment ( probably UHI ) is perversely done by truncating and moving earlier records upwards , instead of adjusting later records downwards .
And ( 37 ) why were Salehard 's and Ostrov Uedine 's earlier " raw " records omitted in the adjusted records ?
I think every correction here will tend to amplify global warming trends .
GISS world temperatures , 2008 : This map was shown in Tingley & Huybers ' latest Hockey Stick presentation at PAGES conference .
GISS ' own station records around Yamal and Polar Urals appear to show ( 38 ) this map is misleading , since according to GISS ' own records , above , averages local to Yamal / Polar Urals after 2000 are at the most 1.5 ºC anomaly ( above local mean ) .
CRU Arctic temperatures , seasonal anomalies : ( graph by romanm )
Since this is from uncheckable individual station records , ( 39 ) the figures could be contaminated by various " correction " factors , ( 41 ) UHI is especially likely in the winter .
But note that ( 42 ) the difference in character between months , and between summers and winters , is striking - summers have hardly changed - and ( 43 ) still no definitive Hockey Stick as per illustrations and per Briffa 's Yamal treering record , nothing beyond the range of natural patterns clearly evidenced here .
Even the known slight overall increase during the twentieth century takes place mainly earlier in the century .
Salehard Seasonal records .
Briffa did not claim correlation with annual temperatures but with seasonal ones - June July August specifically .
However , since the object of his work was to detect longterm trends , climate changes , I am still firmly of the opinion that the treering data must have statistically significant correlation with mean current thermometer records ( when corrected for UHI etc ) , if it is to be of any use in measuring past climate .
Salehard shows a large recent temperature rise in December - February , not June - August .
So much for Briffa 's correlation .
Briffa et al 2007 thermometer records :
These draw on some 30 station records spread across Eurasia from about 60 ºN to about 72 ºN .
The Appendix which specifies details is unavailable so I can only guess which stations .
However , even so , it 's clear that many of my much nearer , highly valid stations are missing .
And I think my individual station records are much more telling than the homogenized soup of grid areas that Briffa uses .
Compare the details of the above temperature records to mine above , especially those around Salehard , and see how much clearer ( and in harmony ) mine seem to be .
Thus I have little faith that the final black uptick in Briffa 's summer record is anything other than undeclared UHI from stations I cannot identify , probably lying at the southernmost end of this selection , where there are larger towns and cities like Irkutsk .
Certainly the scale is peanuts when compared with the winter variations .
Conclusions :
There is no sign whasoever of a Hockey Stick shape with serious uptick in the twentieth century , in the thermometer records .
Yet these records are clearly very consistent with each other , no matter how long the record or how cold , high , or maritime the locality , with a distance span of over a thousand miles .
Neither does the Hockey Stick consistently show in the treerings except in the case of a single tree .
Even with thermometer records that are incomplete and suffering other problems , the " robust " conclusion is -
" Warmist " treering proxy temperature evidence is falsified directly by local thermometer records .

Malware is getting more and more sophisticated .
Bent on destruction , it is seemingly immune to modern weapons .
One such Trojan horse program is very sophisticated and it keeps reinventing itself in its greedy quest to empty bank accounts .
The URLzone Trojan , which was recently discovered by Finjan Software , is highly advanced and proof positive that the bad guys are keeping up with technology as well as the good guys ( if not being a step ahead , sad to say ) .
This strain of malware rewrites bank pages ; victims do not know that their accounts have been tampered with and emptied in many cases .
Its interface is sophisticated and diabolical as it ’s command - and - control feature allows the bad guys pre-set the percentage of the account balance they wish to clear out !
URLzone is a formidable adversary ..
RSA researchers claim that this malware utilizes several techniques to discover those machines that have been set up by investigators and law enforcement , and so far , they have been impossible to fool .
RSA Security was founded by and named after the inventors of public key cryptography : Ron Rivest , Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman .
According to Aviv Raff , RSA ’s Fraud Action research lab manager :
“ We typically create programs that are designed to mimic the behavior of real Trojans .
When URLzone identifies one of these , it sends it bogus information .
Security experts have long published research into the inner workings of malicious computer programs such as URLzone … Now the other side knows that they are being watched and they ’re acting . ”
URLzone is merciless when it discovers a program established by the “ good guys . ”
Some malware might be content to simply disconnect , but not URLzone .
The server forces money transfers , but not by one of their own people recruited to move cash overseas .
They choose an innocent victim ; someone who has received legitimate money transfers from other hacked computers on the network .
To date , more than 400 legitimate accounts have been manipulated in this manner .
The idea is to confuse researchers and to prevent the criminal ’s real money mules from being discovered .
Although banking Trojans are not new and have been responsible for the loss of many accounts of innocent people , the URLzone represents the first of a frightening and smarter generation of malware .
To date , according to police dog , Finjan , this banking Trojan infected as many as 6,400 computers last month alone and was clearing a hefty $ 17,500 per day !
One can only wonder if Andrew Jackson was n’t right after all .

Editor ’s note : Detroit attorney Kurt Haskell dropped bombshell revelations concerning his eyewitness experience of the Flight 253 attack and how the FBI detained a second man after dogs detected a bomb in his luggage on The Alex Jones Show today .
The FBI has not only ignored Haskell ’s story , but they have launched a cover - up by refusing to even acknowledge the existence of another man who filmed the entire flight , including the aborted attack , as well as the well - dressed man who aided the bomber to board the plane even though he had no passport and was on a terror watch list .
Kurt Haskell .
Watch this space for more stories on this astounding news that the corporate media has completely failed to cover .

December 29 , 2009
Detroit attorney Kurt Haskell appeared on the Alex Jones Show today and detailed his experience at the Amsterdam airport and on flight 253 .
Mr. Haskell provided information not covered by the corporate media .
In addition to a detailed retelling of the story he gave the corporate media , Mr. Haskell addressed the unprofessional and lackadaisical behavior of the FBI and airport security after the plane landed at the Detroit Metro airport in Romulus , Michigan .
He characterized their behavior as a “ complete embarrassment .
They actually put us in more jeopardy than we were already in . ”
Passengers were told to remain seated in the aircraft for 20 minutes after landing despite the fact security did not know at that point if there was an explosive on the plane or if the fire started by the suspect Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab while on descent to the airport had spread under the floor in the cabin or to the fuel tanks in the wings .
After being allowed to disembark from the plane by officials , passengers were detained in customs with their carry - on luggage for six hours while they waited to be interrogated by the FBI , according to Haskell .
[ efoods ]
At this point a bomb - sniffing dog pointed at carry - on luggage in the possession of a man Haskell described as Indian around 30 years old .
Officials led the man away to an interrogation room .
Haskell said he was concerned because the bomb - sniffing dog had flagged the man , indicating he may have had explosives in his carry - on luggage .
The Indian man was subsequently led away in handcuffs .
Following this incident the FBI moved the passengers to another location .
“ You ’re being moved , ” the FBI told them , “ it is not safe here .
I ’m sure you all saw what happened and can read between the lines and why you ’re being moved . ”
Haskell said the corporate media refuses to cover this aspect of his story .
He has repeated it to “ countless ” news agencies and they uniformly have not included it to his knowledge .
Mr. Haskell questioned why officials have not released the Amsterdam airport security video that will undoubtedly reveal crucial information about the “ sharp - dressed man ” who escorted a disheveled Mutallab to the boarding area .
Haskell described the suspected terrorist as appearing to be a “ poor black teenager . ”
The well - dressed Indian man did all the talking .
He insisted Mutallab be boarded on the plane without a passport and when an airport employee refused to do so Mutallab and the Indian man went to talk with a supervisor .
The Indian man tried to pass off Mutallab as a Sudanese refugee and have him boarded despite the fact doing so would be in violation of regulations concerning refugees .
In general , documentation must be provided by an embassy in order for refugees to board international flights .
Mr. Haskell did not see Mutallab again until the botched terror bombing inside the plane on the approach to Detroit .
He did not know how Mutallab finally boarded the aircraft .
The FBI was not pleased with Kurt Haskell when they conducted a follow - up interview earlier today in Michigan .
They showed him close - up photographs of various people , including Mutallab .
“ They kind of tried to trick me , ” Haskell explained .
The agents tried to pass off two photos of Mutallab as different people .
Kurt asked the agents if they were attempting to impeach his story and smear him .
The Indian man was not included in the photographs .
Haskell asked them why he was not shown a full body shot of the suspect .
Haskell was eight rows back from the suspect .
The FBI agents did not answer and were displeased with the question .
He also asked the FBI agents if it would be more appropriate to bring the surveillance video from the Amsterdam airport instead of still photos .
“ I do n’t think they liked that comment from me , ” Haskell added .
The FBI said they did not have the videotape .
They also made a point to tell Haskell they were asking the questions and not him .
The agents showed Haskell a photograph of the man flagged by the bomb - sniffing dog and taken into custody in customs .
“ Is n’t this the man who had the bomb in his carry - on bag that you arrested in customs who you refuse to admit exists ? ”
Haskell asked the agents .
“ They really did n’t like that comment from me and had no comment back to me but I said it sure looks like the man you refuse to admit exists . ”
Kurt Haskell was circumspect and careful not to speculate during the interview with Alex Jones .
He indicated he is only interested in the facts and does not want to endanger his version of events by speculating on motives .

It ’s hardly the image of transparency the Obama administration wants to project : A workshop on government openness is closed to the public .
The event in Washington today , which is for federal employees , is a fitting symbol of President Obama ’s uneven record so far on the Freedom of Information Act , a big part of keeping his campaign promise to make his administration the most transparent ever .
As Obama ’s first year in office ends , the government ’s record of responding to public and media requests for information does n’t match up with the president ’s words .
“ The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption :
In the face of doubt , openness prevails , ’’ Obama told government offices on his first full day as president .
“ The government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears . ’’
Obama scored points on his pledge by requiring the release of detailed information about $ 787 billion in economic stimulus spending .
It ’s now available on a website , www.recovery.gov.
Other notable disclosures include waivers that the White House has granted from Obama ’s conflict - of - interest rules and reports detailing Obama ’s and top appointees ’ personal finances .
Yet on some important issues , his administration produced information only after government watchdogs and reporters spent weeks or months pressing , in some cases suing .
Those include what cars people were buying using the $ 3 billion Cash for Clunkers program ( it turned out the most frequent trades involved pickups for pickups with only slightly better gas mileage ) ; how many times airplanes have collided with birds ( a lot ) ; whether lobbyists and donors meet with the Obama White House ( they do ) ; rules about the interrogation of terror suspects ( the FBI and CIA disagreed over what was permitted ) ; and who was speaking in private with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ( he has close relationships with a cadre of Wall Street executives whose multibillion - dollar companies survived the economic crisis with his help ) .
The administration has refused to turn over important records .
Obama signed a law that let the Pentagon refuse to release photographs showing US troops abusing detainees .
And this administration , like the Bush administration before it , has refused to release details about the CIA ’s “ black site ’’ rendition program .
The Federal Aviation Administration would n’t turn over letters and e-mails among FAA officials about reporters ’ efforts to learn more about planes that crash into birds .
Just last week , a State Department deputy assistant secretary , Llewellyn Hedgbeth , said at a public conference that “ as much as we want to promote transparency , ’’ her agency will work just as hard to protect classified materials or information that would put the United States in a bad light .
People who routinely request government records said they do n’t see much progress on Obama ’s transparency pledge .
“ It ’s either smoke and mirrors or it was done for the media , ’’ said Jeff Stachewicz , founder of Washington - based FOIA Group Inc. , which files hundreds of requests every month across the government on behalf of companies , law firms , and news organizations .
“ This administration , when it wants something done , there are no excuses .
You just do n’t see a big movement toward transparency . ’’
The San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties group , said that it filed 45 requests for records since Obama became president and that agencies such as NASA and the Energy Department have been mostly cooperative in the spirit of Obama ’s promises .
But the FBI and Justice Department ?
Not so much , said Nate Cardozo , working for the foundation on a project to expose new government surveillance technologies .

Two Stories of Simplicity
In response to Sending modern languages back to 1980s game programmers , one of the questions I received was " Did any 8 - bit coders ever use more powerful computers for development ? "
Sure !
The VAX and PDP - 11 and other minicomputers were available at the time , though expensive , and some major developers made good use of them , cross-compiling code for the lowly Atari 800 and Apple II .
But there was something surprising about some of these systems :
It was often slower to cross-assemble a program on a significantly higher - specced machine like the VAX than it was to do the assembly on a stock 8 - bit home computer .
Part of the reason is that multiple people were sharing a single VAX , working simultaneously , but the Apple II user had the whole CPU available for a single task .
There was also the process of transferring the cross-assembled code to the target hardware , and this went away if the code was actually built on the target .
And then there were inefficiencies that built up because the VAX was designed for large - scale work : more expensive I/O libraries , more use of general purpose tools and code .
For example , a VAX - hosted assembler might dynamically allocate symbols and other data on the heap , something typically not used on a 64 K home computer .
Now a heap manager -- what malloc sits on top of - - is n't a trivial bit of code .
More importantly , you usually can't predict how much time a request for a block of memory will take to fulfill .
Sometimes it may be almost instantaneous , other times it may take thousands of cycles , depending on the algorithms used and current state of the heap .
Meanwhile , on the 8 - bit machine , those thousands of cycles are going directly toward productive work , not solving the useful but tangential problem of how to effectively manage a heap .
So in the end there were programmers with these little 8 - bit machines outperforming minicomputers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars .
That ends the first story .
When I first started programming the Macintosh , right after the switch to PowerPC processors in the mid-1990s , I was paranoid about system calls .
I knew the system memory allocation routines were unpredictable and should be avoided in performance - oriented code .
I 'd noticeably sped up a commercial application by dodging a system " Is point in an arbitrarily complex region ? " function .
It was in this mindset that I decided to steer clear of Apple 's BlockMove function -- the MacOS equivalent of memcpy -- and write my own .
The easy way to write a fast memory copier is to move as much data at a time as possible .
32 - bit values are better than 8 - bit values .
The problem with using 32 - bit values exclusively is that there are alignment issues .
If the source address is n't aligned on a four - byte boundary , it 's almost as bad as copying 8 - bits at a time .
BlockMove contained logic to handle misaligned addresses , breaking things into two steps : individual byte moves until the source address was properly aligned , then 32 - bit copies from that point on .
My plan was that if I always guaranteed that the source and destination addresses were properly aligned , then I could avoid all the special - case address checks and have a simple loop reading and writing 32 - bits at a time .
( It was also possible to read and write 64 - bit values , even on the original PowerPC chips , using 64 - bit floating point registers .
But even though this looked good on paper , floating point loads and stores had a slightly longer latency than integer loads and stores . )
I had written a very short , very concise aligned memory copy function , one that clearly involved less code than Apple 's BlockMove .
Except that BlockMove was faster .
Not just by a little , but 30 % faster for medium to large copies .
I eventually figured out the reason for this by disassembling BlockMove .
It was even more convoluted than I expected in terms of handling alignment issues .
It also had a check for overlapping source and destination blocks -- more bloat from my point of view .
But there was a nifty trick in there that I never would have figured out on my own .
Let 's say that a one megabyte block of data is being copied from one place to another .
During the copy loop the data at the source and destination addresses is constantly getting loaded into the cache , 32 bytes at a time ( the size of a cache line on early PowerPC chips ) , two megabytes of cache loads in all .
If you think about this , there 's one flaw : all the data from the destination is loaded into the cache ... and then it 's immediately overwritten by source data .
BlockMove contained code to align addresses to 32 byte cache lines , then in the inner copy loop used a special instruction to avoid loading the destination data , setting an entire cache line to zeros instead .
For every 32 bytes of data , my code involved two cache line reads and one cache line write .
The clever engineer who wrote BlockMove removed one of these reads , resulting in a 30 % improvement over my code .
This is even though BlockMove was pages of alignment checks and special cases , instead of my minimalist function .
There you go : one case where simpler was clearly better , and one case where it was n't .

Maggie 's talking points ( now with 8 x more bullsh*t ! )
by Jeremy Hooper
Maggie Gallagher , desperate to rip the train of history off of its naturally progressive path in order to justify her modern day discrimination , has come up with eight reasons why marriage equality is supposedly not an inevitable .
This writer , determined to remove the unnecessary and hurtful obstacles so that all human beings may someday be able to know peace , has gladly taken on Maggie 's new OctoBomb .
Let 's begin :
Maggie 's Top Eight Reasons
Why Gay Marriage Is Not Inevitable
1. Nothing is inevitable .
We are talking about the future here .
It 's weird to have " reporting " that something that has not yet happened will certainly happen .
The future is never inevitable .
Maggie 's first mistake is also her biggest ( and one she / we will revisit throughout this post ) .
The underlying problem :
Her seeming belief that we are talking about " the future , " even though marriage equality ( I refuse to call it ' gay marriage ' ) is already here !
Realistically .
Tangibly .
To have and to hold .
It 's here , it 's queer -- many people are used to it .
How do I know this ?
Well here , have a look :
Yes , that 's right : I , a man , am legally married .
To a man .
And I have not ( yet ) perfected time - traveling technology .
Both I and my husband exist here in the present .
So it 's not the reporting that 's weird , like Maggie suggests .
What 's truly weird is the way she has , of late , taken to referring to marriage equality as if it 's some crazy conceptual notion .
Especially considering that this is a year that we began with two marriage equality states , and are ending with ( at least ) five .
Moving on ...
2 . Young people are not as unanimous as most people think .
In California , the young - adults vote split 55 percent to 45 percent .
Is it so hard to imagine 5 percent of those young people changing their minds as they move through the life cycle ?
This is such bogus statistical logic !
Because yea , of course some percentage of current young voters will change their mind towards the discriminatory .
But it 's absurd to act as if they will move away in great numbers .
This is a generation that is coming to know same - sex marriage as a non-issue .
A generation that has always known and embraced openly LGBT celebrities .
There is simply no comparing the current crop of teens and twentysomethings with those that come before .
And of course the incoming younger populations are sure to be even more accepting .
Plus we know that voter apathy ( which kills us in younger populations ) also decreases with age .
And of course older Americans , who on this issue are the unfortunate victims of their time , will be replaced with the younger .
And so on , and so on .
Maggie acts as if this one crop of voters are the only ones who will move through life , with all other factors will remaining stagnant .
That short - sighted view is her second mistake .
** UPDATE :
It should also be noted that CNN exit polling showed 18 - 29 year - olds coming down at a 61%- 39 % margin , not 55/45 .
3 . The argument from despair is bait and switch .
They are trying push the idea that gay marriage is inevitable , because they are losing the argument that gay marriage is a good idea .
Mistake number three : Suggesting that the " inevitability " argument is something new , and that it 's born out of some devious strategy .
In truth : Those of us who have been fighting for LGBT rights have always been saying that our fair and decent treatment is inevitable .
That 's because it is .
And when we say it now , it 's not because we are in such a state of " despair " about our chances ( again , remember that we are up three states this year ) .
The reason why we continue to make this claim is because we genuinely think , based on a number of factors , that it continues to be true !
The idea that we have lost on the " good idea " argument is also hogwash , primarily because it's not the line that has ever been in the lead role of this epic play .
Maybe some have used marriage equality 's virtues as their leading argument .
But as an organized movement , this certainly has n't been the case .
As a movement , our primary argument is that marriage equality is a FAIR , RIGHT , EQUITABLE , CONSTITUTION , CIVIL idea .
And in fact , we 've made a major point out of disconnecting the conversation surrounding our marriages from whether or not society thinks they are " good , " since we believe that our rights should not be dependent on public opinion .
That 's something 90 % + of LGBT activists can and will agree on .
4. Progressives are often wrong about the future .
Here 's my personal litany : Progressives told me abortion would be a dead issue by today , because young people in 1975 were so pro-choice .
They told me there would be no more homemakers at all by the year 2000 , because of the attitudes and values of young women in 1975 .
Some even told me the Soviet Union was the wave of the future .
I mean , really , fool me once shame on you .
Fool me over and over again . . . I must be a Republican !
Mistake numero quatro : Using silly personal anecdotes to discredit a movement .
Were there individuals who said all of these things to Maggie at various times ?
Maybe .
Probably , even .
Just as there are people who told this writer that I would never get married ( I am ) , that America had too strong of a defense system to have our own planes used as weapons against us ( we did n't ) , and that George W. Bush would lead this country in the right direction ( he did n't ) .
People say things .
With every claim that Maggie says graced her ears , we could find people of that particular era who made the exact opposite arguments .
Just as now you can find both progressives and conservatives ( or at least moderates ) on both sides of the marriage tea leaves .
What matters is not what Ann Coulter or Frank Rich might individually say on a particular day -- what matters is the conclusion provided by a complex , reasoned , objective analysis of all of the factors .
And on marriage equality , any who is honest with his or her self is going to have a hard time seeing " Adam and Even not Adam and Steve " as a long - lasting win .
5. Demography could be destiny .
If there is one force that directly contradicts the inevitability argument , it is that traditionalists have more children .
Preventing schools and media from corrupting those children is a problem , but not necessarily an insoluable [ sic ] one .
Religous [ sic ] groups are increasingly focused on the problem of how to transmit a marriage culture to the next generation ( see the USCCB 's recent initiatives ) .
Maggie 's fifth mistake : Putting too much stock in her thoroughly faith - based movement , and the sustainability of their attempts to muddy the church / state waters .
Yes , Maggie 's staunchest supporters might tend to have more children .
And yes , equality - hostile religious groups ( USCCB stands for United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ) might be focusing on how to propagate their own ideas for how to live a good , Christian family - oriented life .
This is their right in a religiously free nation .
More power to them .
Genuinely .
But here 's the thing :
We are n't talking about RELIGIOUS MARRIAGE .
Increasingly , people are starting to see the difference between civil marriage and the always ancillary component that is church solemnization .
And that 's what we on the pro-equality side really want .
In terms of our civil rights :
Well , we could n't care less if every ' traditionalist " chose to follow Michelle Duggars ' pioneering lead and decided to have their own eighteen kids and counting .
What we care about is that our civil rights are separated from Michelle Duggars ' religious opinions !
Oh , and since Maggie is always harping on about the supposedly mean - spirited " bigot " claims that supposedly define the pro-gay movement :
Well , now might be a good time to talk about Maggie 's thoroughly offensive claim that America 's schools and media are hellbent on " corrupting " children .
That 's offensive to anyone who works in schools and the media ( a class that includes Maggie ) .
And it 's beyond offensive to pro-fairness people , who Maggie is calling " corrupted " simply because they support the human fabric for all of its stitches .
What gall , Gallagher !
6. Change is inevitable .
Generational arguments tend to work only for one generation : Right now , it 's " cool " to be pro-gay marriage .
In ten years , it will be what the old folks think .
Even gay people may decide , as they get used to living in a tolerant and free America , they do n't want to waste all that time and energy on a symbolic social issue , anyway .
( I know gay people who think that right now ) .
I am not saying it will happen , only that it could .
The future is not going to look like the present ( see point one above ) .
Inevitability is a manufactured narrative , not a fundamental truth .
Mistake # 6 : Acting as if a fundamental civil right and Lady Gaga are the same thing .
Sure , some much younger folks might support marriage equality simply because it seems " cool . "
But there are far more people , of every demographic and every walk of life , who support marriage equality because it 's RIGHT .
Yes , some things will change .
But the constitution wo n't .
The existence of LGBT people wo n't .
The rights of citizenship wo n't .
The crucial church / state and minority rights issues wo n't .
The skinny on our equality will be in fashion long after skinny jeans move into the bellbottom wing of the sartorial nursing home .
It may be for Maggie to see marriage equality as a fad .
But the fact that this sort of belief could ever even cross her mind shows how fundamentally she fails to understand ( or at least admit ) how crucial this fight is to pro-fairness Americans .
It 's not some fun little game we 're playing to bide our time between " American Idol " seasons .
OUR LIVES ARE AT STAKE !
7. Newsflash : 18 - year - olds can be wrong .
Should we really say " Hmm , whatever the 18 - year - olds think , that must be inevitable , " and go do that ?
I mean , would we reason like that on any other issue ?
First off :
The young support is obviously not limited to such a small scope .
When we look at support from younger Americans , the current range in which we hold a fairly reliable lead spans from about 18 ( and younger ) to 35 .
So it 's just silly to look only at newly - abled cigarette buyers .
But beyond that :
No pro-LGBT person 's inevitability argument hinges solely on young support !
We also look to the legislative and judicial support , the major sail - winds from all of the leading intellectuals who the far - right loves to diminish as nothing more than " cultural elites , " sweeping support from professional organizations , the increasing number of champions in the business world , the constantly narrowing gap in public opinion , etc .
The young voter support is only one piece of a much larger puzzle .
So Ms. Srivastav 's seventh mistake : Supposing that any of us are actually reasoning in a way that 's limited to new high school graduates !
8. New York 's highest court was right .
From Hernandez v. Robles :
The dissenters assert confidently that " future generations " will agree with their view of this case ( dissenting op at 396 ) .
We do not predict what people will think generations from now , but we believe the present generation should have a chance to decide the issue through its elected representatives .
We therefore express our hope that the participants in the controversy over same - sex marriage will address their arguments to the Legislature ; that the Legislature will listen and decide as wisely as it can ; and that those unhappy with the result — as many undoubtedly will be — will respect it as people in a democratic state should respect choices democratically made .
Oh this one 's really rich !
Maggie " I 've never met a court who I would n't dangerously decry as being ' activist ' "
Gallagher turning to one lone court decision to supposedly support her claims !?
That 's good comedy , really .
What about the Iowa court ( stacked with Republican appointees ) ?
What about New Jersey in '06 ?
What about the California ruling that Maggie & Co. overruled with a tyrannical majority vote ?
These were all major victories for our side , setting some pretty great precedents .
And it must be noted that ALL of these rulings came after New York , with some of the justices surely learning the unfortunate lessons from the NY ruling , and the reasoned pushback that followed its short - sighted birthing !
It 's also pretty interesting that Maggie would even turn to this little snippet from Hernandez , considering her cited chunk contains this line :
We do not predict what people will think generations from now , but we believe the present generation should have a chance to decide the issue through its elected representatives .
That 's right : Decided through the elected representatives , not through " the people " via a direct referendum .
Even this court , as part of a really bad ruling , recognized that if this nation is going to have the chance to weigh in on a matter like this , then this voice is to come through the representatives that Americans send to office .
The human rights decision is not to come via the extremely hurtful campaigns that Maggie forcefully backed in both CA and ME !
So there ya have it : 8 talking points , 0 substance .
Another productive day at the office , Maggie !
* Maggie 's list : Is Gay Marriage Inevitable ? [ NRO ]
Your thoughts
Wow , you are a far braver and more thoughtful person than I am .
It appears that most of her " points " are variations of " Those stupid kids will grow up and see our point of view . "
Except that many of today 's young adults will be used to same - sex marriages , their friends ' queer parents , etc. Except , of course , that young adults who are currently conservative Christian or just see queerness as " icky " might grow out of that , too .
( I began my 18th year as a conservative Evangelical and ended it with another girl 's tiny engagement ring on my finger , because we thought we'd get to marry in Hawaii after college graduation .
I am not kidding . )
For the same reason , I love the argumentium ad Duggerium at # 5 .
Some of those kids will have a lot to rebel against !
The progressives were n't all wrong about the changes for women , either .
Yeah , there are homemakers , but those women expect to have their own lines of credit and be able to pursue work outside the home as an option .
We have female secretaries of state , CEOs , race car drivers , and , oh , influential political activists !
A 9 - year - old girl I know and love fully expects to win the Stanley Cup one day , and few people tell her it can't happen .
I think things have changed * slightly * since 1975 , thank the Gods .
This is a little off the point , but I like how Connecticut printed its marriage licences so you can choose the word that 's right for you and your relationship .
Amazing how difficult some anti-gay activists will make that sound .

Was anyone able to verify the polling data in number 2 ?
According to CNN 's exit poll , the spread of 18 - 29 year olds was 39 percent to 61 percent .
I bet you can guess which number was opposed .
Perhaps NOM did there own exit poll outside of a Mormon Church .

Maggie says ' Even gay people may decide , as they get used to living in a tolerant and free America , they do n't want to waste all that time and energy on a symbolic social issue , anyway . '
She can't believe it 's about symbolism .
She just can't .
Arguing with these people is as bad as arguing with creationists ; at some point the stupidity just grows so dense that it collapses in on itself and the anti-gay zealot is revealed as a liar .

Oh my glorious gods !
Has Maggie ever studied Critical Thinking and Logical Fallacies , because her 3rd. statement ( as with all of them , of course ) wreaks of a Logical Fallacy ?!
Jeremy , if you 'd ever like to draw upon some specific definitions of fallacious logic when debating an opponent , I highly recommend the following academic sites dealing with that subject : * http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/

" Even gay people may decide , as they get used to living in a tolerant and free America , they do n't want to waste all that time and energy on a symbolic social issue , anyway . "
This is now the second ( at least ) time that the Magger has suggested that marriage equality is inconsequential .
Remember that she said that the gay media treats this issue " as if it matters . "
Now she 's saying that it is a " symbolic social issue , anyway . "
The obvious inference from that she does n't believe the drivel that she is spewing forth .
She has found a group of " donors " who are more than willing to keep her in the moo moos to which she has become so accustomed .
And whatever the rationale of those donors is , the entire issue is just a paycheck to her .
I happen to believe that the rationale of her donors ( the whales at least ) , is to keep a " non-issue " percolating in the small minds of the hate - filled bigots , to distract the minions away from what they are actually hoping to accomplish .
I say " non-issue " because ultimately , to the 90 % of Americans who will never be negatively impacted by marriage equality , it is a non-issue .
By distracting the independent - thought - challenged , they can trick them into electing their candidates , even though voting for those candidates is otherwise the most self - detrimental action that they could possibly take .

I love how she brings up abortion , yeah , its still big news .
Because the GOP makes it big news to get you morons to vote for them !
Notice how despite being in power several times since Roe v.
Wade the republicans have never given anything but lip service to banning abortion ?
because if they actually did they would n't be able to campaign on it anymore .
Which sadly is the approach democrats seem to be taking with gay rights .
Posted by : wackadoodle | Dec 10 , 2009 1:59:22 PM
" a problem , but not necessarily an insoluable [ sic ] one " Hmmm ...
Maggie thinks that this problem can be dissolved in water .
Which might lead some less kind people than me might suggest that Maggie go take a long walk on a short pier .
As for the opinions of 18 year olds , Maggie may not have noticed ( or may not have the math skills ) , but about 52 % of Californians in the age group 18 to 44 opposed Prop 8 .
In fact , had the voters consisted of only people aged 64 or younger , it would have been too close to call .
And mathematically , If NO CURRENT VOTERS shifts towards supporting marriage ; and if those 18 to 29 year olds shift TOWARDS discrimination by 5 % ; as long as the newly incoming voters in the 18 to 29 year group are what they are now , marriage equality is inevitable .

" Even gay people may decide , as they get used to living in a tolerant and free America , they do n't want to waste all that time and energy on a symbolic social issue , anyway . "
So " a tolerant and free America " will happen eventually .
Why is she opposing it when she obviously knows she will lose in the end ?
Posted by : Wyzdyx | Dec 10 , 2009 3:21:20 PM
We do have more support from the younger community , but at the same time there is a lot from older people too .
I do n't know one person who does n't think gays should be allowed to marry .
I 'm sure they are around here somewhere , but none of them have expressed that to me .
I live in Missouri too , so you would think there would be more anti-gay , but that has not been my experience .

Maggie Gallagher is a sad , pathetic person who only derives joy from her attempts to rob others of it .
She 's most probably going to die bitter and alone .
I almost feel sorry for her .
Posted by : Christopher | Dec 11 , 2009 4:21:47 PM
When she does die bitter and alone , I will go dance on her grave and leave a hot steaming present for her .

A new study of 21 different nations has found that the male dominance of computer science at university level is pandemic .
At first glance the study looks to be yet more confirmation of what we already know .
However , it gets more interesting .
Differences between the countries indicate that women might not be genetically predisposed to shun all things high tech , and that there might be other factors at work .
The study , co-authored by Maria Charles , professor of sociology at the University of California and Karen Bradley of Western Washington University , found that men are over - represented among computer science graduates everywhere , but the degree of over - representation varies by as much as a factor of three .
So what is behind the variation ?
Turns out , it is not what you might expect .
Girls ' higher achievement in maths or science did not seem to be related to the number of graduates , nor was cultural support for equal opportunities a good predictor of which countries had the most women Comp Sci graduates .
In Turkey , for instance , for every woman Comp Sci graduate there are 1.79 men , while at the other end of the scale , in the Czech republic men graduates outnumber women by 6.42 to one [ perhaps they 're all working as super - models and will return to their computing education at a later stage - Ed ] .
South Korea and Ireland also have more relatively high numbers of women graduating from computer science courses , but , like Turkey , neither of these nations is especially renowned for taking a hard line on sex equality .
Instead , it seems that restricting the choices available to adolescents , and making it mandatory for all pupils to study maths and science subjects throughout their secondary education , correlates with a higher proportion of women going on to study computer science at university .
" The principle of being free to pursue your preferences is compatible and coexists quite comfortably with a belief in essential gender differences .
This essentialist notion , which helps to create what it seeks to explain , affects girls ’ views of what they 're good at and can shape what they like , " said Charles .
She goes on to say that the implications for policy are clear : rather that letting kids discard subjects too soon , governments should insist on more maths and science for everyone , for longer .
" As other research has repeatedly shown , choices made during adolescence are more likely to be made on the basis of gender stereotypes , so we should push off choice until later , " she concludes . ®
