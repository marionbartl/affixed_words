An amendment to the farm bill , currently being considered by the Senate , would enact a widespread ban on the sale of junk food to children on school grounds .
Under the new rules , developed with intense involvement from the American Beverage Association and other drink and food manufacturers , strict limits would be placed on what foods may be sold on school campuses from vending machines , snack bars and cafeteria a la carte lines .
In elementary schools , the only beverages allowed for sale would be plain bottled water , eight - ounce fruit juices or low - fat milk with up to 170 calories per serving .
The milk could be flavored .
Foods would have to contain 35 percent sugar or less and be low in trans and saturated fats and sodium .
Snack foods could contain no more than 180 calories per serving .
In high schools , the same standards would apply , but snack foods could contain up to 200 calories per serving .
In addition , high school students could purchase diet sodas and sports drinks , and any other drink with up to 66 calories per eight - ounce serving .
After five years , other drinks would be limited to 25 calories per serving .
Occasional fund - raising projects such as Girl Scout cookie sales would be exempt from the new rules .
The rules would not affect regular cafeteria food , which is already subject to stronger nutritional standards .
Individual states would be barred from passing stricter regulations , although individual school districts would be allowed to do so .
It is this last factor , along with the involvement of the food and beverage industry , that has driven some to say that the new rules do not go far enough , and will make it difficult to impose stricter standards in the future .
" It 's crazy to think we are going to fix children 's health just by letting companies sell schoolchildren smaller portions of Gatorade and baked chips , " said Susan Rubin , nutritionist and the founder of Better School Food .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Fed up with soaring oil prices and a chorus of people blaming Wall Street speculators , Congress is considering a host of rules aimed at limiting the inflow of investor money into oil contracts .
But oil traders urge caution .
While more disclosure is a good thing , they say making it harder for speculators to invest in oil futures could have the opposite effect intended , and send prices higher .
In light of oil 's phenomenal climb from under $ 50 a barrel to nearly $ 140 in less than 18 months - and the public belief that Wall Street traders were behind the rise - Congress is awash in bills that attempt to limit the role of speculators .
Several have bipartisan support and could soon become law .
" In two days , the price of oil rose $ 16 , " said Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill. , at a joint hearing of two Senate panels on oil speculation Tuesday .
" Did I miss something , was there some war in the Middle East ? "
" No , something is going on besides supply and demand , and it could be excessive speculation , " he added .
Proposals have included requiring foreign exchanges to provide more information about crude oil trades , limiting the number of contracts speculators are allowed to hold , increasing the amount of money speculators need to put up to buy an oil contract , and removing speculators from the market entirely and limiting trade to just producers and consumers .
Government regulators said they are monitoring the markets for evidence of manipulation - someone withholding production in an attempt to bid up prices - and are gathering more information on the role speculators play .
" If the CFTC sounds busy , it is , " said Walter Lukken , acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
" This small agency is working hard to protect the public from manipulation and abuse . "
Lukken said the CFTC has just reached an agreement with the IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE ) in London for that exchange to comply with U.S. disclosure rules - basically letting regulators know who is buying oil contracts .
Oil traders say requiring more information from foreign exchanges is a good idea , as markets function better the more transparent they are .
But they urge lawmakers not to hamper speculative trading .
They say big oil users such as refiners or airlines - unable to find a counter party to offset their bets - could send prices higher by hoarding product or through panic buying .
" They have to be very , very careful with what they 're doing here , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago .
" I always worry when politicians think they know better than the market what the price of oil should be . "
Another trader agreed , especially when it comes to doing something such as raising margin requirements , the amount of money traders are required to put up to buy contracts .
" You 're raising the cost of doing business for the people who need the futures market , " Stephen Schork , publisher of the industry newsletter The Schork Report , told CNNMoney.com .
" In the long run , it 's bullish . "
CFTC's Lukken also said raising the margin requirement may have a negative effect .
" Margin ( requirement ) is a very blunt tool , and it could potentially drive markets overseas " where there is even less regulation , said Lukken .
A spokesman for Sen. Durbin said proposals to raise the margin requirements have been removed from legislation after lawmakers listened to concerns from the industry .
The airline industry , a big user of oil , urged Congress to take action .
" Crude oil prices today are unnecessarily high and distorted due , in large part , to market manipulation and excessive speculation , " Jim May , president of the Air Transport Association , said at the hearing .
" The impact of these unprecedented jet fuel prices on the airlines is devastating and airlines may see 2008 losses nearing $ 10 billion , on par with the worst financial year in aviation history . "
May called on Congress to enact more oversight of foreign exchanges , and to " curtail extremely risky investments by pension funds that jeopardize savings for employees across the country . "

I will once again plagiarize myself by transcribing a talk I gave .
First : be warned !
I offer this gesture of respect to you — yes , you ! — when I say that this is at least 20 minutes of reading .
This is long even for me .
If you 're surfing reddit , gobbling up little information snacks , then it 's best to think of this entry as being more like a big downer cow .
Unless you 're really hungry , you should wait for it to be sliced into little bite - sized prion patties before consuming it .
If you do read it , you 'll see the CJD analogy is surprisingly apt .
I ramble even more than usual , and lose my train of thought , and the slides might as well be scenes from a David Lynch movie for all the relation they have to my actual talk .
But once again I find myself astonished at how much I agree with myself , by and large .
Funny how that works .
And I made a few decent jokes here and there .
So I 'm transcribing it .
If you 're impatient , and I would n't blame you a bit , the best part is probably " Static Typing 's Paper Tigers " .
That might be worth reading .
As for the rest ... * shrug *
If you 're really starved for content , you might find some of it entertaining .
I gave this talk at the Google I/O Conference in San Francisco a few weeks ago .
My talk was boringly titled " Server - Side JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine " , and there were initially only about 40 or 50 people in the room ( out of a 2500 - person conference ) when I started the talk .
Even though I personally thought the talk was pretty boring , people kept trickling in , and I estimate there were about 400 people stuffed in the room by the end .
It was standing - room only , and people were spilling out into the hall .
The conclusion ?
The other talks must have been really boring .
After my talk it became pretty clear to me that it should have been titled " Rhinos and Tigers " , so that 's its new name .
I 've tried to make it flow well by splitting it into arbitrary sub-sections , whose titles are n't really part of the talk .
But otherwise it 's pretty much a word - for - word transcription , except with most of the umms and aaaahs elided .
I 've included the subset of the slides that seemed relevant ; you can find the rest at the Google I / O site So enjoy !
Or not .
I 've given you plenty of warnings .
You 'll see !
Hello !
I 'm Steve Yegge .
I work at Google .
I 've been there about three years , and it 's real nice .
I 'm going to be talking about server - side scripting in general , and talking a lot about Mozilla Rhino and the technology behind it .
I 'm going to try to get through it in maybe 20 - 25 minutes , maybe 30 if I start ranting , at which point I 'll open it up for questions .
I kind of want you guys to help drive how this goes .
Make sense ?
( Ed : Well , it made sense at the time .
Sigh . )
All right , cool .
Let 's get started .
Sooo ...
I 'm going to be talking about Server - Side JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine .
Yes .
We 've got this big animal .
Rhino .
So let 's see ... who here has used a JVM language before ?
Oooh !
My god , lots of you , almost all of you .
Great !
Well I 'm going to be talking about Rhino in particular .
I 'll be making reference to other JVM languages .
I want to kind of help you see how this fits into the landscape , why you might use it , why you might not use it .
But for those of you who have n't used a JVM language , the Java Virtual Machine is sort of like .NET : you can run multiple languages on it .
You can write an interpreter in Java , or you can compile your language down to Java bytecode .
Or you can compile it down to your own bytecode ; there are different ways to do it .
But typically these languages are sort of drop - in replacements for Java .
Which means you can implement classes , you can implement interfaces , you can subclass things .
It gives you an alternate syntax and semantic layer on top of the libraries , and on top of the virtual machine .
I 'll assume that this makes sense ... well , actually , I wo n't !
There 's this dude named Walter Bright , who wrote the D programming language , among many other things .
( Raise hand )
Has anyone heard of Walter ?
He 's this really smart dude .
He wrote Symantec Cafe , and the game Empire [ and Zortech C++ ] .
He told me the other day , [ talking about ] one of my blog rants , that he did n't agree with the point that I 'd made that virtual machines are " obvious " .
You know ?
I mean , of course you use a virtual machine !
But he 's a compiler dude , and he says they 're a sham , they 're a farce , " I do n't get it ! "
And so I explained it [ my viewpoint ] to him , and he went : Ohhhhhhh .
Virtual machines are great for language interoperability .
If everybody in the world used his language , then yeah , you probably would n't need a virtual machine .
You 'd probably still want one eventually , because of the just - in - time compilers , and all the runtime information they can get .
But by and large , we do n't all use D .
In fact , we probably do n't all use the same five languages in this room .
And so the VM , whether it's the CLR , or the Java VM , or Parrot , or whatever ... it provides a way for us to interoperate .
Now I 'll tell ya — I was at Foo Camp last summer .
I 've been wanting to tell this story ...
I 'm telling you guys ; it 's the coolest story .
And it 's relevant here .
Heh .
Very relevant .
So I was in this tent ... you know what Foo Camp is ?
It 's O'Reilly 's , you know , riends ' Reilly invite thing that they do each summer .
It 's coming up in a couple of weeks .
And people give presentations ; people show up and just wander into your [ presentation ] tent , and wander back out if they do n't like it .
So I was in this discussion at the very end of the last day , where the Apple LLVM guy Chris [ Lattner ] was hosting a talk on dynamic languages running on different VMs .
And there was the Smalltalk Squeak guy there , and there was Charles Nutter for JRuby and representing the JVM .
John Lam was there for IronRuby and CLR , and there were the Parrot people .
I can't even remember them all , but the whole room was packed with the VM implementors of the VMs today , and people who are implementing languages on top of them .
This was a smart group of people , and well - informed .
And you know , I was like a fly on the wall , thinking man , look at all [ these brains ] .
And Chris , well , he let everybody go around the room and talk about why their VM was the best .
And they were all right !
That 's the weird thing : every single one of them was right .
Their VM was the best for what they wanted their VM to do .
Like , Smalltalk [ Squeak ] 's VM was the best in the sense of being the purest , and it was the cleanest .
Whereas the Java one was the best because , you know , it has Java !
Everybody 's was the best .
Parrot 's was the best because it was vaporware .
Ha !
Ha , ha ha .
Sorry guys .
So !
He [ Chris ] asked this really innocent question .
He goes , " You know , I do n't really know much about this stuff ... "
Which is bad , you know .
When somebody says that to you at Foo Camp , it means they 're settin ' you up .
He says , " So how do these languages talk to each other ?
" And the room just erupted !
It was chaos .
All these people are like , " Oh , it 's easy ! "
And the rest of them are like " No , it 's hard ! "
And they 're arguing , and arguing , and arguing .
They argued for an hour .
And then they stood up , still arguing , and they kept talking about it , heading into the dinner tent .
And they sat down , going at it for like three hours .
It was chaos .
Because some people were saying , " Well , you know , if Ruby 's gonna call Python , well , uh , you just call , right ?
You just share the same stack , right ?
" And the others are like , " Well , what about different calling conventions ?
What if they support optional vs. non-optional arguments ?
What if they support default arguments ?
What about the threading model ?
What about the semantics of , you know , thepointer ?
What about all this stuff ?
" And they 're like ( waving hands ) " Ooooh , we 'll gloss over it , gloss over it , smooth it over . "
And the reply is : " You can 't .
This is fundamental .
These languages work differently !
" And oh my god , it was really interesting .
And it was also very clear that it 's ten years of research and implementation practice before they get this right .
Before you 'll be able to have a stack of calls , where you 're calling from library to function , library to function in different languages .
So today , VMs are good for interoperability , but you 've gotta use a bridge .
Whether it 's JRuby , or Jython , or Rhino , they provide a set of APIs — you know about javax .
script , right ?
It 's this new thing introduced to the JDK , where they try to formalize just a couple of APIs around how you call the scripting language from your language ... you know , it 's a sort of " reverse foreign - function interface " .
And then how they call each other , maybe .
But it 's all done through ... kind of like serialization .
You marshal up your parameters as an array of arguments , and it's a heavyweight call that goes over [ to the script runtime ] and comes back , and it 's like ... it 's a pain !
You do n't want that .
But today , that 's kind of what we 're stuck with .
At least we have that , though , right ?
I mean , try having Ruby call Python today , and they have different FFIs .
You can do it , but you definitely want the VM 's help .
So , Walter , that 's why you need VMs .
So !
Yeah , there 's a lot of stuff I could talk about .
I gave a practice of this talk to Mike Loukides , an editor at O'Reilly , and it completely changed what I wanted to talk about .
I do want to talk about Rhino 's technology ; I want you to come away understanding it .
But more importantly , I want you guys to understand where this fits in this Google conference .
And where it fits in your plans , going forward .
See , it 's really interesting .
We all know , or at least most of us I think agree , that server - side computing is finally starting to make inroads onto the desktop .
Fat clients are n't so much the norm anymore .
You 've got applications like Google Maps , GMail , Google Docs , those kinds of apps , that are doing " desktop quality " applications in the browser , with the server handling your storage .
That 's kind of one of the messages of this conference .
Everybody 's doing it , right ?
It 's not just Google .
And it makes a certain amount of sense , so I 'm not going to go into the reasons why you 'd do that .
I 'm assuming it 's sort of a given .
The interesting thing is this : all applications ... who was it who said " All apps will eventually grow to the point where they can read mail , and if they do n't , they 'll be replaced by ones that can " ?
( audience : " JWZ " ) JWZ ?
Jamie Zawinski .
Yeah .
It 's a variant of somebody else 's quote [ Greg Kuperberg 's ] , but ... So it 's true , right ?
Apps grow .
If you like an app , you 're gonna want to start doing more and more stuff in it .
If you like it a lot , like I like Emacs , heh ... you know , you like your editor .
Everybody here is a programmer , right ?
You all use development environments ?
Do you ever find it kind of annoying that you have to switch from your IDE to your browser ?
Why is n't the IDE the browser too ?
Why are n't these unified ?
I mean , let 's face it : I only run two apps .
Unless I need to run , like , OmniGraffle or the Gimp , or something to do a document , or Keynote here to do the presentation — I just switched to Macs , so I 'm learning all these names , but , this PowerPoint thing — most of the time , when I 'm developing , I 'm running shells , and I 'm running Emacs , and I 'm running a browser .
That 's it !
So you kind of wish they'd be the same .
Well , once they get big enough , your IDE and Emacs and the browser have this thing in common , which is that they are scriptable !
That 's the magic point at which your application becomes sort of alive .
Right ?
Because people can change it , if it does n't work the way they like it .
GreaseMonkey !
Perfect example .
You do n't like our web page that we give you ?
Write a GreaseMonkey script and change it all around , right ?
That 's cool !
Scripting is really important .
I mean , Emacs , it stands for " Editor Macros " , and it started off as a really thin engine , and the whole editor was written in scripts .
And now it 's huge .
It has a million lines or so of Emacs - Lisp code floating around .
So it 's weird ... you go through this transformation , where your scripting languages are originally for , well , scripting .
And it eventually grows into application level / scale development .
OK ?
Now we all see this happening in clients .
Excel , for instance , is scriptable .
And the reason that Excel is so powerful , I mean the reason that you can go to the bookstore and get a book that 's this thick on Excel , and scientific computing people use it , whatever , is that it has a very very powerful scripting engine .
In fact , all of Microsoft Office has it .
Right ?
You can fire up Ruby or Python or Perl , and you can actually control , though the COM interface , you can actually tell IE to open a document and scroll to a certain point in it .
Or you can open up Microsoft Word and actually ...
I mean , if you want to do the work , you could actually get to where you 're typing into your Perl console and it's showing up over in Word .
Server - side computing has to get there .
It 's gonna get there .
But how many server - side apps are user scriptable today ?
Precious few .
Google has a couple , you know , like our JotSpot acquisition , which is [ scriptable ] in Rhino ... So we 're talking about something that 's kind of new .
I mean , we can all see it coming !
But it 's still kind of new , the idea , right ?
Why ?
Because this is scary hard , from a security perspective .
Heh .
You 're going to run code on my servers ?
Uh ... OK ... I mean , Yahoo !
Store , you know , Paul Graham 's Viaweb that went on to become Yahoo !
Store .
People have done it , right ?
I wrote a game that was really cool .
Scriptable !
I mean , high school kids were teaching themselves to program so they could write areas and monsters and spells and quests for this game that I wrote , which was written in Java and scriptable in Jython .
It 's a big deal !
I mean , people want to be able to write these apps .
However , I had to live with the fact that I did n't personally have enough bandwidth to come up with a decent security model to keep them from ... it 's a trust - based security model in my game .
They write a script , they could erase my hard disk , right ?
So I 've got to be very careful , and recognize that I can only let certain people that I trust do it .
And that I 've got to be prepared for really big disasters .
Because also there 's denial - of - service .
It 's inadvertent : oh , their script is taking up all the bandwidth [ or CPU or memory ] on my server , and everybody else in the game is paralyzed .
Right ?
I mean , how do you deal with it ?
You 've got to deal with user [ i.e. , programmer ] throttling : memory usage , the database or datastore usage , like Amazon 's computing cloud , you know , they have a lot of this stuff in place .
But usually it 's pretty coarse - grained when it gets started , right ?
You get a box , and a certain amount of disk storage , and you get the whole CPU , because how are you gonna allocate CPUs out to people when the languages themselves that are being used for scripting do n't support that ?
We 're getting there ; it 's happening .
But it 's new .
And it 's hard .
Because you do n't want people to be able to go and get access to your company 's proprietary code or resources and wreak havoc .
You just want to host their computing .
So when you decide you 're going to take your server - side application , with its beautiful Ajax app talking to the server , and now you want open it up : to add extensibility for your end users — they 're not just scripting the client ; there 's scripting happening on the server that 's theirs — you have to make a decision !
Namely , what language are you going to give them ?
We have ... see , unfortunately it 's hard for me to talk about Google products , because all I know are their internal code names , and not their launch names .
I can never remember them .
But we have ... something like that .
Heh .
Called ...
Prometheus , I think ?
Uh , wha ... what is it ?( audience member : Google App Engine )
Ahem , the Google App Engine , of course !
Yes .
The Google App Engine .
Ahem .
Yes . ( me : embarrassed )
And I think it 's ...
Python .
Right now .
But of course they want to open it up , because , it 's like , you do n't really want to force people to switch editors , unless you want a real fight on your hands .
You kinda do n't really want to force people to switch languages either , right ?
People want to use whatever they 're comfortable with .
So again , you wind up with this hosted environment , where you 're supporting multiple languages ; which one do you pick [ first ] ?
They picked Python .
You can pick [ anything ] , but you 've got these problems to deal with .
And I 'm going to argue today that Rhino is actually a really good choice for this particular problem space .
OK , we 've got people pooling up in the back here .
Is it time to invite them in ?
Come on in , sit down , there 's space !
All right , cool .
Yeah .
Welcome !
So yeah .
That 's what I 'm talking about today .
Do you guys understand the perspective now , the context ?
I 'm talking about server - side scripting , that either you do yourself inside your company , because you feel like you 've got some logic that needs to be kind of " glue " logic — " scripting " — or , more importantly , you 're opening it up to your users .
Which means you need to sandbox it , and you need to meter it and throttle it .
All right .
Yeah .
So this is a JVM language .
A JVM language can share the Java libraries , and the Java Virtual Machine .
It 's really cool , right ?
And really powerful .
Right off the bat , these JVM implementations of other languages , like JRuby vs. Ruby , Jython vs. Python , right ?
They get all these free benefits , that may not necessarily exist in the C runtimes for these languages .
Example ?
Java has a really good garbage collector these days .
A generational garbage collector that 's becoming an incremental [ and / or concurrent ] generational garbage collector ...
I mean , it 's good !
Whereas for a lot of these [ C - based ] languages , they use mark - and - sweep , reference - counting ... Another one is native threads .
It 's veeery nice to have native threads , and also have well - defined semantics for the threads and how they interact with the memory model .
I mean , a lot of these [ non - JVM ] languages are like , " Well , we have threads , but you probably ... do n't want to use them . "
Because you 're kind of on your own .
So what happens is people use process - switching ; it 's the share - nothing model .
And that 's great too , for certain situations .
Provided you 've got good engineering library support around it , like the java.util concurrency libraries .
They can help you design something without having to do a formal proof around it to get it to work .
That helps a lot in multicore .
It helps !
JavaScript has no [ language - level ] threads , because Brendan Eich says " over his dead body " .
I totally understand where he 's coming from on this , right ?
There 's certainly the " promise " of better concurrency out there .
Erlang , you know , and maybe STM ... But hey man , today ?
I mean , right now ?
You want to write something with high throughput , and you 've got a lot of I / O to do , and it 's parallelizable ?
And you want to get a lot of throughput on one box , because it 's got multiple cores ?( shrugging )
Well , threads get the job done .
So if you 've got it in your so - called " scripting language " , it 's a big win .
We 've got garbage collection , threads ... and asynchronous I /O , right ?
When Java first came out there was the whole " one thread per socket " model [ actually , two ] , which meant that you could n't write a webserver that could handle ten thousand concurrent requests .
It did n't matter how much memory or CPU your box had .
Anyone here ever tried to fire up 10,000 threads on one box ?
Yeah ... yeah .
What happens is , the scheduler and task - switching resources for managing the threads swamp your machine .
So eventually Java wrote a wrapper around the Unix or Windows or whatever native interfaces so you could get super - high throughput .
So all of the sudden , by sticking something on the JVM ...
Sure , you initially get a bit of a hit in performance .
When these people first port a language to the Java Virtual Machine , it 's usually about twice as slow , right ?
BUT , it 's got async I/O , and it 's got [ native ] threads , and it 's got better non-pausing ( by and large ) garbage collection .
And from there , they can make it smarter .
But they 've also got the JIT .
I do n't know , I mean , did anybody here ...
I gave a talk on dynamic languages recently at Stanford , but I do n't want to rehash that if you guys already know about that .
Basically I argued in that talk — successfully at Stanford , so I think that was ... something — that for just - in - time compilers , it 's becoming pretty clear , they have a lot better access , a lot better data at runtime about how you 're actually using your program right now than the compiler ever had .
So the JITs can do all kinds of inlining and optimizations that you just can't do in a compiler .
And what that means is that everybody running on this VM gets to benefit from the JIT .
So there are lots of advantages to these JVM languages .
Or .NET , if you happen to be using Microsoft stuff .
It 's a good model .
So why Rhiiiiino ?
Why JavaScript ?( loudly )
Who here thinks JavaScript is kind of icky ?
Come on , come on , be honest .
Yeah , there we go , a couple of people .
Yeah .
Yeahhhh ... and you know what ?
It is !
Right ?
Because , well , because of vendor implementation issues .
That 's one [ reason ] .
Also , Brendan was kind of forced to rush it out the door .
You guys know ... back at Netscape , when they built JavaScript , it was called , um , LiveScript ?
And Brendan was building Scheme for the browser .
Scheme !
Everyone in here who knows Scheme , raise your hand .
( Many people , at least fifty , raise their hands . )
Holy ... smokes !
A lot more than I would 've guessed .
Wow .OK , well , as it happens , you guys are not " representative " .
( laughter )
And so , Netscape kinda looked at it , and said : " Yeah , well , we did say Scheme , but , uh , there 's this Java thing , this giant marketing thing , and we want to be involved with it . "
And some back - door deals happened , and then they came to Brendan and said : " Make it look like Java .
" So now it 's Scheme with Java syntax , right ?
So he had to pull a lot of all - nighters for a couple of weeks , and he came up with JavaScript .
So , you know , it 's got some flaws .
Some of which make you want to go scrape your teeth on the sidewalk because it 's less painful .
So it 's true , but what language does n't have some flaws ?
The interesting thing about Rhino , which is an implementation of JavaScript in Java , is that there 's only one language .
You do n't have to worry about vendor - implementation or cross- platform problems because ... it 's just Rhino .
So right out of the starting gate , that 's a win .
Plus , Rhino gives you the ability to work around some of the problems .
A classic one is the problem in JavaScript where you can't define non-enumerable properties .
Right ?
You know how you can go , and it'll enumerate the keys of your object as if it were a hashtable .
Nice feature , right ?
And you can add properties to objects ; you can go to , which is the root object of the whole system , and add your own function ( s ) there .
But what happens is , you 've added a function that 's now enumerable in everybody 's arrays , and everybody 's data structures , so theirloops break .
Which means that fundamentally you can't install a library that 's completely seamless and emulates Ruby or Python or some other really expressive set of library functions .
Like , you want yourand , and your , and ... you know what I mean ?
You can't do it in browser JavaScript , so people wind up going different routes .
They either do what Prototype does , and just install it , and you 're screwed if you use , but you do n't use , right ?
Or they use functions .
They do n't use object - oriented programming .
And you know , functional programming is great and everything , but OOP , as we 've discovered in programming in the large , is a nice organizational tool .
Putting the function or method together with the thing that it 's operating on is a nice way of organizing things .
So it 's kind of unfortunate when you have to use functions , because if you have to say , you know , , it gets inverted with functions : .
You have to call from the innermost one to the outermost ... it's " backwards " , right ?
Rhino winds up getting around that problem completely .
We did , anyway , internally .
Because it 's written in Java .
So you can call the Rhino interface .
You can call Parser , or the interpreter , or the runtime ; you can do whatever you want .
So I wrote this littlefunction , that 's like five lines of code .
It calls into the script runtime Java class that implements JavaScript objects , which has a non-enumerable JavaScript has non-enumerable properties ; it just does n't let you add your own .
It 's just a language flaw , right ?
That [ function ] enabled us , in the project I 'm going to be talking about a little bit later here , to implement all of Ruby and Python 's runtime — all the functions we liked — in [ server - side ] JavaScript , in a non-intrusive way .
We were also able to implement a class system , and all this other stuff .
So Rhino is not browser JavaScript .
Man , we 've got more people pooling up at the entrances .
You guys are welcome to come in , squeeze in and sit down ... come on in ... welcome .
There 's still space .
Especially up here kinda in the front , in the middle , where nobody wants to sit .
But trust me , it 's better there .
So yeah .
Rhino 's history : it 's like ten years old .
Or more ?
More than ten years , maybe .
It started inside Netscape , side by side with SpiderMonkey .
A lot of people have been hacking on it .
Rhino 's pretty robust .
I have a question for ya .
I did this " JVM shootout " like three and a half years ago .
I was kind of tired of using Java for scripting , and I wanted to look at all the JVM languages .
So I did this game .
You know about the game Sokoban ?
I would have done Sudoku if the craze had hit then .
It 's a little dude who pushes these blocks around these mazes ?
Well , I reimplemented this thing , which is about , you know , six or seven hundred lines of Java code .
It had a [ user ] interface , and a little search algorithm that had him chase your mouse .
It was just big enough of an application that I could reimplement it in like 10 different languages , and actually compare how it was speed - wise , how to use them [ the languages ] , how well they interoperated with Java ... it was an actual apples - to - apples comparison .
Most of them really , really , REALLY stank .
It was baaaad .
I mean , there are like 250 JVM languages out there , but most of them are just complete toys .
But there were ten or so that were actually pretty good .
You could do anything in them , and they had decent performance , and they were good , right ?
And it [ the shootout ] kind of petered out , because it started looking like Rhino - JavaScript was going to win .
I had this sort of solution selection matrix of criteria where ... it was kind of a heuristic function where I weighted all these terms , right ?
Just to kind of get a feel for which one [ was best ] .
And I wanted JRuby to win .
You should never go into these comparisons wanting one of them to win , because , you know , you 're either going to bias it or you 're gonna be disappointed .
JRuby at the time was really slow .
It 's much faster now , and everything , but at the time , it was so new .
Jython was good , but it was n't fast enough , and the author of Jython had gone off to greener pastures .
Rhino !
Rhino had good tools , and it had good performance , and it was ...
JavaScript !
Eeeeww !
So I never even really ...
I published it , but I did n't leave it up .
I 'm actually going to bring it back up again soon ; I 'm going to update it and do a couple of new languages .
Because I find this an eternally fascinating question , which is : what is the next big language , especially on the JVM , going to be ?
Java will always have a place .
But I think there are domains , like Java Swing , you know ?
The Java GUI stuff ?
Java 's really not very good for that .
We 've kind of figured out that Object - Oriented Programming does n't work that well for UIs .
You want it to be declarative .
HTML showed that you want a dialog , with a title bar , and a body , and it nests , to match the [ UI ] tree .
That works really well .
It 's succinct .
Even in HTML it 's succinct , right ?
Whereas with a [ Java - style ] object - oriented language , you 've got to say , you know , , ' til the cows come home .
And it does n't look anything like ... you can't pattern - match it and say " ah yes !
this looks just like my UI !
" So people write these wrappers around Swing .
Like there 's Apache Jelly , which wound up with this XML framework to do Swing programming , that was 30 % less verbose than Java .
What are the odds that XML 's going to wind up being less verbose than anything ?
( loud laughter ) Really !
I mean , I was shocked .
30 % less verbose .
And I looked at it , too .
They were n't cheating .
I mean , they did the best Swing implementation in Java that they could , but Jelly was better .
So there are domains for which Java is just not appropriate .
But you still maybe want to use a VM for all the reasons that I outlined earlier .
So yeah !
There 's room for these other languages .
But which one ?
All of them ?
Are they going to solve the problem I brought up from Foo Camp earlier ?
To where it does n't matter which language you 're using ; they can call each other , and [ mix however you like ? ]
I mean , how 's your editor going to feel about that ?
How 's your team member going to feel about it ?
A lot of people do n't like learning new languages .
Who here does n't like learning new languages ?
Come on , be honest ... ( A few people raise hands ) Yeah !
New languages .
No fun !
It 's actually kind of ... you should try it .
( laughter )
You know ?
It is .
It 's a good idea .
There 's this dude — has everyone heard of The Little Schemer ?
The Little Schemer , The Seasoned Schemer The Reasoned Schemer ?
Cool books , right ?
Teach you functional programming in this really bizarre format that hooks you in .
Dan Friedman , the guy who [ was ] one of the collaborators on those books — I was reading an article he wrote .
Early in his career he realized that languages are fundamental to computer science and to engineering ; they 're really important .
And he wanted to be able to learn a new language every quarter .
And after he did that for a while , he said , you know what ?
I want to learn a new language every week .
OK ?
And you can actually get to the point where you can do this .
Now it probably takes 2 - 3 months before you 're actually as comfortable with the new language as you were with your favorite old one .
This happened to me with JavaScript ; I was freaking out for the first couple of months , thinking " this is never gonna work " .
But eventually you get over the hump , and you 're like ( relieved sigh ) " aaaah , yes . "
Right ?
You learn how to work around the problems .
It 's just like learning Java or whatever your first language happened to be .
You 've got to learn your way around all these problems , and you 've gotta learn how things work , and how the libraries are laid out .
And all of the sudden it becomes like breathing .
So Dan Friedman , after he said he was learning a language a week , I thought , " wow , that 's pretty macho . "
But he said , nah , that was n't good enough : he wanted to be able to implement a language a week .
And he got pretty serious about it .
Spent years researching how to do this effectively .
( Well , now I 'm just speculating – Ed. ) This is where I 'd love to see engineers today .
Knowing languages will make you a better programmer .
It will !
It will even if you 're not using them .
Just write a little application in it , and it opens your mind .
[ Each new one ] opens your mind .
And now suddenly you know the superset of all the languages out there .
So it 's not scary to learn new ones .
And you can also recognize situations where a language is actually the right tool for the job .
Not a library , not a framework , not some new object or some new interface .
A language !
Case in point ?
Regular expressions .
( raise hand )
Who likes to write their own giant deterministic finite automata to do string matching ?
Heh .
It 's weird — nobody raised their hand .
Who likes to do lots and lots of manual DOM manipulations , as opposed to , say , XPath ?
XPath is a language , right ?
DOM manipulations , you know ... it depends , but usually , no : not if you can get away with using a language for it .
I could talk for hours about that , so I 'm not going to .
But , you know ... it 's good to learn new languages .
So I 'm gonna teach you JavaScript today .
I 'm gonna dive in .
So let 's go !
Oh yeah .
So unit testing .
I mean , like , all the other stuff on this slide is like " blah blah blah " , but then Unit Testing [ in Rhino ] — this was a real surprise to me .
I write a lot of Java code day to day , [ out of the ] probably five different languages I code in regularly .
And unit testing was always a chore .
Unit testing is a chore .
I mean , come ON .
Unit testing 's a chore , right ?
( raise hand )
Who here thinks unit tests are just a poor man 's static type system ?
Eh ? ( some laughter ) Yeah !
Well , not really , since you have to write unit tests for them [ the static languages ] too .
( more laughter ) You need to write unit tests , and unfortunately in Java it's .
I 'm speaking into the mic now , so that everybody can hear .
Unit testing in Java is painful !
It 's so painful that people , the Java ... community , the Java world , has evolved around it .
OK ?
They 've said : " Do n't use constructors .
Constructors are baaaaad . " ( pointed pause ) I mean ... what !?
( laughter ) I mean , like , if you program in Ruby , say , you know that you can actually change the way the metaclass produces objects .
So if you want it to be a singleton , or you want it to meet certain ... you want it to be a Mock object , you just replace thefunction on the fly , and you 've got yourself a Mock constructor , right ?
But Java 's set in stone !
So they use factories , which leads to this proliferation of classes .
And you have to use a " Dependency Injection Framework " to decouple things , right ?
And it 's just , like , ( panting ) ...
We were doing business logic early on in Java .
When Java came out , it was like : " Ooooh , it 's a lot easier to write C code " , basically , or C ++.
Rather than focusing on your memory allocation strategy , or which of your company 's six conflictingclasses you 're gonna use , you get to focus on " business logic " .
But unfortunately that only took you so far .
Now you 're focusing on Mock object frameworks .
It [ Java ] only took you a little farther .
Now I swear , man , doing Mock objects in Rhino is so easy !
It 's easier , even , than in JRuby or in Jython , because JavaScript has JSON .
I did n't even know , like , the name of it when I started doing this , right ?
But JSON ... I 've gotta show you guys this .
This is so cool .
( flipping through slides ) Yeah , tools , blah blah blah .
We 'll come back to it .
Oh , it 's way down in here .
Urrggh .
Come on ... here 's one !
OK .
Down on the bottom we 've got some code here .
Actually on the top , too .
So I do awith a , and , uh ... it sure looks a lot like Java code , huh ?
This is one advantage of JavaScript , actually .
Java ... Script , right ?
Ten years later it 's finally becoming the scripting language for Java ?
So that syntax ( with an obj literal following ) is a little weird , but there 's another one here that says :
So I 've declared an object literal , using " JSON style " .
Now JSON does n't let you do — does JSON let you do functions ?
Probably not , right ?
But I mean , fundamentally you 're doing this declarative property - value list , right ?
And so what I 've got is this anonymous thing that has a named " run " property whose value is a function !
That prints " hi " .
And now I can create a new , with a newthat wraps it , and what effectively I 've done is I 've used that thing as theinterface [ implementation ] , which expects a function called " run " that takes no arguments and does whatever the thread 's supposed to do .
This is how you do mock objects !
I have this huuuge legacy system , right ?
With hundreds of static methods .
Static methods are also bad these days , right ?
Noooo static methods .
' Cuz they 're not mockable .
Right ?
Java has changed Java .
Because Java 's not unit -testable .
So now you can't just go to the store and [ buy a book and ] learn Java .
You have to learn all these ... fashions .
You have to learn what 's in vogue .
Subclassing !in vogue right now .
You talk about subclassing , and people are like " NNnnnnnooooo , you should use manual delegation even though it 's really hard and cumbersome and awkward .
" And you 're like , " but I just want to change this one method , and plus it 's built into the language , and there 's syntax for it , and it 's kind of well - understood ... "
And they just say " NO !
" It 's out of favor .
For similar reasons .
Oh my god ... And I 'm telling ya : the reason unit testing is easy , is , fundamentally , the way you develop in a dynamic language is different from the way you develop in a static language : C++ , Java ...
OCaml , Scala , whatever .
Your favorite static language .
To a large extent , especially in C++ and Java , the way you develop is :
So it 's this batch cycle , right ?
1950s .
Submit your punch cards , please .
In a dynamic language — and this is clearest when you 're writing in Emacs Lisp [ because of thebuffer ] — but it 's somewhat clear when you 're developing in a console , in Python or Ruby , Perl , Lua , whatever , you write an expression , and you give it some mock data .
You 're writing a function , you 're building it on the fly .
And when it works [ for that mock data ] , you 're like , " Oh yeah , it works ! "
You do n't run it through a compiler .
You copy it and paste it into your unit test suite .
That 's one unit test , right ?
And you copy it into your code , ok , this is your function .
So you 're actually proving to yourself that the thing works by construction .
Proooof by construction .
Obviously you still need your unit tests ( er , I meant integration tests – Ed. ) , because there 's going to be higher - order semantics , you know , calling conventions between classes and methods ... Whew !
This room is really filling up .
Um , is there anything we can do to help here , guys in the back ?
( Tech guy says something inaudible in the video ) Yeah , please !
There 're more seats here .
I just want to ...
I do n't want to get to where people can't even make it into the room .
Yeah , so unit testing .
I know you guys all hate unit testing .
So did I .
Or you say , " I looooove unit testing , " but then , you know , your test coverage is still sitting at like 80 % .
I 'm telling you , man , this is a huge , huge thing .
It changes the way you do your development .
And oh , yeah ...
I 'm going to be talking shortly here about Rhino on Rails , which is this thing that I did ... it 's not Rhino on Rails , actually .
It 's actually , I called it " Rhino 's not Ruby " .
Because I got kinda burned at Google for using Ruby .
Yeah .
Uh , for good reasons , good reasons .
But they were like : " No . " And so of course I called it " Rhino 's not Ruby " : RnR .
Because people know JavaScript ; they 're kinda comfortable with JavaScript , so they were OK with it .
So I had to port Rails ; it was kind of a lot of work , but , you know , well it works !
We 're using it here internally ; it 's nice .
I mean , I actually know it 's nice , because six months went by and I did n't look at it for those six months .
And for this recent project , I picked it up , and I was , like , is this gonna be gross ?
But actually , it 's really pretty nice .
Because you 've got all the Java libraries , and all the integration with Google stuff .
It 's cool .
I 'll try to open - source it this year , if I forget to say that later on .
Anyway , I was writing unit tests for this thing , and ... uh ... ( I completely blow my stack .
Who am I ?
Where am I ? ) Have I lost where I am on the slides ?
( Duh . ) I 've diverged from the slides .
I 'll come back to RnR shortly .
Basically , I got unit - testing religion .
That 's the end of that sort of stack .
If you can do it easily , and you do n't have to rewrite your application to be unit -testable ?
Man .
That 's a big difference .
So why would you not use Rhino for server - side scripting ?
Well , it 's not super - duper fast right now .
It 's on the order of about twice as slow as Java , depending on what you 're doing .
So if it really has to be super , super fast — use C ++!
Right ?
Naaaah , you can use Java .
Like I was saying the other day [ at Stanford ] , it 's widely admitted inside of Google — there 's this whole discussion , is Java as fast as C++ , right ?
And Google Java developers definitely admit that it 's as fast as C ++.
The C++ people , well ... yeah .
( sigh ) Let 's see ... if you 're writing a library , then Rhino 's actually not so good right now .
There is no standard library interface for scripting languages .
We have n't got there yet .
It 's all , it 's all related to what I told you about before , you know the calling interop .
A lot of these [ languages ] have their own package systems : their own , their own , right ?
So if you 're gonna write a library , you should probably still write it in Java .
Maybe .
If you 're doing a framework , where you 're defining how things are called : whether we 're calling you , or you 're calling us , then it 's OK .
And if you really hate JavaScript , then that 's , you know , that 's fine ...
But keep in mind , again , that you may be providing something for your end - users .
If you go out to a high school and you survey people , and you ask , " So what language are you learning ?
How are you teaching yourself programming ? "
It 's a sure bet that a lot of them are doing Ajax stuff .
Right ?
A lot of them are doing JavaScript .
If you want to make your end - users happy , and you want to immediately capture a very big user base , then no matter how you detest JavaScript ( and again , Rhino - JavaScript 's really not as bad as browser JavaScript , it 's much better ) , your users probably will prefer it .
It 's something to keep in mind .
All right .
And then we 've got Scala .
I 've gotta mention Scala .
Who here knows ... you 've heard of Scala ?
Yeah ?
( a few hands go up ) Mmmmm , yeah , getting there ... looks like some people , OK .
Scala is a very strongly typed language for the JVM .
It 's from researchers in Switzerland ; they 're professors .
It 's from sort of the same school of thought that static typing has evolved with over the last fifteen years in academia : Haskell , SML , Caml , these sorts of H -M functional languages .
And Scala 's interesting because it actually takes a functional static type system and it layers ... it merges it with Java 's object - oriented type system , to produce ....
Frankenstein's Monster .
I 've got the language spec here in my backpack .
Oh , my god ...
I mean , like , because it 's getting a little bit of momentum , right ?
So I figure I 've got to speak from a position of sort of knowledge , not ignorance , when I 'm dissing it .
( Heh heh . )
And so before , I was like : " Oh yeah , Scala !
Strongly typed .
Could be very cool , very expressive !
" The ... the the the ... the language spec ... oh , my god .
I 've gotta blog about this .
It 's , like , ninety percent [ about the type system ] .
It 's the biggest type system you 've ever seen in your life , by 5 x .
Not by an order of magnitude , but man !
There are type types , and type type types ; there 's complexity ... They have this concept called Meaning it 's not just complexity ; it 's not just complexity - complexity : it 's parameterized complexity - complexity .
( mild laughter ) OK ?
Whoo !
I mean , this thing has types on its types on its types .
It 's gnarly .
I 've got this Ph.D. languages intern whose a big Haskell fan , and [ surprisingly ] a big Scheme fan , and an ML fan .
[ But especially Haskell . ]
He knows functional programming , he knows type systems .
I mean , he 's an expert .
He looked at Scala yesterday , and he told me : " I 'm finding this rather intimidating .
" I 'm like , " THAT sounds like it 's gonna take off ! " ( loud laughter )
Oh yeah !
But the funny thing about Scala , the really interesting thing — you guys are the first to hear my amazing insight on this , OK ? — is : it 's put the Java people in a dilemma .
There 's a reeeeeeeal problem .
The problem is , the Java people say , " Well , dynamic languages , you know , suck , because they do n't have static types . "
Which is kind of circular , right ?
But what they mean , is they say :
No good tools , no good performance .
But even if you say , look , the tools and performance can get as good , they say , " Well , static types can help you write safer code !
" It 's ... you guys know about those talismans ?
The ones , where , " What 's it for ? " " To keep tigers away " ?
( some chuckling ) Yeah ?
And you know , people are like , " How do you know it keeps tigers away ? "
And your reply is : ( sneering ) " Do you see any tigers around here ! ? " ( minor laughter )
So this is what ...
OK , so for a long time , for many years ... and you know , I 've written more Java code than most Java programmers ever will .
( Editor 's note : nearly 1 M lines in production .
Ouch . )
So trust me .
I tried .
OK ?
I 'm not just coming in and saying " I do n't want to learn Java . "
No . I know Java as well as the next person .
But I come to them and say , let 's do proof by – say , argument by example !
You know , an existence proof .
IMDB is written in Perl , right ?
Yahoo !
– many of their properties are written in PHP .
A lot of Microsoft stuff 's written in VB , right ?
ASP .NET ?
Amazon.com 's portal site is Perl / Mason .
A lot of companies out there are building big , scalable systems – and I mean scalable in the sense of throughput and transactions , stuff like that , but also scalable in terms of human engineering — in these dynamic languages with no static types .
[ Using nothing more than good engineering principles . ]
So ... is n't that a demonstration that you do n't need the static types to keep those tigers away ?
And they 're like : " Well !
But !
What if ... what if a tiger came ? " ( laughter ) Right ?
" People need shotguns in their house in case a bear comes through the door , right ? "
The Simpsons made fun of that .
( laughing continues ) Yeah .
So , you know , for a long time , I was like : " Yeah , yeah , yeah .
OK .
So tigers could come .
Fine .
" Scala , now , is the tiger that 's going to kill Java .
Because their [ type- talisman ] argument now has become a paradox , similar to the Paul Graham Blub Paradox thing , right ?
Because they 're like , " Well , we need static typing in order to engineer good systems .
It 's simply not possible otherwise .
" The Scala people come in and they go : " Your type system suuuuuucks .
It 's not sound .
It 's not safe .
It 's not complete .
You 're casting your way around it .
It does n't actually prevent this large class of bugs .
How many times have you writtenin Java ?
Our type system does n't allow [ things like ] that .
" Our type system does what you said your type system was doing .
So , therefore , you should be using it !
∴ And the Java people look at it and go : " Wehellll ... ( cough cough ) ...
I mean , yeah , I mean ... ( * ahem * ) " ( running finger under collar , as if sweating profusely )
They say , " Welllll ... you know ... it 's awfully ... cummmmmbersome ... I ... " " We can actually get around the problems in practice that you guys say your type system is solving through Good Engineering Practices . " ( laughter begins to grow ) HA !!!
( I point accusingly at the audience , and there 's more laughter ) Yeah .
So Scala is creating a real problem for [ Java 's ] static typing camp now .
Because their last little bastion of why they 're using it , the whole tigers argument , they 're like , " Ah , well ... we ... we keep shotguns in our house . "
[ This is what they 've been reduced to .
]
OK ?
Yeeeeahhhh ... So back to dynamic languages !
But my point was — from a previous slide actually — it 's very interesting .
See , I wrote this Rails port , and it was n't ...
I never got it to where it was quite as succinct as Rails , because JavaScript has curly braces and a little bit of extra syntactic cruft .
But it was close !
And then we used this framework to build this web app internally .
It was for external consumption .
It 's kind of a long story that I wo n't go into .
But we had like 20 engineers on this thing , for close to a year .
And we had a huge application .
I mean in terms of user functionality : Ajax - enabled pages , server - side persistence stuff ... it was a big app .
And it was , like 40,000 lines of code , including the templates and the client - side JavaScript .
The whole thing !
OK ?
I mean , you add in unit tests , you know , you add in everything , including build files and stuff , and this thing was up to like , maybe 55,000 lines of code .
Thousand .
I mean , Java programmers would be saying , " We have n't hit 55 million yet .
( Looking at feet ) But , well ... we 're gonna . " ( laughter )
And it 's like , I tell 'em that ( shaking head ) , I tell 'em that , and they 're like : " Well . " ( avoiding eye contact ) That 's what they say .
" Well .
" And that 's , you know , that 's pretty much it .
( laughter ) So unfortunately we have thirteen minutes left .
I 'm sorry .
So let 's really quickly go through some of the really cool things about Rhino , the technology here .
You can JavaScript from Java , and Java from JavaScript .
Guess which one 's easier ?
Obviously calling Java from JavaScript is easier , because Java 's really cumbersome .
It does n't have anything to help you , so you have to do basically what I was talking about with Swing earlier .
You know .
You 've got all this stuff on the Java side .
' cuz it 's Java .
But , uh ... but it works !
And you can do both directions .
Here 's an example of a Java program to bootstrap ... actually I believe this is completely standalone ; it works out of the box .
It 's a Rhino Demo : This is what you need to do to create a JavaScript object calledthat has a function called .
A property called " " , sorry , whose value is " hello " .
So what you do is you call , which sets up the JavaScript runtime .
You only have to do it once .
And then you callto create a new JavaScript object .
And then you callto evaluate it in the context of this object .
It 's one example of how you do it , but it 's not too hard .
You can call back and forth .
So that means that anything that was written in JavaScript that you feel , oh Gosh this really needs to be componentized , you need to stick it down in a Java library for whatever reason : you can do it !
You can migrate code back and forth between the JavaScript layer and the Java layer .
This is true for all JVM languages , I think .
Uh ... this is the actual code that I was referring to earlier , where you can define non-enumerable properties .
I called it .
There 's some closure stuff going on here ...
I do n't want to bore you guys .
( Editor 's note : based on Douglas Crockford 's original ) Runtime delegation : this is one of the reasons unit testing is really easy .
You guys know about Smalltalk , uh , method - missing ?
[ actually ]
It 'sin Ruby .
It 's the ... if you call an object — I think Objective C probably has something like this too
You call an object , and you say : " I 'm calling " , and it says : " I do n't have a " .
Right ?
Normally , what happens when you do this ?
In Java it goes * BARF * .
As it should , probably ... unless what you really wanted to do was delegate to some other object .
Right ?
" Design Patterns " .
Say you want to write a Bridge that says : " Oh !
You 're calling , but you do n't want to call it on me .
You want to go to the game server , call it there , marshal it , send it back .
We 'll pretend it 's a remote method call .
" Right ?
There 's a lot of stuff you 've got to go through in Java to do stuff like this .
In JavaScript — as you all know , if you 're using dynamic languages ... Man , we 've got a huge pool of people in the back .
It 's getting pretty rough .
But we 're almost out of time !
Fortunately .
Heh .OK , so let me tell you a little bit about embedded XML .
It 's kind of interesting , kinda neat .
This is supported in Firefox , in some browsers .
It 's a spec that Adobe and some other people , BEA , put together And it 's cool !
Because you can say stuff likeNow of course there 's this weird , big religious debate going on , between JSON advocates and XML advocates .
It 's weird !
They 're , like , locking horns .
When I was a kid — when I was a kid , jeez ...
When I was twenty , it feels like when I was a kid — I used to have tropical fish .
And my brothers and I noticed two things about tropical fish .
One is that they die , because we 're not in the tropics .
( some laughter ) Sad .
And the other is that if you put a bunch of different species of tropical fish in a tank together , they ignore each other ... except for the ones that are the same [ or nearly the same ] species .
They bite each other .
That 's what they do .
Fish bite each other .
They have a pecking order , right ?
JSON and XML are muscling in on each others ' space , and there are bristles , OK , and it 's so silly !
It 's silly .
The whole thing , right ?
I mean , XML is better if you have more text and fewer tags .
And JSON is better if you have more tags and less text .
Argh !
I mean , come on , it 's that easy .
But you know , there 's a big debate about it .
Nevertheless , sometimes XML is appropriate [ in JavaScript ] , especially if you 're loading it from a file or whatever .
These literals are interesting .
And so it provides new operators and new syntax for actually going in and ... it 's kind of like XPath .
Except it 's JavaScript-y .
And I tell you : it is the worst documented thing on the planet !
It 's horrible , man , working with E4X initially .
But ... eventually you can figure it out .
And I have a document that hopefully I 'll be ready to release pretty soon , that actually covers it pretty well .
And Adobe has some good documentation for it .
And then eventually it clicks , like learning any other language .
This is a minilanguage .
And you go : " Ha , I get it !
I get it .
It 's not as crazy and dumb as I thought .
It actually works .
" It 's kind of a neat feature .
You guys know other languages that embed XML ?
Scala does .
I do n't see all of you using that , but C# 3 , I think , does XML ?
Coming [ soon ] ?
( Editor 's note : it 's apparently been deprioritized by the C# team , although VB 9 has them . )
Anyway , it 's kind of an interesting approach .
All right .
So this is Rhino .
Now you know .
After I explain this diagram , you 'll know what you need to know about Rhino to talk to other people about it .
You start with some JavaScript code .
It goes to a parser .
That turns it into a tree .
A syntax tree .
Rhino 's parser today , currently , immediately begins the next step of rewriting it as code generation .
Right away , as it's parsing .
Now this is a problem .
Because if it takes an if - statement or a switch - statement or a for - loop , and it generates sort of assembly - language like jumps to targets ?
And generates labels , you know , converts it into sort of three - address code , that 's eventually going to actually become three - address code : assembly or bytecode .
Then it kind of sucks if you 're trying to use the parse tree for your IDE .
To , like , syntax highlight , or pretty - print , or show errors and warnings , or whatever .
Unfortunately a lot of languages — most languages — do this because they 're written by compiler guys and compiler gals .
And they do n't see the value .
But unfortunately we 're all doing more and more processing of code .
Language tools , right ?
Frontend stuff .
So I rewrote Rhino 's parser recently , and I 'm currently fixing the code generator .
And I 'm gonna get it out into the Rhino mainstream in a couple of weeks here .
Because my project at Google is doing a lot of code processing .
And it 's a faithful representation .
So if your big beef about Rhino is that there 's no Visitor over the AST : I 'm fixing that .
And then there are two paths here : you see one on the left that goes code generator to bytecode .
And there 's the bytecode , or pseudo - bytecode , for the JavaScript code up there .
And then it goes to an interpreter .
The interpreter is a big loop .
Bytecode is this [ roughly ] postorder traversal of the tree , that flattens it in a way that allows you to push onto a stack to evaluate the operands .
It 's all actually very important ; you should go read up on how it works if you 're not familiar with it , or if you 've forgotten since you first learned it .
And the interpreter is actually pretty fast , because it 's a loop .
There 's not a lot of calling out .
I mean , there are some calls out into the runtime , but mostly it 's this loop : push , pop , push , pop .
So the JIT picks it up and can optimize it pretty well .
The reason that there 's two code paths here , the reason that they wrote the interpreter — they originally had just a classfile compiler — was that compiling to a classfile is this batch / static operation , where you want it [ the resulting bytecode ] to be fast .
You want to do the standard , classic compiler optimizations .
You want to generate the control - flow graph , you want to eliminate dead code , you want to do good register allocation .
In JavaScript 's case , it 's often possible not to generate a closure .
You can actually use Java instance variables and Java local variables instead of these heavier - weight JavaScript [ activation objects ] .
Because at the logical level , JavaScript does n't really even have a stack .
It has object allocations on the heap ; those are your Function invocations .
Sloooow .
Right ?
Because [ in comparison ] the Java stack translates to the C stack .
So the fact that the compiler can go through and optimize away a lot of this JavaScript dynamic stuff that 's provable you 're not gonna need , well , that 's nice !
But it takes time .
The interpreter is a path that allows you to dynamically develop : load code in and see how it 's gonna work right now , at the unfortunate expense of the Rhino people having to maintain these two code paths .
But , you know , there 's a lot shared between them .
And that 's it !
The script runtime implements all the JavaScript , you know , Ecma spec stuff , thefunctions .
And a lot of it just delegates down to Java where possible .
Pretty clean !
Pretty standard .
It 's a pretty standard compiler , interpreter and runtime .
You 're gonna see this if you dig into your favorite JVM language .
You 'll probably see something similar to this .
This is actually more mature than a lot of them .
A lot of them start off by interpreting the parse tree , and it 's slow from the method calls .
So this is why Rhino 's fast .
Now it could be a lot faster , and we 're working on it .
Hopefully , you know , these things can be as fast as Java , in the same way that Java made the claim that it can be " as fast as C++ " .
And for long - running applications , that 's usually true .
Especially with parallelism , right ?
Threads .
And especially if the JIT has a chance to look at the actual code paths being used and compile them down into machine code specific for that code path , as a fall - through .
Obviously for benchmarks , where they fire something up and run a loop a thousand times , or whatever ?
C++ is faster because the JIT has n't had any time to kick in and evaluate what 's going on .
But for long - running services — which is what we 're all writing , yeah ?
At this Ajax conference — the JIT will kick in .
And your Rhino code now will get very close to where Java 's performance is .
( Provided you 're not doing number - crunching - Ed. )
So do n't worry about that so much .
So RnR , I already talked about it .
It does n't have a database backend yet , because we 're using Google 's internal store , like Bigtables .
Which is why I have n't open - sourced the thing yet .
It 's weird : somebody told me the other day , they sent me mail and said : " I think you 're today 's Paul Graham " .
And he meant this in the most negative connotation possible .
" You 're today 's Paul Graham , and RnR is the next Arc . " I was like , " What ! ? "
And he said , well , he 's a server - side JavaScript guy .
I mean , there are n't that many , right ?
Most of us are thinking client - side .
But he 's a server - side JavaScript guy .
And he goes to people and says , why are n't you using server - side JavaScript ?
And they say : " We 're waiting for Steve Yegge to release RnR . " And I 'm ... this is news to me !
I 'm working on ... stuff , you know .
Work .
And this [ open - sourcing RnR ] is part - time and everything .
This year , now that we know people are interested in it , we will release it .
( At least we 'll try for this year - Ed. )
It 's just a little weird , right ?
Because Sun hired the JRuby guys , and they 're doing JRuby on Rails , and it 's eventually going to be part of the Java Development Kit .
It 's gonna be , you know : it 's Sun 's lightweight answer to EJB and all those giant frameworks .
You want to build something quickly and use the Rails model , well , run Rails on the JVM !
So I thought : if JRuby on Rails had been ( a ) ready when we started using it [ i.e. writing RnR ] , and ( b ) Google would let me use Ruby , then I would have used that !
So RnR was like a transitional thing .
But ... again , you know , I think that there are other people in situations where you really prefer to use JavaScript .
So yeah , I guess I 'll ... open - source it .
We 're working on it .
This is the last slide , by the way ; I know you guys are tired .
We 're doing a lot of work on it .
I 'm working on it personally , I mean working on Rhino .
Because I think it 's all right .
I 'm used to JavaScript now , and I think it 's a good implementation .
It 's a good compiler , so it 's good practice for me , to learn how compilers work .
We 've got a debugger , but we 're making the debugger better .
We 've got a sandboxing model , but that could definitely be wrapped up and made available to you folks .
We 'd like to open - source our JSCompiler : the thing that compresses JavaScript for Google Maps and GMail and stuff .
I know there are some open - source ones out there .
We do n't think that it 's competitively in our best interest to keep the thing internal .
It 'd be better to get it out there so you all benefit from it , and so you can all hack on it , right ?
We 're working on open - sourcing our JSCompiler and other stuff .
So that 's it !
I wanted to cover Rhino , but I also wanted to leave time for questions .
And I 've left you ( looking at big LED clock in the back ) one minute and sixteen seconds for questions .
Sorry about that .
So really quickly , if there are any burning questions , I 'll repeat the question and try to answer it .
Otherwise feel free to come up afterwards and chat .
Yeah , that 's a good question .
Um ... uh ...
I kinda wrote that up in a blog .
Is n't that stupid ?
" Read my blog !
" The short answer is : it imposes a tax on the systems people , which means that it 's not completely self - contained within the team that 's using it .
And for that reason , primarily , it 's really not a good idea right now .
Any other burning questions ?
Well , you know ... they 're ... you know ...
Yeah .
But I mean , what other options do you have ?
I mean , you have multiprocessing / share - nothing , which is heavyweight and it requires more work .
So I use threads .
I 'd prefer something better , but they 're what we 've got today .
Ah. OK .
Well , yeah , it already has borrowed some stuff from Python in JavaScript 1.7 , Array comprehensions , destructuring assignment .
And these are good features .
They 're good .
They 're not going to change it to be syntactically whitespace sensitive , right ?
I do n't know .
The guys working on it have really taken off in completely different directions from Python .
They 're looking at an optional static type system , so in that sense it 's maybe more like Groovy .
And they 're looking at maybe fixing some of the bugs .
But I do n't know how that 's going to evolve yet .
Because there 's obviously a lot of people who have skin in the game , a lot of people interested in affecting the way the spec evolves .
So it 's all kind of up in the air right now .
All right , so we 're really out of time .
I 'd like to thank you for coming .
And please come up afterwards .
Thanks !
Anti-Gay Alabama Attorney General Caught Being Gay Posted by Pile ( 83755 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Liars ]
Wonkette says , " This may come as a shock , but a prominent anti-homosexual Republican attorney general has apparently been caught having homosexual intercourse with his homosexual gay male assistant .
Bonus :
The dude ’s wife caught him , in their bed .
This is the rumor that the AG ’s office has officially denied , so now of course everybody is spilling the sordid details . "
The Attorney General in question is Troy King , who , of course , is only interested in outlawing homosexuality and sex toys .
His gay lover is either a college “ buddy , ” or a very young youngster and “ Homecoming King ” from Troy University .
What are the odds of a dude named Troy King getting caught in bed with a Homecoming King from Troy University ?
Rumors Swirl On Possible Alabama AG Troy King Gay Sex Scandal , Possible Resignation
The rumor mill in Montgomery is swirling of news of a potential resignation by Republican Attorney General Troy King , amid rumors that he was caught by his wife having sex with a male aide and subsequently banished from his home by his wife .
King , a potential GOP frontrunner for Governor in 2010 , succeeded Bill Pryor , one of George W. Bush ’s most controversial judicial nominees .
In addition , King was also an early endorser of John McCain .
A spokesperson for Alabama Governor Bob Riley denied that Attorney General Troy King is preparing to resign in the wake of a massive rumor campaign that has yet to be fully confirmed .
The word is , according to multiple sources in Montgomery and elsewhere , that King was recently caught by his wife in a gay affair with a male aide and banished from his home .
According to Tara Hutchison in the executive office of the governor they have heard of no plans in the works for King ’s resignation .
She said she had not heard that he had been kicked out of his home because of a gay affair .
Governor Bob Riley ’s press office refused to return multiple phone calls from this independent press outlet even though some sources accuse Riley of perpetrating the leak .
The attorney general ’s press office also declined to return phone calls seeking comment .
The Locust Fork News and Journal heard about this a couple of weeks ago from a Montgomery lawyer , and have had numerous contacts with people trying to confirm the truth of the rumor .
I just heard from a very reliable source that Troy Boy is resigning as Attorney General .
No report of King ’s official reason , but the unofficial reason almost certainly involves the rumors swirling around Montgomery that he was recently caught in embarassing misconduct .
The resignation may be enough to keep King ’s personal life out of the papers , but I do n’t look for him to run for governor in 2010 .

It was just for research purposes .
Posted by ehutch on 2008-07 - 12 16:52:40 it seems that most people with a public strong anti gay position are gay themselves .
i guess they think that by crusading against homosexuality is a good way to deflect suspicions of their own sexuality ( i.e. good cover ) .
sad and pathetic but true .
Homophobia study
Posted by Craig on 2008-07- 12 18:03:31
Not surprising .
A study several years ago at a university in Georgia proved that 70 % of homophobic men are physically aroused by gay porn , versus 20 % for the non-homophobic population .
Using this tidbit , I 've confronted two guys that loved throwing around gay slurs around ; both admitted to cross dressing and " experimenting with guys . "
It 's amazing to watch .
Try it some time with your favorite homophobe .

So let me get this straight ..
The AG , who is a Republican , who has pushed to ban sex toys in the state , was caught with a male in bed .
Why does the Republican Party have the most hypocrites ???
I mean , the Republicans can keep them and all , but geesh ... there coming out of the wood work ( or closet . )

This is the greatest news I have heard yet !
There is a God and he is sick of his people ... he he he okay he is sick the sheeple herders that are liars .
Anyway , I hope this gets proven , drug out in public , through a long and painfully embarrassing national news story , complete with is wife crying , sexual assault charges , and sodomy charges .
I do n't hate gay guys , I hate homophobes that can't just accept their friggin gay !

You are what you fight .
Wow - do n't be so surprised
Posted by Craig on 2008-07-13 18:37:41
Wow , it 's pretty easy .
Until 1972 , the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association both considered homosexuality as a mental illness .
Until the Stonewall riots of 1969 , it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person .
Many people from that era have a very difficult time coming out of the closet .
Their religion , politics , and self - loathing prevent them from enjoying the God - given life they deserve as an openly gay man .
So , they become hyper anti-gay , thinking its the perfect way to hide their own homosexuality .
It 's very sad .
Fortunately , as more people come out as gay and lesbian , public perception has changed enormously , even from a few years ago .
People who are in their 20's and 30's have a very difficult time understanding what all the fuss is about being gay .
That 's a wonderful thing .
It 's sad those in the religious and political right can't get over their own prejudice .
It will be a great day when they do , for everyone 's sake , especially their own .
Just Another Republican Hypocrite
Posted by Peter Goezinya on 2008-07-15 13:19:16
This is yet another example of Republican hypocrisy that defines the party itself .
This self - richeous a - hole fought so vocally against gays , fought vigorously against selling sex toys in Alabama ( c'mon now , in our own bedrooms , for goodness sake - what possible harm could that do except subract from sales tax revenue ! ) yet is caught in HIS OWN MARRIAGE BED having sex with another man - it could n't have been better written and more ironic than had a soap opera writer penned it !
Yet the mindless religious rightests adored the ground he walked on and most certainly would have paid millions to support his race for governor in 2010 .
What has our world come to people ??!!
Be careful what you believe ...
Posted by Jeff on 2008-07-15 15:21:31
This kind of thing always comes up around elections .
I know he is n't up for anything this year , but he is a republican who endorses McCain .
I live in Troy , am still involved with the university , and have heard nothing about this .
The only way you can be sure of something like this these days is if you have photos of him with his weiner where the sun do n't shine .... and even then it may have been Photo Shopped .
Its about time
Posted by Bama on 2008-07- 16 10:27:19
Another self rightous SOB has been nailed .
He put Alabama on the " map " with the sex toy ban , and now this .
Being gay myself , it does not supprise me to see someone as vocal as King against gays , turn out to be a closet case .
It 's just sad that someone with that sorta influence , could not put his efforts to better use .
Oh , and by the way , to the poster that mentioned " SODOMY " charges .. wake up , Sodomy is not illegel between consenting adults ..
Has n't been in several years now .!
I agree with JEFF

It IS True !
Posted by BamaBear on 2008-07-16 16:00:38
What Wonkette has been saying is true .
It is all over Montgomery , AL that this is NOT the first time he has been caught .
The first time was in his SUV and was covered up by the police .
The second time is what everyone is talking about .
He was caught by his wife in his own bed making out with the homecoming king from Troy University .
His name is John Godwin .
This information comes from an executive assistant to a very high ranking official in the Alabama Government .
Yea , he is Bi / Gay
Posted by JasonH on 2008-07-25 22:29:40
My close friend in Montgomery told me tonight , that this particular story on Troy King is not true .
However , he said that Troy had several incidents of gay activities since college ....
He went on to say that this latest story on him was a political attack and at the same time saying they were motivated statements based on his past homosexual activities .
So , it looks like we have another Republican in the closet , but his activities are sneaking out ???
July 27 , 2008 related article
Posted by Just me on 2008-07-27 18:01:36
There was an article in the Birmingham News today discussing how much Troy King is paying his " boy " .
Nine months ago , boy Godwin started as an intern making $ 10 an hour , without a degree or experience in law .
Now his title is chief aide and he makes $ 54,000 a year .
The article also says that Godwin's job " requires " him to travel with Troy King .
Easy for those late - night get togethers ?
Stop rumor milling
Posted by anon on 2008-08- 04 16:00:37
I have not seen this confirmed in any major media outlets , nor any smaller local news media in Alabama .
It has not yet appeared on his Wikipedia page , and the talk page discusses failure to find any factual evidence .
It 's a rumor .
Seeing as things like this keep happening to republicans , it 's a pretty believable rumor .
But a rumor nonetheless .

Why are so many people so quick to believe this ?
Not saying it 's not true .
Just curious why this story , and most other news stories , are always readily gobbled up by the public as TRUTH .
Could you at least try to think ?
Due to this we get treated to comments like , " Typical f*cking christian / republican hypocrite . "
I lose a little faith in humanity when I see comments like that .
These droppings are on EVERY message board and comment section of any web page having to do with a " Christian " politician screwing up ; as if a politician who claims to be a Christian actually has to be .
It 's funny ( not really ) how people know these politicians are full of sh*t , but will still pick and chose what they want to believe from them .
Anyway , atheists and hardcore liberals have been eating this BS up for hundreds of years and still have n't realized how lame of an argument it is .
Sadly , most Christians have n't either .
If you keep believing lies just because they suit your wants and desires , your whole life becomes exactly that ... a giant lie .
And you show the world your stupidity every time you regurgitate it .
Blackmail and Control
Posted by Robert on 2009-03- 26 06:59:05
The reason the republican party has so many hypocrites .
It is because the rich and greedy who control them wo n't put them in a position where they can betray them unless they have something to blackmail them with and hence be able to control them .
The rich and greedy purposefully seek them out , professional corrupt politicians who believe in nothing , who shameless pull the mantle of Christianity about to cloak their venal , greedy , self serving nature .

Yesterday Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae Plunged on Capital Concerns .
Freddie Mac fell 18 percent and Fannie Mae dropped 16 percent after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. analysts said in a report today that an accounting change may force them to raise a combined $ 75 billion .
Speculation that the companies may take further writedowns also weighed on the stock , said John Tierney , a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York .
The new FAS 140 rule that seeks to stop companies keeping assets in off - balance sheet entities may force Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to bring mortgages back onto their books , requiring them to put up capital , Lehman analysts led by Bruce Harting wrote in a note to clients today .
Fannie Mae would need to add $ 46 billion of capital and Freddie Mac would need about $ 29 billion , the Lehman analysts wrote .
Lie of the Day
Mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are adequately capitalized and continue to be active in the mortgage market , said James Lockhart , director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise , which regulates the two enterprises .
" Both of these companies are adequately capitalized , which is our highest criteria , " Lockhart said in an interview with CNBC .
" They have been very active in the mortgage market , and they are continuing to be .
And , in fact , Congress has put on them the requirement to do jumbo mortgages and they have been doing those as well . "
We 're All Homeowners Now
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not adequately capitalized even if the housing market turned around today .
And it 's not going to turn around today
" It concerns me that people sort of extrapolate well beyond what the facts are , " Lockhart said .
" Fannie and Freddie are continuing to do their job in the marketplace .
They were created for just this type of marketplace and they are continuing to fulfill their function . "
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , created by Congress to increase homeownership , have become one of the few avenues for new mortgage financing as competitors scaled back last year amid record increases in delinquencies and defaults .
Their share of the conforming mortgage market , or new loans of $ 417,000 or less , almost doubled to 81 percent in the first quarter .
Fannie Mae Has Failed Its Mission
Fannie Mae has failed to help make housing affordable ( its primary mission )
Fannie Mae's CEO was forced out in disgrace
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were both involved in multi - year derivative scandals where they had no idea what their derivative books ever were .
Government sponsorship of housing is absolutely guaranteed to drive up prices ( until things implode as they did in the US ) .
Scientists are warning that an Antarctic ice shelf the size of Northern Ireland is on the verge of disintegration , even though it is now the middle of the southern hemisphere 's winter .
The European Space Agency says new satellite pictures show that the Wilkins shelf – the largest to be threatened so far – is " hanging by its last thread " .
Extending for approximately 5,600 square miles , it has been held in place by a thin ice bridge connecting it to an island , but this is now fracturing .
The shelf , which lies near the base of the Antarctic Peninsula , had not been expected to collapse until the early 2020s .
It provides further evidence that the planet is warming more quickly than predicted .

Scientists are stunned that it is continuing to melt in the depths of winter , and believe that warm water is welling up from the ocean to attack it from underneath .
So far seven shelves on the peninsula have collapsed due to climate change .
On Friday , President Bush – who last week told the G8 summit " Goodbye from the world 's greatest polluter " – defied a 2007 ruling by the US Supreme Court to take action on global warming under the Clean Air Act .

Tired Programmers Damage Your Project
I completely agree with David Heinemeier Hansson ’s ( Mr. Rails ‘ ) recent article , Sleep Deprivation is not a Badge of Honor .
I ’ve seen many examples of this kind of counter - productive attitude in software development .
From developers on an hourly rate contributing 100 - hour - plus work weeks to maximise their pay , to teams being expected to work evenings and weekends just to be seen to be doing something to rescue late projects , even though that “ something ” is ultimately detrimental ( both to the project and to the team ) .
The accepted wisdom seems to be that if we can do X amount of work in 40 hours , then in 80 hours we ought to be able to do , if not 2 * X , then at least more than X .
This is based on the dubious assumption that some extra work is always better than no extra work .
We may expend more effort , but it ’s quite likely that the effort will be wasted introducing bugs , making poor design decisions and doing other things that will invariably cause more work later on .
The ever - infallible Wikipedia lists confusion , loss of concentration , impatience , memory lapses , depression and psychosis among the many effects of sleep - deprivation .
These do n’t sound like ideal traits for a software developer .
Speaking from personal experience , the impact of tiredness on my concentration is the real productivity killer .
If you put in extra hours at the beginning of the week , you may find it impossible to repay the debt until the weekend , which means you ’ll be working at a sub - optimal level for days .
At a company were I worked several years ago , we would routinely work late into the evening to try to get more done .
Except there was one developer who was extremely reluctant to put in additional hours and generally managed to avoid doing so .
This was tolerated because he was consistently the most productive member of the team and produced the best quality code .
It did n’t occur to me at the time , but the reason he produced the best work was probably largely because he was n’t working stupid hours , unlike the burnt - out hackers who were checking in poorly thought out , error - strewn code every night .
It is vital to be able to disengage form the task at hand .
To go away and come back with a fresh perspective and new insights .
You ca n’t see the big picture with your nose constantly pushed up against the canvas .
An Industry of Addicts
Tiredness often leads to programmers relying on stimulants , usually caffeine , as a substitute for adequate rest .
It would appear that developers who do n’t have a caffeine dependency are in the minority .
I ’ve had colleagues who need two cans of Red Bull just to kick - start their brains in the morning and others who drink several cups of ridiculously strong black coffee to keep them going through the day .
Of course , here in Blighty , the delivery method of choice is the humble cup of tea – backbone of the British Empire .
High caffeine consumption has a whole host of nasty side - effects that complement the effects of sleep - deprivation perfectly .
Insomnia is the real kicker .
You need to sleep , you are knackered , but you ca n’t sleep because of the caffeine .
So you either go to bed later or you lie awake for hours .
When the alarm goes in the morning you are not recharged .
You drag yourself out of bed and drink that first coffee / tea / Red Bull to get you started for the day .
You are an addict , just in a slightly more socially - acceptable way than if you were smoking crack in the back alley .
“ The Zone ” and Peak Mental Performance
All developers are familiar with “ The Zone ” : that elusive state of mind where the code flows and in an hour we achieve more than we could in a week outside of the zone .
What is less clear is how do we get into the zone in the first place ?
Lack of sleep does n’t help .
If you are tired you wo n’t find the zone .
Too much caffeine probably has a similar effect .
So what else affects our mental performance ?
I am ignorant in these matters , but it seems reasonable that diet and general well - being would play a part .
This makes Google ’s strategy of free meals and snacks particularly interesting .
Not only are they providing a perk that may encourage people to work there , nor are they merely encouraging their employees to lunch together to encourage team - building and sharing of ideas .
They are also taking control of their workers ’ nutrition , rather than leaving them to subsist on Mars Bars and Coke .
It would be fascinating to see a study into what kind of impact this had on staff performance and whether it came close to offsetting the apparently huge cost .
The best athletes leave nothing to chance in their preparation .
Nutrition is part of this .
Maybe it ’s the same for more intellectual endeavours ?
After five years of war , at least one mid-level Army commander finally has realized what should have been obvious from the beginning : that winning the war in Iraq requires soldiers that understand Iraq 's culture , customs ... and language .
Two groups of soldiers at Ft. Lewis , Washington – home of two Stryker brigades – already have graduated from a class that teaches basic Arabic .
" Graduates typically have the verbal and written skills of a fourth - or fifth - grade Arab child . "
The program at Ft. Lewis was pioneered by the 4th Stryker Brigade , which has 80 Arabic speakers , according to the newspaper .
But Col.
Harry Tunnell , commander of the year - old 5th Stryker
Brigade , took the idea to the next level .
...
It was Tunnell 's goal to make sure each company within the brigade had at least one soldier — and as many as four — who could help American forces bridge the language and culture gap with Iraqi citizens .
The major tool for testing these new " soldier - interpreters " is a mock meeting with Arabic - speaking actors in a new movie - style set at Ft. Lewis .
As novel as it sounds , that kind of training is nothing new .
For at least four years , the British Army has hosted the same kind of staged " cultural encounters " at Catterick , a training facility dressed up to look like Iraq .
And the Joint Readiness Training Center at Ft. Polk , Louisiana , built a similar set in 2006 ( pictured ) .

Volvo Cars is the only remaining part of Ford 's Premier Automotive Group
Volvo Cars has said that it is sacking about 1,200 of its employees in Sweden , adding to speculation that it is looking to sell off the business .
A further 300 overseas jobs will be axed by the Ford - owned firm , with contracts for about 500 consultants also being cancelled .
Ford Motor has in the past denied that it was looking to get rid of Volvo .
It is the only remaining part of its Premier Automotive Group after the sale of Land Rover , Jaguar and Aston Martin .
Ford said that Volvo job cuts were part of a 4bn kronor ( $ 662 m ; £ 331 m ) cost - cutting drive .
Staff in Gothenburg and Olofstrom in the west and southern parts of Sweden will be most heavily affected .
Turn around
Earlier this month , Ford completed the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover businesses to Indian conglomerate Tata in a deal valued at £ 1.7bn .
And it sold its Aston Martin marque to a UK - led investment consortium last year .
Ford has been forced to sell the companies in order to concentrate on its loss - making core US car business , which it hopes to turn around in the next two years .

There 's a great community of travellers over there who are ready to read your travel tales
Teddy Roosevelt was the first president to leave the continental U.S.
It ’s too bad he was n’t also the last .
Politicians and celebrities with an urge to see poverty only need to visit the Mississippi Delta or some of the neighborhoods in American cities .
If they yearn for more exotic poverty , all they have to do is visit the Indian reservations that do not have casinos .
Any disease they are hot to trot to cure can be found right here in the good old U.S.A .
Depressed economic conditions ?
We have them .
Crumbling infrastructure ?
We have that , too .
Hunger ?
Yes , that too .
Inflation and weak currency ?
Present right here .
Corruption ?
Our politicians can hold their own in that dubious category .
Orphans ?
There are plenty of those , too .
There is simply no need to travel .
Any bad or sad thing you wish to see you can see here in the U.S .
We live in strange times when politicians expect to get a pat on the back for returning to Americans $ 300 or so of their own dollars while giving Israelis $ 3 billion and Egyptians $ 2 billion .
In retrospect , the Marshall Plan , which helped rebuild Europe after World War II , was a bad idea , because it planted the seed in our politicians ’ minds that they could substitute money for a sound foreign policy .
I ’ve never forgotten the words of a Salvadoran friend during their guerrilla war .
" We ca n’t afford to kill the guerrillas , " he said .
" There are only 7,000 of them , and your government is paying my government a million dollars a day to fight them . "
Some of those held at Guantanamo Bay are there because the U.S. offered cash for members of the Taliban or al - Qaeda in Afghanistan .
Some of the more enterprising gunmen would just grab some poor jerk off the street and turn him over to the Americans .
Why not ?
The Americans would n’t know the difference .
The CIA has always had more money than brains .
Much of the so - called success of the surge in Iraq is because some al - Qaeda people killed the wrong tribal leader and the Sunnis turned against them .
After the Sunnis started killing al - Qaeda people , the U.S. came rushing in and started paying the Sunnis to kill al - Qaeda instead of Americans .
What do you think will happen when we stop paying them ?
What do you think will happen when it becomes clear that the Shiites are not going to allow the Sunnis any meaningful role in government ?
The trouble with buying allies is that they are always for sale .
You ca n’t really buy loyalty .
You can only buy services .
I wish I could collect a bunch of cowboys so we could round up all of the Washington politicians , hogtie them and brand their foreheads with the words " America First . "
They are , after all , American politicians , elected to serve the American people .
There is nothing , not a word , in the Constitution that authorizes them to help any foreign nation in any way whatsoever .
Foreign aid , in all its many forms , is clearly unconstitutional .
For the first 200 years , the only things we gave foreigners were hot lead and cold steel .
Do n’t get me wrong 
I have nothing against foreigners .
We ca n’t blame them for milking us out of every dollar they can as long as we continue to elect stupid or corrupt politicians .
You need n’t pay any attention to all this global baloney you hear .
The world has always had a global economy .
Why the heck do you think Columbus sailed over here and Marco Polo walked to China ?
Global trade does not require treaties , alliances or military forces stationed overseas .
It does not require our muck - brained Congress to turn over its constitutional duty to regulate foreign trade to the executive branch .
It does not require our Supreme Court to even know what foreign laws say , much less apply them to Americans .

WESTFIELD -
In an ironic twist , the jury trial of a Holyoke man who refused to report for jury duty , was continued today due to a lack of jurors .
Michael Franco , 45 , is on trial in Westfield District Court for failing to report for jury duty in 2006 in Westfield .
Franco requested the trial because he has previously said he believes there are systematic problems with the state 's trial system .
A total of eight jurors were impaneled for Tuesday 's trial .
Three were dismissed including two at Franco 's request .
By law , the plaintiff or defendant in a case can each request to have two jurors dismissed without giving a reason .
A total of six jurors were needed for this trial .
Franco 's court case is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Wednesday in Westfield District Court .
Earlier this morning , Judge Rita Koenigs refused to dismiss charges against Franco , a city veterans ' services officer .
Franco , 45 , who is charged with twice failing to report for jury duty , has said he refused because the state Trial Court is " systematically corrupted and politically motivated . "
Franco has said he bases his argument on personal experience during a custody battle with his ex-wife about their 10 - year - old daughter .
He said the court is biased against " heterosexual men and fathers . "
Franco , a failed candidate for Governor 's Council , state representative and City Council , is running again for the 8th District seat on the Governor 's Council now held by Thomas T. Merrigan and has made previous statements concerning his position about the court system .
The council acts on nominations from the governor for judicial appointments .
More details in The Republican tomorrow .
Today The Hill and Congressional Quarterly are reporting that a deal has been reached on legislation to amend FISA , which will include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies .
Under the guise of a compromise , the legislation is designed to ensure that the only issue the courts will review is whether or not the President told the telecoms that their conduct was legal , but not whether the conduct actually was legal .
Over forty years ago , President Jack Kennedy said " In the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger . "
We are such a generation , facing down an executive branch that has seized incredible power to violate the laws set forth by Congress under a dubious interpretation of the Constitution .
To maintain our core values and the separation of powers that is integral to our Constitutional system of government , we must allow the Courts to review and rule upon the legality of the President 's warrantless surveillance program .
Such a ruling effects not only the power of the president to order unlawful surveillance , but will speak to any instance in which the executive branch seeks to unilaterally override the will of the people 's house .
The most promising hope of a judicial ruling on the authority of the President to order surveillance in violation of the FISA statute remains the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies who collaborated in NSA program .
The ACLU 's lawsuit directly against the NSA was already thrown out of court ( on procedural grounds , not the merits ) , and the Administration has already asserted sovereign immunity against any case directly against the government .
The options for accountability are dwindling .
With this in mind , the Administration is seeking , desperately , to forestall any judicial review and throw the telecom cases out of court .
Working with their allies in Congress , and backed by the lobbying might of some the largest and most powerful corporations in the world , it appears that the Administration is on the verge of sweeping a massive violation of the rights of millions of ordinary Americans under the rug .
But it is not too late .
According to The Hill :
aides said the deal is not final because negotiators have to vet the language within their respective caucuses .
One person familiar with the talks said if there are no major objections , the deal could be announced next week .
You have the opportunity to stand up and defend the fundamental freedoms upon which this country was founded , by calling your representatives and asking them to oppose letting the telecoms off the hook .
Any deal is no deal unless the courts can rule on the legality of the warrantless surveillance program .
Please call today .
Here ’s the story of the worst editor to ever take up space on this beautiful planet .
During my second year as an undergrad , someone very close to me was raped .
It was a horrific experience , complete with guns , knives , and torture , like a scene from a Law & Order SVU episode .
She was , needless to say , quite emotionally scarred .
A few years later , I wrote a poem about it and submitted it to a literary journal .
I received an unbelievable response from the editor .
He took the time to type a six page , single spaced letter in which he ranted about how he would never , ever publish a poem about rape , because he was so tired of hearing women cry and moan about the subject .
In his opinion , women who get raped usually “ have it coming , ” because of the provocative way they dress or act around men .
In his words , he was “ sick of wenchy women poets who are always bashing men . ”
He said that women who write poems about rape secretly desire to be raped , because they want to be dominated by men .
He also said that rape was a bad subject , because it was “ too baggy ” and long , and no poem should be more than fifteen or twenty lines long .
He wondered if I thought I was Alan Ginsberg , because he also hated Ginsberg , and he suggested that I pay more attention to commas and less attention to political issues du jour .
The hair on my head physically stood on end as I read his letter .
At first , I hoped I misunderstood what he meant .
Surely , no editor of a literary journal could ever be such a cold hearted bastard .
But after reading the letter several times , the words were pretty cut and dry .
I sat in stunned silence knowing that I understood him oh too well .
Then I ripped his letter into as many pieces as I could and set it on fire in the backyard .
Now I regret doing that .
If I had saved it , I could have posted it on this blog for the world to see .
I could put his name in huge , bold letters .
But I was so upset by his letter that I do n’t trust my recollection of his name or the name of his journal .
I ’d hate to mention what I think it was in fear of accidentally slandering some other good soul out there .
Part of my “ revenge ” is to imagine him as I think he is now –fat , bald , sitting naked at a creaky kitchen table under a bare lightbulb , looking at his latest porn magazine , maybe yelling out the window at the neighborhood kids .
Alone .
Please understand me .
I am not offended when a literary journal rejects me .
That would be petty and childish .
For that matter , most rejection actually helps me .
I go back and question what I have done and often make positive changes .
Or I rethink my submission strategy or purchase journals when I can .
Maybe the market does not fit the style of my work .
Or maybe the poem just sucks , and I need to put it aside for a while .
What offends me is the way the poem was rejected .
It was n’t just a rant against my poem .
It was a frightening rant against women in general .
So , I immediately sat down and wrote a poem called “ DON ’T WRITE A POEM ABOUT RAPE , ” which was accepted by Calyx : A Journal of Art and Literature by Women .
You probably know about Calyx , because it is a very well established and respected journal with amazing work by some big names and many new names , too .
But if you do n’t , then check them out .
The writing and artwork they publish is first rate , and I was thrilled and humbled to be included .
Yes , there are still many good editors out there , so do n’t give up hope !
Many thanks to Calyx for publishing my poem in their summer 1992 issue .
DON ’T WRITE A POEM ABOUT RAPE
by Julie Buffaloe - Yoder
For the editor who told me
rape is not a fresh subject
( he knows who he is ) .
Rape is a cliché .
Unless it happens to you .
But do n’t write a poem about it
or the editor might say
it ’s just not fresh .
Rape is not fresh .
It ’s been done too much .
It ’s too emotional , confessional .
There are too many words .
People are not shocked anymore .
Do n’t write a poem about it
especially if you were in the dark
university parking lot , a little more than tipsy ,
and he forced you into his car with a gun .
Dark parking lots and guns are so overdone !
Do n’t write a poem about it
especially if the digital time on his dash
was 12:00 .
It ’s too much like the Twilight Zone
especially if those stiff red numbers
still ring in your brain sometimes
when you ’re in the grocery line
and you drop everything you got , and the tomatoes
and the peaches , and the can of cream corn
go rolling down the aisle .
Do n’t say he drove you down a dead end road .
Do n’t tell how he bent your fingers back ,
slammed them with the door over and over .
How heavy - handed can you get ?
Do n’t tell how he took the right to bare your arms ,
your legs , your goose - bumpy little nipples ,
and when he ripped your shirt in loud red shreds
you were trite enough to worry
what people would think about you .
For God ’s sake , do n’t say you were a virgin .
Honey , save it for the Movie of the Week .
Do n’t tell about the fistfuls
of sand and gravel in your open mouth ,
your open face , up your open legs .
It ’s just not fresh .
Maybe try a different point of view .
Do n’t tell how he held the gun so tenderly
in your ear , under your tongue ,
deep inside the stretched - out skin
of your nostril , and you could smell the click
as he cocked it , and you could taste the click
in your throat as he made you call him Lord .
With the right music , it might work for a porno flick
but not for a literary journal .
Do n’t tell how you looked up at the full moon
with its mouth torn into a little o
as you waited for it to be over .
Do n’t you know the moon is overused ?
And there are inconsistencies if you say
you almost laughed out loud
cause you were a stupid little twit who thought
who actually believed the first time would be romantic .
Do n’t write a poem about it .
Just do n’t .
Especially if you went crazy when it did n’t end
and the only defense you had was to black out
and dream the damnedest dreams about a book
you used to have when you were a girl
and you dreamed a little song about the silvery moon ,
the moon on the breast of the new fallen road
the Carolina moon that kept shining , shining ,
shining on the one who ’s raping you .
And when you woke up , it was n’t over
but the Goodnight Moon was gone ,
and you saw an old woman in the distance
come out on her porch to hear
what all the Hell raising was about ,
turn out the light and go back inside
and you might ’ve thought Good Night
to the Old Lady Whispering Hush ,
but that ’s too obvious , and anyway
we ’ve heard that story before .
Do n’t say he dragged you down the road by your hair ,
the gravel chewing your back to bits .
Good Night Bowl of Mush , it ’s just
the caveman syndrome .
Get over it .
We ’re sick of wenchy women poets
who are always bashing men .
And the part where he was gentleman enough
to drive you back to your dorm
just does n’t fit the character .
Do n’t say he told you he ’d kill you if you breathed
a word , then asked your forgiveness , told you
not to worry and go get some sleep .
Would he really say that ?
Do n’t say he drove off in a limp line of smoke
as the sun came blinking over the horizon
and you staggered and puked your way back to your room ,
knowing you would n’t make it to Psychology class that day .
Do n’t talk about the guilt for not turning him in .
Take your ass to a talk show or a support group or a priest ,
stop throwing the reader around .
Do n’t tell the never ending end
of your whiny little poem .
Get a grip .
Especially if your roommate laughed and said
Why would anybody want to rape you ?
And the counselor said you ’ve got to take control
of your life , and your boyfriend tried to understand
why even his understanding would never be enough ,
why even his softest fingertips would always be too much .
So you drank yourself into a quiet rage
and now six years later it ’s backed up in a corner
of your throat , bristling , sideways , ready to lunge
at the thickest , closest , slickest , hardest vein .
Nobody wants to hear about it anymore .
And the editor does n’t care that
you ’ve already cut half the words
and many of the details .
It ’s still too sprawling , too baggy ,
too talky , not fresh .
Go tell it to Ginsberg , we’ve
got a comma to perfect .
But if you ’re that damned stubborn , go ahead .
You ’ll write the poem alone
and it ’ll live in a junk drawer
swelling up like a belly
under a pink pile of rejection .
Serves you right .
So stop acting like a bitchy female poet .
It just wo n’t work .
It ’s just not fresh .
It can be difficult knowing what the right age for borrowing should be .
Obviously , lenders have rules about what age people should be when they start to borrow but this does not mean that it is not too low .
Some people might also argue that there are some sorts of borrowing that are worse for young people to do .
They may feel that store cards , for example , are not suitable for a number of reasons .
What is a store card ?
A store card is like a credit card but issued by a particular store to use when shopping with them and any other companies in their chain or other branches .
They work in a similar way to a credit card in that you can buy things using the card and do not have to pay for them until they send you a statement 4 - 6 weeks later .
This will show what you have spent on the card and you will have repayment options .
You will be able to pay just a minimum amount if you want to which will cover the interest payment and a little more or you can pay off the full amount that you spend or something in between .
As the card can only be used in particular stores , then it can be tempting to always shop in those .
If it is your favourite store then this could be great , but it could mean that you are buying there when you could get them cheaper elsewhere .
You may also be tempted by sales and offers that are sent to cardholders which might make you buy things that you do not need .
If you decide not to pay off the card in full then you will start to accumulate debt .
Although the card will get paid off eventually , it will take a long time and you will be charged a lot of interest in that time .
It is best to pay them off right away and then you will not have to pay anything and you can still take advantage of any deals that card holders might get .
Should young people avoid them ?
It can be harsh to judge someone by their age and say that they should not have a store card because they are not responsible enough .
Whether you should consider having one should really be based on whether you will use it sensibly and some young people are more sensible than older ones .
You should get a card if you are sure that you will be able to repay the full balance each month .
You might even be able to set up a direct debit to do this so that there is no risk that you will forget to pay it .
Obviously , you will need to be sure that you have a good income coming in so that you can afford those repayments and that you keep a track of what you are buying so that you are sure that you will be able to afford it .
You may be able to track this online or you could alternatively keep a written record of what you are spending to make sure that you only spend what you can afford .
You also need to think about whether you will be sensible with the card .
You need to think about whether you will only buy things that you really need and want and will make sure that you cannot get them cheaper elsewhere .
You should be able to compare prices online .
It can be tempting to buy things that seem to be a bargain and that you cannot afford because you have the card but if you know that you will be sensible and not do that then it is less risky for you to get one .
So , age is not necessarily a factor when you are deciding about whether to get a store card .
It is much more important to make sure that you are committed to repaying the full balance off each month so that you do not have to pay any interest .
You also need to make sure that you are not tempted to spend extra money in the store just because you have the card .
Check prices and make sure that you shop elsewhere if you can get items cheaper in another store .
Also make sure that if you get special card holder benefits that you are not tempted to spend more money than you can afford or buy things that you do not need just because they seem to be a good bargain .
So as long as you have a good understanding of how the card works , the risks of using it and have enough income to repay the card in full each month then it does not matter whether you are old or young .
Speaking of OMeta / JS [ old link : http://jarrett.cs.ucla.edu/ometa-js] and OMeta in general , I ’ve implemented an OMeta for Scheme .
Currently it runs in MzScheme , but it should be fairly portable , with dependencies only on a handful of commonly - implemented SRFIs .
I intend to properly libraryise it — making it into a proper MzScheme module — and to port it to other schemes , most probably starting with SISC .
One interesting feature of this OMeta is that it implements the error - handling mechanisms suggested by Bryan Ford that I implemented previously in a packrat parsing library for Scheme .
The packrat - based error - handling techniques seem to generalise fairly well to an OMeta setting .

* Check it out with hg clone

I ’m already using it as part of an experimental compiler : the reader , the parser .

Harpers Magazine interviewed Jane Mayer , the author of The Dark Side – An inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on American ideals .
This book is a series of articles which chronicle the Bush ’s administrations involvement with torture and the individuals that helped make it happen .
In a series of gripping articles , Jane Mayer has chronicled the Bush Administration ’s grim and furtive dealings with torture and has exposed both the individuals within the administration who “ made it happen ” ( a group that starts with Vice President Cheney and his chief of staff , David Addington ) , the team of psychologists who put together the palette of techniques , and the Fox television program “ 24 , ” which was developed to help sell it to the American public .
The interview involved six questions which can be found here …
I highly recommend reading this interview in it ’s entirety .
What I found striking was Jane Mayer ’s response to the first question which included this statement :
Activists will be angry at me for saying this , but as someone who has covered politics in Washington , D.C. , for two decades , I would be surprised if there is the political appetite for going after public servants who convinced themselves that they were acting in the best interests of the country , and had legal authority to do so .
An additional complicating factor is that key members of Congress sanctioned this program , so many of those who might ordinarily be counted on to lead the charge are themselves compromised .
Much will depend on who the next president and attorney general are , and how much pressure they feel .
At the very least , as a journalist , I hope that the records are opened , and all the legal memos released ( several crucial ones remain secret ) so that the country can learn its own history here .
My guess is that the real accountability for President Bush will be in the history books , not the court room .
Remember , there are both Democrats and Republicans that sit on the Intelligence Committees and these legislators were informed of the torture programs as developed by the Bush administration .
This would make them both accessory before and after the fact .
The reaction of top Bush Administration officials to the ICRC report , from what I can gather , has been defensive and dismissive .
They reject the ICRC ’s legal analysis as incorrect .
Yet my reporting shows that inside the White House there has been growing fear of criminal prosecution , particularly after the Supreme Court ruled in the Hamdan case that the Geneva Conventions applied to the treatment of the detainees .
This nervousness resulted in the successful effort to add retroactive immunity to the Military Commission Act .
Cheney personally spearheaded this effort .
Fear of the consequences of exposure also weighed heavily in discussions about whether to shut the CIA program down .
In White House meetings , Cheney warned that if they transferred the CIA ’s prisoners to Guantanamo , “ people will want to know where they have been — and what we ’ve been doing with them . ”
Alberto Gonzales , a source said , “ scared ” everyone about the possibility of war crimes prosecutions .
It was on their minds .
( I added the emphasis )
Well , now I understand why there was this big push to pass the Military Commission Act back in the Fall of 2006 .
And to think that most Congress men and women did n’t even read this bill .
My Congressman told me that he voted in favor of this bill because Nancy Pelosi told him to vote “ yea ” and he did .
She wields a strong arm in the Democratic Congress .
Wait , there ’s even more …
Cheney and his buddies have been carrying around a grudge ever since Watergate and they saw 9/11 as an opportunity to strike back .
After interviewing hundreds of sources in and around the Bush White House , I think it is clear that many of the legal steps taken by the so - called “ War Council ” were less a “ New Paradigm , ” as Alberto Gonzales dubbed it , than an old political wish list , consisting of grievances that Cheney and his legal adviser , David Addington , had been compiling for decades .
Cheney in particular had been chafing at the post - Watergate reforms , and had longed to restore the executive branch powers Nixon had assumed , constituting what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called “ the Imperial Presidency .
Then there is the matter of the recent FISA bill and Congressional members ’ knowledge of the illegal spying when it first took place .
From Salon :
Identically , numerous key Democrats in Congress — including Rockefeller and Harman — were told that Bush had ordered the NSA to spy on American without warrants and outside of FISA .
None of them did anything to stop it .
In fact , while Rockefeller wrote a sad , hostage - like , handwritten letter to Dick Cheney in 2003 ( which he sent to nobody else ) — assuring Cheney that he would keep the letter locked away “ to ensure that I have a record of this communication ” — Harman was a vocal supporter of the illegal NSA program .
Here ’s what she told Time in January , 2006 in the wake of the NYT article revealing the NSA program : Some key Democrats even defend it .
Says California ’s Jane Harman , ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee : “ I believe the program is essential to U.S. national security and that its disclosure has damaged critical intelligence capabilities . ”
Harmon even went on Fox News and told the public that this NSA spying program was necessary .
Johnathan Turley explains it further .
This is exactly the dynamic which Law Professor , Fourth Amendment expert , and Simple - Minded , Confused Leftist Hysteric Jonathan Turley was describing on MSNBC on June 19 : I mean , the Democrats never really were engaged in this .
In fact , they repeatedly tried to cave in to the White House , only to be stopped by civil libertarians and bloggers .
And each time they would put it on the shelf , wait a few months , they did this before , reintroduced it with Jay Rockefeller ’s support , and then there was another great , you know , dustup and they pulled it back .
. . . I think they ’re simply waiting to see if the public ’s interest will wane and we ’ll see that tomorrow , because this bill has , quite literally , no public value for citizens or civil liberties .
It is reverse engineering , though the type of thing that the Bush administration is famous for , and now the Democrats are doing — that is to change the law to conform to past conduct .
It ’s what any criminal would love to do .
You rob a bank , go to the legislature , and change the law to say that robbing banks is lawful .
. . .
This is a very frightening bill .
What people have to understand is that FISA itself is controversial .
This court issued tens of thousands of warrants granted applications for surveillance without turning down any .
Only recently did they turn down two .
. . .
What you ’re seeing in this bill is an evisceration of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution .
It is something that allows the president and the government to go in to law - abiding homes on their word alone , their suspicion alone , and to engage in warrantless surveillance .
That ’s what the framers that drafted the Fourth Amendment wanted to prevent .
. . .
Well , there ’s no question in my mind that there is an obvious level of collusion here .
We now know that Democratic leadership knew about the illegal surveillance program almost from its inception .
Even when they were campaigning about fighting for civil liberties , they were aware of an unlawful surveillance program as well as a torture program .
And ever since that came out , the Democrats have been silently trying to kill any effort to hold anyone accountable because that list could very well include some of their own members .
And , I ’m afraid this is Washington politics at the worst .
And , so , I think that what you ’re seeing with this bill is not just caving in to a very powerful lobby , but also caving in to sort of the worst motivations on Capitol Hill since 9/11 .
You know , the administration was very adept at bringing in Democrats at a time when they knew they could n’t refuse , to make them buy in to this program , and now that investment is bearing fruit .
I recommend that you read the complete article from Salon .
There are too many details to list here .
You do n’t want to miss this .
In an effort to solve the bulk and time - consumption problem when encoding large databases , Google developed its own alternative to XML .
Yesterday , the company began evangelizing others to use it as an alternative to the industry standard .
There 's an argument that open standards are only truly useful when one standard applies to any given category of service -- an argument that was raised in the matter of application formats .
Now the broader category of data encoding -- handled nowadays by XML -- is about to receive a big challenge , ironically from the group perceived as the champion of open standards in Internet communication : Google .
Yesterday afternoon , Google publicly released documentation for a system it has been using internally , called Protocol Buffers , inviting others to use it as well .
And in a surprising blog post , one of its own software engineers argued that its system was preferable to XML because it 's less expensive to deploy , and can more easily scale up to very large databases .
Advertisement
" As nice as XML is , it is n't going to be efficient enough for this scale .
When all of your machines and network links are running at capacity , XML is an extremely expensive proposition , " wrote Google software engineer Kenton Varda .
" Not to mention , writing code to work with the DOM tree can sometimes become unwieldy . "
Google 's public documentation shows Protocol Buffers ( which has yet to be formally abbreviated ) is indeed conceptually different from XML , in that it 's rooted more in procedural logic than structural declaration .
In XML , there 's a schema which defines the structures of tables and recordsets , which is separate from the document that relates the contents of records in that structure .
In Protocol Buffers , by contrast , one file contains class declarations whose composition looks much more like C++.
They 're called . proto files , and they define structural prototypes for tables using object - oriented language with which many programmers are already familiar .
Each member of a class -- analogous to an entry in a database -- has characteristics that define their types in memory , just like variables .
But here , in an unusual departure from the norm , the default values for these members are set to digits ( for strings or literals ) or values ( for numerals ) that define their place in a sequence -- where they fall within a record .
Imagine if data were streamed onto recording tape , the way it used to be in the late 1960s and ' 70s .
It 's that streaming of the data sequence , without all the fenceposts , that differentiates XML from Protocol Buffers , by taking out all those markups that say when an entry or a record starts and stops .
Setting the data contents then takes place programmatically , using programming language constructs rather than a marked - up data file .
Under the heading , " Why not just use XML ? " an overview page in the Protocol Buffers documentation reads , " Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing structured data .
Protocol buffers : are simpler , are 3 to 10 times smaller , are 20 to 100 times faster , are less ambiguous , [ and ] generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically . "
Some might argue that , in the effort to solve the bulk problem , Google did n't really invent anything new at all -- it simply reverted to the older concept of the interface definition language ( IDL ) , a defining feature of the era of COM and CORBA .
Google anticipated that argument , and yesterday Varda offered a pre-emptive counter - argument to the question , " Is n't it just another IDL ? "
" Yes , you could call it that .
But , IDLs in general have earned a reputation for being hopelessly complicated , " Varda wrote .
" On the other hand , one of Protocol Buffers ' major design goals is simplicity .
By sticking to a simple lists - and - records model that solves the majority of problems and resisting the desire to chase diminishing returns , we believe we have created something that is powerful without being bloated .
And , yes , it is very fast -- at least an order of magnitude faster than XML . "
The US government has gone from being the biggest player in the mortgage market to being just about the only player .
Per recent reports sent by an alert reader , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae now finance 80 % of all mortgages , and the FHA guarnatees another 10 % , so these entities now come close to having mortgage finance all to themselves .
Having Fannie and Freddie , be this large , as we mentioned before , is disruptive to the credit markets .
The GSE hedging of their derivatives book is pro-cyclical , increasing the amplitude of bond market price moves .
Indeed , the Fed was worried that the scale of these operations in 2001 , seeing possible systemic risk , but the restrictions imposes as a result of accounting scandals took care of that problem for a while .
First , on Fannie and Freddie , from Associated Press :
Freddie Mac and its fellow GSE Fannie
Mae are now financing more than 80 percent of all mortgages in the U.S. , up from 40 percent a year ago .
As lenders rely on Freddie Mac to buy their loans , the company is charging higher prices and increasing market share .
Freddie Mac , which has a $ 738 billion portfolio of mortgage bonds and guarantees $ 1.78 trillion in home loans , is raising prices next month for the fourth time .
“ We are nearly the only game in town , and we think we are going to be able to enjoy that position for a number of years , ” Piszel said .
On the FHA , from the Washington Post :

Truthout
The McCain campaign has an active fantasy life — one that includes the fantasy of feminist women flocking to the polls to vote for him .
As if !!
In The Nation , Katha Pollitt put it simply : “ [ T ] o vote for McCain , a feminist would have to be insane . ”
There are a lot of Hillary Clinton supporters out there who are angry and disappointed , but they are not stupid or insane .
Much of the recent talk has focused on PUMAs ( the acronym stands for “ Party Unity My Ass ” ) , a group supposedly so angry about the Democratic primary that they wo n’t vote for Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
But as blogger Amanda Marcotte reported , PUMA PAC was started by a McCain donor , according to the Federal Election Commission .
McCain counts on his constant pandering and flip - flopping to keep people confused about his actual record on ANYTHING , let alone women ’s issues .
In 1999 , McCain said he backed Roe : “ Certainly , in the short term , or even the long term , I would not support repeal of Roe v.
Wade , which would then force X number of women in America to [ undergo ] illegal and dangerous operations . ”
But on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” in May 2007 , responding to a question about his statements in 1999 , McCain said : “ Well , it was in the context of conversation about having to change the culture of America as regards to this issue .
I have stated time after time after time that Roe v. Wade was a bad decision . ”
McCain has also voted in support of “ backdoor ” and “ parental rights ” pro-life issues .
[ I ] n 2004 , he supported the Unborn Victims of Violence Act , which makes it a criminal offense to harm or kill a fetus while committing a violent crime – essentially deeming the fetus a person in the eyes of the law .
In July 2006 , McCain voted for legislation that would fine and / or imprison physicians who perform abortions on out - of - state minors if there are parental notification requirements in their home state .
In October 2007 , he voted for legislation that would cut Health and Human Services grants to organizations that perform abortions .
Regarding sex education , contraception and healthcare for low income women and children , McCain is positively midevil .
He opposed legislation requiring that abstinence - only programs be medically accurate and based in science .
He voted to abolish funding for birth control and gynecological care for low - income women , and against funding for public education on emergency contraception .
He also voted against a measure that would require insurance companies to cover prescription contraception , despite the fact that many currently fund male reproductive pharmaceuticals , such as Viagra .
This exchange between McCain and Adam Nagourney of the New York Times is chilling :
In March 2007 , the New York Times ’ Adam Nagourney asked McCain whether grants for sex education in the United States include instructions about using contraceptives , or if they should abide by Bush ’s abstinence - only policy .
After a pause , McCain responded , “ Ahhh .
I think I support the president ’s policy . ”
Nagourney followed up : “ So no contraception , no counseling on contraception ?
Just abstinence .
Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV ? ”
After another pause , McCain replied , “ You ’ve stumped me . ”
He “ thinks ” he supports the president ’s policy ?
And he has no clue as to whether or not contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV .
This man is a parent !
It ’s obvious McCain is completely out of the parenting loop , or he should be , since he has no clue .
Then there ’s this exchange during the 2000 primary , after McCain was asked what he would do if his then - 15 year old daughter became pregnant :
“ The final decision would be made by Meghan with our advice and counsel , ” McCain said , referring to himself and his wife , Cindy .
When reporters suggested that this view made him , in fact , pro-choice , McCain became irritated .
“ I do n’t think it is the pro-choice position to say that my daughter and my wife and I will discuss something that is a family matter that we have to decide . ”
Um , that would be a pro-choice position , Mr McCain .
Unless he ’s confused about the definition of “ choice , ” which is very likely .
McCain had this to say about the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ( for which he did n’t vote either way ) :
“ They need the education and training , particularly since more and more women are heads of their households , as much or more than anybody else .
And it ’s hard for them to leave their families when they do n’t have somebody to take care of them . ”
Wow .
I think I just felt a pat on my head …
The Ledbetter case was about 20 years of pay discrimination , not education and training .
Who needs someone to take care of them … ?
Frankly , this is only the tip of the iceberg .
McCain is running for president of pasty - white rice cake rich old guys — not as president for ALL Americans .
His ability to call his wife a trollop and a cunt in the presence of reporters , or at all , is an indication of his lack of respect for 50 % of the population of this country .
Go here to read the whole article , it ’s well worth the read .
Bogged down for more than five months by a controversy surrounding a master ’s degree improperly awarded to the governor ’s daughter , the president of West Virginia University announced Friday that he would step down in September .
The decision follows an independent panel ’s report in April that found that the university had shown “ seriously flawed ” judgment in awarding an M.B.A. to Heather Bresch , the daughter of Gov. Joe Manchin III , even though she did not have enough academic credits .
Ms. Bresch is a longtime friend and former business associate of the university president , Mike Garrison .
“ During the last six weeks , we have found the university at the center of controversy and clamor , ” Mr. Garrison said in a statement issued after a meeting of the university ’s board of governors , which he attended , in Charleston .
“ I have made a decision to continue to serve as president of W.V.U. until September , because it is what a leader in this particular situation must do . ”

Efforts to harness the energy potential of Earth 's ocean winds could soon gain an important new tool : global satellite maps from NASA .
Scientists have been creating maps using nearly a decade of data from NASA 's QuikSCAT satellite that reveal ocean areas where winds could produce wind energy .
The new maps have many potential uses including planning the location of offshore wind farms to convert wind energy into electric energy .
" Wind energy is environmentally friendly .
After the initial energy investment to build and install wind turbines , you do n't burn fossil fuels that emit carbon , " said study lead author Tim Liu , a senior research scientist and QuikSCAT science team leader at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Like solar power , wind energy is green energy . "
QuikSCAT , launched in 1999 , tracks the speed , direction and power of winds near the ocean surface .
Data from QuikSCAT , collected continuously by a specialized microwave radar instrument named SeaWinds , also are used to predict storms and enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts .
Wind energy has the potential to provide 10 to 15 percent of future world energy requirements , according to Paul Dimotakis , chief technologist at JPL .
If ocean areas with high winds were tapped for wind energy , they could potentially generate 500 to 800 watts of energy per square meter , according to Liu 's research .
Dimotakis notes that while this is slightly less than solar energy ( which generates about one kilowatt of energy per square meter ) , wind power can be converted to electricity more efficiently than solar energy and at a lower cost per watt of electricity produced .
According to Liu , new technology has made floating wind farms in the open ocean possible .
A number of wind farms are already in operation worldwide .
Ocean wind farms have less environmental impact than onshore wind farms , whose noise tends to disturb sensitive wildlife in their immediate area .
Also , winds are generally stronger over the ocean than on land because there is less friction over water to slow the winds down - there are no hills or mountains to block the wind 's path .
Ideally , offshore wind farms should be located in areas where winds blow continuously at high speeds .
The new research identifies such areas and offers explanations for the physical mechanisms that produce the high winds .
An example of one such high - wind mechanism is located off the coast of Northern California near Cape Mendocino .
The protruding land mass of the cape deflects northerly winds along the California coast , creating a local wind jet that blows year - round .
Similar jets are formed from westerly winds blowing around Tasmania , New Zealand , and Tierra del Fuego in South America , among other locations .
Areas with large - scale , high wind power potential also can be found in regions of the mid-latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , where winter storms normally track .
The new QuikSCAT maps , which add to previous generations of QuikSCAT wind atlases , also will be beneficial to the shipping industry by highlighting areas of the ocean where high winds could be hazardous to ships , allowing them to steer clear of these areas .
Scientists use the QuikSCAT data to examine how ocean winds affect weather and climate , by driving ocean currents , mixing ocean waters , and affecting the carbon , heat and water interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere .
The research , published in early July in Geophysical Research Letters , was funded by NASA 's Earth Science Division .
Apollo 14 astronaut claims aliens HAVE made contact - but it has been covered up for 60 years
Edgar Mitchell was the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 14
Aliens have contacted humans several times but governments have hidden the truth for 60 years , the sixth man to walk on the moon has claimed .
Apollo 14 astronaut Dr Edgar Mitchell , said he was aware of many UFO visits to Earth during his career with NASA but each one was covered up .
Dr Mitchell , 77 , said during a radio interview that sources at the space agency who had had contact with aliens described the beings as ' little people who look strange to us . '
He said supposedly real - life ET 's were similar to the traditional image of a small frame , large eyes and head .
Chillingly , he claimed our technology is ' not nearly as sophisticated ' as theirs and " had they been hostile " , he warned ' we would be been gone by now ' .
Dr Mitchell , along with with Apollo 14 commander Alan Shepard , holds the record for the longest ever moon walk , at nine hours and 17 minutes following their 1971 mission .
' I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we 've been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomena is real , ' Dr Mitchell said .
' It 's been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so , but slowly it 's leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it .
UFO theorists believe Roswell in New Mexico was the site of an alien crash in 1947
' I 've been in military and intelligence circles , who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge , yes - we have been visited .
Reading the papers recently , it 's been happening quite a bit . '
Dr Mitchell , who has a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and a Doctor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics claimed Roswell was real and similar alien visits continue to be investigated .
He told the astonished Kerrang !
radio host Nick Margerrison : " This is really starting to open up .
I think we 're headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction . '
Mr Margerrison said : ' I thought I 'd stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and there 's no debating it . '
Officials from NASA , however , were quick to play the comments down .
In a statement , a spokesman said : " NASA does not track UFOs .
NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe .
' Dr Mitchell is a great American , but we do not share his opinions on this issue . '

Air Force nuclear command and control system plagued by security flaps
April 25 - 27 , 2008 -- SPECIAL REPORT .
UPDATED 1X .
Air Force nuclear command and control system plagued by security flaps
Part II of a two - part series
Between August 24 and September 6 , 2007 , the U.S. Air Force 's nuclear chain - of - command was severely compromised by a rival chain established out of Vice President Dick Cheney 's office and extending through the offices of the Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff , the Air Force 's Cyber - Warfare element , and into the strategic bombing commands located at Minot and Barksdale Air Force Bases .
In the weeks before and after this time period , there is ample evidence to suggest that the security of nuclear weapons , particularly at Minot , was placed in severe jeopardy by the rival chain - of - command .
On August 24 , 2007 , three B - 52s operating from Barksdale flew a training exercise called REX REDUX , officially billed as a commemoration of a 1938 B - 17 flight directed at the Italian luxury liner SS Rex .
The exercise , personally ordered by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley , was actually testing an Israeli - developed imaging and targeting pod called LITENING II on a U.S. Navy contracted merchant vessel , the USNS Bobo , in the Atlantic east of Bermuda and several targets of opportunity along the planes ' flight paths through the southern United States .
REX REDUX also involved assets of the Air Force 's embryonic Cyber Command in Washington and Barksdale .
Four days later , on August 30 , a Barksdale - based B - 52 flew six nuclear warhead tipped AGM - 129 advanced cruise missiles from Minot to Barksdale .
The incident was later called a " mistake " by Air Force officials .
However , three high - ranking Air Force officers leaked the incident to the Air Force Times .
Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne , a key member of the rival chain - of - command , rewarded his loyalists in Barksdale by announcing the base had been selected as the preliminary headquarters for the Air Force Cyber Command .
Wynne made his announcement at a Shreveport gambling casino .
Wynne , according to a CNN report , advocated the testing of nonlethal weapons , like high - power microwave weapons , against American citizens .
Wynne said , " If we 're not willing to use it here against our fellow citizens , then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation . "
Minot Air Force
Base may also get a piece of the cyber - warfare pie .
Attempts by this editor to interest North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan in the August 30 nuclear incident were unsuccessful .
Dorgan is obviously angling , along with Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , to get a chunk of the cyber - war command pie for Minot .
Far from being a mistake , the procurement of the nuclear missiles from Minot was tied to a rival chain - of - command operation that would occur on September 6 , when the Israeli Air Force struck a purported Syrian nuclear facility in eastern Syria , near the town of Dayr az Zawr .

When no heads rolled ( except for 6 - 7 ' security ' personnel at the base ) I KNEW there was acoverup and the DICK was behind it .
The DICK asserts that NO ONE has authority over him or his office so he needs to be taken out .
Many very good websites have gone subscriber or donation because the MSM and associated costs in fighting propaganda .
I am sick , unemployed and unable to work or even get a dr. to believe me so I will self terminate soon but that is another story .
My favorites that have been ' lost ' to par per are :
1. waynemadsenreport.com
2. www.aci.net/kalliste ( J. Orlin Grabbe )
3. Signs - of - the - times.org
4. Gas_oven.com ( reading room )
But back to the ' story ' .
If the office of vice president is THAT independent and above the law then it should be abolished otherwise what you have accepted is a virtual DICKtator with no morals , ethics and the delusional megalomania comparable to Saddam , Kim Jong il , etc .
where their words are NOT to be questioned but only carried out or you will lose your job , pension / benefits at the minimum and at the max your life .

Yes , some did seem to mysteriously disappear or drop dead from various causes , but I 've seen some of these deaths adequately explained to my satisfaction -- though not all of them .
It would make sense a few heads might roll on something of this magnitude to try to keep things quiet .
If these folks will kill a million innocent Iraqis , what 's to stop them from bumping off a few of our U.S. servicemen who were fighting to protect this country from domestic enemies in our own govt -- intent on starting WWIII with those nukes ?

The EU hopes funds will alleviate food shortages in Africa The European Commission has backed a plan to give 1bn euros ( £ 800 m ) of unspent EU farm subsidies in aid to farmers in Africa .
The cash could help farmers boost output , helping tackle food shortages and soaring prices .
The money has been allocated to the EU agriculture budget , but not spent .
Some countries have queried the move 's legality .
But if EU ministers and the European Parliament agree , it could take effect in early 2009 .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said : " The impact of high food prices is particularly severe for the world 's poorest populations . "
Without European help , United Nations goals to halve world poverty might fail , and tensions between countries in Africa over resources might intensify , he said .
' Rapid instrument '
The EU 's vast agriculture budget eats up more than 40 % of the EU 's annual expenditure , and is worth about 120 bn euros .
But rising food prices mean the EU has saved money on export subsidies , leaving a surplus .
That money would be used to boost the supply of fertiliser and seeds for African farmers , helping increase production over the next two years , said commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger .
" There 's a fairly broad consensus on the need to act here , given the crisis which is taking place , " he said .
" In the commission 's opinion , this is the most efficient and most rapid instrument that could be used . "
Golden opportunity
There will be some tricky negotiations , for example on how to decide what criteria countries need to meet in order to be eligible for the cash , and how much each country should be allocated , says the BBC's Europe reporter , Dominic Hughes .
The commission may have to consider factors such as how much food a country produces to feed itself , political stability and social vulnerability , the level of food price inflation and the reliance on food imports or food aid shipments .
The EU may welcome the chance to prove it can act , not just talk Our correspondent says the payouts are a golden opportunity for the commission to be seen to be doing something useful with money that is often at the centre of allegations of waste , inefficiency and corruption .
The plan has been welcomed in theory , but some EU member states have reservations .
The UK , Sweden and the Netherlands are among some countries which say they like the idea , but argue that the scheme may not be legal under EC rules .
However , officials from the commission say it has been cleared by the EU 's legal service and are confident it will work .
Ministers could still block the plan and the commission fully expects some member states to grumble about it , our correspondent says .
But the commission believes that in the end members states will reach the same conclusion - politically , this proposal just looks too good to turn down .

GAME OBJECTIVES
Your objective in this game is to conquer the galaxy and to defeat the terrible foe that stands in your way .
To achieve this goal you need resources , planets , solar systems and life forms to man your ships .
In each level you need to build a fleet of starships , have a strong resource base and then to succeed you need to destroy the enemy mothership .
Once you have achieved this you can move onto another solar system and continue your conquest for the galaxy .
Starting the Game
The first thing you must do is create starships for defense / offense and planet colonisation .
Only your monthership can produce starships and you must defend it with your life .
Colonising planets is essential to gain resources ( gas and ore ) that can then be used to build more ships .
Only one type of ship can be used to colonise a planet - the Bomber unit .
Make sure you have at least one of these at any one time - do n't use all your resources without first building this unit !
The more planets you take , the more resources you will have to defeat the enemy and destroy their mothership .
You will gain new units as you progress through the game and as you upgrade your mothership .
Planets
Planets contain the resources you require to conquer the galaxy and defeat your enemy .
Each planet may have different levels of resources so you will need to take as many as possible to produce your fleet of starships .
Once you have taken a planet you will need to protect it by leaving a minimum number of ships orbiting it .
Planets can be upgraded by clicking on them - this will increase resource production from that planet .
Starships
You have a range of defensive and offensive ships that can be used to win the game .
Initially however , you only have a couple of the basic starships that are required to fulfill your objectives .
It is important to upgrade your mothership when you have the resources , allowing you to research new starship types that will be required to defeat an increasingly more challenging enemy as you progress through the galaxy .
Different starships move at different speeds .
You can select each ship individually to move it from one point to another or click and drag a group of ships to move them .
If you have a mixed group of starships , the armada will only move at the speed of the slowest unit in the group .
The mothership is the slowest unit and really should only be moved short distances in the game .
Your starships will engage enemy fighters if they become a threat ( get too close ) .
You can at any time call back units that are fighting a losing battle , but be warned it could cost you a planet or worse .

LOS ANGELES  California , a national trendsetter in all matters edible , became the first state to ban trans fats in restaurants when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill Friday to phase out their use .
Under the new law , trans fats , long linked to health problems , must be excised from restaurant products beginning in 2010 , and from all retail baked goods by 2011 .
Packaged foods will be exempt .
New York City adopted a similar ban in 2006  it became fully effective on July 1  and Philadelphia , Stamford , Conn. , and Montgomery County , Md. , have done so as well .
But having the requirement imposed on the most populous state ’s 88,000 restaurants , as well as its bakeries and other food purveyors , is a major gain for the movement against trans fats .
That movement has been led by scientists , doctors and consumer advocates who trace the largely synthetic fat to a variety of ailments , principally heart disease .
Ballantine Books to Publish Book Inspired by the Webcomic Garfield Minus Garfield
Collection to be published simultaneously with Garfield 30th anniversary book
NEW YORK , NY – July 30 , 2008 – Paws , Inc. and Ballantine Books , a division of the Random House Publishing Group , announced last week at Comic - Con International that Ballantine will publish a book inspired by the popular webcomic Garfield Minus Garfield .
Garfield Minus Garfield ( www.garfieldminusgarfield.net) made its online debut in February 2008 and quickly became an online sensation based on a simple premise :
What would Jim Davis ’ Garfield comic strip be like without its lasagna - loving fat cat ?
Without the presence of Garfield and other characters such as Odie the dog and Nermal the kitten , the strips “ create a new , even lonelier atmosphere for Jon Arbuckle …
Jon ’s observations seem to teeter between existential crisis and deep despair . ” ( New York Times )
The full - color book format will give readers the experience of having both the original and doctored Garfield strips together on the same page for comparison .
Dublin , Ireland - based Garfield Minus Garfield creator Dan Walsh will provide the foreword to the book .
Garfield creator Jim Davis was intrigued by — and pleased with — the concept .
“ I think it ’s an inspired thing to do , ” Davis said .
“ I want to thank Dan for enabling me to see another side of Garfield .
Some of the strips he chose were slappers : ‘ Oh , I could have left that out . ’
It would have been funnier . ”
Garfield Minus Garfield site creator Dan Walsh says , “ When I looked at Jon and laughed at his crazy antics I thought ‘ He ’s just like me . ’
As it turns out , I was n’t the only one saw myself in him : millions of visitors from all over the world visit Garfield Minus Garfield and tell me they think the same thing .
Now , thanks to the awesome generosity and humor of Jim Davis , Garfield Minus Garfield is going to become a book and I ’m absolutely honored to be part of it . ”
Ballantine Books has been publishing Garfield books since 1980 , and thirty - three Garfield titles have made the New York Times bestseller list .
Thirty Years of Laughs and Lasagna : The Life and Times of a Fat , Furry Legend , will be published by Ballantine Books in October 2008 .
This hardcover anniversary collection will include a foreword from Dean Young , Blondie cartoonist , and exclusive content from Jim Davis .
ABOUT PAWS INC .
Paws , Incorporated was founded in 1981 by cartoonist Jim Davis as a creative house to support Garfield licensing .
Today , the company , located in rural Indiana , handles not only the creative angle , but also the business concerns of the corpulent kitty worldwide .

EXIT STRATEGY : General Strike USA
idea of Union .
As well as , of course , idea of the workers of the lower and middle class uniting was the real victory .
Corporate America 's greatest historical victory was destroying theof Union .
As well as , of course , destroying actual unions along the way , wherever possible , and with relish .
Many individual unions are still around , obviously .
Some are trying to make a comeback and regain relevance .
But destroying theof the workers of the lower and middle classwas the real victory .
Because it largely destroyed the idea of Solidarity , as well .
The idea of the non-ruling classes banding together to protest and work against the excesses of the ruling class .
And the very real idea that we , if we choose to , can shut the whole thing down .
If someone were to suggest , for example , that we begin a general strike ... for the sole purpose of removing this regime from power , how readily and with what well - practiced assurance would you find yourself producing the words " It wo n't do any good " ?
Plausible and even courageous in the mouth of a patient who knows he 's going to die , the sentiment fits equally well in the heart of a citizen - ry that believes it is already dead .

Individually we find that we are powerless against corporate media or Big Oil or Washington .
Our choices are limited .
Our effectiveness diminished .
This is not by accident .
Unions , social gatherings , clubs that all flourished before the 1960s have all been destroyed by those who find you & me to be a threat .
Without direct action , republican democracy is truly disempowering : our only means of influence are to beg the Very Serious And Important Intermediary - the congressman , the governor , the president , etc. - to do something on our behalf .
We all know how well that has worked out .
The Establishment wants us to focus all of our energy on elections because elections are the controlled space whereby popular ferment can be contained by rules , regulations , etc .
But there are many different methods of direct action - ie .
taking matters into our own hands - that can wield a tremendous amount of power .
Commercial arrangements are rampant throughout medicine .
In the past two decades , drug and device makers have paid tens of thousands of doctors and researchers of all specialties .
Worried that this money could taint doctors ’ research plans or clinical judgment , government agencies , medical journals and universities have been forced to look more closely at deal details .
Image Senator Charles E. Grassley , right , Republican of Iowa , is demanding that the American Psychiatric Association give an accounting of its financing from the pharmaceutical industry .
Credit ... Doug Mills / The New York Times
In psychiatry , Mr. Grassley has found an orchard of low - hanging fruit .
As a group , psychiatrists earn less in base salary than any other specialists , according to a nationwide survey by the Medical Group Management Association .
In 2007 , median compensation for psychiatrists was $ 198,653 , less than half of the $ 464,420 earned by diagnostic radiologists and barely more than the $ 190,547 earned by doctors practicing internal medicine .
But many psychiatrists supplement this income with consulting arrangements with drug makers , traveling the country to give dinner talks about drugs to other doctors for fees generally ranging from $ 750 to $ 3,500 per event , for instance .
While data on industry consulting arrangements are sparse , state officials in Vermont reported that in the 2007 fiscal year , drug makers gave more money to psychiatrists than to doctors in any other specialty .
Eleven psychiatrists in the state received an average of $ 56,944 each .
Data from Minnesota , among the few other states to collect such information , show a similar trend .
In both states , individual psychiatrists are not top earners , but consulting arrangements are so common that their total tops all others .
The worry is that this money may subtly alter psychiatrists ’ choices of which drugs to prescribe .
An analysis of Minnesota data by The New York Times last year found that on average , psychiatrists who received at least $ 5,000 from makers of newer - generation antipsychotic drugs appear to have written three times as many prescriptions to children for the drugs as psychiatrists who received less money or none .
The drugs are not approved for most uses in children , who appear to be especially susceptible to the side effects , including rapid weight gain .

Where does O'Reilly get his statistics ?
I 've been told that 95 % of the major news media outlets are owned by 5 corporations .
Corporations , by their nature , are " conservative " ( as in conserving as much profit for themselves as possible ) .
So what FACTUAL data does
Fox have to show that the majority of the media is " liberal " ?
Is n't there some way to put the numbers on the table once and for all ?
This has been a classic tug of war for years .
Anybody got the answer ?

Why can't things just be straight reporting and leave the editorializing to opinion writers ?

Those GOBS ( GoodOleBoys ) trashed , badmouthed , and degraded the woman - and if my memory serves correctly the sick snakes even institutionalized her .
If it were n't for us " Loons " the country might be destined to listen to the holy / healthy / flawlessly clean and sinless Father Bill O'Really as he trashes his guests and divides Americans further , creating discord and confusion while depositing his million dollar paycheck with his Fascist friends ' failing banking institutions .
Watch him spew his venom below , and witness his hatred against a 911 victim 's son who did n't agree with O'Really 's agenda , and it might be the very last time you 'll watch the Fox channel .

Sign me , " Crazy as a Loon " and proud of it .
Americans will be thanking us " insane , crazy " people who should " take our meds , " and have refused to kiss the likes of , and " sucker down " to O'Really 's azz .
We 've saved the world from more potential Hitlers like O'Really who honestly believes the septic field he 's smelling absolutely could NOT be his own - even though he 's standing in it .
Too bad he did n't get his Moyer 's " hit piece , " as planned .
He 's out for blood , with plenty already in Iraq investments , so give the guy a gun .
Somebody please !

Bill O'Reilly victimized ?!
What 's with Williams anymore , he 's obviously taken the money and will say whatever he 's told to by the Murdoch hitmen .
Wadda gutless sellout !
This is disgusting .
I just watched on HuffPo the attempt by O'Reilly 's producer to ambush Moyers .
Moyers said O'Reilly can have an hour of airtime on his show and then he will appear on O'Reilly's .
And so chickenhawk Bill comes up with this character assasination .
Total complete filth , lying scum , fascists themselves .
Goebbels would be proud of this crap from Fox .
Crikey they absolutely disgust me .

Oh , riiight .. " Conservatives " are being edged out of the public forum .
Totally .. pause for breath .. oh give me a frickin ' break !!
I do n't know why people even give O'Wrylie the time of day .
He is rabid and a quasi- intellectual .
And a pompous *ss .
The corporate - owned media has been the bane of society for far too long and without any effort at " reform " they will eventually self - destruct .
A time will come when people will just look the other way and say " talk to the hand " and refuse to buy their wares .
I can't wait for the day ..:)

You 're kidding me , right ?
The first newspaper built in the U.S. was created to market its advertisers through the mail ( by the first Postmaster ) .
The keystone of libel case law was about a Governor shutting down the newspaper his rival had created .
The rival had created his newspaper to attack the Governor for not paying him money he was owed when he subbed as Governor of New York .
Where , in the illustrious history of journalism has there ever been truthiness ?
The concept of straight reporting originates every year in journalism classes and dies 3 months after graduation .
The history of journalism is as rife with power politics as any of the other estates .
As this site itself experienced over the past few months .

Sometime back on National Public Radio , a panel discussed the high cost of gasoline and what the next president should do about it .
When asked if we should be concerned about running out of oil , a panelist quipped that “ President Obama ” will create appropriate tax incentives for photovoltaics and oil will become so much “ useless sludge ” .
Am I alone in thinking that there is a general lack of understanding about what the future holds for all of us when petroleum runs out ?
Yes , We Eat Oil
When nitrogen is allowed to infiltrate a suitable body of water , the normal population of algae grows explosively .
It consumes available nutrients and oxygen , turns the water green , and kills most other species .
The algae , unable to thrive under the conditions they themselves have created , begin to die .
This is called an algae bloom .
Petroleum is humanity ’s source of nitrogen .
Increasingly , we ’re aware that it does n’t just heat our houses and propel our cars ; we actually eat it .
Through the twin miracles of modern agriculture and wet - milling , petroleum becomes nitrogen fertilizer , which becomes corn or soybeans , which become virtually every and any processed food product we know ( including virtually all meat and farmed fish ) .
[ 1 ]
In Michael Pollan ’s acclaimed book The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , he documents that over sixty percent of the average American ’s diet comes from ( petroleum - derived ) corn ! [ 2 ]
Why Do We Eat Oil ?
It ’s petroleum that allows one farmer to feed ten thousand people .
After all this time , it still costs less than a dollar to pump a barrel of oil out of the ground .
Cheap petroleum gave rise to an a sustained era of over - producing food , which led to an explosion in world population .
With any luck , petroleum will run out before we complete our algae - like “ bloom ” cycle .
Too Many People on Earth
Global climate change , dwindling aquifers , the accelerated loss of species and habitat are symptoms of a bigger disease : human overpopulation .
How do we know this ?
For one , simple arithmetic .
If you take the entire area of the earth ’s surface , subtract out oceans , deserts , and extreme latitudes , and divide the result by six billion people ( our current population ) , you get about four acres of habitable land per human , of which approximately two are suitable for growing food .
The debate , then , is about whether a few acres is enough to sustain each of us — that is , without petroleum .
Most people frame the issue in terms of carrying capacity .
Some estimates for the carrying capacity of our planet range between eight - hundred million and eight billion people .
( Actually , estimates vary more widely because determining what humans need , want , and then actually use , is non-trivial . )
The lower number reflects the notion that there is not just a physical carrying capacity , but a social carrying capacity for the planet , which takes into account issues of competition , free will , and so forth ( “ human nature ” ) .
If you ask a person on the street , likely they ’ll tell you that Earth ’s carrying capacity is around , or somewhat above , our current population .
In other words , most folks assume that there is always room for a few more of us .
I ’d argue that we ’ve already way overshot the mark .
Smallest Footprint Too Big
Is the lower number more realistic ?
I ’ve met a number of people who ’ve attempted self - sufficiency on ten , twenty , and even forty acre properties .
Not for lack of ability or effort , but no one was successful : all were dependent on some amount of petroleum and petroleum - manufactured goods .
Observation and personal experience has led me to believe that estimates for sustainable footprints are low , chiefly because they ignore a dependence on fossil fuel energy , which will have to be made up by wood and other sources of fuel .
These require additional acreage to produce .
Consider that without access to oil or coal , the Romans denuded much of Italy ’s forests making cement and smelting steel .
What About Solar ?
Solar technologies ( photovoltaic , wind , hydro , and solar - thermal ) are vital . [ 3 ]
However , they ’re not a replacement for petroleum .
If you think about it , petroleum is just another form of solar energy .
Ignoring the time period and the process by which it was actually formed , petroleum represents stored solar energy equivalent to a significant fraction of all the sun ’s energy that struck the Earth for hundreds of years .
The trouble is that we ’ve gone through virtually all this energy in the last few decades .
( Ever had a cell phone that used more power than the battery charger could feed to it ?
Once dead , even plugged in , it will make no more calls for a while . )
Even with solar cells on every roof , we still ca n’t sustain our current population without petroleum .
We ca n’t imagine what it will be like to run out of oil .
What Does ‘ Decimation ’ Mean ?
Does recorded history offer any examples of large human populations faced with this level of stress ?
“ Lesser ” examples abound right now : competition for limited resources in areas like Somalia , Zimbabwe , Ethiopia , Palestine , and Iraq , to name a few .
( It ’s said that all wars , directly or indirectly , are about competition for resources . )
I do n’t mean to trivialize the suffering and upheaval in this places , but consider : at a carrying capacity number of eight - hundred million for our planet , and if we grow to eight billion by the time we effectively run out of oil , today ’s most pressing issue is that we need to reduce our population by ninety percent !
The definition of ‘ decimation ’ , by contrast , is only to reduce by one - tenth .
If we face anything like this “ reduction ” , it ’s hard to imagine that civil government — and modern economies — would n’t collapse , along with all the good stuff that comes with them : the ability to preserve the natural world and its species ; art , culture , technology , and wealth .
The Money ’s Gone !
If a common concern for most humans is ( monetary ) wealth , then consider : virtually all wealth as we know it is directly or indirectly petroleum - derived .
Even were that not the case , its still hard to imagine that currencies and other vital trappings of an economy can survive when a majority of the population does n’t .
Even economic theory seems to depend on stable , growing populations .
Birth Control ?
Theoretically , we might be able to achieve drastic population reduction through less chaotic means , through some form of birth control .
Call me a skeptic if you will , but I ca n’t see getting the consensus needed to make this happen .
Bottom Line
The fact that we are poisoning our planet and ourselves finally has everyone ’s attention .
What we address now may determine what , if anything , we leave our grandchildren .
Nevertheless , the scarier problem facing all of us is this : if we are significantly above the planet ’s carrying capacity , our population must , and will , shrink dramatically .
It seems that very few people believe population pressure poses such an urgent problem .
If overpopulation does n’t trump all the other problems facing us , I ’d like to know why .
Notes
[ 1] Wet - milling refers to processing that breaks up cereal grains into all manner of industrial components much the way petroleum is “ cracked ” to produce everything from petroleum jelly to solvents .
[ 2] Carbon atoms from corn have a distinct signature that allow them to be tracked from corn plant to human and animal consumers .
A piece of human hair , for example , can be analyzed to determine the amount of corn in an individual ’s diet .
Industrial - scale farming rotates soybeans and corn ; industrial consumers use whichever is cheaper .
This is the meaning behind food labels like “ contains corn and / or soybean oil ” .
Both are feedstock for wet - milling , but only corn has a traceable carbon signature .
[ 3] The sun heating air creates wind .
Water is evaporated and mobilized by the sun to higher elevations ; hydro-electric power generation harnesses this energy .

The article New York Daily News : ' Save the males ' :
Ho culture lights fuses , but confuses by Kathleen Parker is a useful read because she does a great job of articulating the rationalizations of sexual harassers and rapists and those who rush to defend them .
Her premise is that boys and men who cross ethical and legal boundaries are almost always victims of those girls and women they offend against .
This is nothing new .
In 2006 , Parker wrote a column defending a convicted rapist because of her judgments about the victim in that case so this article and her book , Save the Males , simply give more depth to explain exactly why she so easily decided to defend a rapist and view him as a victim who exemplifies the highest moral values .
From her latest article :
Such males may be forgiven if they 're not sure when greeted by a comely lass whether to grab a sword or a sheath - of the latex variety .
Or perhaps a shield .
To walk down any street in almost any town or city today is to be taunted by a parade of approaching midriffs featuring pierced navels and retreating " tramp stamps " — tattoos that rise like bait from too - tight , low - riding britches .
I 've walked down many streets and I 've seen attractive women with bared midriffs , but I 've yet to see a bared midriff taunt men or boys into physical or sexual violence or into fear for their safety .
Same goes for tattoos .
I 've seen plenty of them , but I 've never seen one taunt men or boys .
However , I have seen men and boys actually taunt girls and women based on a variety of excuses or for no reason other than gender .
But thanks to Parker , I now know those men tell themselves that they are morally superior hapless victims expressing their confusion and their powerlessness in reaction to taunts directed at them .
So if a man sees a " lass " who turns him on ( taunts him in Parker - speak ) and he responds by sexually assaulting her , he may be forgiven .
Exposed midriffs , " tramp stamps " and anything else these guys see which they are told are sexual become billboards of universal consent .
Kathleen Parker told them so .
Apparently , these males which Parker wants to save are incapable of having inter - gender social skills and they are incapable of understanding that individuals have boundaries which are n't the same as what has been laid out for them by people like Parker .
It is n't those who look sexual who are responsible for any confusion , it is people like Kathleen Parker who have decided that they have the right to declare certain girls and women ' ho 's and to offer up these girls and women for the taking and then to offer up a pre-packaged defense for the rape of those Parker disdains .
She even provides rationalizations for pedophiles and gives them someone else to blame -- moms .
Edgy 4 - year - olds can opt for T - shirts that say , " Baby Porn Star " or " I Faked It . "
Budding tartlets can find bustiers , stilettos and " pleather " pants in toy stores , as well as itsy - bitsy lingerie sets of lacy panties and bras . [...]
More curious than an infant girl wearing a shirt declaring that she faked it are the mothers who participate in their children 's sexualization .
Somehow I do n't think many dads are pimping their baby girls as orgasm fakers .
As a rule , dads do n't do the shopping for little tyke wardrobes .
Parker is calling mothers pimps while excusing all fathers because on average dads do n't do the clothes shopping with their children .
The many men who create or profit from products which sexualize young girls are blameless and in Parker 's universe they simply do n't exist .
" In 2003 , girls ages 13 to 17 spent more than $ 157 million on thong underwear . "
But not a single boy or man has any responsibility for this .
Amazing .
Same goes for the Peekaboo Pole Dancing Kit .
There can't be a single man employed at the company which makes this product , VS International LLC , and not a single boy or man has ever purchased such a product .
Parker makes it clear that men are always the victims of products such as this .
This approach of blaming women and girls while ignoring the deliberate actions of boys and men mimics the rationalizations of rapists .
Pedophiles have been offered these children by their mother / pimps .
Ca n't you imagine the jury listening sympathetically as the child rapist testifies , " But she was wearing a thong under her clothes as she toddled toward me !
I know because I went through her underwear drawer the day before .
If anyone should be convicted , it should be her mother because mothers generally do the clothes shopping . "
Parker mentions Jon Benet Ramsey and manages to turn my stomach by her reference to this murdered girl 's " Lolita eyes . "
That is nothing more than a sick projection .
But of course of all the women who are blamed for violence against girls , Parker herself is immune from accountability even as she blatantly excuses a murderer by making this person not be the cause of an innocent girl 's violent death .
Other little girls who look nothing like Jon Benet and who fit none of the sexy stereotypes listed by Parker are also targeted by sexual sadists so the idea that a certain look is the cause of sexual sadism has been proven to be false .
But that idea is so handy that many people keep it protected like a valuable antique handed down through the generations .
Parker has no interest in doing anything except finding examples which allow her to blame someone besides the boys and men who choose to harass or be sexually violent .
In doing so she creates the illusion that sexual harassment and sexual violence did n't exist before g- strings came in child sizes .
The trend of scantily clad has been a marvel to behold to those of us weaned on Hepburn & Hepburn in the Age of Absolutely Not .
That 's what parents used to say when a girl wanted to wear makeup to school , or ditch her white socks and shave her legs too soon , or wear too short a skirt .
The point she ends up making with this example is that the habit of blaming girls ' clothing and grooming choices for sexual harassment and rape are things Parker grew up with and accepted eagerly .
For Parker , the lack of prosecution for non-stranger rapists in decades past was as it should be and she is nostalgic for those good old days when those like me were raped and scared into silence by all those shaming messages which threatened to put a target on our backs if anyone knew we were n't virgins and therefore no longer safe from the accepted sexual harassment we saw directed at the girls who were labeled as easy .
If Parker , as a girl , heard about some other girl being forced into unwanted sex , she would blame the other girl if that girl wore makeup , ditched her white socks , shaved her legs too soon or wore too short of a skirt or if she could find some other way to blame the girl .
Then as a respectable girl , Parker would be able to label that other girl as a slut while thinking only good thoughts about that girl 's rapist .
What a high moral standard .
In less than a generation , girls went from sitting with their knees glued together , ankles cross demurely , to displaying their wares with the pride of a first grader showing off a new tooth .
By the turn of the millennium , America was populated by a generation of girls whose knees had never met , even casually .
So now girls who do n't sit with their knees glued together are asking for it .
Disgusting , but not surprising .
Here 's the last sentence of Parker 's article :
Once women sexually objectify themselves , it becomes harder to insist that others not .
This sentence is overflowing with both illogic and the rationalizations for sexual harassment and rape .
If this sentence were logical then men who wear clothing which can make them look sexy ( for example , wearing pants which do n't hide their erections ) are sexually objectifying themselves and therefore women are justified in commenting on their erections -- even in the office .
Further , women who see men with erections are justified , by Parker 's own logic , in grabbing those men's crotches and going on from there without the man 's express permission because universal permission has already been granted .
That man has sexually objectified himself so it becomes harder to insist that women not take actions which sexually objectify him .
Parker 's own logic tells us so .
Every behavior done by boys and men against girls and women which is excused by Parker must be excused when the genders are reversed if Parker 's logic is sound .
But from what I 've read of Parker , she would be disgusted at the thought of having her logic used to justify a girl or woman 's treatment of boys or men .
That occurrence would likely be given as proof that we are living in an evil ' ho culture rather than being seen as proof that living in a Kathleen Parker culture contributes to rape .
Here 's my rape prevention tip .
Avoid everyone who agrees with Kathleen Parker and avoid those who look to those people as their moral guides .
You may not know until too late what clothing choice , visual cue or movement gives them permission to proceed without the need to get your consent .

Ok , I admit it .
I ’m not your usual observer .
When I heard that Budweiser had been bought by the Euro - capitalists InBev , I was not concerned .
I do n’t care who owns the factories in the U.S. I do n’t worry the U.S. heartland is being infiltrated by foreign interests .
And certainly , I do n’t consider Budweiser a national treasure .
The truth is that it ’s almost undrinkable .
But my ears perked up when I read how Budweiser ’s maker , Anheuser - Bush had roots in St. Louis that went back before the Civil War .
Ah , my friends , THERE is a story worth telling .
And I ’m going to sit back in the damp heat of this Chicago evening , sip on a couple of Fat Tires , and tell it to you , just because I hate patriotic bullshit and because I love revolution .
* * * * *
First , there is nothing American about beer making in St. Louis .
St. Louis in the 1850s was a raw river town situated where the Missouri River and the broad Mississippi met .
It was a frontier town in many ways and the jumping off point .
It was the “ end of the line ” for civilization .
But it was also one of the first American industrial cities , with one of the heaviest concentration of of factory workers in the country .
And these workers were not native - born Americans .
A great many of them came straight from Germany — and formed part of a very large German speaking population that then dominated both the urban and rural landscape from St. Louis to Chicago , to Cincinnati and far into the farmlands of Pennsylvania .
And these immigrant workers were a very rowdy and radical bunch .
Many were veterans of Europe ’s great revolutionary battles of 1848 — the first upheavals when working class and communist revolution emerged as a living threat to the world ’s ruling classes .
And , at the same time , surrounding this heavily leftwing , working - class , German - speaking city was a countryside filled with some of the most ugly , racist , pro-slavery forces in the U.S. The Missouri River stretched west from St. Louis , and its shores were lined with slave plantations producing raw materials for twine — a product that shipped downriver to bind the cotton bales of the Mississippi Delta .
The slave owners of Missouri were quite militant .
They produced the political gangs called “ border ruffians ” who crossed the western Missouri border into nearby Kansas territory , where they engaged in armed struggle with abolitionists like John Brown over whether Bloody Kansas would be a slave state or free .
So you can imagine that there was a tension growing through the 1850s between the pro-slavery farmers of the Missouri floodplains and the anti-slavery and often communist workers of St. Louis .
There was a parallel , and little known cultural clash going on at the same time : the German workers arrived as beer drinkers and quite a few of them were first class brewers .
There were some Irish among the workers , and they too were fans of the Germans ’ sudsy “ liquid bread . ”
Before long St. Louis was peppered with huge German beer halls , where the often lonely immigrants found community and a feeling of home .
For reasons I have n’t yet uncovered , the reactionary political forces of Missouri territory were anti-beer .
Maybe they did n’t want this foreign culture to take root .
Perhaps they had some early religious prohibitionist logic .
But in any case , there was an early political clash when a major push was made to ban beer in St. Louis , and ( needless to say ) the German workers pushed back .
Here is an irony worth thinking about :
In the Mississippi river valley , this important historical clash started between beer lovers and hemp growers .
And , believe it or not , revolutionary sympathies go with the beer drinkers .
At a time when social organization among immigrants was primitive , the fight over beer helped spur a sense of common identity among the workers , and gave rise to a number of political newspapers .
And the movement that emerged from these circles were increasingly active in the fight over slavery .
I have on my bookshelf a rare little book that gathers articles and histories from these German immigrant newspapers — and it is clear how they started to articulate deeply revolutionary views that spoke for a highly conscious and engaged working class population .
You may have studied the civil war a little …
I know I have always been fascinated by this first , truly revolutionary war on U.S. soil .
And one thing to keep in mind was that the so - called “ border states ” were a key battle ground as the civil war broke out .
There was a strip of these states ( from Maryland through West Virginia , Kentucky , to Missouri ) that had sizable populations of slave owners and slaves but a general political mood that was divided over the issues of secession and war .
And in this fight over the border states , Maryland had a particular importance because it surrounded the Union capital , so that if it joined the slavery confederation , Washington DC would be harder to defend .
And the mood was so bad that Abraham Lincoln was almost killed in Baltimore as he traveled from Illinois to DC to assume the presidency .
At the other end of the country , St. Louis has a major strategic importance for the war :
It was the major anti-slavery center on the Mississippi .
( The next river city , Memphis , was a creature of the Mississippi Delta .
It was one of the urban nerve centers of the slave empire — filled with slave markets and holding pens . )
And so , as war broke out , all sides prepared to seize St. Louis by force .
And if it had fallen to the slavocracy , it would have been quite hard for the Union ’s armies to gain a foothold on the Mississippi , and it would have been that much harder to defeat the South .
On the surface , the politics of St. Louis did not look promising .
After 1860 , the new governor Claiborne Fox Jackson was clearly a pro-slavery diehard , and the bastard was scheming to secede from the Union and pull the state into slavery ’s confederacy .
Step by step the tensions mounted , and started to go from political to military preparations .
One focus of preparations was the state armory , the largest warehouse of weapons on the frontier .
Whoever controlled those guns would be better able to crush their enemies .
Here again beer enters the story .
Because the German workers started to prepare for battle .
Led by veterans of the 1848 Revolutions , they started to secretly train themselves in discipline and military tactics .
Their plan : to rise up against the state government in armed insurrection , to seize the armory , and defeat the governor ’s army .
Where did they do their drills ?
In the cavernous beer halls of St. Louis .
At a given time , they would gather .
The doors would be sealed and put under vigilant guard .
The tables would be cleared away .
And cartloads of sawdust would be scattered deep on the beerhall floors .
And with the sawdust muffling the tramp , tramp , tramp of their feet , the workers prepared themselves for war — learning the unit movements so central to the warfare of that day .
Outside , on the streets , the many spies of the governor could not hear what was going on within .
I wo n’t go into great detail about the heroic and fascinating ways that violence erupted .
Led by fearless army officer Nathaniel Lyons the anti-slavery forces struck , and struck hard .
They seized St. Louis and the armory .
And they shattered the schemes of the slave owners .
They routed the Governor ’s troops in the early battles .
And they bottled up the slaveowners of the Missouri River — cutting them off from the Confederacy .
What followed was one of the most bitter civil wars I have ever studied : Missouri was criss - crossed by vicious pro-slavery death squads that carried out horrific murders and mutilations .
Their raiders came dressed in a cloud of human scalps sewn into their clothes and bridles — as they spread terror among those who opposed the sale of human beings .
If you have ever wondered where the frontier killer Jesse James got trained , it was as a triggerman for one of the most notorious death squads of the slavocracy .
Hemp made its appearance here too , right in the midst of the fighting : in several key battles the Confederate forces build protective breast works out of the hemp bales pulled from their slave plantations , piling up the bundled hemp harvest to protect themselves from Union bullets .
Fighting against the slavocrats were a complex array of forces , and at their core were new Union army units led by radical Republican John Charles Fremont , recruited heavily from among the German workers of St. Louis .
The first known actions of communists in the U.S. was the revolutionary armed struggle of these largely German - speaking forces , led in part by Colonel Joseph Weydemeyer , an energetic communist co-thinker of Karl Marx .
These units militantly emancipated many slaves that fell into their hands .
This was in direct contradiction with the policy of President Lincoln who , afraid to offend the leading forces of other border states , insisted in the early days of the civil war that slaves should not be freed , but should be treated as “ contraband property . ”
In this dispute , Fremont was removed from the command of the Missouri armies , and these revolutionary working class forces were dispersed into larger armies in order to better control them .
There are , in my opinion , many lessons and insights within this story .
And more in the parts I have left untold .
But I tell this story now just to make a single point :
Anyone who thinks that Budweiser and the beer industry of St. Louis is a story of patriotism , Americanism , of all - American “ national treasures , ” of a whiteman ’s “ heartland ” of traditional values and conservative xenophobia …
Anyone who runs that story just does n’t know .
The story of beer in St. Louis is a story of communist immigrant workers who did n’t speak English , who hated the mistreatment of kidnapped Africans in the United States , who had little love for America ’s institutions , and who were willing to die ( and kill ! ) to end the horrific practices of human slavery .
Deal with it .
Pass it on .

But a final act of kindness may have led to the knife killing of Pat Regan , a leading figure in the Mothers Against Violence group .
Detectives investigating her murder were yesterday questioning her grandson Rakeem Regan , who has mental health problems .
The two were said to be ' very close ' and in recent weeks Mrs Regan had been desperately trying to get help for Rakeem , 20 .
Friends revealed she spent hours scouring the internet about his ' personality ' problems , called contacts for advice and even took him to a doctor to try to get treatment .
But she was said to be frustrated that the authorities would do nothing as Rakeem was over 18 .
She warned of the dire consequences if nothing was done .
Mrs Regan was stabbed to death at her home early on Sunday morning and Rakeem was later arrested on suspicion of her murder .
Yesterday Mrs Regan 's eldest son
Shane wept as he said : ' She had dedicated her life to stopping violence like this .
What has happened has come as a massive shock to all of us and we 're just trying to piece together in our heads what has gone on .
I 'm heartbroken that she 's not here any more .
I just can't believe it - none of us can . '
A stream of well - wishers placed flowers outside Mrs Regan 's council flat .
The 53 - year - old mother of six was seen as a community hero .
Shot dead :
The campaigner 's son Danny was killed in a suspected gangland murder in December 2002
She founded the Leeds branch of Mothers Against Violence after her 26 - year - old son Danny was shot dead in 2002 in a suspected gangland attack .
Friends spoke of her battle to get help for Rakeem - the son of her daughter Frances .
Fellow campaigner Lorraine Fraser said : ' She was a very brave lady and screamed out for help for that child .
' She said " If anything happens , you 'll soon be down to help . "
And look - something has happened and everybody 's too late . '
Another friend added : ' The problem has been to do with his state of mind .
He was not very well but you can't force an 18 - year - old into doing what you want and she was trying to get him the help he needed . '
A police source confirmed Rakeem was receiving mental health treatment as an outpatient .
Rakeem wrote on Friends Reunited that he was ' taking a career break ' and added he was ' preparing for something big ' .
On her web page Mrs Regan put her interests as 'my grandchildren .
. . and trying to save lives ' .
The full - time volunteer had been struggling through lack of funds and faced closing her campaign office .
Two weeks ago she wrote : ' I do not have any funds left and I will be giving my office space up at the end of this month . '
Her determination to combat crime had won the respect of politicians and even took her to Downing Street to join Tony Blair at a summit on gang crime .
Yesterday Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : ' I was extremely shocked and saddened to hear about the tragic death of Pat Regan .
I had met Pat on several occasions and had been greatly impressed with her dedication .
Pat worked tirelessly and achieved a great deal . '
Friend and fellow campaigner Angela Lawrence said : ' She was a beautiful , very generous and loving person .
' Pat lost her own son and did n't want to let anyone else go through what she went through . '
Cold comfort : Mourners clutch each other as they try to absorb the death of their friend
Hilary Benn , MP for Leeds Central and Environment Secretary , added : ' She made a huge impression on me and on everyone she met .
' She was determined to do all she could to stop any other mothers going through the pain and suffering that she experienced when her son Danny was killed .
' Her passionate belief that things did not have to be this way shone through in everything she did .
It is why she will be greatly missed . '
Investigation : Forensic officers in protective clothing prepare to examine Mrs Regan 's flat
Greg Mulholland , the MP for Leeds North West , added : ' She was such a down - to - earth person , who managed to have a great sense of warmth and humour despite the tragedy that she suffered when she lost her son Danny to gun crime .
" She was an inspiration to people not only here in Leeds but also to people up and down the country with her tireless campaigning .
She will be a real loss to the community she loved and to the campaign she set up and championed . '
Mrs Regan 's first floor flat in the Hyde Park area of Leeds was sealed today and its window shrouded by tarpaulins as officers moved in an out .
Bunches of flowers including a bouquet of red roses and other tributes had been left by friends and family at the entrance to the block .
One note read : ' My wonderful grandmother .
RIP Pat .
Love and miss you always .
Never forgotten .
Kyle .'
Mrs Regan 's husband was among a group gathered outside .
Sobbing , he said he was too upset to talk .
Ashla France , who arrived to lay some flowers with her son Vinod , said : ' She gave the community a voice .
I 'm here on a personal note - she helped me and my family .
It made me want to get involved in the work she did . '
Sylvester Johnson , 74 , said he was stunned at the campaigner 's death , who he described her as a ' quite remarkable young lady '
' Since her son died , she campaigned more for the better .
She did n't want any young people to get caught up in the trouble that her son got caught up in , ' he said .
A former neighbour , who was walking her dog past the estate added that Mrs Regan had always been ' happy and bubbly ' .
She said : ' Everybody had a lot of respect for her .
She always kept herself busy , especially with her campaigning .
She was normally a really happy person . '
' I saw her quite depressed over Christmas but that was to be expected really after her son Danny was shot a while back . '
Determined : Mrs Regan and fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside Number 10 after an anti-gun crime summit last year
Mrs Regan had desperately tried to steer Danny away from a life of crime and never allowed him to bring home drugs or guns .
Shortly before he was murdered , he had spoken of trying to turn his life around , she revealed in an interview last year .
' He was going to run a nightclub in Middlesbrough .
He said he wanted a girlfriend who did n't need to take drugs at the weekend to have a good time .
He wanted an intelligent girl to bring him out of the street life , ' she told the BBC .
After his death , she set up her own organisation in Leeds , visiting schools to give talks about the dangers of getting involved in crime .
Co-founder of the group , Dee Edwards said today : ' She 's made such a big difference to so many people 's lives .
This is an absolute tragedy for so many people . '
' It 's just the most dreadful news for everyone .
She 's just an amazing woman .
We just love her to bits , she 's just an incredible lady , I just can't take this in . '
Her voice breaking with emotion , she added : ' She 's open , she 's honest , she 's got a massive heart , she helped so many people ...
' We were terrified something like this would happen to her . '
Grief : Friends of Mrs Regan 's could not contain their tears as they laid tributes outside the flats where she lived
A mourner lays flowers in the sea of those which had already been sent by people touched by Pat
Another colleague , Lucy Cope , described Mrs Regan as an ' amazing lady ' who had touched the lives of all who knew her .
' She did n't have a bad bone in her body or a bad word to say about anybody .
I was honoured to be her friend , ' she said .
' All the mothers have been on the phone this morning crying , all heartbroken .
A part of us has been taken .
It 's just horrendous . '
Of her work , she added : ' Every single time another family went through the tragedy of gun crime in Leeds , Pat Regan knocked on that door and held the hands of the mothers .
She will never be forgotten , never . '
Mrs Cope said her friend 's family had been ' her life ' .
' She doted on her children .
She was a devoted grandmother and mother , ' she said .
As a campaigner , Mrs Regan attended an anti-gun summit at Downing Street last year after a spate of teenager killings across the country .
Later in the year , she praised the Government for finally taking action on the issue but said young people appeared to no longer respect their own lives or those of others .
Speaking at an event for another murdered man in 2006 , Mrs Regan declared : ' It has got to stop .
How many more young people are going to die before something is done ?'

If this all seems like too much information , well , blame Church himself .
As the director of the Lipper Center for Computational Genetics at Harvard Medical School , he has a thing about openness , and this information ( and plenty more , down to his signature ) is posted online at arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/pers.html .
By putting it out there for everyone to see , Church is n't just baiting identity thieves .
He 's hoping to demonstrate that all this personal information — even though we consider it private and somehow sacred — is actually fairly meaningless , little more than trivia .
" The average person should n't be interested in this stuff , " he says .
" It 's a philosophical exercise in what identity is and why we should care about that . "
As Church sees it , the only real utility to his personal information is as data that reflects his phenotype — his physical traits and characteristics .
If your genome is the blueprint of your genetic potential written across 6 billion base pairs of DNA , your phenome is the resulting edifice , how you actually turn out after the environment has had its say , influencing which genes get expressed and which traits repressed .
Imagine that we could collect complete sets of data — genotype and phenotype — for a whole population .
You would very quickly begin to see meaningful and powerful correlations between particular genetic sequences and particular physical characteristics , from height and hair color to disease risk and personality .
Church has done more than imagine such an undertaking ; he has launched it : The Personal Genome Project , an effort to make those correlations on an unprecedented scale , began last year with 10 volunteers and will soon expand to 100,000 participants .
It will generate a massive database of genomes , phenomes , and even some omes in between .
The first step is to sequence 1 percent of each volunteer 's genome , focusing on the so - called exome — the protein - coding regions that , Church suspects , do 90 percent of the work in our DNA .
It 's a long way from sequencing all 6 billion nucleotides — the As , Ts , Gs , and Cs — of the human genome , but even so , cataloging 60 million bits multiplied by 100,000 individuals is an audacious goal .
The PGP stands as the tent pole of what Church calls his " year of convergence , " the moment when his 30 years as a geneticist , a technologist , and a synthetic biologist all come together .
The project is a proof of concept for the Polonator G.007 , the genetic - sequencing instrument developed in Church 's lab that hit the market this spring .
And the PGP will also put Church 's expertise in synthetic biology to use , reverse engineering volunteers ' skin cells into stem cells that could help diagnose and treat disease .
If the convergence comes off as planned , the PGP will bring personal genomics to fruition and our genomes will unfold before us like road maps :
We will peruse our DNA like we plan a trip , scanning it for possible detours ( a predisposition for disease ) or historical markers ( a compelling ancestry ) .
Bringing the genome into the light , Church says , is the great project of our day .
" We need to inspire our current youth in a way that outer space exploration inspired us in 1960 , " he says .
" We 're seeing signs that knowing about our inner space is very compelling . "
To Church , who built his first computer at age 9 and taught himself three programming languages by 15 , all of this is unfolding according to the same laws of exponential progress that have propelled digital technologies , from computer memory to the Internet itself , over the past 40 years : Moore 's law for circuits and Metcalfe 's law for networks .
These principles are now at play in genetics , he argues , particularly in DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis .
Exponentials do n't just happen .
In Church 's work , they proceed from two axioms .
The first is automation , the idea that by automating human tasks , letting a computer or a machine replicate a manual process , technology becomes faster , easier to use , and more popular .
The second is openness , the notion that sharing technologies by distributing them as widely as possible with minimal restrictions on use encourages both the adoption and the impact of a technology .
Inside the Personal Genome Project
The project will turn information from 100,000 subjects into a huge database thath can reveal the connections between our genes and our physical selves .
Here 's how .
— Thomas Goetz 1 . Entrance Exam Volunteers take a quiz to show genetic literacy .
One question :
How many chromosomes do unfertilized human egg cells contain ? a ) 11 , b ) 22 , c ) 23 , d ) 46 , or e ) 92 ?
( Answer : c. )
Only those with a perfect score proceed , but retests are allowed .
2 . Data Collection Volunteers sign an " open consent " form acknowledging that their information , though anonymized , will be accessible by others .
They fill out their phenotype traits , listing everything from waist size to diet habits .
Suitable respondents go on to the next step .
3 . Sample Collection Volunteers hit the medical center , where they are interviewed by an MD .
Then a technician draws some blood , gathers a saliva sample , and takes a punch of skin .
Do n't worry :
It hurts about as much as a bee sting .
4 . Lab Work
The tissues are sent to a biobank , where DNA is extracted from the blood .
One percent of it — the exome — is sequenced .
Meanwhile , bacteria DNA is extracted from the saliva and sequenced to reveal the volunteer 's microbiome .
5 . Research
Now the fun part : Crunching the numbers .
PGP scientists and other researchers start working with the data assembled from 100,000 individuals to investigate potential links between phenotypes and genotypes .
The team will look for patterns and statistically significant anomalies .
6 . Sharing
The volunteers get access to not only the raw data from their genome , but anything the research team gleans from their information .
Insights — a newly discovered cancer risk , for example — are posted in a volunteer 's file , which they 'll be free to share with other PGP participants .
" I always tell people , your biggest problem in life is not going to be hiding your stuff so nobody steals it , " Church says .
" It 's going to be getting anybody to ever use it .
Start hiding it and that decreases the probability to almost zero . "
For most of his career , Church has been known as a brilliant technologist , more behind - the - scenes tinkerer than scientific visionary .
Though he was part of the group that kicked off the Human Genome Project , he 's far less known than scientists like Francis Collins or J. Craig Venter , who took the stage at the end .
His obscurity is due partly to his style .
He talks about his accomplishments with a certain detachment that one might mistake for ambivalence .
" He 's not without ego ; it 's just a different sort of ego , " says entrepreneur Esther Dyson , a friend and one of the first 10 PGP volunteers .
" Everything is a subject of his intellectual curiosity , including himself . "
His low profile may be the result of his tendency to get too far ahead of the curve , working a decade or two ahead of his field — so far that even the experts do n't always get what he 's talking about .
" Lots of George 's work is so advanced it 's not ready to become standard , " says Drew Endy , a professor of bioengineering at Stanford and cofounder with Church of Codon Devices , a synthetic - biology startup .
" He 's perfectly happy to spin out tons of ideas and see what might stick .
It 's high - throughput screening for technology and science .
That 's not the way most people work . "
But thanks to the PGP , the Polonator , and the fact that the rest of the world is finally starting to understand what he 's been talking about , Church 's obscurity is coming to an end .
He sits on the advisory board of more than 14 biotech companies , including personal genomics startup 23andMe and genetic testing pioneer DNA Direct .
He has also cofounded four companies in the past four years : Codon Devices , Knome , LS9 , and Joule Biosciences , which makes biofuels from engineered algae .
Newsweek recently tagged him as one of the 10 Hottest Nerds ( " whatever that means , " Church laughs ) .
For someone who has spent his whole career ahead of his time , he is suddenly very much a man of the moment .
Most historians would cite Prague or Paris or Berkeley as the intellectual hub of the 1960s , but for people interested in computers , there was no place so significant as Hanover , New Hampshire .
There , at Dartmouth College , an experiment in time - share computing was flourishing .
Developed by professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz , the Dartmouth Time - Sharing System let students remotely access the power of a mainframe computer to do calculations for mathematics or science assignments or to play a simulated game of college football .
It ran on an easy - to - learn , intuitive program that Kemeny and Kurtz called Basic .
In 1967 , the DTSS transitioned to a more - powerful GE - 635 machine and offered remote terminals to 33 secondary schools and colleges , including Phillips Academy , a prep school in nearby Andover , Massachusetts .
The terminal — not much more than a teletype machine , really — sat in the basement of the school 's math building , forgotten until the next fall , when a young George Church showed up for his freshman year and began asking whether there was a computer on campus .
Someone pointed Church to the basement .
" There was n't even a chair in the room .
I had used a typewriter before , but never a teletype .
And so I just started pressing keys , " Church recalls .
" Eventually I hit Return , and it came back with ' What ? '
And so I started typing in stuff like crazy and hitting Return .
And it kept coming back with ' What ? '
At that point , I was pretty convinced it was n't a human , but it was actually talking in words .
So I just had n't asked the right question or given the right answer . "
Soon , Church found a book on Basic .
" I was just sailing , " he says .
He spent endless hours in that basement — he eventually borrowed a chair — and taught himself the intricacies of coding , learning to program in Basic , Lisp , and Fortran .
Indeed , thinking in code came so naturally to Church that he stopped going to his classes ( a habit that would later get him kicked out of graduate school at Duke ) and taught the computer linear algebra instead .
It turns out that learning how to write code — change it , hit Return , see what it will do — was ideal training for Church 's eventual career in computational biology .
" That 's how we reverse engineer things like E. coli — you change something , and you see how it behaves , " he says .
" Little did I know that 30 years later , we would use almost exactly the same operations to optimize metabolic networks . "
Church first hit on the power of computation to automate biology in the mid-'70s when he was in graduate school at Harvard .
At the time , he was working on recombinant DNA , a then - new technique to splice a gene from one organism into another .
Identifying a sequence of 80 or so base pairs of genetic code was a slow , tedious process .
" You had to literally read off the bases and write them on a piece of paper , one by one , " Church says .
" So I wrote a sequence - reading program that would crunch it out .
When the senior graduate student heard I had automated that , he said , ' What do you want to do that for ?
That 's the only fun part . ' "
By 1980 , when Church 's adviser , Wally Gilbert , won the Nobel Prize for DNA sequencing techniques , the process was still slow and expensive , executing one DNA strand at a time .
So Church began working on one of his earlier targets for automation .
His idea was to sequence several strands together by combining them into a single sample mixture .
He called it multiplexing , drawing an analogy to signal multiplexing in electronics , in which more than one signal flows through a current at the same time .
Church thought most of the work could even be integrated into one device rather than numerous machines .
It was a provocative idea , not just because he was substituting several human tasks for machine - driven ones , but also because he did n't make the usual false promise that technology would simplify the process .
On the contrary , multiplexing would be complicated , Church maintained .
But technology was up to the task .
Four years later , Church was invited to present his work on multiplexing at a small meeting in Alta , Utah .
The Department of Energy had gathered about 20 scientists to mull over one question for five days :
How might recent advances in genetics be used to measure an increase in genetic mutations arising from radiation exposure , as in Hiroshima ?
The group quickly reached the conclusion that technology circa 1984 could n't answer that question .
Meanwhile , they still had several more days in the mountains .
" There were a bunch of us there who could talk about genomics as if it were an engineering exercise .
And then we said , well , as a kind of booby prize , we could think of other things you could do , " Church recalls , " like , say , sequencing the human genome . "
Though Church was almost entirely unknown before the meeting , his presentation on multiplex sequencing methods stole the show .
When he fell into a huge snow drift during a break one afternoon , one participant worried that the future of sequencing had disappeared with him .
That Alta brainstorm would become the Human Genome Project — the effort , adopted by the National Institutes of Health , to sequence one human genome for $ 3 billion within 15 years .
However audacious the HGP seemed , Church was disappointed by it almost from the start .
" We could have said our goal was to get everybody 's genome for some affordable price , " he says , " and one genome would be a milestone " on the way toward that goal .
The HGP also played it safe with its choice of technology .
Despite the promise of Church 's multiplexing system , the HGP instead used a more established instrument manufactured by Applied Biosystems , based on a technique developed by biochemist Frederick Sanger .
As Church saw it , this meant that the project had failed to put its $ 3 billion toward improving the state of the art .
Even worse , the HGP consumed so many of the resources available to the field of genetics that it effectively locked that state of the art into 1980s technology .
The result was nearly two decades of inertia .
It was n't until 2005 , when the Human Genome Project was complete and new goals were put forth , that Church finally perfected the multiplexing approach he had presented 20 years earlier at Alta .
In a paper published in Science , Church demonstrated a technique that could analyze millions of sequences in one run ( Sanger 's method could handle just 96 strands of DNA at a time ) .
And Church 's method not only accelerated the process , it made it far cheaper , too , elegantly demonstrating the power of automation to drive exponential advances and bring down costs .
Church 's approach , and a competing innovation developed by 454 Life Sciences that same year , inaugurated the second generation of sequencing , now in full swing .
In the past three years , more companies have joined the marketplace with their own instruments , all of them driving toward the same goal : speeding up the process of sequencing DNA and cutting the cost .
Most of the second - generation machines are priced at around $ 500,000 .
This spring , Church 's lab undercut them all with the Polonator G.007 — offered at the low , low price of $ 150,000 .
The instrument , designed and fine - tuned by Church and his team , is manufactured and sold by Danaher , an $ 11 billion scientific - equipment company .
The Polonator is already sequencing DNA from the first 10 PGP volunteers .
What 's more , both the software and hardware in the Polonator are open source .
In other words , any competitor is free to buy a Polonator for $ 150,000 and copy it .
The result , Church hopes , will be akin to how IBM 's open - architecture approach in the early ' 80s fueled the PC revolution .
In the sequencing game , though , the cost of the machine is only half the equation .
The more telling expense is the operating cost , particularly the cost of sequencing entire human genomes .
Executives at 454 estimate that their latest machine can pull off a whole genome sequence for $ 200,000 .
Applied Biosystems claims its instrument has completed a genome for just $ 60,000 .
Church maintains that , while the Polonator is n't up to whole - genome reads , it is clocking in at about one - third the cost of Applied Biosystems ' estimate .
A whole sequence from Knome , the retail genomics firm cofounded by Church , goes for $ 350,000 .
( It 's worth noting that these figures are only roughly comparable , since each company uses slightly different quality measures and specifications . )
As these numbers continue to drop , the mythical $ 1,000 genome comes ever closer .
Sequencing a human genome for $ 1,000 is the somewhat arbitrary benchmark for true personalized genomics — when the science could become a component of standard medical care .
An important catalyst in achieving that point is the Archon X Prize for Genomics , which is offering $ 10 million to the team that can sequence 100 complete genomes in 10 days for less than $ 10,000 each .
As of June , seven teams , including Church 's lab , had entered the competition .
Church , who served for a time on the advisory board of the contest , says that the prize will drive costs down further and help publicize the potential of personalized whole - genome sequencing .
That 's important because Church hopes the Polonator and other next - generation instruments will inspire a new generation of smaller labs to begin work in personal genomics , as well as other genetic sciences .
Already , the onslaught of technology has jump - started new projects , like sequencing part of the Neanderthal genome , examining extremophile microbes in old California iron mines , and studying the regenerative properties of the salamander .
In medicine , cheaper sequencing has enabled research into drug - resistant tuberculosis ; the genetics of breast , lung , and other cancers ; and the DNA architecture of schizophrenics .
But if the Polonator is going to lead that charge , it has to work — and work on a massive scale .
And that means passing a major test : successfully sequencing the 100,000 exomes in the PGP .
All of us know our height , weight , and eye color .
Fewer of us know our arm span or resting blood pressure .
But who among us knows the direction of our hair whorls or the Gell - Coombs type of our allergies ?
This is the level of detail that the PGP requires the 100,000 volunteers to reveal about themselves , a list staggering in its exhaustiveness .
The PGP will tally head circumferences , injuries , chin clefts and cheek dimples , whether volunteers can roll their tongues or hyperflex their joints , whether they dislike hot climates or are hot tempered , if they 've often been exposed to power lines or wood dust or diesel exhaust or textile fibers .
The project questionnaire asks how many meals they eat a day and whether they prefer their food fried , broiled , or barbecued .
It even demands to know how much television they watch .
And , of course , PGP volunteers will hand over most aspects of their medical history , from vaccines to prescriptions .
This phenotype data will be integrated with a volunteer 's genomic information , then combined with statistics from all the other subjects to create a potent database ripe for interrogation .
In contrast to the heavy lifting that genetic research requires now — each study starts from scratch with a new hypothesis and a fresh crop of subjects , consent forms , and tissue samples — the PGP will automate the research process .
Scientists will simply choose a category of phenotype and a possible genetic correlation , and statistically significant associations should flow out of the data like honey from a hive .
A genetic predisposition for colon cancer , for instance , might be found to lead to disease only in connection with a diet high in barbecued foods , or a certain form of heart disease might be associated with a particular gene and exposure to a particular virus .
Genomic discovery wo n't be a research problem anymore .
It 'll be a search function .
( This helps explain why Google , among others , has donated to the project ) .
The process began last year , and each of the first 10 volunteers has a background in medicine or genetics .
They include John Halamka , CIO of Harvard Medical School and a physician ; Rosalynn Gill , chief science officer at Sciona ( a personalized genetics nutrition company ) ; and Steven Pinker , the noted psychologist and author .
The other 99,990 participants wo n't be expected to be so elite , though they will have to pass a genetics - literacy quiz to demonstrate informed consent .
The general selection process , which starts with registration at personalgenomes.org , is scheduled to begin later this year .
Besides offering up their genomes , subjects will have to part with some spit and a bit of skin .
The saliva contains their microbiome — the trillions of microbes that exist , mostly symbiotically , on and in our bodies .
If phenotype is a combination of genotype plus environment , the microbiome is the first wash of that environment over our bodies .
By measuring some fraction of it , the PGP should offer a first look at how the genome - to - microbiome - to - phenome chain plays out .
The skin sample goes into storage , creating what would be one of the world 's largest biobanks .
Members of Church 's lab have devised a way to automate turning the skin cells into stem cells , and they hope to publish the technique later this year .
( Similar work has been done at the University of Wisconsin and Kyoto University . )
By reprogramming the skin cells using synthetically engineered adenoviruses , Church 's team can transform the skin cells into many sorts of tissue — lungs , liver , heart .
These tissues could be used as a diagnostic baseline to detect predisposition for various diseases .
What 's more , the reprogrammed cells could be used to treat disease , replacing damaged or failing tissue .
It 's an intriguing hint of how Church 's work with synthetic biology complements genomic sequencing .
Commentators whom I respect are saying , with conviction , that there 's no way the U.S. is going to attack Iran .
Alexander Cockburn , Jim Lobe and Tom Engelhardt , for example , say no .
Others whom I equally respect predict the opposite .
Gordon Prather , Ray McGovern , Scott Ritter and Justin Raimondo say yes , it 's going to happen .
Those proffering the comforting message that further insanity is not on the immediate horizon argue that the U.S. is overextended in Afghanistan and Iraq , that the military brass opposes an attack , and that the Condoleezza Rice faction of " realists " in the State Department is heading off Vice President Cheney and the neocons .
They point to the presence of Undersecretary of State R. Nicholas Burns at the recent six-nations talks with Iran , and talk of opening a U.S. interests section in Iran .
They note the furious denunciations of Rice in the Weekly Standard , presumed to articulate Cheney 's views , and suggest that the rage results from a sense of political defeat .
Those predicting an assault point to the incessant propaganda campaign against Iran , abject Congressional complicity in that campaign , military preparations in the U.S. and Israel , the recent flurry of U.S. - Israeli military contacts , the power of AIPAC and Israel in U.S. politics and specifically their influence on the impressionable mind of President Bush .
They point to the sidelining of mainstream intelligence reports that declare Iran has no active military program , and to the nearly identical rhetoric from Bush , McCain and Obama about how that ( probably non-existent ) program poses an " existential threat " to ( nuclear ) Israel .
They suggest Burns ' recent step and other small diplomatic initiatives are really cover , merely designed to convince the world that the U.S. is exhausting diplomacy before the bombing starts .
Having predicted a U.S. attack on Iran for several years during which it 's failed to materialize , at this point I think it 's a toss - up .
I believe that the president 's cabinet is , as Lenin would put it , " the executive committee of the bourgeoisie " of this country .
It mainly represents and is answerable to a ruling class .
Bush made it clear in the 2000 presidential race that the billionaires are " my social base . "
Obviously oilmen Bush and Cheney would love to secure U.S. control over the petroleum resources of Southwest Asia and establish military bases throughout the region in preparation for future rich man 's wars .
But on the other hand , U.S. capitalists and oil execs in general do not seem enthusiastically united in favor of the expansion of the conflict and the destabilization of regimes ( like the Saudi ) that they 've profitably worked with for decades .
The Wall Street Journal editors might be agitating for an attack on Iran , but the U.S. ruling class is in fact deeply divided on how to proceed .
When the Iranian regime in the summer of 2003 delivered a message to the Bush administration via the Swiss ambassador to Tehran , proposing talks towards a comprehensive settlement of issues between the U.S. and Iran , Colin Powell 's State Department first responded positively .
But Cheney 's team contemptuously dismissed the overture , sabotaging a positive response .
There 's been a " two - line struggle " underway at the highest levels : on the one side are the Cheney - neocon faction , a mix of anti-China geopolitical strategists and extreme Zionists , on the other the " realists " who doubt the benefits of the ongoing military engagements in Southwest Asia and feel alarmed by the prospect of a spreading war in the region .
It 's not at all clear that what government officials always term " the interests of United States " ( in reality , the interests of the corporate elite and those of U.S. imperialism ) would be well - served by an attack on Iran .
The blowback could actually be disastrous for the whole system .
But Dick Cheney , wielding unprecedented power as a vice - president , may think that a go - for - broke assault on Iran , Syria and Hizbollah in southern Lebanon is perfectly rational .
It would if successful complete the U.S. colonization of Southwest Asia , end the emerging alliance between Tehran 's mullahs and the al - Maliki regime in Iraq , place more resources of the region under U.S. hegemony , and allow further " containment " of emerging rival China .
Meanwhile Cheney 's busy foot soldiers , the neoconservatives , obsessed with the destruction of Arab or Muslim regimes that maintain a hostile stance towards Israel , are driven by the conviction that American power must be used NOW , by this unprecedentedly pro-Israel administration , to destroy the Iranian regime to save Israel from a " nuclear holocaust . "
We 're talking about the government of an imperialist country taking action that , in the judgment of its more rational agents and former officials like Brent Snowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski would n't serve the interests of the state and its ruling class .
( Not that they 'd put it in those words , of course . )
It 's action urged by a faction of the ruling class of Israel , a small country founded as a settler - state and at war with its Arab neighbors for sixty years .
Such appeals are echoed by the second largest and most effective lobbying organization in the U.S. , backed up by seemingly limitless funding and the support of the maybe 25 % of Americans whose religious beliefs incline them towards unswerving support for Israel .
The personality of the president could be key here .
George Bush is the representative of his class , but he is also a failed businessman , and someone easily influenced by advisors taking advantage of his ignorance of the world and general inattention to details .
He has a cruel streak ; recall his enthusiasm for the death penalty as Texas governor and his sickening mockery of a woman who had appealed for clemency ( " Please , " he mimicked her , pursing his lips in mock desperation in 1999 , " do n't kill me ! " )
Alongside that cruel streak , and indifference to human suffering so evident in the Hurricane Katrina episode , is a self - righteous religiosity ; recall his comment to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in 2003 that " God told me to smite [ Saddam Hussein ] .
And I smote him . "
Perhaps he really believes God talks to him .
Perhaps the neocons ( cynical secularists for the most part ) skillfully play upon such delusions .
The personality of the vice president is also a potentially decisive factor .
He well exemplifies the mentality of the Bush aide ( Karl Rove ? ) who in a conversation with Ron Suskind in 2004 mocked " the reality - based community , " comprised of people who " believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . "
No , he argued : " That 's not the way the world really works anymore .
We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality -- judiciously , as you will -- we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors ... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "
Cheney 's angry reaction to the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran 's nuclear program produced by the collective U.S. intelligence community in November 2007 is telling : having delayed its release , he rejected it out of hand because it contradicted the disinformation campaign in part conducted out of his highly secretive office .
He has never dropped his assertion that Saddam Hussein was working with al - Qaeda .
He is not only not a " realist ; " he is Machiavellian comfortable with lies , and enormous power to influence policy justified by lies .
Bush 's cabinet is the executive committee of the U.S. ruling class , but that cabinet and that class are divided .
So the president gets different kinds of advice and in the end , as he told Bob Windward , he " play[s ] by instinct . "
Thus it 's very possible that Bush will , in the near future , perhaps in a less than sober state , follow his instincts and order an attack .
If it happens , it will show the triumph of a uniquely American mix of bellicose Christian Zionism and geopolitical miscalculation over mainstream Wall Street and the ( rational ) military and intelligence establishments .
The attack on Iraq , based on claims that it posed a looming threat to the world and had some sort of 9 - 11 tie , was a leap into irrationality .
Most wars are justified by lies , but these lies were especially transparent even though , in the manipulated atmosphere of fear and anxiety following 9 - 11 , they acquired traction .
Nowadays the thinking population has soured on that war and its rationale and opposes any attack on Iran .
A minority --- the quarter or so who still believe Iraq was involved in 9 - 11 , supports Bush and the Iraq War --- believes more war in the Middle East will fulfill Biblical prophecy and pave the way for Jesus ' return .
They may reliably endorse even a horrific nuclear attack .
So is it going to happen ?
I do n't know .
The chief executive is the representative of his class , but this administration despite its unprecedented concentration of power seems to have lost the confidence and support of much of its own original base .
( Hence among other things the mainstream corporate media 's enthusiasm for Obama . )
There is fear within the ruling class that Bush and Cheney will hurl American and world capitalism into the greatest crisis since the 1930s , against the interests of Wall Street and the military industrial - complex , aided by a Congress filled with legislators ignorant of the basics of Middle Eastern history and culture and convinced that adhering to the AIPAC line will abet their political careers .
Bush / Cheney must know that if the U.S. attacks
Iran the price of oil will skyrocket , the American people suffer , hatred for the U.S. intensify universally ( except perhaps in Israel ) , and the Shiites of Iraq and Iran both wage a ferocious jihad against the U.S. troops in the region .
They may anticipate the unraveling of NATO , the collapse of the United Nations , and the abandonment of any notion of international law .
But they may really think these times of U.S. economic decline and the " existential threat " they imagine confronts Israel justify further empire - building through military terror --- what the world will perceive as madness .
The neocons see themselves as the Wise in the background , working through their willing , stupid agents in the foreground , steering the clueless masses through fear - mongering to support the reconstruction of the world on their terms .
Maybe they 'll get their way .
They must take comfort in the fact that despite mass disillusionment with the Iraq War , voters according to polls see warmonger John McCain as better able than Obama to conduct what they still conceptualize as a " War on Terror . "
They must smile at the Congressional votes endorsing their lies about Syria and Iran and signaling the administration that it 's free to attack either state at its discretion .
Maybe they lose some sleep worrying that Adm.
Michael Mullen and other military leaders will thwart their plans .
But they know that some well - placed , well - timed editorials by the likes of Norman Podhoretz , Bill Kristol , John Bolton , and Benny Morris screaming about an impending nuclear holocaust if the U.S. does n't act to protect Israel impact a lot of readers .
They know that Bush does not want to leave office with the Iranian regime still in power ; he wants its destruction part of his legacy , to be praised from fundamentalist pulpits for years to come .
In short Bush may , as an unwitting agent of what Hegel called " the cunning of Reason , " help along a process that , were he thinking rationally from his own ruling - class point of view , he would emphatically reject : the actual decline of U.S. imperialism .
My pessimism about the prospect of war is alleviated somewhat by that prospect --- the arrival of a period of " creative chaos . "
You may recall that Donald Rumsfeld used this phrase to refer to the havoc in Baghdad ( including the plundering of the National Museum ) during the U.S. invasion .
I refer instead to the possibility that horrific events might produce something entirely unexpected and potentially positive .
The First World War led to the Bolshevik Revolution ( on the whole , a move forward for humanity in my view ) and a wave of ( unfortunately abortive ) workers ' and soldiers ' revolutions in Europe .
The " War on Terror " against " insurgents " throughout Southwest Asia could increase the disgust towards U.S. policy felt throughout the world , alienate friends and allies , strengthen the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan ) , produce cracks in the " coalitions " fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq , and provoke punitive moves against the dollar while Americans struggle to cope with rapidly rising fuel and food costs .
If it hurts us deeply enough , it could produce a groundswell of protest in this country --- against things that are obviously intolerable and wrong --- greater than anything we saw in the sixties .
It could generate a revolutionary crisis .
How the people of the planet would rejoice in hearing news that the American people , rejecting imperialist war , are marching in millions , challenging their leaders , taking action towards real change !
But the future is truly unclear .

Details of the clashes that sparked the apparent air strike remain unclear Pakistan 's military has condemned an air strike by Afghanistan - based US forces that killed 11 of its troops as a " cowardly attack " .
The incident happened inside Pakistan , near the border with Afghanistan , as US - led forces tackled pro-Taleban militants .
The US military confirmed it had used artillery and air strikes after coming under fire from " anti-Afghan " forces .
It comes amid rising tensions between the US and Pakistan militaries .
The soldiers ' deaths occurred overnight at a border post in the mountainous Gora Prai region in Mohmand , one of Pakistan 's tribal areas , across the border from Afghanistan 's Kunar province .
Eight Taleban militants were also killed in the clashes , a Taleban spokesman said .
' Act of aggression '
In a statement , the Pakistani military quoted a spokesman who condemned " this completely unprovoked and cowardly act " .
Pakistan - US relations hit a low Meeting feared Pakistani militant
The spokesman said the incident " hit at the very basis of co-operation and sacrifice with which Pakistani soldiers are supporting the coalition in the war against terror " and added that the army had launched a " strong protest " .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says the statement was very strongly worded , describing the incident as an " act of aggression " .
A similar government statement condemned the " senseless use of air power " as " totally unacceptable " .
The US military said in a statement that coalition forces had been engaged by " anti-Afghan forces " near the checkpoint and fired artillery rounds at the militants .
It said the operation it was carrying out at the time had been co-ordinated with Pakistani forces , and that it was investigating the incident .
Maulvi Umar , spokesman for a pro-Taleban militant group in Pakistan , told the BBC : " The Afghan army and the US troops there were trying to set up a checkpost on the border .
" So we launched an attack on them from several sides and caused serious harm - and then the US and Nato forces began a series of air strikes . "
A spokesman for the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) in Afghanistan told the BBC that its troops had been fired on from across the border and retaliated by firing back .
Low ebb Both US forces and Nato - led coalition forces are operating in Afghanistan , with Nato focused mainly on peacekeeping and reconstruction and the US troops working more directly to combat militant activity .
Alleged US missile strikes have sparked anger in Pakistan The US has in the past launched missile strikes into Pakistani territory from unmanned aircraft , although it does not officially confirm such attacks .
Our correspondents says these strikes have caused anger in Pakistan as they are widely seen as a violation of its sovereignty , and there has been a lot of disquiet in Pakistan during the past month over the issue .
She says that if one of these air strikes is confirmed to have killed some Pakistani soldiers , it will certainly not help US - Pakistan relations , which some analysts say seem to be at their lowest ebb since the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US .
Pakistani troops have been killed in " friendly fire " on the border with Afghanistan on several occasions in the past .
But the latest is thought to have been the most deadly single incident .
' Smear campaign ' Taleban fighters have a strong presence in the border areas of the tribal districts and local administrators have little power there , although security forces keep a presence on the border posts .
Afghan and US - led forces accuse Islamabad of failing to stop infiltration by Taleban fighters who take refuge in Pakistan 's tribal belt along the frontier , and are worried that the Pakistani government 's recent peace talks with militants there will only give the Taleban more room for manoeuvre .
Late on Tuesday , Pakistan 's military denounced a report by the US - funded Rand corporation accusing Pakistan 's intelligence services and its paramilitaries of supporting Taleban insurgents with information and training .
The Pakistani military dismissed the claims as " factually incorrect " and " yet another smear campaign maligning Pakistan armed forces " .
Meanwhile , in a separate incident , three women and a child were killed in an operation by US - led forces in south - eastern Afghanistan targeting militant leaders , the coalition said .
An Interior Ministry spokesman told the Associated Press 31 people had died , mostly militants .
The death tolls could not be verified .

What are these ?
An Israeli soldier who aims his weapon at a handcuffed Palestinian and fires a rubber bullet at his toe is a very grave matter .
En route to stopping terrorists , or while dealing with rioters , there are many needless abuses of the Palestinian population .
Beyond the acts themselves , the images currently being circulated worldwide are giving Israel a bad name and boosting the sense that we ’re abusing innocent Palestinian protestors , and that we ’re the worst of nations .
Yet if we look a little further , beyond the toe , we should be discussing yet another issue that does not attract much attention .
This project of giving Israel a bad name in the world and smearing it is run by Israelis and Jews .
They are of the same ilk of the despicable characters behind the academic boycott initiative , the type of new historians and propagandists who are building a career at the expense of all of us .
Caught on Film IDF soldier documented firing towards bound Palestinian Ali Waked ( VIDEO ) Palestinian teen films soldier aiming towards bound demonstrator arrested in Naalin , firing rubber bullets while officer holds man 's arm ; Palestinian claims was injured by fire .
IDF : This serious incident negates army values IDF soldier documented firing towards bound Palestinian
The B’Tselem organization handed out 100 cameras , thanks to foreign funding , to Palestinian residents , who were trained and guided to capture images like the one noted above .
Yet these cameras are not meant to assist in performing journalistic duties .
After all , if tomorrow a Palestinian stones an Israeli car , uproots trees , or just tries to murder Israeli passersby ( things that , of course , would never happen ) no camera of a B’Tselem photographer will take any pictures , and no such images will make their way to the newspapers .
After all , this is not the mission of the Israeli Jews who assist the Palestinians in their war against the occupation .
Photogenic provocations
Sorry , but I ’m disgusted by that .
The fact that Jews are trying to catch the soldiers of their own country doing bad things by handing out cameras to our enemies is intolerable .
After for years now leftist Israeli politicians have failed to convince us during elections that we can make true peace with our friendly neighbors , now they just try to smear us ; to show us , and to show everybody , how terrible we are .
Even this would have been tolerable had it not been undertaken through the disgraceful modus operandi of propaganda cooperation with the enemy .
This method prompts photographers and their subjects to clash , arrive in their vehicles to settlements on purpose in order to elicit harsh responses , resort to provocative tours in Hebron , import all the crazies of the global peace movement to the security fence for a series of photogenic provocations , and entrap soldiers and settlers ( who regrettably fall into this trap occasionally . )
This project , run by B’Tselem ’s leftists , is called “ Armed with a Camera . ”
It is indeed an effective weapon in the war against the “ occupation . ”
The Jews of this radical leftist group , which should be referred to as “ Photography Now ” must be overjoyed every time they get good propaganda materials .
The media is fed by these materials as if B’Tselem ’s photographers are members of the news desk , and the girl who photographed the above - mentioned soldier even got an upgraded camera .
Meanwhile , we got to see another photo that again exposes the true face of those who cooperate with enemy propaganda .
A picture is indeed worth a thousand words .

Back to The Need for Attention to See Change
Last updated 27 May 2017 .
The Swarmplayer developed by the P2P - Next research group is now capable of streaming live video in true 4th generation P2P style using a zero - server approach .
With a $ 22 million project budget from the EU and partners , the P2P - Next research group intends to redefine how video is viewed on the Internet .
This new breakthrough technology allows everyone to broadcast a live stream , such as a webcam feed , to thousands of people , using around the same amount of bandwidth you would use to stream to one or two people .
With SwarmPlayer , the user can simply click on a “ live ” . torrent file and tune into any live BitTorrent channel .
To make this possible , the P2P - Next research group created a new .tstream format which is a regular . torrent with live capability .
The BBC is one of the parties currently testing the new BitTorrent streaming format , which is part of the P2P - Next project .
The scientific director of the project , Johan Pouwelse , told Torrent Freak that it ’s not just the BBC interested in this new technology : “ We are working with a lot of interested parties .
Through the European Broadcasting Union we are getting a lot of feedback .
We are expected to do more field trials in the near future . ”
If the technology turns out to be a success , broadcasters can save millions of dollars each year on video streaming projects .
ISPs on the other hand will be less excited , because they now pay for this bandwidth .
Most importantly , however , is that this technology allows individuals to broadcast their streams to thousands of users , without having to invest in lots of bandwidth .
YouTube 2.0 , sort of .
Pouwelse further told TorrentFreak that , unlike services such as Joost , they are fully committed to open standard and Open Source .
“ As a research project we , by definition , need to make things that others do n’t already have , without needing to worry about business models , ” he said , going on to explain how they got live streaming via BitTorrent to work .
“ To be relevant we remain BitTorrent compatible , ” Pouwelse said .
“ However , traditional BitTorrent is not compatible with streaming .
We solved this problem by dropping the tit - for - tat protocol and making something which is more generic , which we call Give - to - Get . ”
“ Give - to - Get tries to obtain video blocks just in time for displaying .
Tit - for - tat rewards people that give bandwidth to you , which does not work in the streaming case .
Instead , Give - to - Get gives bandwidth to people that are nice to others .
This is more powerful , but proved to be quite tricky to get working . ”
Indeed , streaming a webcam feed is totally different than downloading a huge video file .
What the Swarmplayer does is download and buffer one minute ’s worth of data , which is then traded with other people in the swarm .
The users are actively trading the buffered data .
A key breakthrough was that Dr. Arno Bakker got the “ UnDownload ( ) ” functionality working .
This is needed , because the player has to drop data after a while , since you ’re watching a continuous stream .
This turned out to require momentous revamping of 7 year old code . ”
For those who want to test the BitTorrent live streaming , there is a streaming test where you can tune in to a webcam in Amsterdam , or a 5 minute weather report ( not live ) from the BBC .
You can provide feedback and check out some of the statistics here .
More details about how to set up your own BitTorrent live stream are also available .
The Swarmplayer and the BitTorrent live streaming technology are still work in progress .
“ We hope that we can get this code solid and stable in a month , ” Pouwelse said , “ then we can focus on the next milestone of sharing ratio enforcement , where we give better video experience to those that upload more . ”
We will certainly keep an eye on these developments , as it may change the way we watch video online .

The web pages you see here are devoted to the Erma Werke Model EM1 and it 's variations .
Individuals seeking or having information on the history of the other weapons manufactured by Erma Werke , may wish to

ERMA - Werke 1922-1945
ERMA - Werke Post WWII
From the Collection of Holger Schlemeier
In February 1945 , 79 Mosquitoes of the R.A.F dropped almost 100 tons of bombs on the South and East of the old city center of Erfurt , causing 223 deaths .
In this attack all the ERMA factory buildings were destroyed and only the cellar survived .
ERMA - Werke 1945 -1996
At the end of the war Geipel was arrested as a war criminal for his involvement in the Nazi party and imprisoned by the Allied occupational force .
Geipel was able to secure his release from prison , underwent denazification , and became assistant Director for Heinrich Vollmer , at the Vollmer Waffenwerken .
With the end of WWII in May 1945 Allied Forces ordered the closure of all German weapon manufacturing facilities .
The facilities still intact were taken over by the military of the Allied Occupation Zone the company found itself in .
The entire Thuringen region was within the Russian Occupation Zone .
Marshal Shukow of the Russian occupational force ordered what was left of Erma Werke was to be liquidated on the 31st of August 1948 .
Geipel re-established Erma Werke in Bavaria in 1949 and in 1952 they acquired a screw manufacturing facility at 13 - 15 Johann Ziegler strasse in Dachau ( near Munich ) for the purpose of manufacturing and servicing weapons once again .
Son Rudolf Geipel became the Leading Engineer of the new ERMA .
The first few years production was geared to making household appliances .
About 1952 ERMA was granted a contract by the government of West Germany to service and produce parts for the various Allied Forces weapons that had been given to the German police by the allies .
With the independence of West Germany in May 1955 , the West German government granted ERMA permission to research , develop , and produce a new sub - machine gun .
West Germany 's police and military was seeking weapons more consistent with their own wants and culture , and wanted to replace the weapons given to them by the Allied Forces .
The sub - machine gun submissions by West German manufacturers , ERMA included , were passed by in favor of the Isreali Uzi .
The decision was purely political and created financial hardships for the West German companies who had invested the financial backing and personnel necessary to compete for the contract .
The financial impact on ERMA was fatal .
In 1961 Erma Werke was taken over by Fiberglide , a division of Lear - Sigler , who continued operations under the Erma Werke name .
Geipel and his son left the company when it was taken over by Fiberglide .
Birth of the Erma Werke Model EM1 Training Rifle
The development and use of .22 caliber rifles constructed to operate and feel like a particular military weapon was fairly common in Europe during the 1900's .
One example is a .22 caliber training rifle used by the Germans to train their troops for use of the Mauser K98 main battle rifle .
Compared to the full size weapons , the training rifles and their ammunition were less expensive to produce , and helped newcomers to familiarize themselves with the weapons .
When Erma Werke was acquired by Fiberglide in 1961 plans were already underway for production of the EM1 Carbine look - a- like in .22 long rifle caliber for use as a training rifle .
The EM1 was adopted for use in training by the Austrian Gendarmerie [ U.S. Karabiner .30 M1 by Wolfdieter Hufnagl ] , who had obtained over 10,000 U.S. M1 carbines 1955 - 1957 .
How many EM1's were manufactured and used by the Austrian Gendarmerie is not known .
ERMA - Werke purchased surplus U.S. Army Ordnance tooling and machinery used during WWII to produce various parts for the U.S. M1 Carbines .
West Germany 's Office of Bombardment : The Proof Marks
In Europe there have been laws regulating the inspection of weapons to ensure safety , for hundreds of years .
During the war this was done by the German Waffenamt .
The Waffenamt inspection marks ended with WWII .
In 1952 West Germany established the Office of Bombardment , whose job it was to inspect various items for safety , including guns .
West Germany established more than one facility for this purpose .
The facility closest to Erma Werke of Dachau was in Munich .
The inspectors examine the weapons and stamp marks into the metal that indicate what type of gun powder the weapon was tested with , which Office of Bombardment conducted the test , and a two digit date code indicating the year it was inspected .
These marks are proof the weapon was inspected and have come to be known as " proof marks " from the " proof house " .
Because of parts being manufactured in quantity and stored for later use , the proof marks do not indicate the year any part was manufacturered , only the year the rifle was tested before being sold .

The ERMA - Werke E M1 .22 carbine goes Commercial
In Europe in the mid to late 1960's ERMA - Werke introduced a sporterized version of the E M1 , the EGMI Model 70 .
The stock had no sling hole , the front sight had an elevated single blade , and it is often found with a scope attached .
ERMA - Werke Model EGMI Model 70 introduced and sold in Europe
ERMA - Werke distributed all of their weapons sold commercially and overseas , from the start of commercial production until the end of their production , using Wischo Jagd und Sportwaffen GmbH & Company KG of Erlangen , located in Bavaria approximately 14 miles north of Nurnberg .
A retired director of Wischo who was with the company many years , related Wischo started their relationship with ERMA - Werke about 1960 [ private communication with this author courtesy of Robert Beeman Ph.D. , Airgun Information Int'l ] .
Over the lifetime of Erma - Werke and their E M1 , Wischo distributed worldwide several hundred thousand of the ERMA - Werke EM1 .22LR , and a . 22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire version , designated the Erma - Werke Model ESG 22 .
One of their larger markets was France , but they also exported these two models to the Far East ( Thailand , Pakistan , and others ) and South America ( Brazil , Ecuador , and others ) .
One customer was a South American country whose military issued the ESG 22 to their troops that worked in dense jungle areas and called the rifle a " jungle carbine " .
The Wischo director indicated that all of Erma - Werke 's rifles were manufactured at Erma 's facility in Dachau , and the stocks for the various E M1 based models were supplied by Sile of Italy .

In October 1968 U.S. Congress passed the 1968 Gun Control Act .
Weapons imported into the United States thereafter were required to have the importer 's name , city , and state stamped on the weapon .
L.A. Distributors stamped this information on top of the receiver between the bolt and rear sight .
L.A. Distributors was owned by Louis Imperato ( L ) .
His son Anthony ( A ) has been actively involved with his father as a family business .
The American Rifleman issue of September 2001 on page 76 has an article entitled Henry Repeating Arms .
It details the history of Lou Imperato and his endeavors in various gun related businesses .
Lou Imperato was interviewed for this article .
Regarding L.A. Distributors , the article states Imperato started L.A. Distributors in the 1960's , importing various guns from Germany , Italy , and Spain selling them to wholesalers in the United States .
The article states L.A. Distributors business ended with the passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act .
The proof mark on the above E M1 stamped L.A. Distributors is 1969 .
The annual editions of Gun Digest and Shooter 's Bible indicate L.A. Distributors imported the " M22 " from 1967 - 1971 .
Lou Imperato's involvement with ERMA - Werke and the E M1 did not end with the demise of L.A. Distributors , as will be discussed below with Imperato and Iver Johnson 's Arms .
RG Industries of Miami , Florida 1972 - 1975
Between 1972 and 1975 the M22/E M1 was imported to the United States by RG Industries of Miami , FL .
RG
Industries incorporated in Florida in October 1968 and imported various inexpensive weapons from Europe , including revolvers manufactured by Rohm .
RG Industries also went by the name Rohm Tool Corp. and Union Tool Disc , with administrative offices in Miami and Panama City , Panama , under the name Union Tool Management Corporation .
RG
Industries and these other companies lasted into the 1980's , however , they dropped the Erma E M1 from their line of products sometime in 1975 .
No examples of the Erma E M1 imported by RG Industries have been located so far .
They should be identifiable by the presence of RG 's import mark which was probably located on the barrel .
Excam of Hialeah , Florida 1978 - 1985
Excam incorporated in Hialeah , FL in November 1974 .
Like RG
Industries , they imported many inexpensive weapons from Europe .
In 1978 they became ERMA - Werke 's sole distributor for the Erma E M1 .
They placed their import mark on the right side of the barrel between the barrel band and front sight .
In 1978 Excam introduced Erma 's Model ESG 22 , the E M1 modified for the .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire ( WMR ) .
SPECIFICATIONS ERMA Model ESG 22 Caliber : .22 WMR Mechanism Type : Semi-automatic ,
gas operated , locking bolt Sights : rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation ,

on the left side of the barrel , forward of the barrel band
The serial number on the .22 magnum 's is located on the bottom of
the trigger housing , which is actually the lower half of the receiver
Excam dropped the Erma Werke rifles from their line sometime in 1985 .
The company filed for bankruptcy in November 1990 .
Beeman Precision Firearms of Santa Rosa , California 1984 -1985
In the early 1980 's Beeman Precision Airguns expanded their line of products to include a number of high end rimfire and centerfire rifles from West Germany , becoming Beeman Precision Arms Incorporated .
Their first catalog is dated Spring 1984 and includes four rimfire rifles manufactured by Erma Werke in Dachau , West Germany .
Two of the rifles were lever action and pump action American Western style single shot rimfires .
The other two rifles were the Erma E M1 in .22 LR and the ESG 22 in .22 WMR .
Beeman 's owner , Robert Beeman PhD , indicated his company sold only one Erma E M1 and no Erma ESG 22's .
The original intent of selling quality rifles Beeman imported from Europe changed before the Erma rifles became available .
Beeman chose to focus on several specific rifles from Europe instead of a large varied quantity from many manufacturers .
Dr. Beeman sold Beeman Precision Arms and retired in April 1993 .
He maintains his interest in air rifles and their history at Robert Beeman Ph.D. , Airgun Information Int'l .

Iver Johnson 's Arms of Jacksonville , Arkansas 1986 - 1987 , 1989
Louis Imperato ( L.A. Distributors ) purchased Iver Johnson Arm's in 1973 and about 1975 moved the company into the M1 carbine production facility of Plainfield Machine Co. in Middlesex , New Jersey , which he had also purchased .
Plainfield machine ceased to exist and .30 caliber carbines were manufactured and sold under the Iver Johnson 's name .
In 1980 Imperato sold Iver Johnson's , the new owners relocated Iver Johnson 's to Jacksonville , Arkansas .
In 1985 the owners declared bankruptcy and Iver Johnson 's once again passed into the hands of Louis Imperato , who kept the company in it 's facility in Jacksonville , AR .
Iver Johnson Model EW.22HBA new in the box
In 1986 Iver Johnson 's Arms introduced the Model EW.22HBA in .22 LR ( the E M1 with a longer barrel ) and the EW .22MHBA in .22 WMR ( an ESG 22 ) .
Both of these rifles were manufactured by Erma Werke in Dachau , West Germany for Iver Johnson .
The Iver Johnson name replaced the name of Erma Werke on the left side of the receiver .
" Made in West Germany " was placed on the right side of the receiver , the Iver Johnson owl trademark was added to the top of the receiver near the proof marks , and the Iver Johnson 's import mark was located on the right side of the barrel .

The Long ( Essay ) Version
( Portions adapted from a talk I gave to the C++/ Java Sig in New York City in May 2005 . )
Stevens Institute of Technology — a small engineering and science school in Hoboken , New Jersey — was the first college to require all incoming freshman to take a programming course .
In 1971 when I entered Stevens Tech as a freshmen , the course was E11 and the language was FORTRAN IV .
Stevens
Tech had a DEC PDP - 11 in the basement of the library , along with a bunch of IBM keypunch machines .
You typed each statement of your program on a card , and then submitted the deck to the snotty guru behind the counter , who would sometimes riffle through the cards and say " I see a few syntax errors in there , but let 's run it through anyway . "
And sometime later you would pick up a stack of printed paper .
If your program was so bad it could n't run , you 'd get a tiny stack .
But sometimes if your program ran and ran and ran , you 'd get a very tall stack of paper .
That was the most embarassing .
There was also a room in the library basement with several teletypewriters connected to the PDP - 10 where you could do stuff in real time , but you had to belong to the ACM to use the teletypes , and those guys were strange .
I did n't much like programming then .
I had gone to college to be a mechanical engineer .
I liked making stuff with my hands , and computing seemed much too abstract for me .
I took only two other programming courses in college .
One was on numerical analysis using FORTRAN , and the other was a course in assembly language .
The course in assembly language was taught by a math professor , Myron E . White , whose was universally known as Myron Epsilon White .
In the year I graduated , Professor White was the recipient of the annual Golden Ream Award — a gruesome - looking large gold - plated screw mounted on a board , which was supposed to symbolize what the professor had done to his students .
There was no textbook available for assembly language programming on the PDP - 10 so Professor White had written and published his own , a book entitled Meet Macro - 10 .
I 'm not sure what technology he used to publish this book , but a typewriter was definitely involved .
Each page looked like a typewritten sheet of 8 ½ × 11 - inch paper .
This course is assembly language was totally baffling to me .
I think I must have understood that assembly language actually translated to the machine code of the computer and hence was very fast and efficient , but when submitting programs on cards and getting back paper , processing speed was not something you witnessed first hand .
I eventually became a math major and when I graduated in 1975 I moved to New York City and got a job at New York Life Insurance Company as an actuarial student .
Some of the younger actuaries programmed , and new actuarial students were expected to program as well .
The actuaries coded in FORTRAN using punched cards on an IBM 1130 — a castoff computer from an earlier time .
The company 's main computer was a big IBM 370 , and within a couple years non -IT people like myself also got access to the 370 via a terminal system called Time - Sharing Option or TSO .
New York Life was one of the few major financial institutions that did n't do COBOL .
New York Life was a PL / I shop .
By this time , I was liking programming a lot better than in college , partially because I was getting pretty good at it , and also because I could make and correct my own syntax and runtime errors in the privacy of my own terminal , thank you .
No more snotty gurus behind the counter riffling through card decks .
PL/I was a glorious language .
It had a little something for everybody .
You could do reports in PL / I but you could also do hard - core science and engineering programming .
There was a FIXED DEC data type where you specified the number of decimal places .
The math library was very rich .
The DO loop was particularly versatile ( and I may not have the syntax entirely correct but you 'll get the idea ) :
DO I = 1 TO 5 , 6 TO 20 BY 3 , 100 , 120 , 1000 TO 1010 BY 2 ;
To this day I encounter problems where I think " I 'd really like to use the PL / I DO loop for this . "
You could also put these loops right in your WRITE statements .
Meanwhile , at home , I was working with my hands .
I had an interest in electronic music ( beginning with the 1968 release of Switched On Bach ) and by about 1977 I had started building electronic music instruments out of CMOS chips .
With the help of a couple books ( Don Lancaster 's " cookbooks " were instrumental ) I had taught myself digital logic circuitry , and I was wiring up chips with a wire - wrapping gun to make little electronic - music sequenzers .
I had seen Philip Glass 's Einstein on the Beach at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1976 , and an early performance of Steve Reich 's Music for 18 Musicians ( and other works ) at The Kitchen around that time , and I really liked the idea of creating repetitive music .
Except I did n't want to play it — I wanted a machine to play it for me .
After building two sequencers , I remember designing a third where I 'd have certain codes in memory that would govern how notes stored in other parts of memory would be retrieved and moved around and repeated , and how the individual bits of these codes would trigger other chips , and I suddenly thought " I bet this is how computers work ! "
It was an epiphany the likes of which I have never ever experienced .
This was sometime in 1978 , I believe , and I knew there were chips called microprocessors , but I had n't really looked at them because they had seemed like overkill for what I was doing .
Suddenly they seemed ideal .
I realized that having a microprocessor at the center of an electronic music synthesizer would be very beneficial .
At that time there were two major 8 - bit microprocessors available for hobbyist use : the Intel 8080 and the Motorola 6800 .
The Barnes & Noble store on 5th Avenue and 18th Street ( the very first Barnes & Noble store ) had a good selection of technical books , but I think they happened to be sold out of books about the 6800 at the time I checked .
Instead I gravitated towards the 8080 , the beginning of a life centered around Intel architecture .
I sometimes wonder how my life would have been different if the Barnes & Noble had a good book about the 6800 in stock at the time .
After my hands - on experience with digital logic design , 8080 assembly language was a snap .
It was obvious to me exactly what every instruction did in terms of gates and registers .
Around 1979
I started building a computer - controlled digital electronic music synthesizer .
It took about two years and was based on a block diagram in an article in the Computer Music Journal , Vol. 1 , No. 2 ( April 1977 ) entitled " Design of a Digital Oscillator which will Generate up to 256 Low - Distortion Sine Waves in Real Time " by John Snell .
I ended up using the Zilog Z - 80 microprocessor which was binary compatible with the 8080 but also supported additional instructions such as indexed addressing that I found very handy .
The computer part had 64 K of dynamic RAM , with another 64 K accessible sequentially through an I /O port .
The synthesizer part was entirely TTL ( for speed ) .
It generated not the 256 sine waves promised by John Snell but 80 sine waves in real time , with separate envelopes for frequency and amplitude , combined in pairs in simple frequency - modulation ( FM ) synthesis , so I got 40 simultaneous voices .
I built everything myself except for one 4 K static RAM board .
The machine had a five - octave music keyboard , and a regular keyboard and video display capable of 16 lines of 32 characters , which basically let me type hexadecimal bytes into memory .
The software system controlling the synthesizer was entirely interrupt driven , and the machine code had to be as efficient as possible .
As I coded , I literally counted clock cycles , and I soon memorized the length of each instruction .
I would code and recode , shaving a cycle here and a cycle there .
After it was completed in 1981 , I was able to program entire music compositions and play them back , and I spent about a year doing this until it became very , very clear that I had no talent at all for composing music .
But it was fun and obviously a valuable learning experience .
( Without this experience there obviously would have been no Code : The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software . )
Sometime in the future I 'd like to post some photographs and documents about this computer - controlled digital synthesizer , and even some of the " music " I wrote .
About 1982 I bought an Osborne I , which ran CP / M on a Z - 80 .
The simple reason I bought an Osborne rather than an IBM PC was because the Osborne was $ 2,000 and the IBM PC was $ 5,000 .
About the same time , New York Life got some IBM PCs , and I picked up 8086 assembly language fairly quickly as well .
I finally bought a two - diskette $ 5,000 IBM PC early in 1984 .
It wiped out two credit cards , so I decided the machine needed to pay for itself .
I wrote an article about ANSI .
SYS and the PROMPT command , sent it to PC Magazine and they sent me $ 800 .
It was the first time I had ever been paid for something I wrote .
In the summer of 1984 , PC Magazine was doing the first of what became an annual roundup review of printers , so they called all the people who had written for PC Magazine who lived in the New York City area and asked them to come in to the office to review printers .
The PC Magazine offices were at One Park Avenue just a few blocks north of the New York Life offices at 51 Madison Avenue , so it was very convenient for me .
I reviewed printers and also started showing people at the magazine some small assembly - language programs I had written .
I was soon writing little 300 - 500 byte .COM file utilities for PC Magazine
By the summer of 1985 I was getting so much freelance work from PC Magazine that I was able to quit my job at New York Life Insurance .
I have n't had a real job since .
I think I learned C in 1984 or 1985 .
I know that I was pretty familiar with C when I started working with the beta Windows SDK in 1985 .
Another fortuitous connection occurred : Jonathan Lazarus was a VP at Ziff - Davis ( which published PC Magazine ) at the time , and he was very enthuiastic about Windows .
Jon left Ziff and contracted with Microsoft for his consulting firm ( H. Roark & Associates ! ) to publish a Windows programming magazine .
But they chickened out and decided that Microsoft Systems Journal would cover both DOS and Windows programming .
Jon knew a few PC Magazine authors so he recruited us to write some articles .
I wrote the article " A Step - by - Step Guide to Building Your First Windows Application " for MSJ , Vol.1 , No. 2 ( December 1986 ) which I believe was the first article about Windows programming to appear in a magazine .
This early connection between PC Magazine and Microsoft Systems Journal continued for several years .
Editors and writers from the two magazines would often socialize together , both in New York City and at industry events such as Comdex .
At some Microsoft - related function in 1986 I told Tandy Trower how much fun I was having writing articles about Windows programming for MSJ .
When Microsoft Press editor - in - chief Susam Lammers asked Tandy if he knew anybody who could write a book about Windows programming , my name came up , and Susan gave me a call .
As I result , I was contracted to write a book and I wrote the first edition of Programming Windows from January through August 1987 .
I think from that point my programming career has been somewhat more conventional ....
Moroccan - born Faiza Mabchour speaks French fluently , has three children born in France , and a French husband .
Yet France 's top administrative court last month denied her bid for citizenship .
The reason ?
Ms. Mabchour wears a burqa , a long veil that some Muslim women use to cover themselves from head to toe .
In an interview with officials , she said she wore the burqa not for any special religious belief but because her husband asked her to .
A government report stated that " she lives in total submission to the men of her family , and the notion of questioning this submission does not even occur to her . "
The court said such a radical religious practice is incompatible with fundamental French values such as the equality of the sexes ; thus , she was judged unable to assimilate – a must for citizenship .
The decision raises troubling issues for an ethnically diverse and religiously free society .
The court was not denying her French nationality on the basis of her beliefs .
Both France 's 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man , as well as the European Convention on Human Rights , guarantee absolute freedom of belief .
The court must have denied nationality on the basis of her acts , but her only overt act was the wearing of the burqa .
Yet no French law regulates what clothes people can wear in their homes or general public .
( France bans head scarves and other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools . )
So Mabchour 's burqa is lawful .
That France should deny her citizenship on the sole basis of her behavior within the sphere of her own family is inconsistent with normal French tolerance of the private lives of its citizens .
France has by and large adopted the principle espoused in John Stuart Mill 's famous 1859 essay On Liberty : " The sole end for which mankind are warranted , individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number , is self - protection ....
His own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant . "
In denying Mabchour citizenship when she met all of the requirements save the inherently nebulous one of assimilation , the court came too close for comfort to a demand for religious orthodoxy .
It is a paradoxical demand in a nation that insists on the exclusion of religion from the public sphere .
Her case raises two fundamental questions :
What is gender equality , and what is citizenship ?
Is gender equality something more than a guarantee that male and female shall get equal pay for the same work and equal access to opportunities in all spheres to the extent possible ?
Did the French Supreme Court conclude that the principle of gender equality was violated since she wore the burqa because her husband asked her to ?
If she had explained that she wore it because that was her own independent choice would the court have given her French citizenship ?
Is citizenship like membership in a club where all members must wear coats and ties or like a gang where members must sport a tattoo ?
Nationality , of course , is a method for defining outsiders .
Most states define insiders by birth or parentage .
As a leading textbook on immigration and citizenship observes , " Birth is an unambiguous event about which states maintain relatively clear administrative records . "
This distinction leads to a supreme irony .
As one Internet commentator noted , " you have to be French to wear a burqa . "
For if Mabchour had been born in Paris , she could wear whatever she pleased , including a burqa , but because she was born in Morocco her burqa rose up as an insurmountable obstacle to her acquiring French nationality .
One cannot help but wonder if Faiza Mabchour had been named Haruko Tanaka and appeared before the commissaire in a silk kimono walking five paces behind her French husband , whether the French court would have reached the same result .

Australian wildlife experts were racing against time today to save a lost baby humpback whale that has been nuzzling up to yachts believing they could be its mother .
The calf , about two months old , was abandoned or became separated from its mother during the annual breeding migration .
Humpbacks undergo a 20,000 km round - trip from the Antarctic to the warm waters of Queensland .
It was first spotted in Sydney 's Pittwater Bay on Sunday trying to suckle from a whale - sized yacht , in a vain attempt to get a response from its " surrogate mother " .
Yesterday , rangers used the yacht to lure the calf out to open sea in the hope it would find its mother or join other migrating humpbacks .
But today , it was back in the same area , on the western shores of Pittwater , circling other yachts .
A spokesman for the department of national parks and wildlife , Chris McIntosh , said the 5 m - long calf risked dying of hunger , being attacked by sharks , or beaching itself .
" The difficulty with this calf , in our view , is that it probably has n't weaned itself from its mother and that is why it is taking to yachts .
The prognosis is n't good , " said McIntosh .
The humpback 's dilemma has generated a huge outpouring of sympathy in Australia , with television and radio stations keeping a watching brief on the drama .
The Sydney Morning Herald reported today that a grey whale calf called JJ was rescued off the coast of California in 1997 and bottle - fed a special formula before being successfully released back to the ocean .
Wildlife experts in Australia have contacted the US water park Sea World to see if there is any hope of doing the same thing with the calf , but artificial feeding in captivity is extremely rare .
Rescuers believe it would not succeed because the lost calf is relatively large , weighing about five tonnes , and is already distressed .
Australia also does not have the facilities or experience to attempt artificial feeding .
Whale calves normally stay with their mothers for up to 11 months , although at two months they start to eat some solids .
Rangers say the lost baby humpback will survive only a matter of days without the nourishment of its mother 's milk .
Euthanasia might become an option if the young mammal beaches itself or becomes too distressed .
" It 's heart - wrenching but the reality is that in the wild , for various reasons , mothers sometimes reject their young , " said McIntosh .
I 've got the opening scene of a dystopian thriller all worked out .
It 's a hot summer night in a typical suburban flat .
A young woman ( let 's call her Alison ) stands over the body of her boyfriend , who she 's just killed in a fit of madness .
A crime of passion .
She did n't mean to do it , but gah - now look at the mess she 's made .
She 's quivering , gazing down at the body like someone staring into a hitherto undiscovered dimension filled with swirling nightmarish tapestries , still clutching the murder weapon in her dismal little fist , breathing through her nose like a cornered church mouse , and somewhere in the background the phone is ringing .
Ringing , ringing , ringing .
It takes her an age to notice .
In a daze she answers it , her eyes still harpooned to the corpse .
She presses the receiver to her ear and someone in a call centre greets her by name .
" Hello Alison , " says the voice , which - while friendly - sounds as though it 's reading from a card , for the 50,000th time .
" I 'm calling from OmniCorps Ltd , and according to our predictive software there 's a 97.8 % chance you 've just murdered your boyfriend .
Now , we 're obligated to pass this information on to the authorities , which means the police are already on their way , but before they arrive we'd like to offer you the opportunity to take advantage of an exciting offer .
So if you 'd like to go to your window and look outside , our escape van should be arriving any moment ... "
Alison parts the curtains : it 's already there , impatiently tooting .
" Just get in the van , " says the voice .
" Get in , and we 'll take care of the rest . "
Still in a trance , she goes downstairs .
She gets in .
In the back are three other people .
All have committed similar crimes within the past hour .
Speckled with blood , they stare at each other in crazy silence as the van pulls away .
It turns out that the marketing arm of OmniCorps Ltd has been automatically tracking the entire nation 's internet activity , viewing habits , credit card transactions , use of public transport etc for years , in order to build an exhaustive database of consumer profiles .
They 've become so good at profiling , they 're able to accurately predict whether a given individual will commit a crime , and if so , what time of day they 'll do it .
They 're like the " Pre-Cog " department in Minority Report , except that , instead of arresting murderers , they offer them an escape route .
But once Alison gets in the van , she 's driven off to a gigantic underground sweatshop , where she and thousands of other murderers are doomed to spend the rest of their lives slaving on a production line , creating bargain - basement products for - you guessed it - OmniCorps Ltd .
That 's the basic idea .
It needs work .
OmniCorps Ltd needs a better name , obviously .
Also the story does n't have a second or third act ( some sort of prison breakout is in order , I guess ) .
Worst of all , our main protagonist is a murderer , so the average non-murdering audience member might find it hard to empathise with her .
Originally , Alison was a man ; I made her a woman to sweeten the pill a tad , but maybe her boyfriend needs to have been a serial cheat , or a violent drunk , or at the very least have a taste for plodding indie stadium - rock or something , so we can comfortably forgive her for bashing his skull in with a steak tenderiser or whatever she used .
Anyway , it'd be worth watching , if only because the premise is 23 % more plausible now than it was five years ago when I thought of it .
Back then , my biggest fear was the mild intrusion of Nectar points .
Now I simply assume everything I do is comprehensively probed by the invisible fingers of the central scrutiniser as a matter of course .
In my flat , there 's a full - length balcony window , with no curtains , situated right outside my bedroom .
I sleep naked , so if I go for a piss in the middle of the night , I end up flashing the neighbours twice - once on the way to the bathroom , and once on the way back .
First time it happened , I vowed to put up an opaque blind .
But I have n't .
Partly because after a while I figured , hey , they 've seen it all before - why deprive them now ?
But mainly because I live in London , European Graveyard of Privacy .
This place is a joke .
Each day I move around carrying a mobile phone ( traceable ) and an Oyster card ( trackable ) , monitored , on average , by 10 times as many CCTV cameras as there are in the Big Brother house .
Wherever I go , a gigantic compound eye peers at the back of my neck .
I 'm another bustling dot in the ant farm .
Hide indoors ?
Ha. I 've got Sky TV .
I can't even draw the curtains and watch Bargain Hunt without some whirring electronic prick making a note of what I 'm doing .
And forget the internet .
Today I blew 20 minutes pointlessly looking up an old kids ' TV show called Animal Kwackers on YouTube .
A record of this decision will soon be automatically winging its way to Viacom .
I have n't just wasted my own time ; I 've wasted theirs too .
The way things are going , I half - expect to hear a quiet electric " peep " noise each time I flush the toilet ; another bowel movement logged by Bumland Security .
But I do n't get angry .
I shrug .
They won .
They won years ago .
Like a bear in a zoo , I can rub my head against the wall in despair , or ignore the onlookers and forlornly shuffle around as normal .
Past that balcony window .
Where each time they get an eyeful , an electric peep sounds somewhere in the dark .
Yeah .
Never mind a boot stamping on a human face forever .
A smug electric peep each time they catch sight of your bumhole .
That 's your future , right there .

Designing complex applications is a challenging undertaking .
Building applications that have both the depth to support complicated tasks and the intuitiveness to make it clear how to get that work done is a tremendous challenge .
We spend a full day on this topic in our Application Design for Web and Desktop course , but we could easily spend a month to catalogue every type of problem we ’ve encountered in our user - research studies .
Making general recommendations about common application - design problems is difficult , because so many of the problems we observe are domain - specific .
This was true 11 years ago , when the first version of this article was written , and remains so today .
Thus , our first recommendation is to do user research with your target audience :
Begin with task analysis and field studies to understand your users ’ needs and workflows .
Prototype and test low - fidelity ideas to rough out the essential structure of your app and its features , without committing many resources towards ideas that you will revise or abandon as you learn from your users .
Design iteratively , and test each change with a small number of users .
The more iterations , the better your application will be .
Despite the domain - specific nature of most app usability problems , here are 10 common mistakes that we frequently see across industries .
Five of these issues ( # 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) were also included in the original article — which goes to show how durable usability guidelines are .
All 10 of the original guidelines are still true , but 5 mistakes are ( thankfully ) less commonplace than they once were ; they were replaced by another 5 problems ( # 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 ) .
Here is our current list of the top 10 application - design mistakes that are both egregious and commonplace .
Let ’s hope that when we write then next version of this article in another 11 years , most of these will be far less common .
1. Poor Feedback
One of the most basic guidelines for improving an application ’s usability is to provide clear feedback :
Show users the system 's current state .
Tell users how their commands and actions have been interpreted .
Tell users what 's happening .
Apps that keep quiet leave users guessing .
Often , they guess wrong .
Good feedback tells users a lot of things — for example , has the button they clicked been correctly interpreted by the system as a “ click ” and will the system now do something ?
What is currently selected or active ?
One of the scenarios where feedback becomes important is when the application is put into an edit mode to modify existing information .
It ’s important that users have a clear understanding of what is currently editable , as applications will differ in the scope of the edit mode — for example , some applications will incorporate tables of data where a single cell or row is editable , others will make the entire table editable .
Proper , clear feedback can convey to users the scope of the edit ; good feedback can be implemented in a variety of ways , from using a different background to identify the current editable area to changing the buttons associated with editing to clearly show their function
1.a .
Out to Lunch Without a Progress Indicator
A variant on lack of feedback is when a system fails to notify users that it 's taking a long time to complete an action .
Users often think that the application is broken or they start clicking on other targets .
If you can't meet the recommended response - time limits , say so , and keep users informed about what 's going on with a progress indicator :
If a command takes between 2 and 10 seconds , show a wait animation such as a “ spinner .
” This type of progress indicator tells users to hold their horses and not click on anything else until the normal cursor returns .
, show a wait animation such as a “ spinner .
” This type of progress indicator tells users to hold their horses and not click on anything else until the normal cursor returns .
If a command takes more than 10 seconds , put up an explicit progress bar , preferably as a percent - done indicator ( unless you truly can't predict how much work is left until the operation is done ) .
2. Inconsistency
Remember the double - D rule : differences are difficult .
When users have expectations for how something will behave or where they can access it , deviations from those expectations cause confusion , frustration , and increased cognitive load as people attempt to puzzle out the problem .
Human minds crave consistency .
There are a few types of inconsistency that are especially common in complex applications and cause even seasoned users to be utterly confused :
Different words or commands for the same action
Placing controls for the same feature in many different places
Controls that seem similar to one another ( from the user ’s point of view ) but are accessed in different places ( e.g. one is accessed in a toolbar , another a menu , and a third deep in a Preferences dialog )
Similar workflow patterns which require interacting with very different sections of the interface
Inconsistent rules for legit input data : sometimes an entry is allowed , and at other times it ’s marked as invalid , without any feedback as to why this is happening
A feature is sometimes available , and sometimes not for mysterious reasons that are not made explicit
UI elements or controls that move around , violating spatial consistency
An architect in our study who had many years of experience using AutoCAD struggled to understand when she could or could n’t “ dock ” various floating panels to keep them pinned to one side of the screen .
In the same session , she tried multiple times to get a floating panel to dock to the left side , to no avail .
It turned out that , due to a hidden parameter setting , this particular panel could not be docked , but this constraint was not made explicit to the user .
The hidden setting was intended to give power users the ability to customize the interface to an incredible degree , but , due to poor feedback , our study participant could n’t figure out why docking sometimes worked and sometimes did n’t .
This type of inconsistency is a major source of frustration even to experienced users .
3. Bad Error Messages
Error messages are a special form of feedback : they tell users that something has gone wrong .
We 've known the guidelines for error messages for almost 30 years , and yet many applications still violate them .
The most common guideline violation is when an error message simply says something is wrong , without explaining why and how the user can fix the problem .
Such messages leave users stranded .
This problem has worsened over the years , largely due to web apps : Users are shown a Something went wrong .
Try again .
error message , with no details about the cause of the error or how it can be repaired .
At least the native desktop applications of yesteryear used to tell people ( often in technical lingo that lay users had no hope to make sense of ) what the issue was .
Informative error messages not only help users fix their current problems , but they can also serve as a teachable moment .
Although people wo n't invest time in reading and learning about your app ’s features , they will make the effort to understand an error situation if you explain it clearly , because they want to overcome the error .
4. No Default Values
Defaults help users in many ways .
Most importantly , defaults can :
speed up the interaction by freeing users from having to specify a value if the default is acceptable
the interaction by freeing users from having to specify a value if the default is acceptable teach by providing an example of the type of answer that is appropriate for the question
by providing an example of the type of answer that is appropriate for the question direct novice users toward a safe or common outcome , by letting them accept the default if they do n't know what else to do
Default values can save significant user effort in repetitive tasks , such as filling in the same form many times .
Identifying key values for form fields can increase productivity and reduce frustration .
Your analytics can help you understand if there is a most commonly chosen option for a specific field .
In particular , dropdown menus benefit from a meaningful default .
Many apps provide Select one ( i.e. no value selected at all ) as the default choice , forcing every user to interact with the dropdown and select a value .
If you preselect one choice ( ideally the most common ) , at least some users will not have to interact with that dropdown at all .
With numeric form fields , if users deviate very little from a common default ( e.g. , for Quantity fields ) , you can use a stepper to allow them to adjust the number without typing ( but still allow users to type a different value if desired ) .
Steppers have two benefits : they reduce interaction cost and give a reasonable starting point for new users who are still learning the system .
5. Unlabeled icons
It ’s really rare for icons to stand on their own , with most users able to understand them immediately .
Even icons that might seem universal ( such as the hamburger menu ) are not as familiar to users as most UX practitioners would expect .
It gets much worse if your application has icons that are unique ; the likelihood that users will understand what these unique icons mean is very low .
Remember Jakob ’s law : " users spend most of their time on other websites . ”
This means that most icons , unless they have a text label next to them , will be difficult or impossible for users to understand .
Pairing icons with a text label has four benefits :
It increases the size of the target ( which , according to Fitts ’ Law , reduces how long it takes for users to access the control ) .
It decreases the time to recognize the command : two memory cues ( icon and text ) are better than one .
Related to the previous , it can also facilitate learning of the interface ( by establishing multiple associations with the same command ) .
It can help users visually differentiate between several commands placed next to one another .
6. Hard - to - Acquire Targets
In human–computer interaction , anything that can be clicked ( or tapped ) on is called a target : all active UI elements are targets .
For users to acquire a target , they must be able to ( 1 ) identify the target ; ( 2 ) click on it reliably .
Both of these aspects cause problems in modern app interfaces .
6a . Weak Signifiers
" Affordance " means what you can do to an object .
For example , a checkbox affords turning on and off , and a slider affords moving up or down .
Signifiers are the visual elements that help you to understand the affordances just by looking at the object , before you start using it ( or feeling it , if it 's a physical device rather than an on - screen UI element ) .
These concepts are discussed in Don Norman 's book The Design of Everyday Things .
Signifiers are especially important in UI design , because all screen pixels afford clicking — even though nothing usually happens if you click .
There are so many visible things on a computer screen that users do n't have time for a mine - sweeping game , clicking around hoping to find something actionable .
( Exception : young children sometimes like to explore screens by clicking around . )
In modern applications , one of the worst offenders are ultra flat designs .
Many flat designs have weak signifiers for targets : people cannot easily tell text from buttons because buttons lack traditional 3D clues .
Common symptoms of weak signifiers are :
Users say , " What do I do here ? "
Users do n't go near a feature that would help them .
A profusion of screen text tries to overcome these two problems .
( Even worse are verbose , multistage instructions that disappear after you perform the first of several actions . )
6b. Tiny Click Targets
An associated problem here is click targets that are so small that users miss and click outside the active area .
Even if they originally perceived the associated signifier correctly , users often change their mind and start believing that something is n't actionable because they think they clicked it and nothing happened .
( Small click zones are a particular problem for old users and users with motor skill disabilities . )
7. Overuse of Modals
Many applications use modal windows to implement interactions with data — editing an existing item , adding a new item , deleting , or even reading additional details about an item .
Modals appear on top of the current page and the background content is usually dimmed ( under the assumption that dimming will reduce distractions and help users focus on the task at hand ) .
Unfortunately , this design choice reduces context for users by covering up information that they may wish to refer to while filling out the form .
( Note that , even if the covered - up window does not contain information needed for the editing , users often attempt to leverage the work they ’ve done previously , by copying and pasting previous inputs , or even simply using other entries as templates for how to think about the current task . )
8. Meaningless Information
Long strings of letters and digits , such as automatically generated IDs in a database are frequently used to uniquely identify an item in an application .
These strings are completely meaningless to users , but they are often prominently displayed as the first column of a table , forcing people to scan past that first column to find the information that they care about .
While these meaningless indices are important on the back end , they should not be the primary piece of information that users must refer to .
Especially in high –information - density screens , provide some human - readable information as the main anchor point and push the IDs to a less prominent position .
Egregious uses of coded information often appear in medical applications , CRM systems ( where users often have to select a code for each sales interaction with their customers ) , accounting software , and enterprise applications .
In all these apps , information that is meaningful to humans is summarized by a short code , in an attempt to make it more compact .
A short code may fit in a small area better than a whole sentence , but places a much higher cognitive load on users .
They will need to translate the coded information to make sense of it , and our working memory is limited to begin with .
Even highly trained professionals cannot remember every possible code , and it still takes them a lot of effort to do this mental translation .
9. Junk - Drawer Menus
If your application has hundreds or even thousands of features , you have to put controls for those features somewhere , and furthermore , you need to prioritize and organize them so users can easily find and quickly access the most important ones .
One consequence of this constraint is often an overflow menu : the most commonly used actions are displayed in a toolbar , and a final item labeled More actions , or Tools , or worst of all … hosts everything else that did not fit .
These menu labels have low information scent and are nothing more than a junk drawer : a place to put all the stuff you ca n’t otherwise categorize , but do n’t want to throw away .
They often come about because the team has a list of required features but does n’t know where to put them , or in legacy applications , it cannot remove old , seldom used features .
The problem with an overflow menu is that , just like with the junk drawer in your house , no one else can know what you might have put in it .
In other words , it limits both discoverability and findability of features , since most users wo n’t have any reason to go looking in those menus .
10 . Proximity of Destructive and Confirmation Actions
Placing actions such as Save next to actions that destroy work such as Discard is a commonplace design decision that causes much grief for users .
While logically this placement often makes sense ( for example , Save and Delete are related , in that they decide the fate of an item ) , it also makes it easy to click the wrong button or icon — especially when users are rushing , completing repetitive actions , or have motor difficulties .
This type of unintentional substitution of one action for another is called a slip
Summary
Applications are hugely domain - specific , so a usable , efficient , and pleasant application for one industry might be an unmitigated disaster in another .
Creating a usable application requires researching with your users to identify their workflows , their needed features , and their mental models and expectations .
However , the 10 application mistakes outlined here represent common themes that we observe in studies across a range of industries , including creative , financial , enterprise , healthcare , engineering , and more .

Stunning Examples of Fractal Art in History
" Mandelbrot ?
Never heard of him ! " ...
Before anybody knew who Mandelbrot was , artists throughout history were seeing fractals in Nature all around them , recognized their aesthetics and introduced these patterns into their own paintings , sculptures , and designs .
Fractals , as we define them now , are the infinitely recursive geometric patterns , repeated on a smaller and smaller scale , until the resulting intricate lattice - work recedes past the scope of classic geometry .
They are governed by the Mandelbrot Equation and can be explored ad finitum , provided you have capable computational and visualization tools :
( image via )
Human mind continuously enjoys a certain fixation on recursive fractal patterns , perhaps because our natural environment is so abundant with them .
Like a dancing flame , or a streaming water , fractals attract our eye and hold our attention .
However , it is only during the last 30 years that we 've been able to precisely describe this exquisitely subtle set of interacting patterns .
First fractal shapes were drawn by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978 , and then in 1980 Benoit Mandelbrot has been able to define the algorithm .
Fractals may have drifted into a " cliche " category since then , and became commonplace in modern computing , but interestingly , they 've enjoyed a long and rich history in art , where there was no end to their popularity with photographers and artists wanting to create visually complex forms .
1. The Medieval Celtic " Book of Kells " ( 597 A.D. )
This magnificent cultural treasure contains a stunning variety of Irish art , designs and calligraphy at its best .
Perhaps the most frequently seen design elements in this book ( and in other illuminated Irish manuscripts of the period ) are the closely coiled spirals connected with each other by a number of curves and terminating in the so - called " trumpet fractal pattern " .
Similarly convoluted curves and spirals can be found within letters , throughout the book :
2. Fractals have a rich history in African Design :
There are traces of fractal geometry to be found in typical Ethiopian ornaments :
... in village architecture :
and even in traditional Ethiopian hair - style ! -
Ron Eglash , professor of comparative studies at the Ohio State University , came up with a special tool enabling everyone to create their own fractal branching patterns found in braided hairstyles .
" At first I thought it was just from unconscious social dynamics , " Mr. Eglash says , " but during my fieldwork , I found that fractal designs also appear in a wide variety of intentional designs -- hairstyling , textiles , sculpture , painting , carving , metalwork -- and the recursive process of fractal algorithms are even used in African quantitative systems . "

3. Persian & Traditional Islamic Ornaments
These ancient ornaments are essentially a study in symmetry , extended and enhanced with multiple iterations :
Here are some " Persian Rug " examples , created on the computer by applying recursive fractal algorithms :

4. Italian Renaissance & the Dutch Masters
Often called " Space Filling by Iteration " , this technique of creating intricate textures has been known since Renaissance and widely used to add visual interest to drawings and paintings in history of art .
For example , Leonardo da Vinci in his famous Treatise of Painting described what now is called Leonardo method or " blotting method " - emphasizing the innate power of " messy forms " ( like stains on old walls , amorphous clouds or muddy water ) and thus helping mind to embark " on various discoveries " .
Dutch painter Jan Van Goyen ( 1596 - 1656 ) also used " deliberate accident in art " idea to create paintings with little effort from stains of colors .
Compare , for example , Van Goyen 's painted clouds with a typical fractal computer - generated " cloud " rendering :
( left : Van Goyen , " Two Men on a Footbridge over a Stream " , 1655 , oil on panel ; right : " The cloud " generated by Iterated Function System , via )
This technique is based on a well - known mathematical algorithm of producing space - filling curve pre-fractals :
One well - known application of generating space - filling curves in computer graphics is " half - toning " and dithering of images :

5. Fractals in Spiritual Art
It 's only fitting that representations of fractals as visualization of INFINITY most frequently appear in human art within Religious and Spiritual context : Islamic , Egyptian , Judaic , Hindu and other religious symbolic arts all contain fractal elements in one form or another :

In the last 8 years , McCain only fell below 90 % twice .

Cool Your Jets in a Giant New Air Terminal .
My recent install guide for CLISP , Emacs , and SLIME on Windows XP was a big hit – it has had about 2000 hits and 5 sincere thanks in the comments ( it even got praise from a troll ! ) .
In it I promised a similar guide for SBCL , and here it is .
The nice thing is that swapping out Common Lisp implementations within an Emacs / SLIME setup is easy , so maybe 3/4 of this guide is identical to the CLISP guide .
I ’ll put a disclaimer at the beginning of each section saying whether there ’s anything new or whether you can skip it .
0. Files to Download [ DIFF :
The only difference is the link to the SBCL installer instead of the CLisp installer ]
If you want to get started on downloading the setup files , here are the links :
1. Setup Directories [ NO DIFF : skip if you ’ve completed the CLisp guide ]
Windows XP loves extremely long pathnames like C : \Documents and Settings \Username \Application Data .
This is okay if for GUI - driven apps , but in Emacs , you \ ’re not clicking , you\ ’re typing , and you want short path names .
Also , much ( most ? ) of the open source Common Lisp tools are developed on * nix , so there \’s less impedance mismatch when using stuff off the net if you have a * nix - ish folder structure .
Start with a root folder .
In the pathnames in the rest of this guide , I \ ’ll refer to it as [ HOME ] .
I used C: \home\ to match the * nix convention of having user files be in / home / username / .
You also need a username directory – I called mine peter and I \ ’ll refer to it as [ USR ] .
So in my case , [ HOME ] / [ USR ] would be C:\home \peter\ .
Emacs NOTE # 1 : One important point about filenames in Emacs is that they CAN be entered with â€˜ / \’ , but if you prefer to use â€˜\\ ’ , you have to escape it with another back slash , so in Emacs buffers and files , you would enter â€œC : / home / â€  or â€œC : \\home\\â€  but never â€œC : \home\â€ .
The trailing slash is also important because it indicates that it \’s a directory .
Now that you have chosen your [ ROOT ] and [ USR ] values , these are the folders you should setup :
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \site \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \docs \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \lisp \
[ HOME ] \[ USR ] \info \
[ HOME ] \bin\
2. Setup Emacs [ NO DIFF : skip if you ’ve completed the CLisp guide ]
Emacs does not need to be â€œinstalledâ€ like most Windows apps – it just runs from its directory .
Extract it to [ HOME ] \bin\ .
I changed the folder name from emacs - 22.2 to just emacs , so my path was c:\home \bin\emacs\ .
You run emacs by running the file [ HOME ]\bin\emacs\bin\runemacs.exe .
Emacs settings are stored in a configuration file called â€œ.emacsâ€ .
On Windows , the default working folder and .emacs location is C : \Documents and Settings \Username \Application Data , but that \’s too painful to type and it \’s a hidden folder so it \’s not even easy to get through with the GUI .
To have Emacs work in a different folder , create a file called site - start.el in the emacs \site - lisp folder .
In that folder , put the following line ( but change the path to match yours ) :
( setenv â€ œHOMEâ€ â€ œ [ HOME ] / [ USR ] / â€ )
( Thanks Nathaniel !
This was probably the biggest annoyance of mine that made me put off finishing setup for so long . )
Emacs NOTE # 2 : Emacs has lots ( and lots and lots ) of keyboard shortcuts , many more than there are letters in the alphabet .
Many of them require multiple keys or a sequence of keys called a â€œchordâ€ .
The two modifier keys used are Control and Alt ( also called Meta ) .
The common way to write chords is to use C- and M- for Control and Meta , so to run the command to close Emacs , you hold down Control and X , then let go , then hold down Control and C .
This is written as C-x C- c.
Sometimes a chord is followed by another letter or the name of a command .
For instance , to undo , you hold Control and x , then let go and hit u .
This is written as C-x u .
Dashes mean press at the same time , space means let go .
Easy !
I made a cheat sheet for common commands in Emacs and SLIME .
Now it \’s time to create your .emacs file .
Run emacs and hit C-x C-f .
This is the find command , which is used to create or open a file .
At the prompt â€ œFind file : â€œ , type â€œ ~/.emacsâ€ ( without quotes ) .
Right now just put a ; ( that \’s the comment marker in Emacs Lisp files ) and save it by hitting C-x C-s .
There \’s a world of stuff you can put in a .emacs file , but that \’s too much to bite off now .
3. Install SBCL [ DIFF :
This section is completely different ]
Although the Windows port of SBCL is still experimental , there is a Windows installer ( .msi ) file for v1.0.13 ( highest version as of now is v1.0.17 ) .
Just run the installer , and install it to the directory :
[ HOME ] \bin\sbcl -1013 \
Then just finish the install wizard .
But you ’re not finished yet .
Robert Zubek wrote a post about 2 months ago about how to setup SBCL / Emacs / SLIME on Vista , but it does n’t work exactly right on Windows XP .
If you use the .emacs settings from his post , you get this error when you start SLIME ( instead of using the .emacs settings in step 4 ) :
fatal error encountered in SBCL pid XXXX :
ca n’t find core file at /user / local / lib/sbcl//sbcl.core
Process inferior - lisp exited abnormally with code 1
If you use the settings in step 4 , you ’ll get a different error message :
Searching for program : no such file or directory , sbcl
If you SBCL looks in the environment variable PATH to find the executable and core file .
The default directories are * nixy , so it wo n’t find your sbcl directory on accident .
But why should it look for the directory if you entered it into the install wizard ?
Apparently Windows XP does n’t update system environment variables until the system reboots .
So right after you install SBCL , you have the user environment variables PATH and SBCL_Home but SBCL looks in the system variables .
I could n’t find out a way to fix that without rebooting , but the good news is that a reboot solves the problem .
So reboot your computer now .
4. Setup SLIME [ DIFF :
This section has some differences – links and .emacs setup ]
Apparently the SLIME 2.0 is very old ; several people recommend ignoring it and going straight to the CVS snapshot , so that ’s what I linked to above .
Extract the SLIME folder to [ HOME ] \bin\emacs\site -lisp .
( Here \ ’s a tip about putting emacs code in site - lisp ) .
Now in Emacs , open your .emacs file ( C-x C-f , ~ /.emacs ) and enter the following ( general SLIME instructions , SBCL specific setup ) , changing your pathnames as usual .
The good news is that because SBCL looks in the environment variables , you do n’t need any of the command line parameters in the inferior - lisp - program variable :
( setq inferior - lisp - program â€œsbclâ€ )
( add - to - list â€˜load - path â€ œ [ HOME ] /bin/emacs/site-lisp/slime/â€)
( require \’slime )
( slime - setup )
Save the .emacs file ( C- x C-s ) , then run the eval - buffer command ( M - x eval - buffer ) .
This will run the code that you just entered and tell Emacs how to run SLIME .
Now , you start slime with M-x slime and you\ ’re ready to go !
NOTE : This is a basic SBCL setup – I ’ve found some more advanced setup links that I ’ll write guides for later :
Setup ASDF - Install / SBCL on Windows
Running SBCL on Windows – this is again for Vista , with the newest ( v1.0.16 and v1.0.17 ) versions of SBCL .
It also includes configuring shell commands , etc .

Barry George denies murder BBC TV presenter Jill Dando was killed by a " loner " with an " exaggerated interest " in celebrities , single women and weapons , the Old Bailey has heard .
Barry George , 48 , kept photographs of famous personalities and followed women in west London , where both he and Miss Dando lived , the prosecution said .
Miss Dando , 37 , was shot in the head on her doorstep in April 1999 in what was an irrational act , the jury was told .
Mr George , who was originally tried for her killing in 2001 , denies murder .
Miss Dando , who became a household name after presenting shows such as Crimewatch , the Holiday programme and the news , was described in court as a " kind and generous " woman who was popular with colleagues and the public .
Over the course of many years the defendant ... would approach women , engage them in conversation and then seek to discover where they lived
Jonathan Laidlaw QC
She had " none of the pretensions " associated with those who achieved fame , jurors were told .
The court heard how Miss Dando was killed on the morning of 26 April 1999 after being " taken by surprise " by her attacker .
She had just returned to her Fulham home from her fiance 's house in Chiswick , west London .
' No hate campaign ' Jonathan Laidlaw QC , prosecuting , said her death was the result of the actions of " a loner , a man acting alone with no rational motive to kill " .
Describing the killing itself , Mr Laidlaw said : " She arrived at her doorstep at 1130 and it would appear she was immediately shot by a gunman as she was about to unlock her door .
Her keys were in her hand . "
Miss Dando had not been aware of being stalked in the Fulham area and " she had certainly not been the target of any sort of sustained hate campaign " , he told the jury .
Miss Dando , originally from Weston - super - Mare , was due to marry doctor Alan Farthing in September 1999 .
Mr Laidlaw went on to tell the court there was " no evidence " that anyone other than Mr George , also of Fulham , was involved in the murder .
Miss Dando was due to marry in September 1999 Mr George , who was wearing a blue shirt and tie in court , sat beside clinical psychologist Dr Susan Young who , the court was told , was there to help the defendant follow proceedings .
The jury heard how Mr George , who lived a few streets away from Miss Dando , had a history of complex medical problems and told police that he had a " personality disorder " .
Mr Laidlaw said the defendant had " a wholly exaggerated interest in well - known personalities and entertainment " , with " single women and particularly those living locally to him " and also with " the army and weaponry " and the media .
Among some 4,000 undeveloped pictures found at his home were images of TV presenters Anthea Turner , Caron Keating , Emma Freud and Fiona Foster , photographed from his television , the court heard .
Mr George had also " hung around " at the BBC 's offices in White City , west London , had BBC cards and also had copies of the corporation 's staff publication , Ariel , the prosecution said .
' Changed names '
The jury was told the defendant lived out his celebrity fantasy by pretending to be Queen singer Freddy Mercury 's cousin .
Mr George , who had briefly worked as a messenger for the BBC in the 1970s , told another BBC employee he " did not like the way they [ the BBC ] had treated Freddie Mercury and his family " , the prosecution said .
The defendant had also changed his name by deed poll , twice adopting the names of famous people , including Paul Gadd , the real name of singer Gary Glitter , the jury heard .
On other occasions he called himself Thomas Palmer - a member of the SAS involved in the Iranian embassy siege in May 1980 .
Mr Laidlaw went on to tell the court how Mr George was a former member of the Territorial Army and a probationary member of the Kensington and Chelsea Pistol Club - although his application for full membership was rejected after eight visits .
He bought a number of items of military equipment two weeks before Miss Dando died , the jury heard .
Mr Laidlaw said as well as photographs of female news presenters , Mr George had allegedly taken hundreds of pictures of women he had followed .
He said : " Over the course of many years the defendant , particularly but not exclusively in the area of Fulham , would approach women , engage them in conversation and then seek to discover where they lived and the vehicles they drove . "
The Old Bailey heard that witnesses also saw Mr George observing these addresses and on occasions watching as the women arrived home .
Mr Laidlaw said these " obsessive aspects " of Mr George 's behaviour may provide a reason why he had an " interest " in Miss Dando and why he formed an " irrational " plan to kill her .
Six people have given evidence that they saw a man matching Mr George 's description in the area at the time of Jill Dando 's death , the prosecution said .
The trial continues .

What are these ?
AHMEDABAD / MUMBAI :
As the death toll from the serial blasts , now counted at 19 , crept up to 49 , Ahmedabad woke up to an edgy start on Sunday with police defusing an unexploded bomb at Hatkeshwar in Maninagar , where the first terror bomb had gone off .
( Watch )
Although the fears of a backlash to the bombings remained unfounded , the state administration , eager to avoid fresh turmoil , called the Army onto the streets to stage flag marches in several parts of the city .
( In Pics : Blasts rock Ahmedabad )
As with previous serial blasts , whether in Jaipur or Varanasi , investigators made no initial headway , despite hopes pinned on the recovery from Surat of two cars packed with material to make bombs .
Police officers said that the cars could yield vital clues .
Until then , the obvious parallels were being drawn with the May 13 Jaipur blasts in which the vehicles of death were the ubiquitous " aam admi " mode of transport - bicycles .
Also , police further locked into the Jaipur connection because the table clocks used in the Jaipur blasts were similar to the ones used as timers on Saturday .
That tied in with the burden of suspicion falling on SIMI , which intelligence experts now say has strong ties with Bangladesh - based Harkat - ul - Jihad al - Islami and Al - Qaida - linked Lashkar - e- Toiba .
Police say the scale of Saturday 's attacks would have needed a network of more than 50 terrorists , something only a SIMI - HuJI combine could deliver .
Police also suspect ammonium nitrate and LPG bottles were used for maximum impact in the two bombs which went off at LG Hospital and Civil Hospital .
Police say 5kg LPG cylinders were strapped along with the ammonium nitrate mix to create greater heat and power .
At LG Hospital , a portion of a wall was blown off and more than 20 people died at the Civil Hospital alone .
Meanwhile , the city crime branch on Sunday confirmed the arrest of a person named Abdul Halim from Dani Limda area in the heart of the city .
( Watch )
Halim , also wanted in the 2002 Gujarat riots case , had gone into hiding after the sectarian violence and remained untraceable .
Police said Halim belongs to the Ahl - e - Hadees group and is a native of Uttar Pradesh , settled in Ahmedabad since the 1980s .
He was booked in the RDX haul case in Delhi in which Shahid Bakshi and Farhan were convicted .
Joint commissioner of police ( crime ) Ashish Bhatia said the arrest could provide leads in the blast .
" There were reports that he was hiding in Delhi and we had intimated Delhi police as well .
After receiving some specific inputs about his whereabouts , the crime branch arrested him during a combing operation , " Bhatia said .
Halim was wanted for enticing disgruntled youths from refugee camps for riot victims in and around Ahmedabad and taking them to Uttar Pradesh .
" From there , an organized network was engaged in sending these youths across the border to Pakistan for training .
Halim was part of this network , " said Bhatia .
Also , the live bomb found in Hatkeshwar on Sunday could provide clues on the architects of Saturday���s attacks .
Police say in this case , the terrorists used old cycles , unlike in Jaipur where new bikes had been bought on the morning of the blasts .
The Hatkeshwar bomb had ammonium nitrate , ball bearings for shrapnel and was packed in an oval container with a steel lid .
A timer device was fixed to trigger it .
Late Saturday evening , a bomb found on an Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service bus in Gandhinagar was defused .
Eleven bodies were yet to be identified at hospitals .
State held an emergency meeting and formed a panel headed by principal secretary ( home ) Balwant Singh to coordinate intelligence inputs from other states and the Centre .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A magnitude - 5.4 earthquake shook the Los Angeles metropolitan area Tuesday , leaving residents rattled but causing no serious damage or injuries .
However , the temblor served as a warning to southern Californians who had not experienced an earthquake in some time : the " Big One " remains a possibility .
" This is a sample , a small sample , " said Kate Hutton , a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology .
" This is somewhere between small and moderate . "
She said there is a 5 percent chance the quake could be a precursor to a larger earthquake .
After 24 hours , she said , that chance will drop to 1 percent .
" Every earthquake relieves some stress , " Hutton said .
" It 's usually only a drop in the ocean .
In other words , the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount that 's built up and is building up for the Big One when it happens some day in the future . "
Watch Hutton say Tuesday 's quake was a sign of bigger ones to come »
And when will that be ?
" From a geologist 's point of view , the answer has to be soon , " she said .
" But geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale , so I do n't think that gives any useful information for people , except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time . "
A 5.4 magnitude quake is considered by the USGS to be " moderate , " which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures .
So far this year , 39 " moderate " earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 have occurred in the United States , and 790 globally .
The last moderate quake to strike California was a magnitude 5.4 in April in the northern part of the state .
A magnitude 4.4 struck the greater Los Angeles area in August 2007 .
There is a 99 percent chance of California experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or larger within the next 30 years , according to the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast , sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey , the California Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center and published in Science Daily in April .
" This earthquake reminds us to be prepared , " said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
" We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage . "
He said he believes the state is " as prepared as anyone can be .
We have continuous discussions about that .
We are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready . "
The largest earthquake in recent years in California was a magnitude 7.1 in 1999 , Hutton said .
But it was centered in the desert , near Twentynine Palms , in a sparsely populated area .
Tuesday 's quake struck about 11:42 a.m. , according to the USGS .
Its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of Chino Hills and about 5 miles southeast of Diamond Bar .
The epicenter was about 7.6 miles deep , making it a fairly shallow quake , according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers .
In general , earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground .
But most Southern California earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow , officials said .
More than 30 aftershocks were recorded .
Hutton said the largest was a magnitude 3.6 .
Los Angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage , but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated .
There were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries .
The White House was also monitoring the situation , said spokeswoman Dana Perino .
Despite the absence of serious damage or injuries , some Los Angeles - area residents were left rattled .
The quake was felt as far south as San Diego , California , and the USGS said it received reports of light shaking as far north as Rosamond , California , about 55 miles north - northeast of Los Angeles .
Reports from those who felt the quake poured into CNN .
Did you feel the quake ?
" My house was like a fun house .
Everything was moving , " said Danny Casler , 28 , of Huntington Beach .
He said he was sleeping when his house began shaking , and some things fell in the living room .
He said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts .
Attorney Kevin Crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in Riverside , 65 miles away , who burst out , " Big quake ! "
Crisp said he felt it about five seconds later .
" This was very impressive .
Long and very uniform .
Really had the building going . "
He said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf .
" It just started with a really strong jolt , " said Wendy Criner .
" I ran and got my daughters from different rooms , and we squatted in the living room .
I did have stuff fall off the shelf , some books in my daughters ' room and some things in the kitchen . "
The quake knocked out a ground radar system at Los Angeles International Airport , but that has not interfered with operations , according to the Federal Aviation Administration .
Technicians were working to restore the system , which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground .
Also , tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe .
The calculation of the quake 's magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data .
Initially classified as a magnitude 5.8 , the quake 's intensity was reduced to a 5.6 and then to a 5.4 .
Because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential , a 5.8 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 5.4 .
Two nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quake 's epicenter near Chino Hills , according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The closest to the epicenter is in San Onofre , 50 miles south , but an NRC spokesman said , " this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants . "
" In the U.S. particularly in California , buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage , so we do have the potential for damage , " said Don Blakeman , an analyst for the USGS .
" It depends on the structures [ and ] the ground the building is built on . "
He said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken .
" It 's kind of on the margin where you 'll get some structural damage from these .
We may find that some of the older homes and buildings that were n't retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures .
" I would expect some cracked buildings , " he said .
" There is the potential for injuries , but hopefully we wo n't have too much of that . "
Blakeman 's comments came before the quake 's magnitude was dropped to a 5.4 .
However , he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations , although obviously there is less potential for damage .
Still , the quake jolted the nerves of many Californians .
" I 've lived in California , I 've lived through several of them , " Margot Wagner of Santa Barbara told CNN .
" It 's always a little unnerving . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Exxon Mobil once again reported the largest quarterly profit in U.S. history Thursday , posting net income of $ 11.68 billion on revenue of $ 138 billion in the second quarter .
That profit works out to $ 1,485.55 a second .
That barely beat the previous corporate record of $ 11.66 billion , also set by Exxon in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
" The fundamentals of our business remain strong , " Henry Hubble , Exxon 's vice president of investor relations , said on a conference call .
" We continue to capture the benefit of strong industry conditions . "
But Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) profit fell short of Wall Street estimates .
Analysts predicted the company , the world 's largest publicly traded oil firm , would make $ 12.1 billion in profit on $ 144.4 billion in revenue , according to Thomson Reuters .
Exxon shares fell about 3 % on the New York Stock Exchange .
Excluding money set aside for a recent damage award related to the Valdez tanker spill back in 1989 , Exxon made $ 11.97 billion in the quarter .
Pricey oil cuts both ways
Exxon was both helped and hurt by high oil prices .
As an oil producer , the company makes a lot of money when crude prices rise .
Exxon made $ 10 billion from selling oil in the latest quarter , up nearly 70 % .
But as a refiner , it must also buy crude oil to turn into gasoline .
Exxon actually buys more crude than it sells .
Profits from its refining business totaled $ 1.6 billion in the quarter , less than half of what they were last year .
" Record crude oil and natural gas realizations were partly offset by lower refining and chemical margins , lower production volumes and higher operating costs , " read a statement attributed to Rex Tillerson , Exxon 's chief executive .
While oil prices in the quarter were nearly twice as high as the same time last year , gasoline prices only rose about 30 % .
That 's one reason why the stock of major oil companies - such as Exxon , Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSA ) and BP ( BP ) - that both produce and refine crude has been relatively flat over the last year , despite the runup in oil prices .
Meanwhile , shares of companies that mostly produce oil , like Anadarko and Apache , have soared in the last year , while shares in refiners like Valero and Sunoco have tumbled .
Where the money goes
Exxon spent $ 7 billion in the second quarter finding and producing more new oil , up 38 % from last year .
Still , oil and natural gas production from the company fell 8 % .
Even excluding special events such as a labor strike in Nigeria and seizure of fields in Venezuela , production slipped 3 % .
The production declines should n't be seen as an indicator the world is running out of oil , said Fadel Gheit , a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer .
Rather , as the price of oil rises , the amount of oil Exxon or any international oil firm is allowed to pump from many oil - rich countries decreases , said Gheit .
" We did n't expect production to be down as much as reported , " he said .
" But that does n't mean [ worldwide ] production is down , just that Exxon 's share is decreasing . "
The company returned $ 10.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks , 12 % more than last year .
On an earnings - per - share basis , Exxon made $ 2.22 .
That was still lower than analysts had expected , but 24 % higher than last year , a gain Exxon attributed to its aggressive stock buyback plan .
The big international oil companies have been criticized for plowing much of their profits back into stock buybacks and other programs to benefit shareholders , as opposed to exploring for more oil which could bring down the price of crude for everyone .
" While oil companies are earning record profits and gas prices are soaring , the largest oil companies have invested more resources in stock buybacks than U.S. production , " said Congressional Democrats in a press release shortly after Exxon announced its earnings .
Other critics charge the oil companies with deliberately restricting production in an attempt to keep prices high .
The industry says it 's investing as much as it can in finding new oil , but is having a hard time given the shortage of workers and equipment in the sector .
Recent efforts by countries such as Russia , Venezuela and Kazakhstan to gain greater control of their own domestic oil resources have also hampered the ability of international oil companies to increase production .
In addition to making hefty profits , Exxon also had a hefty tax bill .
Worldwide , the company paid $ 10.5 billion in income taxes in the second quarter , $ 9.5 billion in sales taxes , and over $ 12 billion in what it called " other taxes . "
Political backlash
With Americans paying nearly $ 4 a gallon for gas , oil company earnings have been political fodder of late .
Congressional Democrats said they are having a conference later in the day to call for an end to tax breaks for big oil firms .
Several bills have been introduced in Congress to enact a " windfall " profits tax on these earnings , or at the very least eliminate manufacturing tax exemption oil companies now enjoy .
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama wants to tax oil companies at a special rate every time crude goes over $ 80 a barrel .
Most plans would either use this newfound tax money to fund investments in renewable energy , or give it to low income Americans struggling with high energy prices .
But so far those efforts have been blocked - mainly by Republicans - who say raising taxes on oil companies will only discourage investments in finding new oil and raise the price of crude .
Defenders of oil company profits also point out that their profit margin , at around 8 % , is slightly below average for S&P 500 companies , and far below the 20 % - plus margins seen at companies such as Microsoft or Pfizer .

Despite spending $ 230 m ( £ 115 m ) an hour on healthcare , Americans live shorter lives than citizens of almost every other developed country .
And while it has the second - highest income per head in the world , the United States ranks 42nd in terms of life expectancy .
These are some of the startling conclusions from a major new report which attempts to explain why the world 's number - one economy has slipped to 12th place - from 2nd in 1990 - in terms of human development .
The American Human Development Report , which applies rankings of health , education and income to the US , paints a surprising picture of a country that spends well over $ 5 bn each day on healthcare - more per person than any other country .
The report , Measure of America , was funded by Oxfam America , the Conrad Hilton Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation .
It shows each of the 11 countries that rank higher than the US in human development has a lower per-capita income .
Those countries score better on the health and knowledge indices that make up the overall human development index ( HDI ) , which is calculated each year by the United Nations Development Programme .
And each has achieved better outcomes in areas such as infant mortality and longevity , with less spending per head .
Japanese , for example , can expect to outlive Americans , on average , by more than four years .
In fact , citizens of Israel , Greece , Singapore , Costa Rica , South Korea and every western European and Nordic country save one can expect to live longer than Americans .
There are also wider differences , the report shows .
The average Asian woman , for example , lives for almost 89 years , while African - American women live until 76 .
For men of the same groups , the difference is 14 years .
One of the main problems faced by the US , says the report , is that one in six Americans , or about 47 million people , are not covered by health insurance and so have limited access to healthcare .
As a result , the US is ranked 42nd in global life expectancy and 34th in terms of infants surviving to age one .
The US infant mortality rate is on a par with that of Croatia , Cuba , Estonia and Poland .
If the US could match top - ranked Sweden , about 20,000 more American babies a year would live to their first birthday .
" Human development is concerned with what I take to be the basic development idea : namely , advancing the richness of human life , rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live , which is only a part of it , " said the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen , who developed the HDI in 1990 .
" We get in this report ... an evaluation of what the limitations of human development are in the US but also ... how the relative place of America has been slipping in comparison with other countries over recent years . "
The US has a higher percentage of children living in poverty than any of the world 's richest countries .
In fact , the report shows that 15 % of American children - 10.7 million - live in families with incomes of less than $ 1,500 per month .
It also reveals 14 % of the population - some 40 million Americans - lack the literacy skills to perform simple , everyday tasks such as understanding newspaper articles and instruction manuals .
And while in much of Europe , Canada , Japan and Russia , levels of enrolment of three and four - year - olds in pre-school are running at about 75 % , in the US it is little more than 50 % .
The report not only highlights the differences between the US and other countries , it also picks up on the huge discrepancies between states , the country 's 436 congressional districts and between ethnic groups .
" The Measure of America reveals huge gaps among some groups in our country to access opportunity and reach their potential , " said the report 's co-author , Sarah Burd - Sharps .
" Some Americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about : health , education and standard of living .
" For example , the state human development index shows that people in last - ranked Mississippi are living 30 years behind those in first - ranked Connecticut . "
Inequality remains stark .
The richest fifth of Americans earn on average $ 168,170 a year , almost 15 times the average of the lowest fifth , who make do with $ 11,352 .
The US is far behind many other countries in the support given to working families , particularly in terms of family leave , sick leave and childcare .
The country has no federally mandated maternity leave .
The US also ranks first among the 30 rich countries of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of the number of people in prison , both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the total population .
It has 5 % of the world 's people but 24 % of its prisoners .
Frank Lowy , the billionaire shopping centre tycoon , will be revealed today as a client of the notorious Liechtenstein bank , LGT in a US Senate tax evasion investigation that accuses Australia 's second richest man of hiding millions of dollars from authorities .
Lowy , the biggest individual shareholder in the quoted property firm Westfield is one of eight wealthy individuals named in the powerful Senate probe for tax evasion which is estimated to cost the US a total of $ 100 bn each year .
The billionaire strongly refutes the allegations of tax evasion but , in a 110 - page report to be released at a Senate investigations committee hearing , he and his three sons are accused of using LGT to hide $ 68 m ( £ 34 m ) from tax authorities between 1996 and 2001 , using a complicated structure of trusts and accounts spanning Delaware in the US , the British Virgin Isles and Liechtenstein .
A team of Senate investigators has accessed dozens of sensitive bank documents and memos which reveal that Lowy 's account was one of the largest at LGT .
Lowy was considered so valuable a client that unusually he was not required to visit Switzerland to sign off instructions .
Instead LGT officials flew out to meet him in London .
Lowy founded Westfield 50 years ago .
It is now the world 's largest retail property firm .
He has become a powerful presence in the US and UK over the past few years .
The Czech - born former Australian Reserve Bank board member is building a shopping centre in Stratford , east London , which forms a major part of the Olympic Park .
He recently successfully persuaded the government to contribute tens of millions of pounds to the project to ensure the mall will be open in time for the games in 2012 .
Westfield will also shortly open the White City shopping centre – the first major mall development in London for years .
LGT , the biggest bank in Liechtenstein , is owned by the royal family there .
Last February , it emerged that details of thousands of wealthy account holders was passed onto international tax investigators by disgruntled former bank employee , Heinrich Kieber .
Kieber , who is in hiding , will be supplying evidence at the hearing via a video link .
The report sheds a searchlight into the secretive world of private banking where trillions of dollars are held by wealthy individuals to avoid and seemingly escape taxes worth an estimated $ 260 bn worldwide per year .
" It is simply unacceptable that some individuals are using offshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions to shelter trillions of dollars from taxation , forcing working families to shoulder the tax burden , " said Republican senator Norm Coleman who with senator Carl Levin leads the investigation committee .
" By exploiting gaping loopholes , these foreign banks are enabling felony tax evasion .
Simply put , foreign banks should not be Al Capone safe - houses for evading taxes . "
But Lowy totally rejects the assertion made by a team of Senate investigators that he knowingly evaded taxes .
In a strongly worded statement , he said : ' The report from the US sub - committee relies on certain documents originally stolen from a Liechtenstein Bank .
It draws inferences from the documents and states them as facts - without verifying their contents or inquiring into the real facts .
Under the Australian tax system the use of Liechtenstein structures to hold assets is not illegal or improper .
" Before publishing the report the US sub - committee failed to give Frank Lowy or his family any meaningful opportunity to be heard or otherwise have the true position stated .
This amounts to a denial of natural justice . "
Lowy added that the beneficiary of his Liechtenstein - held funds were charities in Israel .
Other individuals revealed as Liechtenstein bank account holders include Harvey Greenfield , a major US businessman who has donated to senior Democrat and Republican politicians and Michael Miskin , a British born businessman , who is alleged to have used LGT to hide a substantial slice of his fortune from his wife after they divorced .
The Senate report has also accessed sensitive material from UBS , at the centre of a separate tax evasion scandal .
This information appears to show how the Swiss bank aggressively marketed tax products which enabled US citizens to evade up to $ 18bn in taxes according to the US investigators .
UBS is helping the Internal Revenue Service with its inquiries .
Today 's hearing entitled Tax Haven Banks and US Tax Compliance is focusing on the workings of the offshore industry , examining how " tax haven banks facilitate tax evasion by US clients , hide client and bank misconduct behind the cloak of bank secrecy laws , and add to the offshore abuses that cost US taxpayers an estimated $ 100 bn each year " .

WASHINGTON - Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon escalated his feud with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Tuesday , saying he intends to call on the national media to come to the Valley and observe the sheriff 's crackdown on illegal immigration .
Criticizing the sweeps as heavy - handed and abusive , Gordon , said he intends to call a news conference at the National Press Club here in September .
He said he'd like to see a media mobilization comparable to the effort of the dozens of reporters who streamed to Arizona from around the country following the 1976 murder of Arizona Republic investigative reporter Don Bolles .
Their effort , which became known as the Arizona Project , produced extensive reporting on organized crime in the state .
" I 'm going to say , ' Come like you did for Don Bolles ; come to Phoenix and stop this madness , ' " said Gordon , who was in town on unrelated city business .
" Let 's turn the eyes of the nation on this . "
Gordon wants to focus attention on the sheriff department 's sweeps , in which deputies check vehicles and pedestrians in a search for illegal immigrants .
The measures have been widely criticized as a form of racial profiling .
" He ( Arpaio ) has become the false messiah , " Gordon said .
" But when the light is shined on him , people will see that he is n't helping to fight illegal immigration and he 's just making the situation worse .
You 've got an individual with a badge and a gun who 's breaking the law and abusing his authority . "
Arpaio fired back in a telephone interview from Phoenix .
" He does n't have to call ( on the media ) , because they 're here every day , " Arpaio said .
" I 've been on 3,000 national shows as sheriff .
I had two different Dutch reporters yesterday .
They come all the time .
... I do n't need him to be my press agent . "
Arpaio said Gordon " just wants to get some press because if he takes me on , he gets his name in the paper . "
The mayor accused the sheriff of ham - handed techniques that violate the rights of American citizens caught up in Arpaio 's immigration sweeps .
He also claimed the sweeps are making immigrants , both legal and illegal , fearful of cooperating with police criminal investigations .
Arpaio rejected the accusations and said his efforts have received broad support from the people of Maricopa County .
" I do n't have to defend myself over his vicious comments because he does n't like me arresting illegal immigrants " said Arpaio , who is seeking his fifth term as sheriff .
He said Gordon is trying to fuel his own political ambitions .
" He wants to be governor , " Arpaio said
The Gordon - Arpaio feud is a particularly volatile example of the tensions dividing communities across the country that are frustrated by the inability of Congress to pass immigration reform .
In the absence of a new federal policy , states and local jurisdictions are fashioning their own approaches to enforce immigration law .
Gordon says he favors " comprehensive immigration reform , " the term for legislation that attempts to package measures to deal with all the major components of the immigration issue , including border security and what to do about the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country illegally .
This year 's two principal presidential candidates , Arizona Sen . John McCain and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama favor a comprehensive approach .
Both have promised to take up the issue during their first year as president .
There is no expectation Congress will take it up this year .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Parts of Australia ’s key Murray - Darling river food bowl may be beyond recovery unless a prolonged dry spell and political wrangling over water use ends by October , a leaked scientific report warned on Wednesday .

“ There has been 10 years at least that people have said you have got to restore the environmental flows to the system if you wish to keep the natural assets .
We have failed to do that , ” University of Adelaide ecologist David Paton told local radio .
The Murray - Darling river basin , an area the size of France and Germany , produces 41 percent of Australia ’s agriculture and provides $ 21 billion worth of agricultural exports to Asia and the Middle East , including rice , corn , grapes and dairy .
But the government wants to secure water supplies and repair ailing rivers with an A$ 13 billion ( $ 12.2 billion ) , 10 - year water plan topped by a A$ 3 billion deal to buy river water back from irrigators .
The centre - left Labor government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deferred consideration of a scientific report into the crisis facing the basin ’s lower reaches until a ministerial meeting with state counterparts in November .
But Paton and other ecologists say much of the river system could be virtually dead by then , with vegetation on the lower Murray lost and fish species driven to extinction .
The lower Murray , where vast wetlands and lakes meet the sea , is an important region for horticulture , vegetable and pasture cropping , as well as dairy farming .
Environment Minister Peter Garrett said the government was aware the situation in the region was critical , but negotiations to better manage water flows were “ tough and difficult ” .
“ Recognizing the seriousness of what ’s happening in the lower Murray is something that is front of mind for this government , ” he told Reuters .
“ These are particularly difficult times for the Murray ... with such low inflows . ”
Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown accused the government of “ environmental vandalism ” for not acting with more urgency .
“ The government ’s missing in action when it comes to the greatest river system in this country and the urgent need for action , ” Brown said .
Australia , the driest inhabited continent on Earth , has been suffering more than seven years of drought , with water inflows into the nation ’s rivers at record lows and farmers facing tough restrictions on irrigation .
Climate scientists have warned the continent is suffering accelerated climate change , with temperatures expected to rise by about 1 degree Celsius by 2030 and rainfall forecast to decrease by up to 20 percent by 2070 in the most populous southeast .
Australia this week cut its wheat output forecast by nearly 9 percent after the return of dry weather during a crucial planting period dashed hopes for a record crop from the world ’s second - biggest exporter .

It started as a cop show about drug gangs in Baltimore , and grew into an epic , shifting portrait of a city in the grip of poverty and crisis .
But The Wire - now in its final season and acclaimed as the most accomplished TV series ever - is not the work of regular screen writers but an ex-journalist , an ex-detective and an elite team of novelists .
We asked our own panel of crime writers to explain its appeal
Irvine Welsh
Irvine Welsh is a novelist , playwright and screenwriter acclaimed for his gritty depictions of Scottish working - class life .
His novels include Trainspotting , Filth and Porno .
His latest , Crime , is out now .
My pal and screenwriting partner Dean Cavanagh is the master of the download and he seems to get everything before everyone else .
He was going on about The Wire a few years back .
Now I think it 's the best thing on TV .
By far .
Nothing 's close to it .
A lot of things interest me about the programme : the huge ensemble cast and the fact that there are no stars , the sheer honesty of the writing .
It makes just about all of the writing on British TV look absolutely shit .
It maddens me that BBC or ITV put out crap after crap after crap and they do n't pick up something like this .
We do n't know what to do with quality .
We would n't recognise it if it bit us in the arse .
All of the HBO stuff shows up how poor and puerile we are , and how our TV people completely patronise the public .
Guys in housing estates in Britain go crazy about The Sopranos but programmers assume they just want shit like The Bill .
A real revolution in programming is required in British television .
It 's significant that none of the writers on The Wire came up through TV and that quite a few are crime novelists .
There 's a big difference between a proper writer and someone who 's learned how to write scripts .
We 've got a big culture now of screenwriting and telling people how to structure things .
Anyone can learn to write a three - act script but what they do n't tell people is how to tell stories .
The guys on The Wire are proper storytellers .
Of course you get good novelists who can't do scripts .
F Scott Fitzgerald was one of the great writers of all time but he could n't cut it in Hollywood .
He could n't get down to the crass discipline of doing three - act structures and plot points and foreshadowing .
I had dinner with David Simon [ the show 's creator ] a few weeks back and I was asking him how they managed it .
He 's just so careful about selecting the writers .
That 's the most important thing to him .
It 's very , very hard to get a job writing on The Wire
Simon has created a whole alternative Baltimore in the show .
If you take a train from New York to Washington DC , you pass through the city and you can see all these places .
Large swathes of north Baltimore are [ made up of ] all these beautiful old Victorian small houses that are completely derelict and overrun .
You can see the kids standing on the street corners .
Basically the whole of north Baltimore and parts of the south are like a big empty derelict film set for The Wire .
It 's like an alternative universe , with the politics and the school boards , but it 's very close to the reality of the city in many ways .
They use great local actors too .
The guy who plays Proposition Joe is a well - known theatre actor who trains all the young kids .
The whole thing is very much a local industry .
I find the character of Omar particularly interesting .
He 's an outsider 's outsider , this Robin Hood type of guy who steals from the drug lords as well as the police .
He 's an isolated figure , completely against everybody , and one of the few homosexual characters in the show , but he always seems to be one up .
The guys in the police department and even the smooth characters like Proposition Joe are always a hop behind him .
Simon is normally very brutal about killing his darlings but Omar seems to have a different set of rules .
Looking at the writing of The Wire , he 's right out of kilter with the other characters .
He is this hyper-real , fantastical character - a sort of mysterious phantom , almost super - powered - whereas the others are all very realist .
If he were a realist character he would have been dead a long time ago .
It 's a tribute to the writing that this never hits a false register .
It works as grammar , adding something rather than weakening the plausibility of the show .
My advice to anyone watching The Wire for the first time is to stick it out .
The first two episodes in season one are actually pretty sketchy .
They 're a bit rough and ham - fisted , and it does n't look as great as it actually becomes , but it kicks in around episode three , and when it starts to pull together it 's really fantastic .
Michael Connelly
American writer Michael Connelly is the author of the acclaimed Harry Bosch series , about a Los Angeles detective .
His next book , The Brass Verdict , is due in October .
If you look at The Wire in shorthand , it 's a story about drug dealers and cops trying to catch them .
That just does n't sound interesting .
But somehow they got inside these people and their neighbourhoods and the bureaucracies they work in to a unique degree .
I have never seen anything like it on TV before .
I 've watched The Wire from the first night it aired , largely because I have a friend , George Pelecanos , who is a writer on the show .
Also , David Simon [ the show 's creator ] and I come from a similar background : we were both police reporters on a newspaper .
I 've dabbled unsuccessfully with screenwriting - I had a TV show on the air eight years ago but it only lasted six episodes - so I know a little bit about it .
I know in particular about the difficulty of moving from writing a book to a screenplay and how completely different they are .
In a book you can explore what 's going on in someone 's head but you can never do that in a script .
Instead you go for broad demonstrations of character , which often means that bad guys are all bad and good guys are all good .
That 's what you see most of the time in TV and movies but you do n't see that in The Wire .
The achievement of the series is that it has captured the humanity of every individual in it , whether they are a good person by trade or a bad person .
In some cases it goes further by showing the nobility of the characters , be they drug dealers or even killers .
It 's a fabulous accomplishment that the writers on the show , like Pelecanos and Dennis Lehane and Richard Price , have somehow been able to stay away from the stereotypical script .
I had the opportunity to sit next to Simon at Lehane 's wedding earlier this year and I asked him how they managed to do it so well .
He said : ' It 's my show but I trust these writers .
I love their books .
I love other scripts they 've written .
So I allow them to do their thing .
I trust that they 're good storytellers and they know what 's important . '
He provides the framework and the beat points - what has to happen in each episode - and he lets them wing it .
HBO deserves a lot of credit too .
In the early years the ratings were pretty lean but the channel believed in the show and let Simon do his thing - pretty rare in TV , in America at least .
They did n't have the ratings of The Sopranos .
Maybe they could have had if they 'd made the show more simplistic and focused on a core group of five or six mobsters , but this thing is all over the place .
It 's risky .
I applaud that .
I like to work for my entertainment .
I like to put two and two together .
I do n't like to have everything handed to me on a plate .
There 's a sub - theme in the final season about the declining newspaper business in the US that is so important and so accurate .
I loved all the seasons but this one connected with me the most because that 's where I came from , and because I also happen to be writing a novel about a newspaper reporter .
If you read a good book you get glued to your chair and have a visceral reaction to it .
This was happening every week on The Wire .
I 'd say it 's one of the five best shows I 've ever seen .
John Williams
John Williams is best known for his Cardiff trilogy of thrillers , set in the city 's criminal underworld .
His most recent book is Temperance Town .
I did n't watch The Wire till around halfway through series two , delayed by the fact that I 'm one of those people who steadfastly ignore things that everyone tells them will appeal to them ( ' snobs ' , I think , is the technical name ) .
When I did succumb it took a little while to get my ear tuned in enough to start picking up the dialogue , but not much longer to realise that this was remarkable TV , a crime series that actually aspired to tell the truth about the way we live now rather than simply bamboozle us with an insanely complex whodunit or entertain us with ' ironic ' brutality .
And , to be honest , I was kind of annoyed .
Why annoyed ?
Because here was a TV show , a product of the most commercial industry you can imagine , and it was taking bigger risks than anything I 'd lately encountered in the world of fiction , especially anything in crime fiction .
That was saddening for me as I 'd spent a fair bit of time over the past couple of decades championing crime fiction as the one art form that really tells it like it is .
Some time in the 1980s it struck me that mainstream contemporary fiction was doing a woeful job of reflecting what was going on in our modern - day cities .
Meanwhile , in the world of crime fiction , writers like Elmore Leonard , James Lee Burke , Sara Paretsky and the late , great George V Higgins were turning out books that married social realism to energetic storytelling .
They , and others who followed in their footsteps , such as Walter Mosley and George Pelecanos , successfully conveyed the notion that out there on the streets was a world that Miss Marple and Hill Street Blues were never going to set right , a world that Amis and McEwan , or McInerney and Ellis , barely seemed to realise existed .
I was so enthused by this notion that I wrote a book called Into The Badlands in which I roamed America , talked to its great crime novelists , and fleshed out my case .
And for the next decade or so I suppose I mostly still believed in it .
But as I went on reviewing crime fiction in the Noughties , I felt an increasing sense of disappointment at the prevailing lack of ambition to do anything more than entertain .
Everything people always used to say about crime fiction - is n't it just a formula ?
- seemed to be true .
There was a plague of serial killers , pathologists and profilers , cops with bad marriages and drink problems .
Lumbering plots with saccharine endings .
I could n't deny it any longer : the world of crime fiction had ceased to interest me .
Then I watched The Wire .
And there was everything I 'd liked in the work of Higgins or Leonard or Pelecanos : the inventive dialogue , the characters etched in shades of grey , the prevailing mood of moral ambiguity and profound cynicism as to the motives and efficacy of the forces of law and order .
There , in particular , was the sustained attack on the war on drugs - a war that makes the Iraq adventure look well thought out - that neither our newspapers nor our novelists ( with the shining exception of Richard Price ) seemed able to make .
There , in a nutshell , was the revival of American social realism : the Steinbeck / Hammett / Algren tradition that seemed to have been lost in a welter of postmodernism , post - colonialism and pure unadulterated schlock .
So I watched The Wire , and watched it some more , and nodded my head in respect as it widened its brief to take on education and politics , becoming positively Zola - esque in its detailing of the ways in which the rich and the powerful fail and exploit and madden the poor and the powerless and - in Baltimore at least - the black .
My one consolation , I suppose , in finding a TV series that is so much better than contemporary crime fiction is that much of the series is actually down to writers - not screenplay writers but book writers .
Its progenitor , David Simon , made his name with a wonderful non-fiction account of policing in Baltimore called Homicide .
And the show 's regular writers include the aforementioned George Pelecanos and Richard Price , as well as Dennis Lehane .
Which is perhaps why , for me , The Wire is so satisfying .
It 's got all the advantages of a great series of crime novels , plus moving pictures - and for once there 's no one telling the writer that it 'll only sell if they stick a serial killer in the middle of it .
So hurrah for smart literary TV ; and boo to dumbed - down crime fiction .
John Harvey
John Harvey is the author of the Charlie Resnick novels , following the exploits of a Nottingham police officer , and has been awarded the Crime Writers ' Association 's Diamond Dagger award for a lifetime 's contribution to crime writing .
Cold in Hand is his most recent novel .
A little over a week before writing this , the same evening I read the news that another young Londoner had been killed - the 18th fatality on the streets so far this year - I watched Final Grades , the last episode of series four of The Wire .
For those of you who do n't know , this series took public education as its theme ; as well as showing the police continuing their struggle to hold the lid on mainly drug - fuelled crime , we follow a former police officer , now retrained , into one of the local schools for his first term of teaching .
Ed Burns , David Simon 's principal co-writer on the series , had earlier followed the same course : police squad room to classroom .
He knows .
Aside from how kids think and how they talk , how cops and teachers get through their day , Burns knows that in education , as in the justice system , it is all too often the system itself that is the biggest hindrance to achieving the kind of goals decency and common sense demand .
One of the things The Wire is superb at - and which becomes possible because of its structure - is showing how politics and finance both underscore and overwhelm decisions taken on the ground .
An initiative to take those most likely to end up in a life of drugs and violence out of the normal classroom and educate them separately , in ways that try to give them an element of self - knowledge and pride , is stymied both by a lack of funding - itself due in no small part to political hubris and chicanery - and the necessity of forcing each pupil blindly through the rigidity of state testing .
I used the word ' kids ' earlier , but that 's not quite accurate .
These are youths struggling , too soon , too close to the beginnings of their lives , to become adult , to become men ; forced to do so by poverty and family breakdown , by peer group pressure , by the lack of opportunity and expectation .
What is so chilling , so heart - rending , about the young men whose short lives we follow in The Wire is that , despite their bombast and the brash fuck - you exterior they present to the world and largely to each other , in some ways they are still children .
In brief moments , unguarded , you can see it in their eyes .
Talking to McNulty , the cop who has kept him out of prison , one of these kids says : ' I been out there since I was 13 ...
This game is rigged ... we 're like the little bitches on the chessboard . '
' Pawns , ' McNulty informs him .
A scene or two later , the same kid is shot dead on his corner , a bullet to the head .
Of the vulnerable youths that the teachers and cops have made special efforts to save , one is sent to a group foster home where he 's beaten up as a snitch , another - perhaps the sweetest of all , the one for whom you had the most hope - is back on the street again , dealing drugs .
Even the bright youth who 's been taken in by the ex-policeman and his wife has not lost his connection to the life .
Despite a few gestures towards closing on an upbeat note , this final episode of series four leaves you feeling shocked and forlorn , but caring .
After getting to know these characters , week after week , even if you try not to , you care .
Last night I watched a programme about the black power salutes at the 1968 Olympics : we wanted to draw attention , one of the athletes said , to the lives of black people in our country .
There 's The Wire , holding up its fist .
And casting a shadow now on this country , too .
Dreda Say Mitchell
Dreda Say Mitchell is best known for her novel Running Hot , a gangland thriller set in the East End , for which she was awarded a Crime Writers ' Association Dagger Award in 2005 .
Her latest novel , Killer Tune , is out now .
From Dickens and Balzac to Z Cars and Lou Reed , portraying ' street life ' has been a staple of drama , music and fiction , but it 's not often that artists get it right .
Most of us are wearily familiar with the pitfalls - the stereotyping , the authorial finger - wagging and the leaden political and social ' messages ' .
And they 're often written by people whose only experience of the ' street ' has been a few months slumming in a squat .
The success of The Wire has been to transcend the usual format of social dramas to give us a panoramic view of modern urban America .
It 's all here - from the politicians in City Hall to the good cops who are really bad and the bad cops who are really good .
In season four it follows the experiences of four teenage boys .
In a typical morality drama we would know what to expect : education will be a good thing , missing school will be a bad thing .
And perhaps we can look out for an idealistic white teacher from the suburbs .
But instead , in The Wire , we see the dynamics of the ghetto apply in the school system the same way they apply everywhere else , with the same devastating results .
Meanwhile , up in City Hall , it 's election time .
Perhaps not : there are votes to be won , and it 's not going to be pretty .
The West Wing has its fans but if we really want to see the underbelly of American democracy , these episodes do it better .
British society has increasingly followed the US model and now we 're confronting the same range of social problems .
Many are looking to America to see what answers they 've come up with .
The narrative of The Wire suggests there are n't any .
There may be solutions for individuals , occasionally , but there are no solutions for communities .
If viewers want to see The Wire as a searing indictment of free market capitalism or the effects of liberal welfarism , they can , but the programme does n't take a point of view .
That 's not to say , though , that it does n't have a message , and it's that this kind of TV drama still works .
When it 's well written , well acted and portrays its characters without sentiment and without moralising , TV drama can still be a powerful artistic force .
Mark Billingham
Mark Billingham is the author of the Tom Thorne series , about a tormented DI in the Metropolitan Police .
He won the 2003 Sherlock Award for Best UK detective novel for Scaredy Cat .
His latest novel , In the Dark , is published next month .
To seek out novelists as members of a show 's writing team is extremely rare but just such a forward - thinking policy - specifically the use of a triumvirate of America 's finest urban crime novelists - has played a major part in making The Wire into the most acclaimed and groundbreaking TV drama in decades .
George Pelecanos , Dennis Lehane and Richard Price are the perfect writers for a show that is anything but a conventional crime series .
As with their critically lauded novels , The Wire is able to deliver the genre goods while at the same time painting a deftly nuanced portrait of a city - in this case Baltimore - where the social fabric has been systematically degraded by those entrusted with its welfare .
With what David Simon has called a ' murderers ' row ' of writers on board , the show was further able to develop the novelistic approach which makes it so unique .
With each episode a ' chapter ' in a novel that lasts a season , The Wire makes no concessions to its viewers .
This is not a show you can pick up halfway through .
Pelecanos , Lehane and Price each write with the precision that can only come from a novelist 's research , and their work has an enviable economy .
Theirs is fat - free storytelling , with each able to nail a character in a few key lines of razor - sharp dialogue without the need for back story or clumsy exposition .
Though the plot moves along quickly enough to satisfy those used to less ambitious projects , the writers have been given the freedom to let themes and story - strands develop at their own pace .
Characters are brought to life during seemingly innocuous conversations in bars or in police cruisers , each relationship as important as any other in a narrative arc that is not constricted by a ticking clock or the need for action sequences .
It remains to be seen if the righteous fury of The Wire 's vision has been the wake - up call it should be , but at the very least those responsible for TV drama in Britain should take a hard look , and perhaps be a little braver .

I love Reddit :)
Karl Rove 's role in building , running and ruining the most corrupt , inept and politically polarizing presidential administration in U.S. history , is the stuff of legends .
The below excerpts from Paul Alexander 's new book , " Machiavelli's Shadow : The Rise And Fall Of Karl Rove " , gives a stunning picture of how Rove , within hours of Hurricane Katrina making landfall , put his political machine to work protecting George Bush , his administration and their Republican allies in the Gulf Coast region , by smearing both New Orlenas Mayor , Ray Nagin and Louisiana Governor , Kathleen Blanco .
With Karl Rove neutered and disgraced , Alexander found that people ( politicians ) directly involved in the disaster were finally willing to speak openly about the immoral , disgraceful and unforgivably political nature of the Bush Administration 's handling of one the worst natural disasters ever to strike the United States -- and was widely viewed as a seminal moment in the downward spiral of George Bush , Karl Rove and the Republican party , from which they never recovered .
Excerpts from Salon :
On Monday , August 29 , 2005 , at about 6:00 a.m. , Hurricane Katrina slammed into the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama .
A category 5 hurricane until just before landfall , it was one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast .
Kathleen Blanco , the governor of Louisiana , had been briefed extensively about what to expect when the storm hit , which was why , on the Friday night before the storm reached the coast , she signed papers declaring Louisiana to be in a state of emergency .
Based on what she had been told by her advisers and what she knew from being a native Louisianan , she understood that Katrina , creeping gradually toward land with sustained winds of a strength rarely seen in a hurricane , could prove to be catastrophic for Louisiana , and particularly for New Orleans .
If Bush had not seen what was taking place by Tuesday , Karl Rove had .
The first evidence of Rove 's involvement in the Katrina disaster occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
" Rove understood what a nightmare this was for the president , " Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana says , " so he went into high gear on the spin thing they 're so good at in the White House .
Rove had David Vitter , the Republican senator from Louisiana .
I was at a press conference and David Vitter walked up to the mike and said , ' I just got off the phone with Karl Rove . '
I looked at the governor and she looked at me , like , ' Why is David Vitter on the phone with Karl Rove ? '
I mean , he could have been talking to generals , the president himself , but Rove is just a political hatchet man . "
" I could not believe that the president of the United States , staged by Karl Rove himself , had come down to the city of New Orleans and basically put up a stage prop .
It was like you had gone to a studio in California and filmed a movie .
They put the props up and the minute we were gone they took them down .
All the dump trucks were gone .
All the Coast Guard people were gone .
It was an empty spot with one little crane .
It was the saddest thing I have ever seen in my life .
At that moment I knew what was going on and I 've been a changed woman ever since .
It truly changed my life . "

Recently , Harvard researchers reported that children with autism have a wide range of genetic defects , making it nearly impossible to develop a simple genetic test to identify the disorder .
Now , University of Missouri researchers are studying 3 - D imaging to reveal correlations in the facial features and brain structures of children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , which will enable them to develop a formula for earlier detection of the disorder .
The researchers anticipate their work also will reveal genetic clues that can direct additional research .
Autism is a brain disorder characterized by a complex of social , communication and behavioral difficulties .
“ When you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children , it is obvious there are variations .
Currently , autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities .
We are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier , more precise detection of specific types of the disorder , ” said Ye Duan , assistant computer science professor in the MU College of Engineering .
“ Once we have created a formula , we can pre-screen children by performing a quick , non-invasive scan of each child ’s face and brain to check for abnormalities .
Early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families . ”
“ Instead of looking at brain structures slice - by - slice in an MRI ( magnetic resonance image ) , we developed tools to create 3 - D representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons , ” said Kevin Karsch , a research assistant in Duan ’s computer graphics lab , MU senior and Goldwater Scholar .
“ Using the 3 - D representations , we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non-autistic children ; no one has ever done that . ”
Duan ’s facial and brain imaging work will focus on two ASD subgroups hypothetically identified by Judith Miles , the William and Nancy Thompson Endowed Chair in Child Health at the Thompson Center .
She has observed and distinguished children with a tendency toward more physical and brain abnormalities and smaller heads as having complex autism .
Only about 20 percent of affected children fit this subset .
The other 80 percent are classified as having essential autism .
Miles also has identified physical similarities in facial structure and increased cranium size among those in the essential group and has speculated that the traits may be related to brain abnormalities .
To address the pressing questions about brain development and function in autism , a dozen University of Missouri researchers from a variety of disciplines formed The Autism Neuroscience Research Group ( ANRG ) .
“ Our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines .
Ye ’s work will be a pivotal part of ANRG ’s grand scheme , ” Miles said .
“ To solve these problems , it takes an entire community of specialists working together . ”
The U.S. Department of Defense awarded Duan , in collaboration with researchers at the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders , a $ 110,000 grant to create a facial imaging system that will make identical measurements of the faces of children with ASD .
Additionally , the NARSAD Foundation , the world ’s leading charity dedicated to mental health research , awarded Duan the Young Investigator Award and $ 60,000 to fund 3 - D imaging of various segments of the brain in children with ASD .
The projects also are supported by a $ 100,000 contribution from other MU sources and $ 30,000 in Research Scholar Funds .
Police curbed the gray , four - door Mercury Grand Marquis Ruci was driving after he allegedly committed a lane violation , the highway patrol statement indicated .
A specially trained , narcotics - detecting dog was brought to the scene , and its reaction to the car signaled the presence of drugs , the statement said .
A search of the vehicle yielded 104 pounds of hydroponically - grown marijuana stuffed inside eight black plastic trash bags .
Police said the marijuana had an estimated street sale value of more than $ 4.7 million .
[ Naperville Sun ]
During a routine traffic stop in Ohio , police discovered over 100 pounds of the most valuable marijuana ever documented :
This is really an incredible discovery and I 'm surprised it has n’t generated more attention .
At $ 4.7 million for 104 pounds , we 're talking about an ounce that 's worth $ 2824.51 !
That just blows away everything listed at High Times 's market quotes section , where ounces of high - grade marijuana in Ohio last month were listed at $ 400 .
It also overwhelms the STRIDE data collected by drug enforcement officers showing that U.S. marijuana prices averaged around $ 200 per ounce as of 2003 .
So far , I have n’t heard of anyone smoking this new type of marijuana , but that 's probably because the police took it all .
*********
Ok , enough .
In case you have n't figured it out yet , this marijuana is n't worth $ 4.7 million .
The police maybe got a little carried away and reporters do n't doublecheck their numbers on things like this .
It 's happened before .
The problem is the numbers are so far off here that it really takes the crime to a different level , an inaccurate one .
They magnified the value by a factor of 10 , roughly , if the smoker - submitted street prices at High Times are realistic ( my guess is they 're the most accurate numbers available ) .
The Naperville Sun , The Toledo Blade , and local ABC News grabbed the story , with The Sun even rounding up in the headline , " Driver arrested with $ 5 million in pot " .
Ironically , the $ 300,000 they added for the headline is much closer to what it was actually worth .
Police also stated that it was " hydroponically - grown , " but they admitted not knowing where it came from , meaning they can't be sure how it was actually grown .
Perhaps they just like to say " hydroponic , " in which case they 're certainly not alone .
Amidst the numerous tragedies and injustices caused by our nation 's war on drugs , the tendency to exaggerate drug seizures is a minor one .
But it 's annoying , it happens a lot , and it might even have the unintended effect of encouraging people to think growing marijuana will make them a millionaire .
Action Alert : ( Updated )
Let 's respond to this by contacting the papers that reported it and letting them know they 've been pushing a false headline .
Here are a few of them :
Cleveland Plain - Dealer : send a letter / comment here
ABC News send a letter / comment here
Toledo Blade send a letter / comment here .
Naperville Sun send a letter / comment here .
You can send more or less the same comment to each , but be sure to include the appropriate link for their coverage , so they know what you 're referring to .
And , of course , be brief , on topic , and polite .
Update 2 : Fascinatingly , The Chicago Tribune has the story , but leaves out the claims that the marijuana was valued at $ 4.7 million .
That was the headline elsewhere .
Could it be that Chicago Tribune was suspicious of the numbers ?

Subject : [ ANN ] Halcyon 0.5.0 Released !
From : " Matt Todd " < chiology@ a . m
Date : Wed , 11 Jun 2008 09:16:34 +0900
Halcyon version 0.5.0 has been released !
== DESCRIPTION
Halcyon is a framework for developing service - oriented applications .
== ANNOUNCEMENT
Halcyon has gone through a major refactoring : the codebase has been completely restructured and developed from scratch .
Halcyon apps behave much more like applications and the framework has separated itself completely from the server domain .
== EVOLUTION
The 0.4.0 branch had numerous design and implementation deficiencies , mainly due to a lack of experience and understanding on my part .
Putting applications into production has revealed numerous flaws and prompted a complete rewrite , which is where Halcyon 0.5.0 has come from .
Not only are Halcyon applications more app - like than previously , Halcyon itself has matured and separated itself from any type of server - specific functionality which Rack 's handlers and the servers themselves are far more capable of handling .
In addition to these changes , applications look more app - like with a proper implementation of an MVC pattern ( though the view is still just JSON responses and the models are not explicitly factored in by default ) .
I 'm really proud to announce this iteration of Halcyon and can only see great improvement hereon !
== CHANGES * major refactor , completely incompatible with 0.4.0 applications * new application - centric structure and design [ # 13 resolved ] * remove coupled server code , completely Rack - based * full Rack handler support ( Thin / Mongrel /etc ) , daemonization [ # 12 resolved ] * application structure split into controllers [ # 17 resolved ] * application initialize improved greatly , structured * new configurable attributes with config hooks [ # 31 resolved ] * configurable paths [ # 33 resolved ] * new commandline interface for application tasks * new application generation from commandline * able to run application interactively in IRB shell [ # 18 resolved ] * logging configuration improved , more loggers supported [ # 4 resolved ] * added JavaScript , PHP , and Java clients [ # 27 resolved ] * enhanced debugging output [ # 15 resolved ] * fixed changed merb / core_ext dependencies [ # 16 resolved ] * DateTime et al return ISO 8601 format for to_json [ # 19 resolved / deferred ] * much improved documentation , API and otherwise [ # 7 resolved ] * generated applications include better inline documentation [ # 21 resolved ] * improved specs with more thorough testing [ # 2 resolved ] * new examples [ # 23 resolved ] * app init can specify to initialize new Git repo for new app [ # 25 resolved ] * fixed bug with interactive shell not loading the correct paths [ # 39 resolved ] * extended status codes to provide more extensive errors / states == SYNOPSIS
A great example of an SOA is the Twitter API service , accessed via sending requests to URLs and parsing the data returned .
Halcyon utilizes the widely used HTTP protocol and JSON format for handling requests and responses , making its overall footprint light and sending complex data trivial .
Halcyon is built on top of Rack which means it can be folded into existing Rack application stacks , can be run on any kind of server supported ( including Thin , Mongrel , etc ) , and provides a great deal of flexibility for injecting functionality .
Several example applications exist within the repository .
Check them out at http://github.com/mtodd/halcyon/tree/master/examples/. == INSTALLATION
Halcyon can be installed with RubyGems with : $ sudo gem install halcyon
The latest development gem can be downloaded from with : $ sudo gem install halcyon -- source=http://halcyon.rubyforge.org/latest/
If you 're feeling adventurous , you can also clone the repository and install directly from the Rake task : $ git clone git://github.com/mtodd/halcyon.git $ cd halcyon ; rake install NOTE : Because of platform limitations with dependencies , Halcyon by default only ensures that the JSON pure - Ruby variant is installed .
To install the faster C - based extension , try : $ sudo gem install json == DOCUMENTATION Halcyon has been under a complete overhaul of its documentation ( and is still being worked on ) .
New articles have been written for getting started , writing controllers , defining routes , etc , and even more advanced topics have been touched on ( or are planned ) , such as integrating databases into the development of your application as well as taking full advantage of the Rack features .

The first time someone snatched the speech processor from behind her son ’s ear , Hilda Giron got it back .
She had been shopping for groceries and shouted to the cashier to watch 3 - year - old Jose while she took off after the young thief and his accomplice .
The boys probably thought they had grabbed a Bluetooth headset , which are in high demand now that California requires drivers to use hands - free cellphones .
Luckily , the boys ditched the $ 6,000 earpiece -- the external part of Jose ’s implanted hearing device -- as they fled .
Giron found it in the market parking lot , still intact .
Then a week ago , she and Jose were having lunch at a McDonald ’s on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard when two teenagers grabbed the earpiece and ran .
This time , the thieves got away .
Advertisement
“ He kept asking , ‘ Where is it ?
Where is it ? ’ ” Giron said in Spanish , repeating words the processor had helped Jose learn to say .
Advocates for the deaf at first welcomed the Bluetooth craze : Deaf people with cochlear implants , they thought , would n’t stand out so much if everyone wore little gadgets behind their ears .
But some now fear that Bluetooth headsets will become as popular with thieves as iPods -- and that deaf people will become inadvertent targets .
Jose Franco was 2 when he received his cochlear implant .
The electronic device has interior and exterior parts : an interior receiver and an exterior earpiece and transmitter .
Advertisement
The tiny receiver , barely thicker than a credit card , is surgically implanted in the skull .
The earpiece contains a battery , a microphone and a computer to process and send signals to the receiver via a bottle - cap - size transmitter .
Magnets connect the transmitter to the receiver .
Regular hearing aids help people with limited hearing by amplifying sounds .
Cochlear implants convert sounds into electrical signals that directly stimulate the auditory nerve , bypassing the parts of the inner ear that do not function .
The implant does not restore hearing .
But with intensive practice , the brain can learn to interpret the impulses , allowing many deaf people to learn to speak and understand words .
Advertisement
Giron and her husband , Elias Franco , did n’t know anything about cochlear implants when Jose failed the hearing test for newborns that is mandatory in California .
The mother of a daughter 17 years older than Jose , Giron emigrated from Guatemala in 2000 .
Her hopes for her first U.S. - born child shattered when she learned he was deaf .
“ I felt as though heaven and earth just collapsed on each other , ” Giron said .
She turned for help to a doctor at California Hospital Medical Center , where Jose was born .
She ca n’t remember the doctor ’s name , but said she ’ll always remember his kindness .
Advertisement
“ Do n’t worry , ” she remembered him saying .
“ You ’re going to be in good hands . ”
The hospital referred Jose to the House Ear Institute , a nonprofit research and treatment center , for more tests .
He was fitted with hearing aids at 6 months and referred to the John Tracy Clinic , a nonprofit education center for parents of children with hearing loss .
For about 95 % of such children , there is no family history of deafness , said Barbara Hecht , president of the clinic .
And there often is no explanation .
It comes , she said , “ out of the blue . ”
Like most parents on first arrival , Giron and Franco were still in shock .
Advertisement
“ There ’s tremendous grieving going on , ” Hecht said .
“ It ’s almost like a death in the family , of the dreams you had for your child .
Our job is to put the pieces of the dream back together . ”
Franco , who met Giron after emigrating from Guatemala in 2003 , took months to accept that his first child could not hear .
“ I thought it was a big mistake , a misdiagnosis , ” he said through a translator .
“ Probably we men react differently than mothers do .
Even after the exams confirmed it , I had this inner voice telling me he was going to hear , to talk . ”
In ways Jose ’s parents never imagined , he has .
Advertisement
The clinic , in a leafy enclave near USC , is named after the deaf son of its founder , Louise Tracy , and her husband , actor Spencer Tracy .
( John Tracy died last year at age 82 . )
Bucking the conventions of the day , Louise Tracy taught John from infancy to interact with the world .
The clinic she founded in 1942 began as a support group for mothers who did not want to send their deaf children to state boarding schools .
At her insistence , the clinic does not charge families for its services .
Instead , it requires at least one parent to commit to a regimen of individual counseling , family support groups and preschool classes until the child is 6 and ready to enter regular kindergarten .
As much as her family needed the income , Giron gave up a job she loved at a bakery to go to school with Jose .
Advertisement
“ Typically , kids pick up a language incidentally , ” she said .
“ With a deaf child , you have to talk with him over and over .
He does hear it .
His brain is learning how to memorize it . ”
After Jose received the implant , Giron learned to talk to him on his “ implant side ” and to take off the earpiece when he plays on plastic slides so static electricity wo n’t erase the programming .
When Franco does n’t have a construction job -- more often the case now with the housing downturn -- he too attends counseling and classes .
Among other things , he is learning to be patient .
“ Sometimes when you want your child to make progress and it takes longer than you expect , that ’s when you feel down , ” he said .
“ But when they do something you did n’t expect them to do , you feel this overwhelming sensation . ”
Advertisement
Jose can claim accomplishments that might surprise the hearing world .
In class one morning last week , he sang , “ The ants go marching one by one , ” and flung up his arms for “ Hurrah ! Hurrah ! ”
And like many of his classmates , he speaks in not one language but two : Spanish and English .
The theft of the processor has not halted his progress .
Cochlear implants come with a backup earpiece .
Most insurance plans cover the $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 cost of the implant , and for low - income children like Jose , California Family Services and Medi-Cal pick up the tab .
But replacing the backup will be up to Giron and Franco .
For now , they fasten the remaining earpiece to a strap , clip the strap to Jose ’s T - shirt -- and worry .

“ He hates taking it off , ” Giron said .

Now this really is a mixed blessing .
On the one hand , I m thrilled to see that a study documenting the anti-cancer properties of cannabinoids is finally receiving some mainstream media attention .
On the other hand , I m disappointed that its coverage is limited to a British tabloid that is better known for running anti-pot propaganda like this :
Cannabis killer knifed neighbour 100 times via Metro.co.uk
A mentally ill man driven to violent frenzies by cannabis was sentenced to life yesterday for stabbing a man 100 times .
Kashmiri , 50 , of Tooting , south London , sexually assaulted the woman at her south London home in June , 2006 , and returned five nights later to attack her .
Kashmiri , whose violent episodes are triggered by cannabis , denied murder but admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility .
Of course , Im accustomed to reading  Reefer Madness  in the British press .
But Im less accustomed to reading  Reefer Madness  when it comes from the mouth of an established medi- pot researcher like Dr. Wai Man Liu .
Cannabis may help the war on cancer via Metro.co.uk
Cannabis could be used to treat many forms of cancer , new research suggests .
The drug contains an ingredient which slows tumour growth and prevents the reproduction of cancer cells , doctors say .
Its effects are seen in all cancers but particularly in those of the lung and brain , and leukaemia , it is claimed .
But scientists warned against smoking the drug , saying the only safe version was that created in the lab .
Researcher Dr Wai Man Liu said :  Im in no way encouraging people to take up smoking the ganja — there would be more harm than good . 
Previous research has shown cannabis - based medicines can help cancer patients as a painkiller , appetite stimulant and in reducing nausea .
The drug has also long been used by multiple sclerosis and arthritis sufferers to reduce pain .
Its medicinal benefits come from the main active ingredient , THC .
The latest research , by St Georges University of London , shows that THC can weaken cancer cells to make traditional chemotherapy more effective .
Dr Liu said :  It s another weapon against the armour of cancer .
We are quite close but need to jump through certain hoops .
I believe it could be used in two to three years . 
Dr Joanna Owens , from Cancer Research UK , said the latest studies were encouraging but needed to be followed up with more trials .
She added :  Making cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy or radiotherapy is a great concept but it is still early days . 
Having recently lost friends and family members to cancer , including one to leukemia , I can inform Dr. Liu that such a diagnosis — even when treated with standard radiation and chemotherapy — is a death sentence .
For Dr. Liu to advise , with a straight face no less , that these patients would do more harm than good  by smoking cannabis is a disgrace .
Not only can cannabis alleviate cancer patients  nausea and pain , elevate their mood , and increase their appetite , but also — as Dr. Lius own data demonstrates — it may help to alleviate the very disease that s ravaging their bodies .
Nevertheless , I suppose that Dr. Liu would rather have these patients shut up and die than expose the political hypocrisy surrounding criminalizing a plant .
Finally , as for Dr. Lius idyllic estimate that his pharmaceutically - approved pot - based anti-cancer drugs will be available in two to three years ,  dont hold your breath ( or , if you already have cancer , try not to die in the interim ) .
Im sure that these investigators made similar proclamations when they documented pots anti-cancer properties — in 1975 !
Yet here we are 33 years later and the only u201 Cprogressu201D we ’ve made on this issue is in the wrong direction — having moved from investigating the plants anti-cancer potential in animals to cells in vitro in a petri dish !
Thank you Dr. Liu ; now kindly get out of my sight .

Problem : the Internet is running out of addresses .
Clean solution : create more addresses by increasing the address length from 32 to 128 bits .
Messy solution : have multiple systems share a single 32 - bit address through Network Address Translation ( NAT ) .
After years of applying the messy NAT solution , it looks like we 're going to run out of 32 - bit IP v4 addresses within the next three years or so anyway , so those who want to connect to the Internet after 2011 or 2012 will probably have to use IPv6 .
But everyone else will still be on IP v4 , so we need some way for IP v6 users to talk to IP v4 users .
Could the much - maligned NAT be the solution ?
Because of the large address space , IP v6 does n't need NAT to conserve addresses , so many IP v6 proponents have been looking forward to a future without NAT .
In a five - page article , however , Network World suggests that the Internet Engineering Task Force is considering adding NAT to IPv6 .
In its current form , NAT introduces a number of problems .
It works just fine when end - users initiate a connection to a server , but it gets in the way when two end - users want to talk directly , such as when transferring files using an instant messaging client or with Apple 's back - to - my - Mac service .
There are ways to avoid these problems , but every application interacts with NAT differently , so there are often combinations that wo n't work .
What we 're actually working on in the IETF — yes , my name appears on some of the working documents — is n't IPv6 NAT as such .
We 're trying to find a reasonable way to translate between the IPv6 and IP v4 worlds .
Just translating an IP v6 packet to an IP v4 packet is n't all that hard , provided you have an IP v4 address for every IP v6 address that needs translation .
But the whole reason why we need IP v6 in the first place is that we do n't have an IP v4 address for every user — let alone every device — that wants to connect to the Internet .
So just translating the protocols is n't enough : just like a home with several computers that share a single Internet connection with a single IP v4 address , several IP v6 users who share a translator will have to share an IP v4 address .
This is where NAT comes in : it 's only applied when an IP v6 system talks to an IP v4 system , not when two IP v6 systems are communicating .
From time to time , IETF - ers speak up in favor of NAT in IP v6 , suggesting that we should just get over ourselves as ( enterprise ) users have grown to like the fact that a single address can hide an entire network .
However , if we were to design NAT for IP v6 , it would look very different from NAT as it exists today .
Being able to have stable internal addressing despite changing connectivity to the rest of the world can be very useful .
An airplane that connects to different ground stations during a flight , for example , may want to avoid renumbering all the internet - connected systems on board each time it hooks up with a different ground station .
However , with IPv6 there is no need to make all the devices on board share a single address as it's actually much easier to translate one range of IP v6 addresses to another range of IP v6 addresses — this requires much less meddling with protocols and applications .
So far , nobody has seriously suggested a one - to - one IPv6 NAT , let alone standardizing an address sharing NAT for IPv6 .
But that lack of standardization did n't really stop anyone from doing NAT with IP v4 , either ...
In any event , it looks like after next week 's IETF meeting in Dublin , IP v6 may not be as architecturally pristine as it was once envisioned to be .
But we 're not ready to throw out the baby with the bath water just yet .
According to reports in The Sun and elsewhere , a vacationer who was walking past Bono 's home in the South of France managed to record four songs from U2's upcoming album as they blasted from Bono 's windows .
( The house in question is thought to be the orange one in the photo to the right . )
The four muddily recorded tracks available on this page , via YouTube , are believed to be " No Line on the Horizon " ( the presumptive title track ) , " Sexy Boots , " " Moment Of Surrender , " and " For Your Love , " all from the band 's upcoming album .
They appear to have been posted by Vetle Vik Gundersen , a 15 year old Norwegian guitarist and U2 fan .
In addition to male and female voices , waves are audible in thebackground of the recordings , lending credence to the theory that thesesongs were recorded from the beach .
Celebrities often encounter issueswith photographers hassling them from beaches , since they 're generally public property below the high tide mark .
But this is thefirst we 've heard of someone leaking songs from an unreleased album inthis way .
No Line on the Horizon appears
to be slated for a November 14th release .
The band recently releasedremastered versions of their first three albums War , October and Boy –
all playable for free on imeem .

Many workers on low salaries say they could lose out under the changes Hoarding loose change .
Always having to buy the cheapest groceries .
Dreading the arrival of utility bills through the door .
Britain 's low earners say their lives are already difficult enough .
But changes to the tax system could mean that making ends meet becomes even harder for many .
Under the new system , standard income tax has been cut from 22 % to 20 % and tax credits raised - but the lowest 10 p band has been scrapped entirely .
The government insists many stand to benefit .
But a Treasury Select Committee report has warned that households without children or anyone over the age of 65 , and on incomes below £ 18,500 a year , would lose out by up to £ 232 a year .
' Very painful '
Nervously awaiting her latest payslip is Victoria Forester , 55 , from Birmingham , who earns just over £ 11,000 as an audio typist .
She fears the reforms could be enough to break her already frugal budget .
To make up the shortfall , she says , she would have to give up the Nissan Micra she drives to work - even though her bad back makes walking any distance agonising .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I never thought I would see a Labour government penalise people in the lower pay bracket Elizabeth Philips , Halifax " It 's very painful for me to walk , " she says .
" But if it 's as much as I fear , I might just have to do it .
" As it is I always try to buy the cheapest own - brand groceries but it 's never enough .
I 'd love a fresh wardrobe but I can't remember the last time I bought new clothes .
" I do n't think it should be people on low incomes who have to pay more .
It should be those with higher incomes - like MPs . "
Her sentiments are shared by receptionist Kate Mason , 22 , from Newcastle , who is on an annual salary of £ 11,000 .
She says she is penalised because she earns too little to think about supporting a family , but as a result does n't qualify for working families tax credits .
At the end of each month I 'm scrabbling around looking for pennies
Kevin Davia
" Money is a constant worry for me , " she says .
" I keep a diary of which bills are due and I 'm always checking my bank balance .
" Now I 'm going to be even worse off .
There 's no way I can think about getting a mortgage or anything like that .
" This is meant to be a government for the ordinary Joe , but it seems to be hitting the poorest hardest . "
' Corporate ladder ' Kevin Davia , 34 , from Hitchin in Hertfordshire , says that he also has trouble making ends meet - a situation which will be made worse by the tax changes .
He takes home £ 13,500 a year working in customer support and says he has already been hit by rises in the cost of petrol , gas and electricity .
" As it is I have to dip into my credit card to pay the bills , " he says .
" At the end of each month I 'm scrabbling around looking for pennies .
" In business I think when people get so far up the corporate ladder they forget about the people on the bottom rung , and the same obviously applies to politicians . "
Ministers say the changes will benefit millions .
But that may be little comfort to those working on the breadline who feel they have been forgotten .

We do n’t need him to do any more “ work ” .
We ’re not asking that he do anything , really .
It might be better if he just went to Crawford until January .
But since he insists on carrying on the charade of being a representative of the American people , all we really want is for him to stop saying moronic things in front of important world leaders for the duration of his time in office .
Really , is that too much to ask ?
George “ The Decider ” Bush met in Japan a couple weeks ago for a summit with the leaders of the top eight industrial nations ( G8 ) to discuss how they plan to have their way with the globe .
Naturally , ( no pun intended ) among the items on the agenda was the subject of climate change .
The G8 were unable to come to an agreement on any definitive action with regard to climate change , but rather than this being a cause for sober reflection , it inspired our fearless leader to conclude his comments at the summit by punching at the air and saying , “ Goodbye from the world ’s biggest polluter . ”
Now , I ’m just a humble blogger ; certainly no diplomat or statesman .
I work in my pajamas half the time , drink too much coffee , and watch reality TV while surfing the internet and reading DIGG .
And yet , even I know that an international summit is not the place to crack jokes about how little my country cares about the planet .
Reporters state that everyone at the summit was shocked by the president ’s remarks .
I ’m sure there were a few moments before they recovered when their faces revealed a furious mental debate in which they tried to decide whether he is an idiot or ballsy .
Personally , I think both are true .
A ballsy idiot is representing our interests to the entire civilized world .
And that , my friends , is no laughing matter .
General Motors ( GM ) is in talks to possibly sell the Hummer brand to Mahindra & Mahindra , an Indian automaker .
Automakers in China and Russia are also said be interested .
Considering the only place the Hummers are selling nowadays is in Asia , we 're not surprised .
While GM had said every option was on the table regarding Hummer , even an overhaul of the brand , a sale always seemed like the most probable outcome .
Something about a " hybrid Hummer " just does n't sound right .

The SnuzNLuz alarm clock connects to your online bank account via WiFi and donates your real money to an organization you hate every time you push the snooze button .

Texas Company Will Recycle Offshore Oil Platforms for Wind Turbines
April 30th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
Wind Energy Systems Technology ( WEST ) will use old oil platforms to support new wind turbines .
Herman Schellstede , CEO of WEST , holds sixty - seven U.S. patents and ten international patents , and is a naval architect and marine engineer .
His partner , Harold Schoeffler , is a longtime Louisiana environmentalist , having co-founded Save Our Coast .
The company is presently engaging in wind monitoring activities , shown in the picture at left .
Still , I have n’t seen any announcement of any turbines actually being built on these recycled oil platforms .
Wired has a nice story with great visuals dating from Feb. 2007 .
If anyone has more recent news , please comment below .
Remaking old oil platforms into clean energy sources is a beguiling idea , but it would be even more charming to actually see wind turbines producing wind off the coast of Texas .

Although described personally as quiet and impeccably mannered , von Bismarck continued to live high on the hog , hosting riotous all - night parties for his ( chiefly gay ) friends at his £ 5 million flat off Sloane Square .
It was at one such event , in August last year , that von Bismarck encountered tragedy for a second time when one of his male guests fell 60 ft to his death from the roof garden .
While von Bismarck was not arrested , he was questioned as a witness and there were those who wondered - not , perhaps , without cause - whether he might be the victim of a family curse .
How to Take Great Breaks at the Office
Updated 11-10-2018
Most of us feel that we work too hard and that we do n’t have enough breaks during our working day .
The time between 8 am and 7 pm is a blur that only ends when we unlock the front door at night .
We generally give time pressure as the main reason for the stress in our work day .
But a lack of time is not the only reason .
Most of us simply do not know how to take a lunch or coffee break .
When we do have a little time , we end up scrolling through emails with coffee cup in hand , talking about work with colleagues or playing computer games .
Often we even drift back into work without realizing it .
Yes , we are often dragged back to work by ourselves , not by the boss .
Where to start ?
Taking quality breaks is good for company productivity as well as your heart and soul .
( Click here to see some background . )
Reminding yourself that taking good breaks will make money and save you from a heart attack will no doubt motivate you to start changing the way you work .
As a first step , take the 2 ×2 test .
Try two of the techniques described below for two days .
Do nothing
The best way to take a break is to do absolutely nothing .
Do n’t think about what you are going to do next .
Do n’t sit and stew about what your boss just said .
Do n’t check emails or take calls or even read the newspaper .
If you find doing nothing hard to do , use some of the following techniques .
Variety , variety , variety
To get rest during work breaks , do something different .
If you are glued to a computer , move around .
If you are a waitron , sit down for a while .
If you are a manual laborer , read something .
If you are an academic , do something physical .
At least get away from your computer screen .
Leave your cubicle if you can .
Getting out of your building would be even better .
This is easier done than said .
A simple walk to the water fountain or a walk downstairs to buy the newspaper may do the trick .
Draw the line
Do not mix work and breaks .
Clearly marking the beginning and end of a break will help you take a break in the first place .
It will also ensure that you do not float back into work without realizing .
Designate a few minutes for a break set the alarm on your mobile phone to mark its beginning and end .
Many of the techniques described here only take a minute or two .
Avoid discussing work with colleagues during this time .
If you can , do n’t take or make phone calls .
When you do work during breaks , it stops being a break and starts becoming part of the work day blur .
Move
Most people are sedentary at work , so movement gives a break .
Take a walk , do a few stretches ( check out this 3 minute stretching routine ) .
Breathe
Breathing deeply reduces stress .
Simply close your eyes and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth .
Doing this 3 or 4 times is surprisingly calming .
Look
Your eyes need rest too .
Closing your eyes for a minute or two is a surefire break .
Looking at something calming like a plant , a garden or even just the clouds can also bring you back into the zone .
If all else fails , have a look at the photo gallery of the Cloud Appreciation Society .
Listen
Close your eyes for a few moments and listen to the sounds around you .
If your mind is too busy to do this , try and concentrate on one of the sounds .
My loud old air - conditioner is very useful for this exercise .
Or hook up your MP3 player .
Listen to whatever works for you , but in the end Mozart and John Coltrane may be more calming than Sepultura or Cannibal Corpse .
Take Micro- breaks
Micro - breaks can be taken at any time of the day .
Many of the techniques discussed here can be applied without taking a formal break .
Take calls on your balcony .
Try micro-napping by closing your eyes for a few seconds during meetings – if asked , tell them you were trying to listen carefully .
You could also try printing out your work to proofread it rather than proofing from your monitor .
Walk over to your colleagues rather than phoning or emailing them .
Or just stare at the clouds when you are sucked into another interminable conference call .

My latest redesign project at work was for Group Logic .
Another company did the design and created static HTML templates .
My role was to create a single header and footer to make maintaining the site easier , and to wrap the store and other dynamic applications in the new design .
The company who designed it used images for the form buttons , and I found some interesting things while implementing them .
A Disclaimer
I think before you design form buttons to be images , you should seriously consider just styling the buttons with CSS .
Just think about all of the images you will have to maintain .
Is the value of the image button style really that great that you will deal with all of that hassle ?
In my opinion , it ’s not .
But whatever , to each his own ( you like that Nate ? ) .
Ok , enough with the disclaimer , now on to the good stuff .
Some Options
Ok , so I decided that there were 3 options for implementing these buttons :
Use < input type =" submit " /> and use an image replacement technique ( that I did n’t think would work in Safari ) .
Use < input type =" image " /> and have the image source as an attribute .
Use < button type =" submit " ></ button > and insert the image within the button element .
My Decision
With ease of implementation in mind ( since the time line was short ) , I decided to go with option 2 : < input type = " image " /> .
Everything went fine until we decided to test in IE ( 6 and 7 ) .
Apparently , the value from the button does not get passed onto the server .
After some Googling around , I found out that this is a well known problem , and the only way to get this to work is by using JavaScript .
Whenever I code something with JavaScript , I want to make sure that it works without JavaScript .
So that solution would not work .
The Next Option
Next , I went with option 3 : < button type = " submit " ></ button > .
I really did not know much about the button element until I read Rediscovering the Button Element a year ago .
Again , that option worked fine in everything , except IE6 this time ( in IE7 , it passed in the entire source of the image as the value , but we could find a way to make that work ) .
Apparently , if you have multiple button elements with the same name attributes , the value that comes out from the server in IE6 is the value from the last element on the form .
Ok , maybe that was confusing .
The example page might clarify some .
The first example is just < input type = " submit " /> .
The second example is < input type = " image " /> .
Finally , the third example is < button type = " submit " ></ button > .
Be sure to try that in IE6 and IE7 to see the problems I explained .
A Third Try ?
Ok , this sucks , obviously I went with option 1 this time : < input type = " submit " /> .
We know from the first example on the previous page that the value is at least passed through to the server properly in all browsers .
Now the fun part is just trying to style the buttons in all browsers .
Stying the Input Element
Let ’s assign a class to all of the buttons we are going to style , and just add some basic styles to the button :
input.buttons {
background : none no -repeat top left ;
border : none ;
cursor : pointer ;
display : block ;
height : 25 px ;
overflow : hidden ;
padding : 0 ;
margin : 0 2px 0 0 ;
text - indent : - 9999 px ;
width : auto ;
}
Most of that should be pretty self explanatory .
So let ’s now add in the background images for the 3 buttons and give them a width :
input.updateCart { background - image : url( update - cart.gif ) ; width : 107 px ; }
input.continueShopping { background - image : url( continue - shopping.gif ) ; width : 146 px ; }
input.proceedCheckout { background - image : url ( proceed - to- checkout.gif ) ; width : 156 px ; }
The images are actually CSS Sprites so let ’s add in the hover effect :
input . buttons : hover { background - position : 0 - 25 px ; }
Sweet , let ’s take a look at the page .
Nice , it even looks good in Safari .
Of course , it ’s broken in IE 6 and IE 7 .
Check out the weird buttons in IE
Fixing for IE
Ok , so I had no idea how to even attack this problem .
So I started playing around , and finally came up with this :
input. buttons { font - size : 0 ; line - height : 25 px ; }
So I just serve those properties to IE6 and IE7 .
Beautiful , it works now .
One Last Thing
So we were able to get these buttons working in all browsers .
There is just one minor thing that bugged me .
The hover effect does not work on the buttons in IE6 .
How about we use jQuery to fix that for IE6 :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
$ ( 'input.buttons ' ) .hover ( function ( ) {
$ ( this ).css ( ' background - position ' , '0 - 25 px ' ) ;
} ,
function ( ) {
$ ( this ).css (' background - position ' , '0 0 ' ) ;
}
) ;
} ) ;
Nice , it works in IE6 .
So yeah , that was really long .
But form buttons are always a fun topic to get working across all browsers .
Anyone have anything they would do differently ?

McCain gave a speech last week in Houston to an audience of oil executives , announcing he now supports offshore oil drilling .
To justify his flip - flop , he claimed that drilling is now so safe that “ not even Hurricane Katrina and Rita could cause significant spillage from battered rigs off the coast of New Orleans and Houston . ”
You can read the transcript or watch him say it :
Unfortunately , the truth is that it is easy to find many reports of oil spills due to hurricane Katrina .
Here ’s a story from the Houston Chronicle .
In fact , the Katrina oil spills were compared to those from the Exxon Valdez , and were even visible from space :
So , does our ever - vigilant media report this error by McCain ?
Let ’s see what they have to say :
“ Hurricanes Katrina and Rita flattened terminals across the Gulf of Mexico but did n’t cause a single oil spill . ” – Wall Street Journal editorial
. ” – Wall Street Journal editorial “ Obama talks about environmental damage from drilling offshore but the fact is the moratorium was put into effect in 1981 .
There ’s been a lot of technological advances since then .
We had Hurricane Katrina go through the heart of the Gulf of Mexico and ravage these oil rigs and there were almost no oil spills , so what ’s he talking about ? ” – Chris Wallace on Fox News ( plus Dick Morris said “ Hurricane Katrina did n’t cause any leakage or any spill in the Gulf of Mexico oil wells . ” )
“ Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large spill . ” – George Will in the Washington Post
What makes this even worse is that it is a craven , evil lie .
The Republicans are trying to convince you that high oil prices are due to environmental regulations that limit off - shore drilling .
But Department of Energy figures show that allowing unlimited drilling offshore ( and in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge , too ) would lower the price of gasoline — are you sitting down ? — by less than 6 cents a gallon .
And not until the year 2025 .
Try to imagine how much gas will cost in 2025 , and how glad you will be that we mucked up our beaches and wildlife for 6 cents a gallon .
Also note that 79 % of America ’s offshore oil reserves are not even restricted by those regulations .
But the oil companies , and their representatives in Washington , ca n’t wait to get rid of any remaining environmental restrictions .
Yesterday , zmedico wrote about building multiple packages in parallel with Portage - 2.2_rc2 .
In Gentoo Prefix , we had a sneak peak to this feature , so I have had some time to play with it on my dual - quad core box .
Some timing results that you may like :
emerge -e system ( excluding sys - devel / gcc )
As a baseline :
With -- jobs=1 and MAKEOPTS=16 , load - average=9 :
real 77m54.290s
user 41m46.086s
sys 29m14.598s
Because I was skeptical of what -- jobs could really do , I decided to start with small number of parallel jobs :
With -- jobs=3 , MAKEOPTS=16 , load - average=9 :
real 61m30.181s
user 42m23.398s
sys 32m32.009s
While that was running , I noticed a very significant amount of time where my cores were idle , thanks to the handy little xfce - extra / xfce4 - cpugraph widget .
So , I turned -- jobs up again :
With -- jobs=5 , MAKEOPTS=16 , load - average=9 :
real 58m5.388s
user 42m35.721s
sys 34m46.950s
Meh , not much improvement there .
Surprising , but I suspect that I may be reaching the limits of the parallelization ( dependencies , etc ) .
With -- jobs=10 , MAKEOPTS=16 , load - average=9 :
real 58m9.824s
user 42m43.525s
sys 37m57.234s
( And actually , a quick visual scan showed load averages staying below 4 .
Only a few times did I see the average above 8 )
Relying solely on load - average to keep my system usable :
With -- jobs=40 , MAKEOPTS=40 load- average=15 :
real 58m45.106s
user 43m15.129s
sys 40m47.949s
The highest load average I visually saw was 23 .
But my load average was mostly always greater than 4 , so this means that my procs are obviously getting used more but I must have hit another bottleneck .
NOTES :
- emerge - pe system was preformed before each time trial to assume the depgraph was in cache .
- 84 packages total
- no ccache / distcc running
Conclusion : 20 minutes ?
~ 30 % speedup .
Wow .
Good !
Quite significant even .
Assuming you have cores / procs to spare , go ahead and crank up those -- jobs .
It is nice to be able to make the ./ configure step not be the bottleneck anymore .
😉
I will keep testing and see if I can get the time down even farther ( although , unlikely based on the last time trial ) .
Test requests ?

Animal shelter workers got quite a surprise last week in Louisiana .
One of their dogs gave birth to a bright green puppy .
" It 's surprising , alarming to see , " Louisiana SPCA CEO Anna Zorrilla said .
" Sometimes , when a puppy is born , the amniotic fluid mixes with the placenta and dyes the coat of the puppy and it almost always happens to very light colored puppies . "
Zorrilla said the puppy will not be green forever , and will likely turn white or a light tan color in the next few weeks .
She also said the health of the puppy wo n't be affected .
" There are not health concerns , " Zorrilla said .
" It 's really just a discoloration in the birthing process . "

Army recruiter threatened teen with jail for not enlisting David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008

An army recruiter in Houston has been lying to high school students about their obligations under a non-binding military " delayed entry program " and even threatening them with jail if they do n't follow through and enlist .
Eighteen year old Irving Gonzales told KHOU 11 News in Houston that as a high school senior he started thinking about enlisting in the Army as a way of helping out his family financially and signed up for the program .
But when he told the recruiter , Sgt. Glenn Marquette , that he'd changed his mind and " I 'd rather just stay here , go to college , " Marquette insisted that Gonzales could n't get out because " you signed a binding contract . "
Accourding to KHOU reporter Mark Greenblatt , Army recruiting regulations state that " delayed entry members can leave any time " and " under no circumstances can a recruiter threaten or intimidate future soldiers . "
In an audio recording played by KHOU , Gonzales went on to ask , " What if I just do n't show up ? "
Marquette replied , " Then guess what ?
You 're AWOL .
...
You want to go to school ?
You will not get no loans .
...
As soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket ... they 're going to see that you 're a deserter .
Then they 're going to apprehend you , take you to jail . "
" All that lovey dovey I want to go to college and all that ? " Marquette concluded .
" Guess what ?
You just threw it out the window . "
Marquette refused to speak to KHOU reporters who caught up with him in a parking lot , telling them , " I do n't want to be bothered . "
However , the Army says that making threats as Marquette did is a violation of regulations and that he has been removed from recruiting duties , pending an investigation .
According to Greenblatt , when KHOU found the same tactics being used three years ago , the story became a national scandal and the military promised its recruiters would be retrained .
" It seems someone did n't learn their lessons , " Greenblatt reports .
The officer involved in that earlier incident was even promoted to be a station commander , responsible for training and supervising other recruiters .
Rep. Ted Poe ( R - TX ) , whose district lies just north and east of Houston , agrees that " there is a problem . "
" Our country cannot deceive its citizens , " Poe who is himself a veteran , told KHOU .
" Since the Army has n't taken the initiative , now Congress may have to get involved .
...
The Army has to get their ship in shape . "
KHOU has more details here .

Army to shoot live pigs for medical drill Associated Press
Published : Friday July 18 , 2008
Print This Email This By JAYMES SONG Associated Press Writer HONOLULU - The Army says it 's critical to saving the lives of wounded soldiers .
Animal - rights activists call the training cruel and outdated .
Despite opposition by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , the Army is moving forward with its plan to shoot live pigs and treat their gunshot wounds in a medical trauma exercise Friday at Schofield Barracks for soldiers headed to Iraq .
Maj .
Derrick Cheng , spokesman for the 25th Infantry Division , said the training is being conducted under a U.S. Department of Agriculture license and the careful supervision of veterinarians and a military Animal Care and Use Committee .
" It 's to teach Army personnel how to manage critically injured patients within the first few hours of their injury , " Cheng said .
The soldiers are learning emergency lifesaving skills needed on the battlefield when there are no medics , doctors or facility nearby , he said .
PETA , however , said there are more advanced and humane options available , including high - tech human simulators .
In a letter , PETA urged the Army to end all use of animals , " as the overwhelming majority of North American medical schools have already done . "
" Shooting and maiming pigs is outdated as Civil War rifles , " said Kathy Guillermo , director of PETA 's Laboratory Investigations Department .
The Norfolk , Va. - based group demanded the exercise be halted after it was notified by a " distraught " soldier from the unit , who disclosed a plan to shoot the animals with M4 carbines and M16 rifles .
" There 's absolutely no reason why they have to shoot live pigs , " PETA spokeswoman Holly Beal said .
The bloody exercise , she said , is difficult for soldiers because they sometimes associate the animals with their own pet dogs .
Cheng said the exercise is conducted in a controlled environment with the pigs anesthetized the entire time .
He had " no doubt whatsoever " in the effectiveness of the instruction , which he called the best option available at the base .
" Those alternative methods just can't replicate what the troops are going to face when we use live - tissue training , " he said .
" What we 're doing is unique to what the soldiers are going to actually experience . "
Cheng did n't have details about the number of pigs , how they were acquired or the weapons involved in the training .
The soldiers being trained are with the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division , which is deploying to Iraq this year .
" We understand ( PETA 's ) concerns and point of view .
At the same , the Army is committed to providing the soldiers with the best training possible , " Cheng said .
Disappointed at the Army 's decision , PETA on Thursday instructed its 2 million members to inundate the Army with calls and e-mails .
" We 're hoping at the 11th hour here that we can have this stopped .
We have to hang on to hope , " Beal said .
PETA believes the U.S. military has conducted similar training at other bases using pigs and goats .

For many youngsters , the mad scramble for candy tossed from parade floats is as much of a holiday tradition as family cookouts and fireworks displays .
“ The kids see the candy as a treasure and they 'll run straight into the street for it , ” said Fort Mitchell , Ohio , Police Chief Steve Hensley .
“ It 's like they have tunnel vision when they enter the street .
They do n't pay any attention to the massive floats coming down Dixie Highway . ”
In Fort Mitchell , which boasts one of the Tristate 's largest Independence Day parades , a city council member recently suggested the city ban candy tossing , in favor of passing it out behind the curb .
In New Orleans , where thousands of Mardi Gras revelers scramble for beads thrown from floats , the city protects parade spectators through enhanced security , barricades , and public service announcements that remind spectators that it 's illegal to run in front of , or behind floats to scoop up beads .
People , take a stand !
They 'll start with candy , but can a fruit toss ban be far behind !
Stop the madness !

Bell Canada Inc. is moving to impose download limits on customers of independent internet providers , an act the smaller firms say is designed to eliminate broadband competition and prevent the introduction of new television services .
The Montreal - based company , which cut its own Sympatico customers off from unlimited downloading last year , has proposed extending that plan to firms renting portions of its network in order to provide their own services .
That would include a number of smaller wholesale ISP customers such as Chatham , Ont. - based TekSavvy Solutions Inc. , Cobourg , Ont. - based Eagle.ca , Mississauga - based Acanac Inc. and Ottawa - based National Capital Freenet .
The limits would range from two gigabytes per month for customers with slower connections of 512 kilobits per second up to 60 GB for those with the faster speeds of five megabits per second , according to Acanac president Paul Louro .
Customers who exceed those limits would incur extra charges , much like cellphone subscribers do when they surpass their monthly minutes .
Rocky Gaudreault , president of TekSavvy , said Bell 's proposal was unacceptable because it would eliminate the last way in which the smaller wholesale ISPs can differentiate their services .
" This is very much making us little more than a reseller , " he said .
" We would become mini-Sympaticos . "
Louro told CBCNews .ca the repercussions would be even greater because some of the smaller ISPs are getting big enough to start installing their own equipment in Bell 's telecommunications offices , which will allow them to offer not only super - fast broadband but also internet - based television .
Such a service , known as Internet Protocol Television or IPTV , would require much more capacity than the proposed 60 GB limit and would compete directly with Bell 's own ExpressVu satellite television offering .
" It seems like a way to limit our growth so this wo n't happen , " he said .
" No ISP at this point can offer IPTV — you 're looking at hundreds of gigs , not 60 . "
Bell officials could not be reached for comment .
The company has taken several steps toward eliminating the smaller ISPs ' ability to compete over the past few months , the firms say .
Bell began slowing the speeds of its own Sympatico subscribers using peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent last November , then extended the practice to its wholesale customers in March , prompting a dispute that is before the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
The smaller companies , through the Canadian Association of Internet Providers , say Bell is breaking telecommunications law through its speed " throttling " and have asked the CRTC to force an end to the practice .
CAIP has also said Bell is forcing the throttling onto its members so that they are n't able to offer a competitive advantage , or faster speeds , than Sympatico .
Bell says its hand was forced in introducing the throttling and download limits because of growing internet usage and abuse of peer - to - peer networks by a small percentage of customers .
The CRTC is expected to rule on the dispute by October .
Rules of access no longer needed : Bell
Bell also has an appeal before the Federal Court of Canada to scrap CRTC - mandated access of wholesale customers such as TekSavvy , Eagle.ca and Acanac to its network .
Bell says the high - speed internet market is highly competitive and regulated rules of access are therefore no longer necessary .
Smaller ISPs were given access to the networks of phone companies in the first place because the incumbents held a natural infrastructure monopoly , which was initially built through taxpayer funds when they were government - owned .
Louro , posting on DSLreports.com , said the only good news for customers is that the download limits — if they are imposed in January , as proposed by Bell — will not affect current clients .
So long as customers do not switch ISPs , they will continue to have unlimited downloading .
He also said Acanac is exploring the possibility of allying with other small ISPs to install its own equipment in Bell 's communications offices , which would allow them to bypass Bell 's forced download limits .
" We prefer not to do this alone , " Louro wrote .
Installing equipment in Bell 's buildings is a risky proposition , Gaudreault said , until the outcome of the company 's court appeal is known .
" The question then becomes , what next ? " he said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City has agreed to pay a $ 2 million settlement to protesters arrested during a 2003 rally against the Iraq war who said their civil rights had been violated , lawyers for both sides said on Tuesday .
The 52 plaintiffs in the lawsuit were among 94 protesters arrested on April 7 , 2003 , during a demonstration at the midtown Manhattan offices of the Carlyle Group , a private equity firm with holdings in the defense sector .
“ The New York Police Department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the Iraq war and those who stood to profit from it , ” said Sarah Netburn , a lawyer for the protesters .
In a statement , a lawyer for New York City confirmed the size of the settlement .
“ This settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants , ” said Susan Halatyn , senior counsel in the Special Federal Litigation Division for New York City .
“ Although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial , the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time . ”
Two of the protesters , Eva Hageman and Sarah Kunstler , went to trial on charges of disorderly conduct and were acquitted by a jury , said a lawyer for the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , which brought the case .
Charges against the remaining protesters were dismissed without a trial , CCR said .
The settlement , which includes attorney ’s fees , will be divided evenly among the plaintiffs , lawyers said .

On Monday , July 28 , “ Sheriff Joe ” made the editorial page of the Washington Post .
And this bit of national coverage did n't involve some brainless TV reporter taking Arpaio ’s word or remarking about how neato that pink underwear is .
No , D.C. ’s paper of record called it like it is .
“ Sheriff Joe likes to refer to his blatantly unconstitutional campaign of harassment as ‘ crime suppression sweeps , ’ ” the editorial reads .
“ By equating race with immigration status , the sheriff 's office has made moving around Maricopa County risky and at times terrifying for many Latinos , immigrant and native alike . ”
The Post editorial succinctly unpacked the pattern of Maricopa deputies ’ racial profiling — and the price it costs documented citizens who get arrested and harassed in the process .
The Post 's editorial board was able to identify and nail this issue from 2,300 miles away .
What a shame more local reporters and editors ca n’t see it as clearly from so close .
Of course , the Post is n’t the first national paper to notice how backwards Maricopa County has become .
The New York Times wrote a similar piece back in April .
That editorial called for legislators to issue subpoenas for Arpaio and hold a congressional hearing about his tactics .
Meanwhile , local TV coverage of Arpaio is rife with hunky - dory stories about doggies and good deeds , punctuated with five - second soundbites and rarely questioning the sheriff ’s self - serving “ internal investigations . ”
( Joe Dana ’s coverage of Arpaio burning county dollars in Honduras is one of the notable exceptions . )
With both the Washington Post and New York Times trained on the Joker , er , Arpaio , Gotham City , er , Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon is now in Washington , D.C. , encouraging more national media outlets to notice the constitutional abuses funded by our local tax dollars .
As the wagons of national media circle , the question changes from " Do Maricopa County residents know that the constitutional rights of one minority group are being blatantly violated ? "
Now the questions seem to be : " Do Maricopa County residents even care that the constitutional rights of a minority group are being blatantly violated ? "
This story originally appeared in the Dec. 31 , 1973 , issue of U.S. News & World Report .
Commander McCain spent 5 ½ years as a war prisoner .
Because he was the son of a top U. S. admiral , his captors made every effort to wring propaganda from him .
His first - person story appeared in this magazine 's May 14 , 1973 , issue .
Now , nine months after his return , he reports on what being home has been like .
Commander McCain , what has life been like for you in the nine months since your release from prison camp in Hanoi ?
Was there , for example , a big letdown after the initial joy of being free ?
There certainly has been no letdown .
The reception that we , as prisoners of war , received was overwhelming and somewhat embarrassing , because we felt that we were just average American pilots who had been shot down .
We never anticipated such a feeling of warmth .
It still shows no signs of letting up .
The only thing that has been somewhat of an adjustment is the difference in the pace of living now , as compared to in prison .
There , the big event of the day usually was when it came your turn to go out of your cell to bathe .
I still seem not to have enough time to do all the things that I want to do — or have to do .
Readjustment has its amusing aspects , too .
The other day I was talking with some friends about a movie star I remembered and somebody said , " Why , she 's dead now . "
I said , " What ?
She can't be ! "
And my wife , Carol , said : " You have to excuse John .
He 's only caught up to 1969 so far . "
It 's become a big family joke .
Do the memories of those long years haunt you in any way ?
Do you , for example , have nightmares ?
No , I sleep very well .
But sometimes , a little thing can bring back those days in a flash .
For instance , one of the most unpleasant aspects of living in a cell is to hear the keys rattle in the door at an unusual time of day — or night — when you know it is n't routine .
That usually meant you were going for interrogation , and that could often turn into a long period of no sleep , no food , or severe torture .
A couple of times recently , I 've heard keys rattle at a door , and for a very brief instant I 've tensed up just as I did over there .
But that 's very rare .
Have there been surprises — things you did n't expect or anticipate — since you have returned and picked up a normal life here in America ?
In prison , I think , you become very idealistic .
You get a feeling that in your country everything is perfection .
Now that I 'm back it disturbs me to find people so critical of our country and our way of life and our Government .
I think that many Americans have a tendency to neglect the really fine things and the benefits that we have here and concentrate on the faults .
What are some of these benefits , as you see them ?
One , of course , is the basic standard of living .
Another is our freedom to speak out , to move around at will .
I do n't think in any other country , except perhaps in England , do they approach the basic freedoms that the individual has in this country .
Another surprise is the emphasis that is being made on ecology — and it 's fine .
The greatest change , and , to me , the most heart - warming improvement has been in the area of equal opportunity .
When I left the U.S. seven years ago , we were having riots and demonstrations in the streets .
Cities were being destroyed .
Now I find none of that , and I have not seen any really overt racial discrimination .
How do you account for the fact that most of the POWs have made such a good readjustment ?
I think there are a number of reasons for this .
The major one is that the last two years that we were there the treatment was relatively mild .
If we had come out , say , in late 1969 , the problems of readjustment would have been far more severe .
Starting in 1971 , the food improved considerably .
We were allowed to be together more and set up educational programs , and work out some simple entertainment and do a lot of things for each other , to keep our minds active .
Would you have liked to see the POWs charged with collaborating brought to trial ?
The decision was made by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army not to bring these men to trial who were charged by the senior officers among the POWs .
All of us who had knowledge of their behavior were given a hearing .
Although I was in favor of their going to trial , I certainly understand and support the official decision .
But I do think that it is very important for us to consider that we have a code of conduct for American prisoners of war that must be upheld for others to follow in future wars .
We were not interested in trying to get two individual officers but to have a trial that would either clear them or convict them .
There has been some misconception as to why these men were charged by our senior officers .
It was not because they were against the war in Vietnam .
The charges , specifically , were that they had caused great difficulty , and sometimes injury , to individual POWs and to our military organization in the camp .
When you left to fight in Vietnam in early 1967 , did you have the feeling most Americans supported the war ?
Yes , I did .
Were you shocked when you returned and found out that the war had become so divisive ?
I was surprised at the degree of the divisiveness .
Of course , the North Vietnamese told us every antiwar statement that was made by any well - known American .
But we had a great tendency to disbelieve anything that the North Vietnamese had to say .
And so I would say I was surprised to find out how the attitude of so many Americans had changed drastically .
I do n't think that the goals which we had when we entered that war changed .
It was the long duration and the methods by which the war was prosecuted that changed people 's minds .
Since you 've been back , has this Watergate business changed your opinion of the President ?
No , it has n't changed my opinion .
It has certainly made me sad that this situation should have arisen .
However , I feel that in the context of history that Watergate will be a very minor item as compared with the other achievements of this Administration , particularly in the area of foreign affairs .
I do hope that this country will get over Watergate and get going again on the very serious problems that we 're facing today .
To return to the personal problems of readjustment , do you have an explanation for why so many POWs have separated from their wives ?
I think you start with the fact that the overall divorce rate in this country is high .
Divorce is no longer considered so unusual when a marriage is under strain .
Next , you should realize that many of these men had been married only a short time before they left for Vietnam .
But the most basic factor in the rather large number of separations and divorces among the POW families was the long separation and the difficulty of communication between husband and wife .
Many of the wives did not know how our views about the Vietnam war and our hatred of Communism had crystallized in prison camp .
And back home great forces were being brought to bear on these women by the antiwar groups that promised to get letters and packages through to their husbands — to bring them home — if only the wives would endorse the antiwar propaganda .
So , in cases that I know of personally , while a man was being tortured for refusing to make a propaganda statement , his wife had gone along with the antiwar movement back home , because she thought it was in her husband 's best interests .
But this created a wound that in many cases could not be healed .
Let me emphasize that there were many , many fine women who supported what they knew their husbands believed in .
My wife , Carol , was one of those , and I 'm very proud of her .
Commander , you mentioned the warm reception you got on your return .
Are letters still coming to you ?
WASHINGTON 
Two days ago , during an off - the - record session with a group of foreign policy experts , Vice President Dick Cheney got a question he did not want to answer .
“ Mr. Vice President , ” asked one of them , “ I understand that on Wednesday or Thursday , we are going to de-list North Korea from the terrorism blacklist .
Could you please set the context for this decision ? ”
Mr. Cheney froze , according to four participants at the Old Executive Office Building meeting .
For more than 30 minutes he had been taking and answering questions , without missing a beat .
But now , for several long seconds , he stared , unsmilingly , at his questioner , Steven Clemons of the New America Foundation , a public policy institution .
Finally , he spoke :
“ I ’m not going to be the one to announce this decision , ” the other participants recalled Mr. Cheney saying , pointing at himself .
“ You need to address your interest in this to the State Department . ”
He then declared that he was done taking questions , and left the room .
In the internal Bush administration war between the State Department and Mr. Cheney ’s office over North Korea , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her top North Korea envoy , Christopher R. Hill , won a major battle against the Cheney camp when President Bush announced Thursday that he was taking the country he once described as part of the “ axis of evil ” off the State Department ’s list of state sponsors of terrorism .
The administration sought to portray the move as a largely symbolic , reciprocal move , made in return for North Korea ’s long - delayed declaration of its nuclear program to the outside world .
It is the first step in what will be a long , drawn - out diplomatic process that is meant to lead eventually to establishing a nuclear - free Korean Peninsula .
Should we be reconsidering the conventional wisdom on saturated fat ?
Yes , according to Gary Taubes ’s interpretation of the new report in The New England Journal of Medicine on a two - year diet experiment in Israel .
The Israeli researchers found that people on a relatively low - fat diet lost less weight ( 6 pounds ) than those who ate a low - carbohydrate or Mediterranean diet ( 10 pounds ) .
These relatively modest weight losses were interpreted as discouraging news for dieters , and they also set off a debate on whether the whether the low - carb diet was really an Atkins - style diet , as my colleague Tara Parker - Pope reported .
Mr. Taubes prefers to focus on another aspect of the study : perhaps the best news yet about saturated fat .
As I wrote last year , in a column about Mr. Taubes and his book “ Good Calories , Bad Calories , ” the medical establishment originally warned people to avoid all kinds of fat , but subsequent studies kept failing to produce evidence of the benefits of a low - fat diet .
Then the supposed experts said the villain was n’t just any fat but specifically saturated fat .
But now their recommendations are being undermined yet again by research , Mr. Taubes says .
Here ’s his take on the new experiment and a series of similar trials :
These trials are fundamentally tests of the hypothesis that saturated fat is bad for cholesterol and bad for the heart .
They ’re not just about which diet works best for weight loss or is healthiest , but what constitutes a healthy diet , period .
( This is the point I made in my Times Magazine story six years ago ) .
Specifically , these low - fat / low - carb diet trials , of which there are now more than half a dozen , test American Heart Association ( A.H.A. ) relatively low - fat diets against Atkins - like high - saturated - fat diets .
In this last test , the A.H.A. diet was about 30 percent calories from fat , less than 10 percent calories from saturated fat ; the low - carb diet was almost 40 percent calories from fat , around 12.5 percent saturated fat .
In this particular trial , as in all of them so far , the high - saturated - fat diet ( low - carb or Atkins - like ) resulted in the best improvement in cholesterol profile — total cholesterol / H.D.L .
In this Israeli trial , the high - saturated - fat diet reduced L.D.L. at least as well as the did the A.H.A. relatively low - fat diet , the fundamental purpose of which is to lower L.D.L. by reducing the saturated fat content .
So here ’s the simple question and the point : how can saturated fat be bad for us if a high saturated fat diet lowers L.D.L. at least as well as a diet that has 20 to 25 percent less saturated fat ?
It could be argued ( and probably will be ) that the effect of the saturated fat is confounded by the reduction in calories , but the A.H.A. diet also reduces calories and in fact specifies caloric reduction while the low - carb diet does not .
It will also be argued , as Dean Ornish does , that the source of the saturated fat was not necessarily meat or bacon , but beans or other healthy sources .
But the nutritional reason why meat has been vilified over the years , is that it ’s a source of unhealthy saturated fat .
It ’s not that meat per se is bad — unless you buy the colon cancer evidence , which has always seemed dubious — it ’s that the saturated fat in meat makes it bad .
So the argument about the source of the saturated fat is irrelevant .
The question hinges on whether saturated fat raises cholesterol and causes heart disease .
One way or the other this trial is a test of that hypothesis .
It ’s arguably the best such trial ever done and the most rigorous .
To me that ’s always been the story .
If saturated fat is bad for us , then these trials should demonstrate it .
They imply the opposite .
Why does the A.H.A. continue to insist that saturated fat should be avoided , if these trials repeatedly show that high saturated fat diets lead to better cholesterol profiles than low - saturated fat diets ?
And how many of these trials have to be done before the National Institutes of Health or some other august institution in this business re-assesses this question ?
After all , the reason the food guide pyramid suggests we eat things like butter and lard and meats sparingly ( and puts them high up in the pyramid ) is that they contain saturated fat .
This is also the reason that the A.H.A. wants to lower even further what ’s considered the safe limit for saturated fats in the diet .
Is Mr. Taubes right ?
If eating more saturated fat improved the dieters ’ cholesterol profile ( while also enabling them to lose weight even though their calories were not restricted ) , should the federal government and the American Heart Association stop warning people about saturated fats ?

Creative Code : 14 Ways to Learn From Creative Programmers
The common stereotype for programmers is this : nerdy , pocket - protector wielding , and very , very boring .
One does n’t typically link a programmer as a creative individual .
However , this could n’t be farther from the truth .
Working with code is one of the most creative jobs one can have .
Programmers have to balance two very different worlds : a world of structure and a world of imagination .
They create abstract concepts using very structured programming languages ( like PHP or Java ) .
It ’s not an easy task .
I only know this because I ’ve recently been brushing up on a bit of my PHP skills building some interesting Web sites ( I ’ll keep you all posted , do n’t worry ) .
I ’ve found that programming is actually a great exercise in creativity .
Here are a couple reasons why :
Programming gives ultimate control .
Creating something from nothing is possibly the best example of creativity .
The ultimate control over software or web site that a programmer has is perfect for taking the application to any direction that they wish .
Many ways to do one thing .
Programmers have to essentially build a framework for the web site .
They ’re laying the foundation for something that , up until that point , is just an idea .
The programmer uses a wide palate of tools and methods to find
Programmers have to find creative solutions or else they ca n’t create .
Programmers are a great example of thinking outside the box because , well … programmers can actually create the box .
Here are some of the ways that we can learn from programmers on how to boost our creativity .
1. Learn a new language
Programmers are constantly learning new languages , either for fun or necessity .
Do n’t limit yourself to what just what you know and are comfortable with .
Branch out and learn a new skill .
2. Start from the ground up
If you ’re going to write software , you ca n’t just start halfway through the project .
You have to start at square one .
Sometimes this is the best way to find a creative solution for a problem is to go back to the beginning and work forward .
3. Question everything
Questioning everything means taking every assumption and making sure it ’s correct .
All programming starts with making the most basic assumptions , and then building on those basic assumptions .
If something is wrong with the code at the base , then the software is n’t going to work well at all .
Sometimes creativity is limited by assumptions .
New solutions arrive when we tear down assumptions and start with fresh perspectives .
4 . Do it for fun
If you know any programmers , they ’re constantly building something .
Even when they ’re done for the day on work - related projects , they ’ll spend hours of time working on fun projects for themselves .
Their work is also their hobby .
Continually mulling over new ideas and solutions is something that should n’t be a chore .
It should be something that you find yourself doing constantly , like a reflex .
And it should excite you .
5 . Never stop testing ideas
Programmers are constantly benchmarking code to make sure that it ’s as efficient as possible .
Even the smallest change can bring a program or Web site to it ’s knees , so constant testing and improvement is important to any bit of software .
Ideas should be tested rigorously and refined on a consistent basis .
Your ideas will change over time , it just depends how much .
Constantly evaluating them and just plain thinking them through is a great way to “ benchmark ” your idea .
6 . Find a passion
Photo by Marco WesselIf you ’ve ever spent more than two minutes talking with a programmer about his work , you ’ll find out very quickly that programmers have a passion for what they do .
They eat , sleep and breathe programming .
Do you have a passion for your ideas and projects ?
7 . Master your tools
Programmers constantly improve their knowledge and usage of their tools .
A great coder keeps tabs on software and is constantly finding ways to improve his usage of them .
You ’ll seldom find a programmer who does n’t tweak his toolbox regularly .
No matter what your skill set , you ’re limited to your skill with the tools you use to create .
The more of an expert you are with your tools , the more you ’ll be able to create .
8. Start making abstract associations
The people behind projects like Skype , Google Docs and Twitter all have one thing in common :
They fused seemingly abstract concepts together .
Taking what - ifs and testing them is a great way to start thinking of things in a different , more creative light .
9 . Think of structure as a tool , not a limitation
People associate creativity with taking a giant , blank canvas and letting our ideas flow without any sort of limiting structures .
However , there ’s a huge problem with this type of thinking :
It ’s a great big creativity myth .
See , limitations are everywhere .
We ca n’t avoid them , we can only hope to work with them .
A programmer embraces the limitations of his programming language or tools and works around them .
These limitations help him as they make a foundation to work from .
Sometimes discovering a new workaround will lead to an even bigger idea .
Necessity is the mother of invention .
10 .
Do n’t rule anything out until you try it .
Your kindergarten teacher was right :
There is no such thing as a stupid question .
If you ’re adhering to # 3 and dismissing all assumptions , you ca n’t be certain it ’s not going to work until you ’ve tested it .
How do you know it wo n’t work unless you try it ?
You might be surprised .
Even if the proposed solution does n’t work , it may help you find a solution .
Sometimes it ’s just best to start with a prototype and try it out .
If your prototype does n’t work , then trash it .
If it does , you ’ll have stumbled upon something that just might work .
11 . Always look for a simpler and more elegant solution .
A good programmer is one that understands that finding the simplest solution is always going to be better .
Complicated solutions lead to… complications .
A practical approach to programming always works best in the long run .
Our ideas sometimes become too complicated .
We get caught up in the novelty of the idea that we ignore how practical it really is .
The simplest way to solve a problem is often the best way to solve a problem .
12 . Do n’t be afraid to build off the code of others .
The beauty of the Internet is that the solution your looking for has probably already been done by someone else .
When building a new site I almost always use pre-existing open source code .
Why recreate the wheel ?
Putting a great idea into motion does n’t mean you have to start from scratch to create it .
Use existing ideas and turn them in to something better .
Sometimes a great idea is only modifying something that ’s already been done .
Gmail is a great example .
They “ reinvented ” email by adding useful features to traditional email .
13 . Do n’t be afraid to collaborate .
Some of the best coding — or any creative projects for that matter — are done not just by one coder but by many excellent people inspired to work toward the same goal .
Assemble a great team , use the most brilliant ideas no matter who they come from , and let everyone contribute .
14 . From the very basic , create the beautiful .
Programmers often use some very basic code over and over , and while those small bits of programming language are n’t necessarily beautiful in and of themselves , they can come together to create a final product that is amazing .
No matter what creative project you ’re working on , pay attention to the details , but most especially pay attention to the effect those details have on the overall picture .

Thanks Leo !
The next time there is a Republican president and Congress -- and there will be a next time -- they 'll have it a whole lot easier .
For one , they 'll have a complete road map .
Richard Nixon started drawing the map back in the 1970s .
His mistakes were the grand ones that set off the Watergate scandal : wiretapping , use of government means to achieve political ends , and the failure to complete a perfect cover - up .
There were tapes , there were turncoats , and there was the money .
But it allowed the GOP to see where they went wrong and , more importantly , how not to go wrong again .
Ronald Reagan helped complete the next portion of the road map with the actions of a number of his subordinates .
John Poindexter showed , during Iran - Contra , how to " protect the old man " by falling on his sword .
Elliott Abrams and Oliver North demonstrated that it was possible to cut out and ignore the legislative branch in pursuit of the ends sought by the executive .
Anne Gorsuch Burford at Reagan 's Environmental Protection Agency proved that in the end there is no price to be paid for holding Congress in contempt , as the courts would duck out on the question as to whether or not there should be criminal prosecution of such an act .
George H.W. Bush sealed the deal when he pardoned nearly everyone involved in Iran - Contra after ducking any and all questions about it for more than four years , claiming he was " out of the loop . "
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger walked on several counts of perjury .
Then - Deputy National Security Adviser Abrams got off scot - free from unlawfully withholding information , only to go on and hold yet another position in the administration of George W. Bush .
Duane Claridge and Alan Fiers of the CIA never saw a day in prison after Claridge was pardoned by Bush I before his trial was over , and Fiers got probation and community service , only to be pardoned less than a year after his conviction .
Both men were charged with either lying to or concealing information from Congress .
CIA third in command Clair George walked as Bush Sr. pardoned him two months before his sentencing .
His crime ?
Once again : lying to Congress .
Of course , the person who took much of the fall for Iran - Contra , National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane , was pardoned after pleading guilty to four counts of lying to Congress .
Together , by showing what not to do , the band of Iran - Contra executive branch refugees showed Bush Jr. 's administration how to get away with a world of malfeasance under the noses of the nation .
From the exposure of the PROF internal electronic mails during Iran - Contra , the Bushies learned not to let any electronic communications be saved .
Thus political operators like Karl Rove learned to use external communications such as Blackberries issued by the Republican National Committee to avoid leaving any kind of an electronic trail .
The secure Lotus Notes e-mail system the Clinton administration left behind was scrapped and the kludgy Microsoft system was put in , with a lack of secure backups to assure the proper safekeeping of records .
With no records , there were no " smoking gun " tapes like in the Nixon years , and no PROF records like the ones that tripped up the " off the books " operation under Reagan .
All that the Bush operators needed to do was assure that anyone who got caught would never see a day in federal court .
After I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby landed in court over the exposure of the covert identity of CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame ( which came out of human error : the need to issue payback to Plame 's husband , Joseph Wilson ) , the Bush administration learned more than anything that the top priority was to install an obedient lackey as head of the Department of Justice .
When it appeared that John Ashcroft was n't going to be that lackey ( Former U.S Attorney David Iglesias told the Dallas Morning News that Ashcroft " was asked to move on " after refusing to sign off on the unconstitutional warrantless wiretapping program ) , Alberto Gonzales became the frontman whose job was to agree to any and every plan the White House cooked up .
When it became apparent to all that Gonzales was a paper tiger for Vice President Dick Cheney and his lead henchman , David Addington , the Bushies found Michael Mukasey , who would be far more adept at appearing to appease Congress while still telling them nothing .
Mukasey could also be counted on to bring any and all subpoenas and investigations to a halt , assuring the administration that no one would see the inside of a courtroom for the rest of Bush 's presidency .
The map is drawn and waiting .
The next time a Republican sits in the chair behind the desk in the Oval Office , there might as well be a binder in the desk drawer titled " How to Do Anything You Want as President . "
The authors will be listed as every participant in the Iraq war run-up , Iran -Contra , and one or two left over from Watergate .
The foreword will be written by Cheney .
And the dedication will be " To Richard Milhous Nixon , without whom none of this would be possible . "

McCain 2004 : ' It 's Obvious We Would Have To Leave '
Jon Ponder Byon 7/22/2008 , 2:39 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
Does anything that George W. Bush and John McCain say matter ?
Based on this colloquy between Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow on " Countdown " last night , apparently not :
OLBERMANN : ... The Iraqi government is saying , “ Get out , ” and President Bush swore , you know , “ Some day if they say ‘ get out , ‘ we‘ll get out . ”
MADDOW : That ‘s right .
May 2007 in the Rose Garden , Bush said — and I went back and checked the quote directly so I could be sure to directly quote him —
“ If they were to say leave , we would leave . ”
Also , for what it ‘s worth , in April of 2004 , John McCain at the Council on Foreign Relations said , “ It is obvious we would have to leave if they asked to us leave . ”
I mean , they told us that the point of invading Iraq was to topple Saddam Hussein .
Saddam Hussein was toppled ; they told us that the point of staying there after , was to set up a sovereign Iraqi government .
Well now , the sovereign Iraqi government is standing up on its hind legs enough to tell us to leave , and we ‘re left with this situation where they need another explanation of why we can‘t leave .
That ‘s the real headline here .
Here 's the question Bush was asked in May 2007 , as well as a bit of preamble to the money quote :
BUSH : Martha .
Martha .
Q [ Probably Martha Raddatz of ABC News ]
Thank you , Mr. President .
You say you want nothing short of victory , that leaving Iraq would be catastrophic ; you once again mentioned al Qaeda .
Does that mean that you are willing to leave American troops there , no matter what the Iraqi government does ?
I know this is a question we 've asked before , but you can begin it with a " yes " or " no . "
BUSH : We are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government .
This is a sovereign nation .
Twelve million people went to the polls to approve a constitution .
It 's their government 's choice .
If they were to say , leave , we would leave .
McCain spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) on April 22 , 2004 .
After his remarks , he took a few questions from Peter G. Peterson , chairman of the Blackstone Group and chairman of CFR , including this one :
PETERSON : Let me give you a hypothetical , senator .
What would or should we do if , in the post - June 30th period , a so - called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave , even if we are unhappy about the security situation there ?
I understand it 's a hypothetical , but it 's at least possible .
Let me give you a hypothetical , senator .
What would or should we do if , in the post - June 30th period , a so - called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave , even if we are unhappy about the security situation there ?
I understand it 's a hypothetical , but it 's at least possible .
McCAIN : Well , if that scenario evolves , then I think it 's obvious that we would have to leave because — if it was an elected government of Iraq — and we 've been asked to leave other places in the world .
If it were an extremist government , then I think we would have other challenges , but I do n't see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the Iraqi government over to the Iraqi people .
This is just more evidence --- as if any were needed --- that Bush 's invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with WMD , freedom for Iraqis or the rest of the bull .
It was then , and is now , about controlling the oil .
The bombers ' lawyer , Fahmi Bachmid , said afterwards : " All of them have repeatedly said they will only ask pardon from God , not the president .
This is their faith . "
FALSE beliefs are everywhere .
Eighteen percent of Americans think the sun revolves around the earth , one poll has found .
Thus it seems slightly less egregious that , according to another poll , 10 percent of us think that Senator Barack Obama , a Christian , is instead a Muslim .
The Obama campaign has created a Web site to dispel misinformation .
But this effort may be more difficult than it seems , thanks to the quirky way in which our brains store memories  and mislead us along the way .
The brain does not simply gather and stockpile information as a computer ’s hard drive does .
Facts are stored first in the hippocampus , a structure deep in the brain about the size and shape of a fat man ’s curled pinkie finger .
But the information does not rest there .
Every time we recall it , our brain writes it down again , and during this re-storage , it is also reprocessed .
In time , the fact is gradually transferred to the cerebral cortex and is separated from the context in which it was originally learned .
For example , you know that the capital of California is Sacramento , but you probably do n’t remember how you learned it .
This phenomenon , known as source amnesia , can also lead people to forget whether a statement is true .
Even when a lie is presented with a disclaimer , people often later remember it as true .
With time , this misremembering only gets worse .
A false statement from a noncredible source that is at first not believed can gain credibility during the months it takes to reprocess memories from short - term hippocampal storage to longer - term cortical storage .
As the source is forgotten , the message and its implications gain strength .
This could explain why , during the 2004 presidential campaign , it took some weeks for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against Senator John Kerry to have an effect on his standing in the polls .
Rising oil prices lift all alt - energy boats .

For proof , look no further than the fat $ 130 million investment scooped up by eSolar , a company whose basic solar power strategy — using sunlight - reflecting mirrors to generate steam — was all but abandoned in the 1980s , and has recently recently caught investors ' attention again .
The money , from Google 's philanthropic arm , Google.org , and venture capital firms Idealab and Oak Investment Partners , will go towards the construction of eSolar 's first functioning solar power plant .
" ESolar 's long term is to become a viable replacement for all fossil fuel , " said Robert Rogan , a Cal Tech Ph.D. and eSolar 's executive vice president for corporate development .
" The reason Google invested in us is that they saw the potential of this technology to beat the cost of using coal . "
The company 's core technology is an implementation of concentrating solar power , which uses mirrors to turn liquid into steam that drives standard electricity - generating turbines .
CSP , also sometimes called solar thermal , is considered a promising replacement for fossil fuel power plants , particularly the coal plants that generate more than half of U.S. electricity .
It 's been around for decades , last seeing popularity in the early 1980s , when oil hit an inflation - adjusted price of $ 82 per barrel .
Higher oil prices make fossil fuel plants more costly , making it easier for alternative technologies to compete .
( Oil is currently trading for more than $ 115 a barrel , its highest level ever . )
Google 's green - energy plan goes by the formula - like name RE<C , which sets out the goal of the company 's operation — to find renewable energy sources that reliably generate electricity more cheaply than burning coal .
In modern times , that 's been impossible , with fossil fuel plants able to generate power for a few cents a kilowatt - hour while solar energy from photovoltaics has cost upwards of $ 0.25 per kwh .
But times are changing as coal and natural gas plants have gotten more expensive to build .
That 's happening for a variety of reasons :
Banks are including the risks of climate change legislation in their pricing for power plant loans , the raw construction materials used in power plants have become more expensive , and natural gas and coal prices have gone up alongside the skyrocketing price of oil .
Within this changing marketplace , wind power has been growing phenomenally fast , but is too intermittent to power the whole grid .
As a result , many clean - energy advocates are turning to solar thermal power plants as the solution du jour .
" There 's hope and optimism but a little bit of skepticism as well , " said Ryan Wiser , a renewable energy analyst at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
" No one knows whether the technologies are really cost competitive with other energy alternatives . "
That has n't stopped Abu Dhabi 's clean - tech fund , Masdar , from funding a $ 1.2 billion solar thermal company called Torresol .
Another competitor in the market , Ausra , has received more than $ 40 million from blue - chip venture capitalists .
Yet another player , Abengoa , recently signed a $ 4 billion deal with Arizona Public Utilities , and Brightsource recently landed a 900 - megawatt deal with the California utility PG&E .
Stirling Energy Systems , a company that has adapted the Stirling Engine , a 200 - year - old invention , for concentrated solar power , even pulled in a $ 100 million investment .
As Food Prices Spiral , Farmers , Others Profit
WILLMAR , Minn . ( AP )
— The steepest run-ups in food prices since 1990 are hurting grocery shoppers , restaurants and school cafeterias but they 're making others rich .
The winners in the new food economy include crop farmers selling corn and wheat for near - record highs after years of crushingly low prices .
Ingredient makers like Cargill and ADM are rife with profits .
Fertilizer and tractor companies are cashing in .
Profits at seed and pesticide maker Monsanto Inc. reached nearly $ 1 billion last year — a 14 - fold increase since 2003 .
They 've tripled to $ 1.1 billion at agrichemical maker Syngenta and agriculture divisions of DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. have also seen their earnings balloon .
Cargill , which makes ingredients , boosted its profits to $ 2.3 billion , up nearly six - fold since 2001 .
Meanwhile , profits at agricultural processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. have more than quadrupled to $ 2.16 billion during the same period .
To some it may come as too little too late .
But setting out on his final trip to Europe as president , George Bush has expressed regret that his rhetoric in the run-up to the war in Iraq may have created the impression that he was a warmonger .
" I think that in retrospect I could have used a different tone , a different rhetoric , " Bush told the Times as he flew across the Atlantic on Air Force One .
The phrases he used to win support for the war such as " bring 'em on " and " dead or alive " he said , " indicated to people that I was , you know , not a man of peace . "
But that impression , he insisted , was far from the truth .
" One of the untold stories of Iraq is that we explored the diplomacy a lot , " he said .
" We all wanted to solve this ' disclose , disarm , or face serious consequences ' in a diplomatic fashion .
After all , I went to the United Nations security council . "
Bush , who met the German chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday on a tour that will take in Rome , Paris and London , also disputed the notion that the war had harmed the image of the US abroad .
" I do n't buy into that theory , " he said .
" America is a force for good .
America is a force for liberty .
America is a force to fight disease .
We 've got the largest HIV / Aids initiative in the history of the world .
We 've got a malaria initiative that 's saving babies . "
Wearing an Air Force
One flying jacket embroidered with George W Bush over his left breast , and with a china mug bearing the acronym Potus - President of the United States - at his side , Bush told his interviewers of the pain he feels at the casualties sustained by US forces in Iraq .
Noting that he finds it difficult " to put youngsters in harm 's way " , he added : " I try to meet with as many of the families as I can .
And I have an obligation to comfort and console as best as I possibly can .
I also have an obligation to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain . "
Bush 's statements come as his presidency enters its final six months .
They also come as the two presidential candidates spar over the differences between them , notably their stances in the build - up to the war .
While avoiding direct comment on the presidential race , Bush 's remarks will be interpreted as a thinly veiled criticism of the Democratic nominee Barack Obama .
Bush suggested that Obama 's stated intent to sit down directly with the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , could undermine what he termed the " multilateralist " diplomacy he has been nurturing .
" I believe when people get in and take an assessment of what will work or what wo n't work in dealing with Iran , they 'll understand the wisdom of having not only our friends and allies in Europe at the table but also China and Russia , " he said .
Far from being a lame duck , Bush said he was full of vigour .
" There 's plenty of energy on the democracy agenda , the freedom agenda , right now , " he said .
While welcoming the nomination of an African - American candidate , describing it as " a statement about how far America has come " , he argued that voters would be swayed by attributes such as experience .
" It 's going to be important for the American people to figure out who can handle the task of the 21st century , " he said .
" It 's a challenging job .
It requires tough decision making , clear thought , and an experience level . "
He did not pass up the opportunity to claim that he had campaigned on Obama 's change agenda well before the Democratic nominee .
" I 've campaigned for change ever since I ran for office , " he noted , " except for 2004 .
Then I was n't for change . "
The defense will also file a separate motion requesting a special jury instruction to the effect that a juror has the legal right to refuse to convict an individual , even if he or she admits to the elements of a crime , if the juror believes the application of the law to that particular defendant would create an injustice .

We 'll be spending one afternoon at Hunter Thompson 's Owl Farm in Woody Creek again .
If you 're a criminal defense lawyer or if you 're a medical pot user and want to hang with sympaticos , you 're welcome to attend .
Here 's my video from our 2006 Owl Farm party and me interviewing Tommy Chong at Owl Farm in 2007 .
My topic this year : Crackadoodledoo !
A New Dawn in Crack Cocaine Sentencing .
Here 's the full schedule .
Not in Boston ?
How about Minnesota ?
They 're trying to get a compassionate law passed there and are running into trouble with false ads .
The e-mail I received says :
We have a bill in the legislature that 's already passed the full Senate and is pending a vote in the House any day now .
Although it has had Republican support in the legislature form the start , Minnesota 's Gov. Pawlenty has stated that he " stands with law enforcement " on the issue – meaning , presumably , in opposition to it and inclined to veto on the basis of a small but vocal group of prosecutors and law enforcement officials who have repeatedly testified against it through the committee process .
There 's only one problem : these opponents – who so adamantly defend their right to arrest and jail the sick and dying for using marijuana with their doctor 's recommendation – have made false claim after false claim , some of which have been outright lies .
They are looking for media attention -- the local press is ignoring it :
It 's staggering that elected officials like County Attorneys and law enforcement officers are permitted to just lie about legislation and , when they 're called on it , the media seems uninterested , no matter how well it 's documented .
I suppose this is in the interest of " balance " – and also why independent media and blogs like yours are so crucial .
Procera Networks will announce today a new standard in deep packet inspection ( DPI ) gear : an 80 Gbps monster called the PacketLogic PL10000 that is targeted at tier - 1 network operators .
At up to $ 800,000 a unit , these are n't cheap , but when you want to throttle , inspect , and shape traffic in real - time on a major network , this is now the fastest thing on the market ( and by a large margin ) .
Procera 's appliances all run the same software , so the difference between them is in the interfaces and the number of racks the units take up .
The PL10000 , the company 's top - of - the - line offering and provides 5 10 Gbps channels and 9 1 G bps channels in a 12 rack unit .
It can handle 80 Gbps of total speed , but most ISPs will want to keep an eye on traffic moving in both directions , bringing this down to 40 Gbps each way .
The PL10000 can handle up to 5 million subscribers and can track 48 million real - time data flows .
That 's certainly a potent piece of hardware , but larger ISPs will need more .
That 's why Procera designed the new machines with full support for synchronizing traffic flows where return traffic might be routed to a different PacketLogic machine .
The machine receiving the return traffic can make the machine monitoring the outbound traffic aware that it sees the other half of a TCP / IP conversation , for example , giving the devices more accuracy than those which might only have access to one side .
The capability also incurs overhead of only 2 - 6 percent , far better than the 25 or 50 percent sometimes seen in competing products .
The PL10000
DPI gear in general is astonishing technology , able to drill down to the packet level in real time , but the PL10000 can do this at 80 Gbps with 96 percent accuracy .
But how does it fare with P2P content , especially when it 's encrypted ?
This is one of the key issues for ISPs using DPI gear as a less - expensive alternative to increasing capacity .
I spoke James Brear , Procera 's CEO , and Jon Lindén , the VP of Product Management , about the issue .
While they did not break out specific accuracy numbers on P2P , they indicated that Procera was quite good even at sniffing out encrypted P2P traffic .
Breaking such encryption in real - time is n't currently possible , nor is it desirable from a privacy perspective , but Procera does n't need to ; most P2P protocols can be detected simply by analyzing header information , handshake peculiarities , or the way in which a particular application exchanges encryption keys .
Such telltale traces can give away various kinds of encrypted traffic , and while the information within remains secure , the entire flow can be shaped or blocked if desired by the ISP .
( Note that this alone is n't enough to filter copyrighted content , but it can put the kibosh on entire protocols that might be heavily used for copyright infringement . )
But Brear and Lindén made the case that this should n't be seen as a looming consumer nightmare , nor should it be seen as having anything to do with network neutrality .
In their view , DPI is a competitive tool for ISPs in several ways .
First , it allows ISPs to set charge for " services " like faster VoIP or gaming .
Second , it can speed up the network by shaping P2P and other high - bandwidth applications at peak times , or enforce user quotas and bandwidth limits .
Finally , DPI can be a security tool that gives ISPs a way to shut down DDoS attacks and viruses propagating through the network .
In Procera 's ideal world , your grandma in Poughkeepsie should pay less to use only e-mail and the Web than you do to access e-mail , the Web , P2P , VoIP , and online gaming .
A " big dumb pipe " approach this is not .
In fact , as Procera make clear in press materials , " Adding capacity is not the answer ! " to ISP bandwidth problems .
So long as it is consumers making the decisions about what services to purchase , though , neither Brear nor Lindén see any network neutrality issues arising from the use of such gear .
Despite the whiff of controversy that still surrounds DPI gear ( on grounds of both privacy and neutrality ) , the technology has become increasingly common at major ISPs .
Sweden 's Com Hem , the largest cable operator in Scandanavia , has just upgraded to the PL10000 .
Jens Persson , VP of R&D for the company , said that " DPI has become a critical element in our network and enables us to offer our customers the best possible service . "
US ISPs are generally less interested in speaking publicly about their use of such gear , but many appear to use it .
While tools like those from Sandvine have gained public notoriety due to Comcast 's use of DPI to interfere with P2P uploads , 80 Gbps is an entirely new level of speed .
And because the PL10000 does n't use custom ASICs to get the job done , protocol identifications can be updated in software just as fast as Procera can issue them .
P2P coders , in particular , are likely to put this updating capacity to the test , doing whatever they can to avoid detection .
Who will win the game of cat - and - mouse remains to be seen , but Procera 's execs sound confident in their ability to identify at least the top applications on a consistent basis .
What ISPs choose to do with that information is up to them .
Julian Sanchez of The American Prospect writes that the House Democrats who say the FISA bill they voted for is a " compromise " are liars , unless you define " ' compromise " as a " shameful or disreputable concession , ' which fits the deal brokered by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) to a tee . "
The award for the most bald - faced lie on the House floor Friday , however , goes to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , who insisted that the bill " does not allow warrantless surveillance of Americans . "
She is wrong .
It does .
The broader spying powers given to the executive branch by the compromise bill require intelligence agencies to " target " foreigners .
But if those foreign " targets " happen to call or e-mail Americans , those communications are fair game .
And since the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is only permitted to review the broad targeting procedures government eavesdroppers use to determine that a target is abroad , and not the substantive basis for authorizing surveillance of any target , anyone is a potential target .
The bill , in other words , allows the government to conduct " vacuum cleaner " surveillance — sweeping up international traffic willy - nilly — then filter it for anything that looks interesting .
Indeed , many believe that licensing such surveillance is precisely the point of this legislation .
If so , " warrantless surveillance of Americans " could well become routine , whether or not they are the formal " targets " of eavesdropping .
I was n’t upset when I read that Final Fantasy 13 had become a multiplatform game .
Granted it was one of the reasons I bought a PS3 over an Xbox 360 , but really it did n’t make me all that mad .
As far as I ’m concerned anger over video games is a staple for children and fanboys and I ’m neither .
If someone were to offer me an Xbox 360 tomorrow , free of charge , I ’d take it and enjoy it without feeling any of the silly guilt so many people feel for " betraying " a company .
After all , it is just a company .
Whatever drive Sony , or Microsoft or Nintendo might feel to make me happy is firmly grounded in their desire to convince me it ’s a good idea to buy their merchandise .
I ’m smart enough to know that if they were n’t in the business of making money they would n’t care about me in the slightest , so when one of the big three does something , I tend not get angry at them .
In truth , I am actually pleased at Square Enix ’s decision to make the game multiplatform .
The financial woes of SE have not been a secret .
Last year ’s profits were not up to their usual par and by making Final Fantasy XIII multiplat , profits will go up , ensuring a safe future for my favorite gaming franchise .
After all , the last thing anyone wants is for the next Final Fantasy to really be final , and while it might seem absurd to imagine the behemoth series going down , the costs of development have skyrocketed and one can only imagine how much the exceedingly long gestation of FFXIII has cost SE .
The last thing the company needs is another fiscal debacle a la The Spirits Within , and honestly it would have been much harder for SE to remake the costs of this game if they had kept it an exclusive .
I suppose something can of course be said for loyalty between companies .
Part of the reason so many people were shocked and even angered by this move is the fact that Final Fantasy has been primarily a Sony based franchise since FFVII first graced us with its spikey haired hero .
Sony and Square Enix grew so close over the years that Sony actually owns a minority portion of the company .
Something all the fanboys need to remember however is the fact that before FFVII came along there was FFVI , and V and IV and so on and so forth , all on Nintendo systems .
FFVII itself was originally supposed to be on the Nintendo 64 as well , but SE , then still Squaresoft , jumped ship when the costs and limitations of catridge based games became clear .
Sony might have brought SE into its most profitable era , but without Nintendo , Final Fantasy might have never been .
That did n’t stop them from leaving and anyone who says it should have is a fool .
If a console ca n’t give a developer what it needs to be succesful , why would anyone ever expect them to stick around ?
They have their own worries , their own lives to care about ; whether or not Sony , or Microsoft or Nintendo move more consoles is not their responsibility .
People , especially those wrapped up in the silliness of system wars diatribe , tend to forget that .
For all the Sony fans crying foul and Microsoft fans predicting the doom of the PS3 , this announcement does n’t really mean that much .
PS3 owners still get to play this , and while it is most certainly a success for Microsoft that this game is multiplatform , people would do well to remember that Grand Theft Auto IV , another exclusive turned multiplat did almost nothing to move consoles .
The only people it benefited were the game makers themselves .
And its not as if SE has completely abandoned Sony either .
FFXIII remains a PS3 exclusive in Japan , where really it matters most .
Any hopes Microsoft has of moving the Xbox 360 there are not going to be helped by the insane popularity of Final Fantasy in Japan .
The 360 will indeed remain a marginalized force there much as the PS3 is third in America .
So in the end , what this amounts to more than anything is just another sign of the changing industry .
Third party exclusives are quickly becoming a thing of the past , which for gamers is a good thing .
It means the likes of Sony , Microsoft , and Nintendo will have to work harder for your money .
A cold war can be a bad thing , but its hard to argue with companies trying to give you more bang for your buck .

Bureaucrats at the American Physical Society ( APS ) have issued a curious warning to their members about an article in one of their own publications .
Do n't read this , they say - we do n't agree with it .
But what is it about the piece that is so terrible , that like Medusa , it could make men go blind ?
It 's an article that examines the calculation central to climate models .
As the editor of the APS 's newsletter American Physics Jeffrey Marque explains , the global warming debate must be re-opened .
" There is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the IPCC conclusion that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution .
Since the correctness or fallacy of that conclusion has immense implications for public policy and for the future of the biosphere , we thought it appropriate to present a debate within the pages of P&S concerning that conclusion , " he wrote .
American Physics invited both believers and sceptics to submit articles , and has published a submission by Viscount Monckton questioning the core calculation of the greenhouse gas theory : climate sensitivity .
The believers are represented by two physicists from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo , who state that :
" Basic atmospheric models clearly predict that additional greenhouse gasses will raise the temperature of Earth .
To argue otherwise , one must prove a physical mechanism that gives a reasonable alternative cause of warming .
This has not been done .
Sunspot and temperature correlations do not prove causality . "
But within a few days , Monckton 's piece carried a health warning : in bright red ink .
The following article has not undergone any scientific peer review .
Its conclusions are in disagreement with the overwhelming opinion of the world scientific community .
The Council of the American Physical Society disagrees with this article 's conclusions .
Not so much Medusa , then , as Nanny telling the children what not to think .
" The first sentence is nothing more or less than a deliberate lie , " writes Professor John Brignell on his Numberwatch blog .
" The second is , to say the least , contentious ; while the third is an outrageous example of ultra vires interference by a committee in the proper conduct of scientific debate . "
Monckton has asked for an apology .
In a letter to the APS President Arthur Bienenstock , he writes :
" If the Council has not scientifically evaluated or formally considered my paper , may I ask with what credible scientific justification , and on whose authority , the offending text asserts primo , that the paper had not been scientifically reviewed when it had ; secundo , that its conclusions disagree with what is said ( on no evidence ) to be the " overwhelming opinion of the world scientific community " ; and , tertio , that " The Council of the American Physical Society disagrees with this article 's conclusions " ?
Which of my conclusions does the Council disagree with , and on what scientific grounds ( if any ) ? "
President Bush on Wednesday night leveled his most aggressive criticism yet of the Democratic Party and its presumptive presidential nominee , Sen. Barack Obama , by mocking his campaign mottos of “ hope ” and “ change . ”
Mr. Bush , speaking to a partisan crowd at a Republican fundraiser in the D.C. Convention Center , also criticized the Supreme Court ’s recent decision awarding certain due process rights to suspected enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Though he did not mention Mr. Obama by name , the president , who previously made only a few references to Mr. Obama ’s candidacy , took the gloves off for the first time , testing out lines likely to be used in numerous stump speeches between now and Election Day .
Saying that “ this election season is just beginning , ” Mr. Bush began by portraying Mr. Obama ’s signature phrase , “ hope , ” as a symbol of foreign policy naivete .
“ The other side talks a lot about ‘ hope , ’ ” Mr. Bush said .
“ And that sums up their Iraq policy pretty well :
They want to retreat from Iraq and hope nothing bad happens .
“ But wishful thinking is no way to fight a war and to protect the American people , ” the president said to applause .
Mr. Bush praised Sen. John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican nominee , as “ tested ” by adversity , a man of experience who “ will not flinch , ” and said he is the only candidate with those qualities “ in trying times . ”
The president also said unequivocally that the Democratic Party cannot be trusted to prevent terrorism in the U.S .
“ The war on terror is the great challenge of our time .
And on this vital issue , the Democratic Party has repeatedly shown it would take America down the wrong direction , ” Mr. Bush said .
He referred to the Democratic - controlled Congress ’ failure to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , their opposition to aggressive interrogation techniques that at one point in 2002 are known to have included “ waterboarding , ” attempts to defund the war , and their overall stance on Iraq .
Declaring that “ a democracy is taking root ” in Iraq , Mr. Bush said Democrats are ignoring progress sparked by his surge of 30,000 troops last year , and labeled them the party of retreat .
“ The Democrats declared the surge a failure before it began .
And now that the surge has turned the situation around , they still call for retreat , ” Mr. Bush said .
The Obama campaign said it had no immediate comment .
But Mr. Obama continued to campaign Wednesday night on his familiar themes , telling a fundraiser crowd at Ethel Kennedy ’s house in McLean , “ We will not just win this election .
We will inspire a generation . …
We will change the world . ”
The president also for the first time Wednesday publicly criticized the U.S. Supreme Court ’s decision on detainee rights at the U.S. Navy Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba .
Mr. Bush called the 5 - 4 decision granting enemy combatants the right to challenge their incarceration in U.S. civilian courts “ judicial activism that frustrates the American people . ”
“ A bare majority of five Supreme Court justices overturned a bipartisan law that the United States Congress passed and I signed to deliver justice to detainees at Guantanamo Bay , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ With this decision … hardened foreign terrorists now enjoy certain legal rights previously reserved for American citizens . ”
Mr. Bush said the decision was “ a fresh reminder of the importance of the courts ” and said only Mr. McCain can be trusted to “ put good judges on the bench . ”

Unlike Starbucks , which got into the music business to sell CDs at its stores , these companies want to use music to promote products they already sell .
“ It ’s not about money , ” said Sarah Tinsley , a global marketing manager at Bacardi .
“ It ’s a branding exercise . ”
Unlike the exclusive album deals that Wal - Mart is striking with groups like the Eagles , these companies are attracting artists at the height of their relevance .
Two weeks ago , Converse released a single by a combination of artists that The Times of London called “ a three - headed Frankenstein ’s monster of coolness ” : the Strokes singer Julian Casablancas , the producer Pharrell Williams and the R&B performer Santogold .
Offered as a free download on Converse ’s Web site , the song received mostly favorable reviews from both blogs and newspapers .
“ Our instructions to them were to have fun , as though they were doing any song , ” said Jon Cohen , co-founder of Cornerstone , a music marketing company that has set up music deals for Converse , Nike , Caress and Smirnoff .
“ It does n’t matter where the music comes from as long as it ’s great . ”
A decade ago , signing a record contract with a body spray company would have been unthinkable for most artists .
But at a time when labels ’ promotion budgets are declining , consumer brands can offer valuable exposure in print and television ads .
Jeff Straughn , Island Def Jam ’s vice president for strategic marketing , said that Tag might spend seven times as much promoting a release as a traditional label .
“ When I started in this business 10 years ago , it was hard to get an artist to stand in front of a sign with a logo on it , ” said David Caruso , the co-founder of Acme , the agency that negotiated the deal between Island Def Jam and Tag .
“ Now brands are engaging their audiences with content . ”

For USD 2,995 , consumers can own a Maine lobster trap and all the lobsters it catches for an entire year through the Premium Trap program from Catch a Piece of Maine .
As " partners , " as the company calls them , customers of the program are assigned a dedicated lobsterman who will fish their trap throughout the 32 - week season .
Everything he catches is tracked with a colour - coded band placed on the lobsters ' claws , and all data is recorded online so that the partner can view their trap 's activity , manage their catch and schedule shipments from anywhere .
As lobsters are caught by the trap , the partner 's account grows ; as lobsters are requested for shipment , it decreases again .
Lobsters can be shipped in batches of four as soon as they are caught , or they can be saved for later ( in which case the company will substitute one just caught for the original ) ; either way , details are included on when , where and by whom they were obtained .
Catch a Piece of Maine guarantees at least 48 1.5 lb lobsters for each partner — totalling over 70 bs .— and also 12 lbs. steamer clams , 12 lbs. mussels , and 48 servings of Maine - made desserts over the course of the year .
All shipments are sent via FedEx overnight delivery throughout the continental U.S. ; shipping costs are included in the fee .
Partners are even invited to come aboard the company 's lobster boat in Maine if they can , to meet the lobstermen and experience the harvest first - hand .
Corporate gifts and single - meal orders are also available , and Catch a Piece of Maine donates 10 percent of its profits to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute , educating 5th and 6th grade students about the Maine lobster industry .
At a time when local fishermen are struggling to make a living , Catch a Piece of Maine 's partnership program allows lobstermen to receive a premium for their product while also preserving their sustainable fishing methods , the company says .
No less significantly , it also gives consumers an active hand in what has typically been a hands - off business .
Finally , it dovetails nicely with the still made here trend , giving consumers a geographical connection and a story to tell about the source of their food .

Lloyd was planning to return to Australia next month .
He was due to start a new job in October , as co-host of Breakfast News on ABC2 with Virginia Trioli .
Instead , he was taken last night to the Changi prison hospital as the ABC dispatched its top lawyer to Singapore , which has some of the toughest drug laws in the world .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said he would take personal interest in the case when he travelled to Singapore next week .
" I 'll be in a position to speak first hand to our high commissioner , and ensure personally that anything that we can do in terms of consular assistance is done for Mr Lloyd and his family , " he said .
Lloyd 's former partner Kirsty McIvor , with whom he has two boys , declined to comment .
Lloyd was on leave in Singapore when he was arrested around 8.30 pm on Wednesday .
" In the course of follow - up search , the officers recovered a packet of 'ice ' weighing approximately 0.8 grams , one improvised smoking pipe and six syringes .
His urine was screened positive for amphetamines , a controlled drug , on the instant urine test machine , " said a statement from Singapore 's Central Narcotics Bureau .
He was arrested after being identified as the alleged " supplier " of ice to a 31 - year - old Singaporean " male drug abuser " .
The Singaporean man had been arrested earlier and allegedly found in possession of ice .
Another four Singaporeans were arrested in the same bust .
A bureau spokeswoman said Lloyd had been offered bail and his case would return to court on July 25 .
Singapore lawyer Shashi Nathan said a bail surety of up to $ 53,000 may have to be provided .
Mr Smith said Lloyd 's arrest served as a reminder that Australians must abide by foreign countries ' drug laws .
Lloyd is a respected reporter who covered the case of Australian Nguyen Tuong Van , who was hanged in Singapore in 2005 for trafficking 396 grams of heroin despite appeals for clemency from the Australian government and public .
In 2004 , Briton Nigel Simmonds , a former magazine editor , was sentenced to two years ' jail after he pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing 0.48 grams of ice and consuming ice and cocaine .
If found guilty , Lloyd could face between five and 20 years ' jail and between five and 15 strokes of the cane .
Lloyd will appear in Singapore 's District Court before a single judge .
He could then appeal to the Supreme Court .
If a conviction is still upheld , Lloyd can appeal to the Singaporean President for clemency .
Diplomatic approaches can be made to the Singaporean Attorney - General , who has the power to decide not to prosecute .
Singaporean lawyer Joseph Theseira , who represented Van , said it was not out of the question that Lloyd 's charges could be withdrawn by the Attorney - General because " we do n't know anything about the person he is alleged to have received the drugs and his credibility " .
Lloyd has had an extensive career on commercial TV networks and the ABC .
He has twice been a finalist in the prestigious Walkley awards and last year won a United Nations Media Peace prize .
Lloyd was based in Bangkok between 2002 and 2006 before being posted to New Delhi .
He led the ABC 's coverage of the Schapelle Corby and Bali nine drug trials .
Ash Khan , an Australian journalist in Bangladesh who worked as Lloyd 's fixer , described him as a hard worker and " a really fun guy , really on the go " .
ABC colleagues were yesterday in shock .
" Peter Lloyd is very highly regarded here , " said veteran broadcaster Quentin Dempster .
Radio presenter Monica Attard described Lloyd as a " very fine correspondent with an eye for detail and a good deal of compassion " .
Commenting on the rewards and risks of covering international disasters in the February 2005 issue of Inside the ABC , Lloyd said a tip from a contact led to exclusive footage of devastation wreaked by the tsunami at Khao Lok in Thailand .
" But in the haunting scenes of temples - turned - mortuaries there is a price to pay too , is n't there ? "
AMERICA appears to be a much less inviting prospect to migrants than it once was .
This may please some lawmakers , who might point to the effectiveness of tough state - level laws and at improved border security .
But although $ 12 billion will be set aside to guard the frontier in the next fiscal year , fewer people are actually being caught trying to cross it .
In 2007 , 20 % fewer arrests were made by the Border Patrol than in 2006 .
In the six months to March this year , arrests are down by 17 % on a year - to - year basis .
Using this imperfect measure , migration has slowed dramatically .
Big fences and hostility do play a part , but the economy is a big factor .
In boom times , more arrests are made at the border as more people cross looking for work .

People who kill their partners after years of abuse would be able to use a new defence that they had acted in response to extreme " words and conduct " , under government plans to change the law on murder .
The proposals from the Ministry of Justice , to be unveiled today , would also provide a defence for women in domestic violence cases who kill their partners in premeditated attacks .
They would be able to rely on a defence of " fear of serious violence " but would not have to show they acted spontaneously .
The reforms , triggered by concerns about the different treatment of men and women in cases of domestic violence , would mean the abolition of the 17th century defence of provocation and a more precise medical definition of diminished responsibility .
At the centre of the reforms is tackling gender inequality : the view that it is too easy for men to say they killed female partners because of infidelity , or the ending of a relationship , while women with abusive partners find it hard to mount a similar partial defence .
" The days of sexual jealousy as a defence are over , " said Vera Baird QC , the solicitor general .
" Exceptionally , someone who loses control and kills from a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged by the victim 's conduct will ... have a partial defence .
" However , unlike the current defence of provocation , this can't be used when ordinary domestic conflicts cause friction and emphatically will not be available as a reaction to sexual infidelity . "
Men and women who suffered a " slow burn " of domestic violence over a period of time could also use one of the partial defences under the proposals , overturning the law which requires them to have acted on the spur of the moment .
But Maria Eagle , the justice minister , said the slow burn defence would still have a high threshold .
" This is a substantial change , " she said .
" But we would not want to introduce anything that would allow cold , calculating killers to get away with it . "
The recognition of the devastating effects of long - term domestic abuse was demonstrated by the case of Kiranjit Ahluwalia whose conviction for killing her husband was overturned on appeal in 1992 .
After abuse including having a hot iron held to her face , she attacked him in his sleep by pouring petrol on his feet and setting them alight , but he died and she was charged with murder .
Her appeal set a historic precedent - that women who kill as a result of severe domestic violence should not be treated as cold - blooded murderers .
As in the case of Sara Thornton , Ahluwalia 's story showed they could still have a defence , even if they did not kill in response to an immediate act of violence .
The proposals - which have taken more than four years to draw up after two reports from the Law Commission - do not take forward the idea of a US - style scale of first and second degree murder which was recommended in the commission 's second report in 2006 .
The new concept of the " words and conduct " defence could apply , for example , when a rape victim killed his or her attacker after being taunted about what happened .
The partial defence could also be used when a mother kills a man after catching him trying to rape her daughter , said a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman .
It could also similarly apply when neighbours have been involved in a long - running dispute , leading to one of them killing the other , although the spokeswoman said this would be a " very exceptional " case .
If a jury accepts a partial defence in a murder trial the defendant can be convicted of manslaughter instead , and receive a much lower sentence .
The defence of being in " fear of serious violence " would mean that men or women living with domestic violence could argue they were forced to kill their tormentor .
But the Ministry of Justice said the law would be changed to make it clear that someone who discovered their partner was having an affair would not be entitled to argue they had been " seriously wronged " .
Lady Scotland , the attorney general said : " Murder law has not changed since 1957 - the proposed thorough overhaul will bring it right up to date . "
The new partial defences in full are :
· Killing in response to a fear of serious violence .
· Killing in response to words and conduct which caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged .
Other reforms in the consultation paper include a change to the partial defence of diminished responsibility .
It will be abolished and replaced with a defence based on " recognised medical conditions " with defences " grounded in a valid medical diagnosis " that together " encompass the recognised physical , psychiatric and psychological conditions " .
The document says : " Where a woman has suffered mental health problems as a result of domestic abuse , this definition will enable them to be taken into account . "
But the government dropped a previous Law Commission recommendation for a defence of " developmental immaturity " , which would have seen children who kill being convicted of lower charges lawyers proved they were young for their age .
NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Shares of Yahoo
Inc rose as much as 11 percent on Tuesday , reversing earlier declines , after contradictory reports on whether buyout talks with Microsoft Corp were heating up again .
Microsoft runs across a news ticker above a Yahoo sign in New York City May 19 , 2008 .

“ People are attributing huge outcomes to very small pieces of information , ” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay , referring to a flurry of thinly detailed stories citing unnamed sources that caused Yahoo ’s stock to spike .
Following a report on technology blog TechCrunch saying merger talks were back on , Yahoo shares sailed as high as $ 23.71 , a 10.5 percent rise from their Monday close and a 15 percent jump from a Tuesday session low of $ 20.60 .
The shares erased most of the gains after TV news channel CNBC said no deal was on the table between the two companies .
Other news reports had also suggested talks on a partial deal were back on .
The reports all cited unnamed sources .
“ It ’s ‘he said , she said , ’ ” Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis said .
Both Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment .
Yahoo shares settled back to trade up 1.6 percent at $ 21.80 in late Nasdaq trading .
The stock had traded down around 3 percent early in the day after a downgrade by broker Thomas Weisel Partners that argued Yahoo was worth only $ 18 a share .
TechCrunch cited multiple unidentified sources saying Microsoft was back in talks to buy all of Yahoo , after walking away in May .
In June , Yahoo turned down Microsoft ’s estimated $ 9 billion offer to buy a 16 percent stake in the company as well as Yahoo ’s search business .
“ The information we have is thin , but what one source is saying ( is ) that Microsoft is talking a price lower than the $ 33 they were offering ( per share ) when the talks disintegrated in May , ” the TechCrunch report said .
Reports of a rekindling of talks gave hope to Yahoo investors incensed over what was perceived as the botched handling of Microsoft ’s initial overtures in January .
“ The options in Yahoo are very susceptible to any sort of speculation on a strategic partnership that might put the company on a more resolute path , ” said Rebecca Engmann Darst , equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group .
She cited heavy buying in Yahoo July calls valued at $ 22.50 and $ 25 .
Yahoo has said it remained open to more talks with Microsoft .
On Monday , CNET Networks
Inc ’s technology news website News.com reported on its blog that Microsoft was willing to sweeten its earlier offer for a partial purchase of Yahoo ’s search business , citing one unidentified major investor .
Microsoft shares fell 17 cents , or 0.6 percent , to $ 27.80 on Nasdaq after the reports .
Gillis said Yahoo does not have the luxury of time to stay independent as U.S. economic weakness appears to be sapping the pace of growth in the display advertising business -- ads that are prized by corporate marketers and serve as Yahoo ’s revenue mainstay .
The Canaccord Adams analyst warned that even if Yahoo does not disappoint Wall Street with its second - quarter report due out later in July , then the economic drag on advertising would likely show up by its third - quarter results .
“ A miss would be brutal to the stock , ” he added .

Au lendemain de leur premier dialogue direct depuis 1995 , la Chine et Taïwan ont signé , vendredi 13 juin , un accord historique autorisant les vols directs entre les deux pays et permettant à davantage de touristes chinois de se rendre à Taïwan .
Les discussions directes entre Taïpeh et Pékin ont été rompues pendant de longues années , et la Chine refusait de traiter avec le président Chen Shui-bian , qu'elle soupçonnait de vouloir pousser l'île à déclarer son indépendance officielle .
Mais le climat s'est réchauffé depuis la prise de fonction , en mai 2007 , du président Ma Ying - jeou , favorable , lui , à un rapprochement avec la Chine communiste .
Il n'y a pas eu de vols directs réguliers au - dessus du détroit de Taïwan depuis 1949 , date de l'arrivée sur l'île des forces nationalistes chinoises de Tchang Kaï-chek , en fuite devant les troupes communistes de Mao Zedong .
Seuls quelques vols étaient autorisés lors de fêtes nationales .
Les vols réguliers , une vingtaine dans chaque sens chaque week - end , commenceront le 4 juillet et relieront les huit aéroports de Taïwan à Pékin , Shanghaï , Canton , Nankin et Xiamen , plusieurs de ces villes comptant une importante communauté d'affaires taïwanaise , obligée jusqu'ici de transiter par Hongkong pour les trajets entre l'île et le continent , éloignés de moins de 200 km .
VISITE DANS L'ÎLE DU NÉGOCIATEUR CHINOIS
Un autre accord permettra de tripler le nombre de touristes chinois autorisés à visiter Taïwan : 3 000 , contre 1 000 actuellement , pourront chaque jour se rendre en groupe dans l'île par le biais d'agences autorisées .
Ces accords sont intervenus au deuxième jour de la reprise du dialogue direct entre Pékin et Taïpeh , lors d'une cérémonie retransmise par la télévision chinoise .
Ils ont été signés par les présidents des deux organismes semi-officiels chargés de ces discussions , Taïwan et la Chine n'ayant formellement pas de relations gouvernementales .
Jeudi , la Fondation des échanges entre les deux rives ( SEF ) côté taïwanais et l'Association pour les relations entre les deux rives ( Arats ) côté chinois , s'étaient déjà accordées sur une visite dans l'île du négociateur chinois cette année .
La Chine avait proposé de traiter " d'abord les choses faciles , puis les difficiles " .
Une suggestion apparemment écoutée , les questions politiquement plus sensibles ayant apparemment été laissées de côté , comme la signature d'un traité de paix et les centaines de missiles que Taïwan accuse la Chine de pointer vers elle .

WTC 7 collapse vs controlled demolition take down
Unleashed : Unanswered 9/11 questions
The collapse of New York ’s World Trade Centre on September 11 , 2001 is arguably one of the most well documented events in human history .
Less well documented is the controversy over why the buildings fell as they did .
At the time of writing , 357 architectural and engineering professionals have signed a petition which directly challenges the National Institute of Standards & Training ’s official finding that the destruction of these massive buildings was caused solely by structural damage from the impact of jet airliners and the resulting fires .
[…]
Current research indicates that an incendiary ( thermite ) may have been used to sever the massive box columns of the towers , causing the buildings to plummet to the ground at close to free - fall speed .
[…]
“ As no reports have come to light of any steel framed buildings collapsing due to fire , and as all steel framed buildings which had collapsed had done so due to explosive demolition , the logical way to have started the investigation of this surprising event would have been to question whether explosives had been used .
This apparently did not occur .
William Rodriguez , an acknowledged hero of 9/11 who single - handedly rescued fifteen people from the North Tower , described a massive explosion in the basement which occurred before the first plane struck , pushing him upwards out of the seat of his chair .
The New York Fire Department ’s oral histories project contains 118 witness statements which are strongly consistent with explosive demolition .
Incredibly , none of this shocking testimony was included or acknowledged in any official investigation , including the 9/11 Commission .
If the towers were wired with explosives by terrorists prior to the planes , that would imply a lack of security on a massive scale that would be worth hiding .
On the other hand , how do you hide that much work to rig buildings like that ?
If terrorists did n’t do it , why would the towers be rigged with explosives ?
Leaving aside the wacko’s government conspiracies , are other buildings routinely wired to blow to bring them straight down if something happens to prevent them falling onto other buildings ?
An interesting ‘ protection ’ scenario for the neighborhood that would be worth hiding for many reasons .
And then there ’s this article from a few months ago with quotes from military experts like this one :

Things are changing .
There is a whole new level of curiosity and excitement about getting Apple stamped devices ready to work with our corporate IT .
There are more and more employees demanding access for their Apple hardware .
Even the bosses from the top are more open .
They are curious and in some cases even ready to make the changes .
I 'm sure their experience with other Apple products had nothing to do with it . ;-)
Take a look at these excerpts from corporate executives and CEO's in the latest Anthony Decanti , Vice - president for technology Werner Enterprises ( $ 2B in sales ) Werner Enterprises ( WERN ) , a trucking company based in Omaha with $ 2 billion in sales , decided to start letting employees use a variety of computers a few years ago .
When they began to choose Macs , the company reached out to Apple .
" They all but told us to take a hike , " says Anthony Decanti , vice - president for technology .
But Decanti persisted , and Apple eventually sent an account rep .
Michele Goins , Chief Information Officer at Juniper Networks
" If we opened it up today , I think 25 % of our employees would choose Macs , " she says .
Scott Kriens , CEO At Sunnyvale ( Calif . ) - based Juniper
One of the people with a new Mac Book laptop .
" Everybody told me I should get one , " he says .
" It 's not anything to do with negative perceptions about Microsoft .
It 's just that Macs are cool . "
Mark Slaga , Chief Information Officer of Dimension Data
A large computer services firm based in suburban Johannesburg , says he has received 25 e-mails recently from employees who want permission to use Macs at work .
In a survey of 250 diverse companies that has yet to be released , the market research firm Yankee Group found that 87 % now have at least some Apple computers in their offices , up from 48 % two years ago .
Companies are stepping up for their employees and starting to support Apple in the business environment .
Notable ones include : IBM

There are also legions of celebrity endorsers and media darlings that support and promote the Apple Invasion to consumers ( our corporate employee base in most cases ) .
Another factor that could drive increased usage in coming years is the droves of college students who have known nothing but their Apple during their higher education coming into the workplace .
According to a survey of 1,200 undergrads by researcher Student Monitor this year , 43 % of college students who intend to buy a laptop plan to buy a Mac , up from 8 % in 2003 .
Combine this with constant word of mouth marketing from colleagues , friends and family and there is a significant shift in usage patterns in favor of Apple in corporate environments .
All this translates into changes for many of our corporate IT policies .
We have to adapt to the demand and to be open to the idea of sharing our corporate networks and resources and even support Apple devices on our own ( no in - house Genius Bar ) .
The best advice given we 've heard so far . . . keep an open mind and get ready to be Appleified .
Is your company ready for the Apple Invasion ?
What kind of resources are you setting up to support the influx of Apple users in your company ?
The Apple invasion into corporate has started and I can't say if I am excited or scared .
As an IT manager , I have nightmares over all the support and technical issues of integrating Apple hardware and software into our company .
As an owner of ample Apple products , I 'm excited about being able to use my iPhone and MacBooks at the company .
For years many of us have fought to get Apple products into our company 's infrastructure .
Much to our dismay , the cost involved with supporting Apple products across the whole enterprise always outweighed the benefit .
It did n't help that even Steve Jobs for many years held a firm stance on being a consumer oriented company .

Opinion Why Germany Needs an Iraq Policy
Regardless whether Obama , Clinton or McCain enters the White House , the next US government will demand greater support from Germany on the international stage , especially in Iraq .
But the government in Berlin is poorly prepared for this inevitability -- and that 's a serious failure .
Von Guido Steinberg
Given the relative odds , one would think Gessen ’s genetic counselors would have advised a pre-emptive mastectomy rather than an oophorectomy , or removal of the ovaries .
To her surprise , they recommended an oophorectomy .
One can understand their logic : breast cancer is easier to detect and survive ; removing the ovaries reduces the risk of breast cancer ; and most women ca n’t even countenance the idea of parting with their breasts .
But Gessen balked , well aware of the studies associating surgical menopause with cognitive troubles and depression , to say nothing of osteoporosis , high blood pressure and heart disease .
“ I politely suggested I could just shoot myself tomorrow :
That would prevent my death from cancer with a 100 percent probability , ” she writes .
“ The joke remained suspended in the thin air between us and the counselors , and with it , our disengagement from one another was complete . ”
Image Credit ... Ellen Lupton
So Gessen ditches the counselors and the doctors and instead tries to collect information from a wider , more eccentric variety of sources .
A sympathetic nurse scientist at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute concedes that close surveillance might be a reasonable alternative to surgery for some women .
Nancy Etcoff , a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and the author of “ Survival of the Prettiest , ” a study of the evolutionary importance of beauty , points out that while breasts are central to female attractiveness , attractiveness and happiness are barely correlated .
Most memorably , an instructor in a psychology and economics class at Harvard attempts to “ express life in numbers ” for Gessen on an Excel spreadsheet , assigning values to living with cancer , living without cancer and living with the stench of a cancer threat .
Though she rejects some of his findings 
I will not say what Gessen ultimately chooses to do  she leaves his office feeling light , unburdened : “ I jumped on my bicycle and sped home , making currents in the puddles , getting soaked , feeling strong and a little silly and generally like my life had a utility of 100 a year , possibly even more , now that I also felt that much more competent for being able to put a number on the value of riding in the rain . ”
Our culture does n’t yet have the infrastructure  educational , medical , moral , the whole shebang  to handle the consequences of the recent revolution in genetic testing .
But we ’ll need it , and Gessen , though drafted into this project against her will , is helping to do the crucial spadework to build it .
As she points out , the nascent rules of the new cancer caste to which she belongs “ are an approximation , albeit a very crude one , of the rules by which my daughter ’s generation will run its life . ”
And indeed , “ Blood Matters ” is about far more than Gessen ’s own story .
She writes energetically , if a bit discursively at times , about the grander context in which her personal drama takes place .
There ’s a lovely chapter about Holmes Morton , who , long before the term “ personalized medicine ” entered our lexicon , was developing protocols to treat genetic diseases common to the Amish and the Mennonites .
Henry T. Lynch , the doctor who first posited that cancer might have a genetic component ( and one of the first to talk about preventive surgery ) , earns a chapter , as does a group of people living with the mutation for Huntington ’s .
Gessen ponders behavior and genetics ( characterizing herself as a “ novelty - seeking , sex- crazed , egomaniacal optimist ”  until she discovers she has a mutation associated with harm - avoidance and anxiety ) , and she writes thoughtfully about Dor Yeshorim , a premarital testing program aimed at Orthodox Jews , which avoids telling individuals whether they carry a gene for one of the “ Jewish mutations ” by telling them instead if they ’re genetically compatible with the person they wish to marry .
( “ Why advise people if they do n’t need to know ? ” asks a rabbi who once ran the program . )
My only quarrels with “ Blood Matters ” come at the beginning and at the end .
Gessen starts with a lengthy disquisition about Jews , disease and selective advantage , leading us to believe we ’re in for a treatise on Jewish exceptionalism , when in fact the questions she addresses are universal .
And for a book that ’s so careful , she concludes uncarefully , asking and too easily answering all sorts of questions about the moral consequences of genetic advancements that deserve more nuance .
( She tries to make the case , for instance , that prospective parents already preselect embryos for intelligence , because it ’s common in the United States to terminate pregnancies involving sex- chromosome abnormalities that correlate with learning problems and below - average intelligence  as if the fear of sex - chromosome abnormalities themselves , not the desire for smarter children , is n’t still the reason . )
That is a drop of nearly $ 150 billion , an amount much larger than the value of the tax rebates the government has sent to households this year in an effort to spur economic activity .
Financial industry executives say tighter credit from major banks represents a swing back to a realistic assessment of risk , after years of handing out money with abandon .
Those practices produced a mortgage crisis whose losses could reach $ 1 trillion , by many estimates .
“ Before , they would n’t verify income and they were loose on the valuations of collateral , ” said John W. Kiefer , chief executive of First Capital , a private commercial lender .
“ Now they ’re tightening down on the ability to repay .
They go off the reservation , and now they come back to basics .
It ’s preservation for many of them at this point .
It ’s survival . ”
But if the newfound caution of American banks is prudent in the long run , the immediate impact is amplifying the troubles with the economy .
The Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates aggressively to make money flow more loosely and to spur economic activity .
The financial system is not going along :
As banks hold on to their dollars , mortgage rates are climbing .
So are borrowing costs for corporations .
Some suggest that the banks , spooked by enormous losses , have replaced a disastrously indiscriminate willingness to hand out money with an equally arbitrary aversion to lend  even on industries that continue to grow .
“ There ’s been a lot of disruption in the credit market , and a lot of traditional lenders have really tightened up , ” said Gregory Goldstein , president of Macquarie Equipment Finance , which leases computer gear and other technology to companies .
“ Before , some of the standards they lent on were weak , but we think they have overshot and gone too far on the other end . ”

The best shows are the ones where you go through some unexpected things in your head as you ’re watching and listening .
It ’s really about the magic — the sound and sights of surprise — that transcendent music and performance can be .
It happened to me last night at the Orpheum , as the nonpareil Tom Waits and his five - man band opened its Glitter and Doom Tour before a sold - out house in the sweet old venue in downtown Phoenix .
It was one of the more anticipated concerts in these parts in a while , and folks came in from several states , according to Live Nation ’s Terry Burke , to check out what the iconic songwriter and performer had in store this go - round .
Waits did the near - impossible and lived up to the great expectations , sweating through his gray suit as he worked himself and his top - drawer band through the paces for two - plus hours .
The guy is a performance artist of the highest rank , a kabuki with a bowler hat , a Delta bluesman not afraid to be romantic , a cynic with a heart of gold .
Waits ’ voice , once ravaged by cigarettes and overuse , may be as worn as my old fast - pitch glove , but — like the glove — it can do the trick , which , in his case , is to feel him from the inside out .
It was impossible to resist a fella who sings from way down under ,
“ Well , I see that the world is upside - down Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold And now the clouds , well they ’ve covered over And the wind is blowing cold Well , I do n’t need anybody , because I learned , I learned to be alone Well , I said anywhere , anywhere , anywhere I lay my head , boys Well , I gonna call my home ”
We may as well have been in an Irish pub last night , with the bawdy give - and - take between performer and an audience recharged after a brutal 113 - degree Phoenix day .
Waits has more influences in him than an Arizona congressman , yet he remains , to steal one of his lyrics , as independent as a hog on ice .
Between songs , he riffed about anything that came to his agile mind , including blue laws said to be on the books in various states .
“ You know , it ’s against the law [ in some state ] for a one - armed piano player to get paid , ” he said , adding that , from where he sits , that player ought to get paid double .
“ I ’m gonna do something about that ! ”
He asked the audience about Van Buren Street , which he recalled fondly from his last gig in town , some 32 years ago .
It ’s the kind of nasty street that Tom Waits invented in his head long ago , and he wanted to know if you could still get a cheap room there .
Someone hollered back something in a faux - Waits trademark gravelly voice about being able to find a cheap whore down there .
Waits laughed , and said that , in the interest of decorum — hah ! — it was time to change the subject , “ especially at these prices , ” by which he meant the $ 90 a pop ticket tag .
The music that this guy has soaked up during his 58 - plus years on the planet is endless : Johnny Cash .
Lord Buckley .
Ma Rainey .
Dylan .
Guthrie , and on and on .
Hell , Waits and his band sounded like mad Klezmer scientists on a few tune , so much so that the boy might find a place on the Bar Mitzvah circuit if this selling - out - a - venue - in - five - minutes thing does n’t work out .
But in the end , Tom Waits is a bluesman , and his music inevitably hearkens back to those “ five notes , ” as the late Al Wilson of Canned Heat used to say , that are the blues .
Check out some classic Tom Waits .
At one moment during last night ’s show , I flashed to a fellow named Robert Pete Williams , whose “ disregard for conventional patterns , tunings , and structures kept him from a wider audience , ” according to one expert , “ but his music remains one of the great , intense treats of the blues . ”
That author could be talking about Tom Waits .
Long ago , I checked out Mr. Williams at a show in my hometown of New Haven , Connecticut .
I went because someone told me he was the “ Coltrane of the blues , ” referring , of course , to jazz innovator John Coltrane .
Two hours after Williams ’ transcendent solo performance in front of , say , 20 people , I followed him backstage — a kitchen in a dorm at Yale University — and said hello .
The elderly black man plopped onto a stool , drenched in sweat and emotionally spent .
He gestured me in and said to sit down , which I did .
He reached into a suitcase and pulled out a bottle of Scotch whiskey .
Twisted it open and drank long and hard from it , then handed it to me like I was an old friend , not a 17 - year - old from down the road .
It did n’t go down so easily .
We did n’t say anything for a minute or so , just passed the bottle back and forth .
Finally , the door opened and people stepped in to pay their respects .
I stood up , shook his hand , and left .
Though I ’ve never shared a taste with Tom Waits , I can safely say that he is a kindred spirit of Mr. Williams ’ if ever there was one .
Sitting on one side of me last night was a gent from Sun Valley , Idaho , named Chris , who had driven down fourteen hours or so for the show , losing his air conditioning , he said , as he crossed into Arizona .
This show was a huge deal for Chris , a Waits fan for three decades , as it was the first time he ’d seen his musical hero in concert .
“ Tom has been at the top of my list of must - sees - before - I - die artists for so long , I ca n’t believe I ’m here , ” Chris said just before the show started .
Afterward , he said with a huge grin , “ That guy is a damned treasure . ”
Amen .

Introductory Babblings ....
I cast , load and shoot lead bullets .
I 've been doing so for quite awhile now but I 'll be the first to admit that I started doing it simply because I 'm cheap .
Since then , I 've come up with a lot of other good reason .
Some of these reasons are supportable with fact and some of them are just opinion .
Im trying to put together this page because Ive noticed that there is precious little information available on the internet concerning lead bullets and that what information is available is spread out in small bits and pieces .
This page will always be a work in progress because
Im always learning new things and because my typing skills leave much to be desired .
If you have any information , opinions or questions please feel free to contact me .
Well , lets see ... If you have actually found this site you are either desperate or have progressed beyond the basics of casting so the basics will be dispensed with , at least for the time being .
Lets start with one word .
That word being - wheelweights .
I can already see the raised eyebrows , so let me explain .
Im a lazy man .
The standard Lyman # 2 alloy is an excellent alloy however
Im too lazy to take the time to mix it and too cheap to buy it so I was left with the only thing I could think of .
Wheelweights .
Hither to known as WW .
Wheelweights .....
Wheelweights are , in my opinion , the greatest thing to have ever happened to casters .
They are cheap if not free , a almost perfect alloy of lead , tin , antimony and even a little arsenic .
Yes , it could be harder but we will get to that later on .
Here is a little hint when it comes to collecting WWs .
Tire stores and mechanic shops .
Everyone knows that you say ?
Theres more .
I was a mechanic for a large number of years so this is the inside scoop , write this down somewhere .
BEER .
Yes you heard me right …. a little beer goes a long way .
Buying a set of tires ?
Talk to the man .
Do n’t just get your tires , then ask for some WWs , you will probably get them but it will cost you .
Be friendly , once he realizes that you arent the usual yuppie that thinks hes nothing more than a sub - human grease monkey you have just guaranteed yourself a steady WW supply .
A 12 pack will generally get me two five gallon buckets full .
Try it !
Once
Ive acquired a decent amount of WWs I melt them down into clean shiny ingots .
To do this I use a 40 year old Coleman camp stove that I have converted to propane and a four quart cast iron pot .
A word of advice here , consult your wife before taking one of her pots .
It has been brought to my attention that some women seem to have a rather unhealthy attachment to their cookware .
I perform the initial melting outside because most WWs are very dirty .
Once I have these ingots made they can be used in my electric pot inside , albeit in the basement .
Concerning ingot molds ….
I have several , Lyman , RCBS , Saeco etc .
But what I now use are small muffin tins .
Not the large size , the small ones .
They are cheap , light weight and they cool quicker .
Moving inside .....
.
Now that all my lead has been cleaned and formed into ingots , I move inside the basement .
For casting my bullets I use a Lee Bottom Pour Pot .
I think it is an excellent pot that holds 10 pounds of liquid metal .
To this liquid I add a 6 - inch piece of 95.5 wire solder .
Thats 95 percent tin and 5 percent antimony .
Sorry , but that is about as scientific as I get when it comes to alloying my metals .
Is that the standard 2 percent tin that everyone says you are supposed to add ?
Dont know .
I do know that it works !
It certainly aids in filling out my bullets , practically no wrinkles or rounded edges .
Hardens my bullets a bit but not too much .
In my opinion a bullet that is too hard is just as bad , if not worse , than a bullet that is too soft .
But thats something that we will look into later on .
Another issue is mold and melt temperature .
There are a lot of theories out there and I have one of my own .
Surprise !
I cast all my bullets HOT ...
I have less fill out problems , especially with the larger bullets and we all know what a pain they can sometimes be .
I usually cast with 3 molds at a time .
That way , they do n't heat up too fast .
Cant have lead smears on the top of my molds !
I 'll admit right now that I dont have a hardness tester .
Again , I 'm too cheap .
I 've always used the " thumbnail " test .
If a bullet scratches easily with a thumbnail it's too soft .
If it requires considerable effort to scratch it then it's good to go .
I 've found that this method serves me quite well .
Well , in the next few pages I 'll attempt to cover equipment , techniques and loading so on the left you will see a list of different pages , click on one of those and enjoy !

In my time as your Greatest American Hero I have seen some pretty sick shit , and let ’s face it , I have beaten off to most of it because in reality I am a sick sick fucker , but this afternoon this was brought to my attention .
Apparently there is a growing group of people getting off to pictures of dragons having sex with cars .
Take a moment …
Let that sink in .
Now I realize that more than likely this is just a joke , but that ’s how it always starts .
Look at all the shitty anime porn out there with chicks getting fucked by aliens with 50 cocks .
Is this really where porn s going ?
I mean I never really understood anime porn to begin with .
Asian bitches are so hot on their own why would you need to beat off to animated ones ?
Any how for more info on this check here .

Ahmedabad , home to 3.5 million people and Gujarat ’s commercial center , is no stranger to violence .
In 2002 , a train fire that killed several dozen Hindus led to the killing of 1,000 Muslims over several days , one of the worst outbreaks of religious violence in India ’s history .
An obscure group calling itself the Indian Mujahedeen warned Saturday that an attack was about to take place “ in revenge of Gujarat , ” plainly referring to the 2002 killings .
The statement was sent in an e-mail message , written in English , to television stations just before the first blasts .
H. P. Singh , the city ’s joint police commissioner , said Sunday that some of the explosives had been strapped to bicycles in crowded streets and markets .
Later in the evening , a pair of car bombs went off in front of two city hospitals .
At one of them , Civil Hospital , the dead included husband - and - wife doctors and two sanitation workers .
The police said two additional bombs had been found and defused , in Ahmedabad and nearby Gandhinagar , Gujarat ’s capital .
On Sunday afternoon , the police found two abandoned cars in Surat , an industrial city in Gujarat , one stuffed with bomb - making chemicals and detonators , the other with live bombs .
The police said they were still tracing the cars ’ ownership .
On Friday , there was a series of similar low - intensity blasts in southern Bangalore , one of which killed a woman standing at a bus stop .
Two months ago in Jaipur , synchronized blasts on bicycles killed 56 people ; the Indian Mujahedeen sent an e-mail message claiming credit for those attacks .
On Sunday , a police official , P. P. Pandey , said “ a single mind ” was suspected to be behind the three latest attacks .
The police said they had detained people for questioning ;
The Associated Press reported 30 were in custody .
Officials offered no further details about who was involved in the group or a possible motivation behind the bombings .

Dean Peterson has heard the snickering .
His 17 - year - old son " keeps quiet " about his father 's new obsession , and when his 15 - year - old son proposed following in his dad 's footsteps , the principal at the boy 's school warned that other students might pick on him .
But the 6 - foot - tall , 250 - pound mail carrier from Lacey , Wash . , does n't worry about anyone questioning his virility , or ogling his bare knees .
He just wants to feel as free as a woman wearing a skirt .
" A lot of people think I 'm crazy , " said Peterson , 48 , who became a mail carrier after retiring from the Air Force eight years ago .
" This is important to me - I just want to be comfortable .
I just want the option . "
As some 10,000 mail carriers gather in Boston this week for the 66th biennial convention of the National Association of Letter Carriers , Peterson is on a one - man mission to persuade his colleagues to approve a change in their strictly regulated uniforms .
He has proposed a resolution to allow mailmen to wear kilts , which he calls a Male Unbifurcated Garment , or MUG .
Over the past few weeks , he says he has spent the $ 1,800 he received as part of the federal government 's stimulus package to send about 1,000 letters and photographs of a mockup of the new uniform to postal union branches in every state , as well as Guam and Puerto Rico .
" MUGs are worn all over the world , and have been for thousands of years because they are comfortable , " he wrote to fellow mailmen .
" Unbifurcated Garments are far more comfortable and suitable to male anatomy than trousers or shorts , because they do n't confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do . "
He argued that pants can cause sweat rashes and added , " Please open your hearts - and inseams - for an option in mail carrier comfort ! "
Peterson 's efforts have already attracted support .
During the spring , similar resolutions calling for mailmen to be allowed to don kilts passed at letter carrier conventions in Washington and Oregon .
Women can wear skirts .
Paul Lunde , who promoted the resolution in Oregon and has worn kilts on St. Patrick 's Day , Halloween , and occasional Saturdays when his supervisors are n't paying attention , said that expanding the uniform choices would be a way to express his Celtic heritage , just as Jewish postal workers are allowed to wear yarmulkes .
Some of Lunde 's co-workers have accused him of cross-dressing .
Then there are the inevitable , sophomoric questions : " What are you wearing under there ? "
( He and Peterson insist they wear underwear . )
" They 're mostly ribbing me , but occasionally there are people who appear to be offended , " said Lunde , 38 , who has delivered mail in Salem , Ore. , for nine years .
" I say , ' Show me a picture of Jesus in slacks , and I 'll consider it . ' "
He 's usually portrayed wearing some kind of long robe , Lunde added .
The data come from thousands of children who have taken part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys  compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics at the C.D.C. since the 1960s  and represent some of the most reliable statistics available on the health of American children .
The most recent data is based on two surveys  one in 2003 to 2004 and one in 2005 to 2006  that included 8,165 children ages 2 to 19 .
In that group , about 16 percent of children and teenagers were obese , which is defined as having a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile on United States growth charts .
For example , a 10 - year - old girl who is 4 - foot - 7 would be considered obese if her weight reached 100 pounds .
By comparison , about 5 percent of children and teenagers in the United States were obese in the 1960s and 1970s .
As startling as those numbers are , the good news is that from a statistical standpoint , obesity rates have not increased since 1999 .
Estimates for the number of children who fall into the overweight or obese category also have remained stable at about 32 percent since 1999 .
Overweight is defined as at or above the 85th percentile .
In fact , the number of children who fall into the obese category decreased from 17.1 percent to 15.5 percent between the 2003 and 2006 surveys , but the decline was not statistically significant .
So the researchers combined data from both surveys to enhance the statistical strength of the numbers .
The plateau follows years of excessive weight gain among American schoolchildren .
For instance , in 1980 , 6.5 percent of children age 6 to 11 were obese , but by 1994 that number had climbed to 11.3 percent .
By 2002 , the number had jumped to 16.3 percent , but it has now appeared to stabilize around 17 percent .
“ It does n’t mean we ’ve solved it , but maybe there is some opportunity for some optimism here , ” said Cynthia Ogden , the lead author of the journal report and an epidemiologist for the National Center for Health Statistics .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The source of the Salmonella that has sickened hundreds of people through tainted tomatoes may be in Mexico and South and Central Florida , U.S. investigators said on Friday .
A pile of tomatoes are seen on display at a wholesale produce market in Washington , June 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
Health officials said all indications pointed to a single geographic region as the source of the outbreak , which has sickened 228 people in 23 states .
David Acheson , associate commissioner for foods at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) said on a conference call that nine people who became ill with Salmonella had eaten at two different outlets of the same restaurant chain .
He declined to name the chain or the location of the restaurants .
“ That represents a small cluster within this outbreak , ” he said .
The outbreak has been disastrous for the U.S. tomato industry , which produced $ 1.28 billion of the fruit last year .
The FDA has linked the outbreak to raw round , plum and Roma tomatoes , and has issued a list of states and countries whose tomatoes are not associated with the outbreak .
California , Georgia , New York , Canada , Guatemala and the Dominican Republic are among tomato producers on the safe list .
The FDA also has cleared counties in North Florida , whose tomatoes were not widely available at the time of the outbreak .
The FDA said investigators were focusing on South and Central Florida and Mexico because they were the biggest producers at the time .
The Mexican government says its tomatoes are being unjustly targeted and notes that the uncommon Salmonella Saintpaul bacteria identified in the outbreak has never been found in Mexico .
The agriculture ministry said in a statement on Friday it would send a delegation to the United States next week to press officials there to declare Mexican tomatoes as safe to eat .
“ The borders have not been closed to Mexican tomato imports but the alert put out by the U.S. government had provoked a decline in consumption , ” the ministry said .
Some shipments from Mexico have been stopped at the border by worried importers , raising concern among some analysts that Mexico could be hit by a glut of rejected produce .
The Florida Tomato Committee said on Thursday the state ’s industry remained committed to production of a safe product .
It said Florida was the first state in the country to adopt a comprehensive food safety program with mandatory government inspection and audit of its tomatoes .
FOOD - BORNE ILLNESS
Salmonella bacteria are frequently the culprit for food - borne illnesses .
Symptoms of infection include fever , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain and generally appear within 12 to 72 hours of eating tainted food .
Infants , the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness .
Salmonella infections commonly result from eating food that has been contaminated by animal feces , but it is also caused by human feces .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there have been at least 13 multi-state Salmonella outbreaks linked to different types of tomatoes since 1990 .
The FDA is under increasing pressure from consumer groups and Congress to do more to protect the U.S. food supply .
Responsibility for protecting food is split among the FDA , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and state regulators .
Food safety officials have said that outbreaks of food - borne illnesses are rare .
One of the worst outbreaks in the United States in recent times was caused by tainted spinach in 2006 .
That E. coli outbreak killed three people and sickened more than 200 .
RIYADH ( Reuters ) - A Saudi appeals court is due this week to review the case of a biochemist and his female student sentenced to jail and flogging after a lower court ruled their research contact was a front for a telephone affair .
The man was sentenced to 8 months in prison and 600 lashes and his student to 4 months in prison and 350 lashes last November for establishing a phone relationship that led her to divorce her husband .
London - based Amnesty International says it will consider the two as prisoners of conscience if the verdicts are carried out .
“ The charges ... do not correspond to recognizable criminal offences , ” the group said in a statement in April .
A spokesman for the government ’s Human Rights Commission said he was not immediately able to comment .
Rights groups and some Saudi reformers have criticized what they say is an arbitrary justice system unsuited to the needs of a country of 25 million people .
Judges who are religious scholars apply the rulings of an austere version of sharia , Islamic law , often termed Wahhabism .
The government , a key U.S. ally , says the system ensures justice for Muslims and non-Muslims .
It is in the process of overhauling the organization of courts and codifying a formal penal code .
The hospital where the man worked in al - Baha in the southwest of the kingdom put him in charge of the masters research the student was doing at the King Abdul - Aziz University in Jeddah in 2002 .
The woman obtained a divorce seven months after she was married in 2004 .
Her husband then raised the court case , saying the supervisor ’s phone calls led to the break - up .
The supervisor , who asked to be identified only as Khalid , 32 , told Reuters that over 12 months of trial he and the woman were refused permission to use lawyers or bring witnesses to testify .
The woman was represented in court by her father because Wahhabi rules require a male legal guardian .
MEXICO CITY - Ten - year - old Adriana Salgado spends her days in a field in northwestern Mexico , picking the spinach , cabbage and other vegetables that fill American salad bowls .
Adriana does n't know how to read .
She attends school for only one hour a day .
Her 15 - year - old sister , who works with her , ca n't read , either .
Adriana had an 8 - year - old brother , too , until he was crushed to death by a tractor while working in a tomato field last year .
About 300,000 youngsters such as Adriana work illegally in Mexico 's fields , the U.N. Children 's Fund says , making child labor a major link in the chain that increasingly supplies American dinner tables .
In his annual May Day speech last week , Mexican Labor Secretary Javier Lozano pledged to eradicate child labor and impose " the quick application of workplace law . "
But with thousands of poor families dependent on the money that their children bring in , experts say it is an uphill battle .
" It is the worst form of exploitation , " said Nayeli Ram�rez , director of Ririki Social Intervention , a Mexican group that campaigns for children 's rights .
Mexican law prohibits children 13 and younger from working , and those 14 to 16 can work only in jobs that do not " jeopardize their development . "
That clause is not defined .
Nevertheless , children under 15 make up 20 percent of Mexico 's migrant farmworkers , the Mexican Labor Secretariat says .
Less than 10 percent of these children attend school , and 42 percent suffer from some form of malnutrition , government studies show .
They persist in the fields despite harsh criticism from international groups , rules imposed by U.S. distributors and increasingly strident warnings from the Mexican government .
Child deaths
In December , nine children were killed when a truck carrying coffee pickers flipped over in Mexico 's central Puebla state .
In January , the government threatened to fine another coffee farm for using child laborers .
" Enough of this , this making a minor less than 14 years old work without good school conditions or medical care , " Lozano told agribusiness executives during a hearing in the Mexican Senate last year .
" We can not approve of what is going on . "
Adriana is a migrant worker from the southern state of Guerrero .
Interviewed by telephone from a migrant camp in Mexico 's Sinaloa state , she rattled off the names of other children who work with her on a farm run by a wholesaler of Asian vegetables that exports to the United States and Canada .
She recited the produce they pick : baby lettuce , Chinese cabbage and spinach .
She earns about $ 7 a day , said her father , Cruz Salgado .
From 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. , she attends a school run by the company and staffed by student teachers provided by the Mexican government .
Asked if she enjoys working , she said , " Not much . "
" I like school , " she said .
NAFTA byproduct
The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement is partly to blame for the child - labor phenomenon , Ram�rez said .
The trade pact has opened up the U.S. market to Mexican farmers , encouraging large - scale packing and exporting operations in Mexico 's northern and central states .
From 2003 to 2007 , U.S. imports of Mexican fruit and vegetables rose 35 percent , to $ 4.4 billion from $ 3.2 billion .
Small - scale farmers , mostly Indians from southern Mexico , have found it hard to compete .
Instead , they began migrating north each harvest season to work the big fields , Ram�rez said .
The children of these families went from working on the family farm to working for hire , she said .
To most families , it just made sense :
Most farms did not offer day care or schools , so the children might as well stay busy .
In most cases , the children do not appear on the farms ' payrolls , said Teresa Rojas , a professor at Mexico's National Teachers ' University who has studied the phenomenon .
But because adult workers earn bonuses for picking more than their daily quota , parents with " helpers " bring home more money .
Farms save money because they do not have to pay social security for the youngsters .
" You never find the child on the payroll ; it 's always the head of the household , " Rojas said .
" That 's part of the problem .
These children are invisible ( to the government ) . "
In many farms , children as young as 5 scoot on their hands and knees along rows of vegetables , cutting weeds , she said .
In the state of Puebla , children work as " burros , " carrying buckets of coffee beans down from the mountains .
In states that grow corn and wheat , which are easily harvested by machine , small children are seen less frequently in the fields .
But adolescents are common .
In the central Mexican state of Guanajuato , Maria del Carmen L�pez , 16 , said she had been working in the fields since she was 14 .
On a recent day , she walked down rows of young corn plants carrying a small hoe .
Every few minutes , she stopped to hack away at a weed or brush dirt off a corn sprout .
" I wanted to keep studying after middle school , " she said , her voice muffled by a bandanna she wore to keep out the dust .
" But I could n't afford it . "
In Mexico , many children are expected to start working after middle school .
The cost of books , supplies , school clothes and school - maintenance fees are barriers to many families .
In a nearby field , 15 - year - old Ivan Garcia cut broccoli for another exporter of vegetables .
He said he had started working in the fields at age 13 .
Cracking down
Child farmworkers came under greater scrutiny after the Jan. 6 , 2007 , death of Adriana 's 8 - year - old brother , David , at the Los Pinos tomato farm in Sinaloa .
" He was going to empty his bucket , and the tractor driver did n't see him and went right over him , " said Cruz Salgado , his voice choking up .
The case made headlines across Mexico and prompted calls by UNICEF to ban child labor .
The farm 's owner , Agr�cola Paredes , paid $ 3,308 in funeral expenses , according to a report by the Mexican Senate .
But it refused to pay any further compensation , claiming that the boy was on a public road and that he was not a formal employee , the Senate report said .
Agr�cola Paredes officials declined to talk to The Republic .
The company sells tomatoes , bell peppers and eggplant in the United States under the SPV , Chelita and Paris brands .
One of its main importers , H.M. Distributors of Rio Rico , Ariz. , said it had not heard about the boy 's death and was unaware of any children working on its suppliers ' farms .
But Vice President Rene Monteverde said it was difficult for importers to make sure farms are obeying the rules .
Changes in policy
" We 're not there every day , so it 's tough , " Monteverde said .
Before David 's death , many companies in Sinaloa paid child workers just like other workers , with envelopes of cash , Salgado said .
Now , most refuse to pay children directly , and some bar children from the fields entirely , he said .
U.S. distributors are increasingly putting rules against child labor into their supplier contracts , said Eduardo Garcia , operations manager of the Agr�cola Nieto farms in Guanajuato state .
Manager Let Tran of Agr�cola Buen A�o , the Salgado family 's current employer , said he has no children on the payroll but added that many workers insist on keeping their children with them during the day .
" I do a school , and nobody wants to put their kids in school .
I do a day care , and nobody puts their kid in day care , " Tran said .
" It 's really hard because we 're trying to improve their lives . "
Enforcement is difficult , Lozano has said , because of jurisdictional conflicts between state and federal officials .
The federal Labor Secretariat only has 318 inspectors nationwide , while farms number in the thousands .
The Labor Secretariat said it did 3,047 inspections to check on the labor conditions of minors in workplaces from January to July 2007 , but it could not immediately provide statistics on how many were farms or how many violations had been found .
Day care , school
The Mexican government has started building day - care centers nationwide and is boosting the number of grants given to families so that children can continue studying .
But poverty and a long family tradition of farmwork remain a significant hurdle , Rojas said .
After losing his son , Salgado said he did not want his other children in the fields .
But he said there was no way he could make ends meet on the $ 20 a day he and his wife would earn alone .
" I wish they did n't have to work , " he said .
" But we need the money . "

If you ’re thinking about starting your own business this year , there ’s only one question you need to answer .
Do I have what it takes to succeed ?
Of course , to answer this question , you need to know what it does take to succeed on the modern market .
That ’s exactly what we ’re going to talk about on this post .
By the end of this post , you should be able to answer that question with confidence and take your first step as a new entrepreneur .
Be aware that it ’s not an easy road ahead but with the skills , the belief , and the determination , you can succeed .
So , what do you need ?
Confidence In Your Idea
Pexels Picture
This was one of the key details to almost every start - up venture you can consider .
The entrepreneurs behind the company all had one key trait in common .
They believed in what they were selling .
You need to believe in your product , service or company .
If you do n’t believe , why should anyone else ?
Do n’t forget ; you ’re going to have to encourage investors to pour money into your company .
You ’ll also need to get customers to buy your product .
Both will know if you do n’t have faith in it yourself .
If you like , you can try and fake the desired passion .
But watch interviews with people such as Branson , Zuckerberg , and the other billionaires .
They all have a huge level of confidence in the idea that made them .
Of course , it ’s easier to have confidence in your idea if you know it ’s going to be a hit .
Can you know this before you ’ve already found success on the market ?
Well , there are signs to look out for .
Talk about your business with strangers who you believe are your target customer .
If they get excited or interested , there ’s a good chance your company is going to fill a hole in the market .
Or , you may want to test the waters online .
You can post about your business ideas and look at the response you get .
Obviously , if there ’s no response , then that ’s a clear sign your business is n’t going to be a hit .
Remember , you have to demonstrate your confidence when you present your business to investors .
Do n’t forget ; they ’re not just investing in the product .
They are investing and making sure they know you are confident will make that investment far more appealing .
Ability To Take Risks
Location Of Image
If you ’ve never taken a risk in your life , running and owning a business might not be the right decision .
As a business owner , you ’ll find you ’re in a position where you should take a risk at least once a year .
That might be to invest in a new product , expand your business or try a new form of marketing .
Even setting up a company in the first place is a risk and you should n’t underestimate it .
People often misconstrue a risk as being the same as a gamble .
But they ’re not the same at all , and we ’d never encourage business owners to gamble .
If you gamble , you ’re playing the odds .
If you take a risk , you ’ve calculated the pros and cons , making an informed decision .
One is a chance on fate , and the other is a business decision .
For instance , taking out a business loan is only a gamble if you do n’t look at the terms and conditions .
If you understand the interest rate and know when you ’ll need to pay it back , it ’s a risk .
Particularly , if you have calculated that based on your current rate of profit , you will be able to pay it back .
When you ’re looking for a business loan , you can use a company like Business Lender Match .
Ruling out the use of a resource like this completely is another piece of evidence that you ’re not ready to run a business .
There should be no absolutes when you ’re running a company .
At some point , you might find that you need a loan to keep your company profitable .
If you refuse to take one , you can put your company in the red and all because you ca n’t take a risk .
USP
Image URL
Easily one of the most crucial traits of a successful business is a USP .
USP stands for unique selling point .
It is something that separates you from the rest of the market , even your direct competition .
That could mean that you ’re selling a completely original product .
Or , it might mean that you ’ve found a fresh way to market an old product .
A new spin on an old idea is still a USP .
You might be wondering what the USP of your business idea is .
If you ’re wondering that , there ’s a good chance it does n’t have one .
That means you need to get creative and give your business a USP .
An example of a USP is augmented reality .
Alone , this is not a USP .
But what about if you ’re producing children ’s glasses ?
To the best of our knowledge , no company has a produced drink glasses that come alive in virtual space when a child uses them .
It ’s a cool idea and one that is sure to have marketing potential for big brands .
This is the type of trait that you need to think about .
Support
Link To Image
If you want your company to be a hit , you need a lot of support .
As we ’ve already mentioned , this , at least partially , comes down to how well you can promote it .
But it ’s also about whether or not you can convince investors to sign on the dotted line .
To get investors support , you need to know what they ’re looking for .
In most cases , they are interested in plans for the long term .
It ’s not enough to just think about what your company can offer right now .
You need to think about the future , at least five years ahead .
As well as this , investors are looking for growth potential .
When you discuss your business plan , make sure you tell them about ideas on how to expand .
This does n’t mean that you need to expand your company right away .
But letting them know the potential is there will certainly impress potential investors .
Brand Image
Image Source
Look at any successful business on the market now and they share one important detail .
They all have a brand that is easy to recognize .
Either we know the name , the look or the logo .
For instance , Disney , Marvel , Coca - Cola , Sony , all bring images to mind .
Either positive or negative , they are all instantly recognizable , and that ’s why your company needs to be .
You do need to spend a little time drawing up designs for your logo and trademarking key concepts .
However , it ’s not just about the image attached to your company .
You need to think about promotion as well .
It ’s perhaps not the best idea to look at how those companies built up their brand because the market has changed .
These days , the best way to build brand recognition is with viral media .
You need to do everything you can to get information about your business shared online .
To do this , you must connect with the target consumer and know how to create content that demands sharing .
There are plenty of great tips online for how to do this but , if you want the best , you need a marketing agency .
They are experts in this field and can all but guarantee your company gets the interest .
Pick your marketing agency carefully and make sure that they have a good track record with established companies .
Now you know the challenge you ’re facing , let ’s ask the question again .
Do you have what it takes to succeed ?
“ Real Olympic athletes who have spent their whole life waiting for this moment . ”
Although only athletes whose gender has been questioned will be tested in Beijing , the lab is a relic of an earlier Olympic era , when every female athlete was required to submit to a sex-verification test before competing in the Games .
The tests emerged in the 1960s , when the Soviet Union and other Communist countries were suspected of entering male athletes in women ’s events to gain an edge .
At first , women were asked to parade nude before a panel of doctors to verify their sex .
At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City , officials switched to a chromosomal test .
The tests never unmasked a man posing as a woman , but they did turn up several athletes who were born with genetic defects that made them appear  according to lab results , at least  to be men .
In 1967 , the Polish sprinter Ewa Klobukowska was barred from the sport because she failed the chromosomal test , even though she had passed the nude test a year earlier .
In the 1980s , the Spanish hurdler Maria José Martínez Patino was disqualified because the test revealed , to her surprise , that she was born with a Y chromosome .
Her eligibility was reinstated in 1988 .
The practice came under increasing criticism in the 1990s by doctors , scientists and athletes who argued that the tests were not just invasive , but were also bad science .
During the 1996 Atlanta Games , eight athletes failed the test , but all were later cleared of suspicion because it was determined that they had a birth defect that did not give them an unfair advantage .
“ It was an unethical , unscientific and discriminatory practice , ” said Arne Ljungqvist , the chairman of the International Olympic Committee ’s medical commission and one of the most outspoken critics of the testing .

There is not a child alive who dreams of being a project manager .
Maybe a firefighter , a rock star or an astronaut , but not a project manager ?
Nope .
There ’s something inherently dull about the words “ project ” and “ manager ” , the notions they generate make the flames of even the brightest imagination flicker and fade .
And it follows that in the professional world saying you are a project manager wo n’t get you much respect either .
To many being a PM means you fit this unfortunate stereotype : you were not good enough in your field to be an engineer or a programmer , and through politics and self - inflation , you find ways to take credit for the hard work done by others .
It stings , but that ’s the stereotype ( ask at your next happy hour with non PM friends ) .
Many
PMs unintentionally reinforce this view by trying to get everyone to pay attention to the work they do produce : the meta work of spreadsheets , specifications , presentations and status reports , failing to realize that to most in any organization , these are the least interesting and most bureaucratic things produced in the building .
This mismatch of value sends the PM and his / her team into a downward spiral : the PM asking for more and more respect in ways guaranteed to push people further away .
The core problem is perspective .
Our culture does not think of movie directors , executive chefs , astronauts , brain surgeons , or rock stars as project managers , despite the fact that much of what these cool , high profile occupations do is manage projects .
Everything is a project .
The difference is these individuals would never describe themselves primarily as project managers .
They ’d describe themselves as directors , architects or rock stars first , and as a projects manager or team leaders second .
They are committed first to the output , not the process .
And the perspective many PMs have is the opposite : they are committed first to the process , and their status in the process , not the output .
The result is that most of the world thinks of project management as BORING .
Not sure how it happened , but instead of thinking of the great moments in PM history , say the NASA space race , The D - Day invasion of Normandy , The construction of the pyramids , the Empire State building , or any of a thousand great things made possible only by someone ’s effective management of the project , people think of pocket protectors , overdesigned charts , epic status reports , and people who spend too much time in rooms filled exclusively with other project managers .
If you are not going out of your way to separate yourself from the stereotype , odds are good that when you say “ I ’m a project manager ” the person you are talking to puts you into a Dilbert cartoon in their mind , and you are the punchline .
People with job titles like “ Program Manager ” , “ Product Manager ” , “ Information Architect ” or “ Quality Assurance manager ” have similar problems .
These titles all makes it hard to relate to what it really is that the person gets paid to make happen : a sure sign of title inflation , confusion via over - specialization , or abstraction from the real work .
I suspect all of these folks have similar problems with getting respect from people when they introduce themselves with their literal job title ( process ) , instead of what it is they help make ( output ) .
The news is n’t all bad .
This lack of respect creates a huge opportunity for people with open minds : their expectations of you are low .
If you take the time to find out what it is that the people on the project need from you , or value from you , and make that as large a part of your job as possible , you ’ll get more respect than you expect .
And you may find that people start referring to you as a different kind of PM – one who has changed their opinion of what PMs can do for a team – and you ’ll earn not only their respect , but their trust and best work too .

Olinda is a new radio that has been built for BBC Audio & Music Interactive .
It includes innovative features like modularity and social networking in a physical device .
But we normally build websites and other digital media so why would we want to build a new radio ?
To actually have a device in the physical world ?
These are the three reasons I give ...
1. Physical things make people think differently and can help them better understand new concepts .
2 . The digital radio market in the UK is fairly mature and very successful but there is not a huge amount of innovation at the moment , we think there might be room for something that will help stimulate that market .
3 . Online radio is great but people still like to listen to the radio through actual radios .
So last year we commissioned a design and technology consultancy called Schulze and Webb to build a real , working , physical , innovative DAB radio .
It has two main features ; modularity - making the radio expandable - and social features - for discovering programmes and starting conversations .
At Radio Labs we have recently been thinking about how radio and social networking could work together , if you came to Futuresonic you may have heard us talk about it .
Olinda is one way that they could meet .
MODULARITY
Olinda is an extendable and customisable radio .
On the side of Olinda is a studded , magnetic connector for plugging in expansion modules .
This is an open , standardised hardware API - with defined connections and defined protocols for the data .
It 's a bit like the expansion port on an iPod , and this makes the radio modular .
It 's a hardware version of the APIs around websites like Flickr , del.icio.us or Twitter - which , by virtue of their APIs , are all surrounded by a rich ecosystem of supporting sites and products .
These plug - in modules for Olinda can use the API to find out information like which station the radio is tuned to and the current LiveText , and also lets them send instructions to the radio .
This enables anyone ; the manufacturer or third parties , to create add - on modules which should all work with any radios implementing this API .
And we think this could create a secondary market for DAB add - on products which will benefit both manufacturers and consumers .
A tear - off player module for kids .
It records all their favourite childrens ' radio progamming and then unplugs to become a standalone MP3 player .
A projector module that projects the station name and currently playing track details onto your ceiling .
SOCIAL NETWORKING HARDWARE
As part of the project Schulze & Webb have built a single module for the radio which uses the hardware API and proves that it works .
It 's a social module which includes wi-fi wireless networking and integrates radio listening with someone 's close friends , their immediate social network .
When you get the module you configure it to connect to your home wireless network and then you set it up with your friends .
You 'll notice in the pictures that there are slots for your friends - these are wipe - clean spaces for writing your friends ' names or sticking in a picture .
So each slot on the wireless is customised and configured to represent one of your friends .
And each slot has an associated combined light and button .
Then whenever they are listening to the radio their slot on your radio will light up .
And when you push the associated button your radio will show you what they are listening to .
And if you want to listen alongside them ?
Just push select and it tunes to the station - you 're now listening alongside your friend .
So we hope this might provide a sense of community around your radio , harking back to the times when families and friends used to gather around the radio to listen .
But Olinda provides this in a glance - able , non-intrusive manner .
And it will start to support conversations around radio programming and the discovery of new shows and stations .
Social networking for your radio .
The configuration and communications all happens on a website called Radio Pop .
It 's a prototype site we built last year and will shortly be re-launching as a more robust beta .
When you first turn on your Olinda radio you will be given a unique code for that radio .
You can enter that code on the Radio Pop site to associate that particular radio with your account .
From then on , whenever you use Olinda to listen to the radio it will update your Radio Pop account with that listening .
And when your friends listen to their Olinda radios , their data will be sent to Radio Pop and then on to your radio , causing those friend lights to turn on .
But , obviously I guess , it 's not just other Olinda radios that this will work with .
Anything compatible with Radio Pop will work with Olinda and vice - versa .
So if your friend is listening to BBC radio through the internet then their button on your radio will still light up .
INTERACTION DESIGN
We 've tried to use some of the expectations of people who are used to websites and interactive products in the design of the radio ; the station presets on this radio will be automatically generated .
The outer tuning ring lets you scroll through all the available radio stations .
The inner ring only scrolls through the stations that you listen to most .
And the radio should be suitable for its situation , so there are two screens .
There is a forward - facing screen for viewing information like the scrolling LiveText from across the room and a secondary screen for when you 're standing over the radio interacting with it .
The radio itself ended up being relatively visually conservative .
This is partly due to cost and partly because we did n't want to take anything away from the concepts and new ideas by making it look unlike a conventional radio .
SHARING IT
Olinda is a design prototype and we want to encourage development of these ideas and stimulate the potential market around Olinda , similar DAB radios and the modular add - ons .
Maybe it will eventually lead to some real products .
We feel that part of the role of the BBC is to encourage innovation like this and to maybe do things that others would n't consider .
So we are making all of the ideas and concepts behind Olinda available under a Creative Commons - type license - licenses that basically allow for sharing and remixing of the work , provided the original author is credited .
What we 're not doing is building a product for the BBC to sell .
The BBC grants any third party a fully paid - up , perpetual , worldwide , non-exclusive license to use , modify and sub-license all concepts , design elements and novel technical solutions in Olinda , provided such third party conspicuously and appropriately publishes on each copy an appropriate notice acknowledging the BBC and the copyright that it owns .
In non-legal terms : if you can see it , you 're more than welcome to it ( and please say thanks ) .
You can read lots more about Olinda and its associated ideas by downloading the pamphlet .
Or head over to Schulze & Webb to read more about how it was developed .
There is also a press pack for download ( warning : 85 MB ) .
Postscript : Olinda ?
It was named after a city in a novel by Italo Calvino .
We have since discovered it 's also a real city in Brazil .
Update : I just wanted to clarify that we are n't planning to ship CAD files or source code now that Olinda is out in the world .
Most of the heavy lifting in the radio is done by chips that are bought in , so publishing their code is n't possible .
We 'd love to see these ideas adopted by radio manufacturers , and part of being a good citizen in the industry is to work with them .
So the license is there to say ' go ahead ' to any manufacturer who wants to pick up the design elements , how the hardware API works , and the other solutions the radio demonstrates .
NEW YORK  Non-Orthodox
Jewish men are becoming alienated from their faith , a " crisis " that foreshadows a rise in interfaith marriages and secular generations , according to a new study from Brandeis University .
The findings , based on 300 interviews , report the rise of female leadership and participation in Reform , Reconstructionist and Conservative Judaism has prompted men to opt out of religious activities , in contrast to Orthodox Judaism , which still requires men for traditional worship and family life .
MAP AND MORE : See what Jews believe compared to others and where they live
" The past four decades have contradicted thousands of years where men were the primary ( leaders ) in terms of religious roles , " said Lindsey Fieldman , spokeswoman for the Hadassah - Brandeis Institute , which released the study this week .
With women currently outnumbering men in weekly non-Orthodox worship services , adult education classes , volunteer leadership positions and cultural events , the study concludes that non-Orthodox groups should create programs aimed specifically at engaging boys .
The earlier the better , the study reports , because alienated Jewish men are more likely to marry non-Jewish women , taking them and their children farther away from the synagogue .
" The Jewish community must intervene well before the marriage years if it hopes to have an impact , " the study reports .
" Not only does the presence of a Jewish mother in the home dramatically increases the likelihood that the children will be raised as Jews , her absence increases the likelihood that they will not . "
The Reform movement has struggled with its growing gender gap for years , stunned by a two - to - one ratio of women to men entering the rabbinical class in its Hebrew Union College in 2005 .
Last year , the movement launched a three - year campaign to address the problem , called " Where Have all the Young Men Gone ? "
Some of the imbalance can be blamed on American culture , which places higher values on women 's participation in religious and educational activities , and has caused similar struggles in churches across the country , said Jonathan Sarna , American Jewish history professor at Brandeis University .
" I do n't think we need a fancy Jewish explanation for what 's going on , " he said .
" Non-Orthodox Judaism is becoming more like American religion as a whole , which has been largely female . "
As a result , Sarna believes , Americans will begin seeing a marked increase in all - male activities sponsored by churches and synagogues , pausing or reversing efforts to raise the status of women in congregations .
" We 're going to see stronger efforts to bring back groups for men — clubs for men , services for men , sports teams and so on , " he said .
" It may not be fair ... but that 's the way it is . "

Senator Dodd – You are One of the Cops
Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - Ct. ) , in an interview on CNN this morning , referring to federal banking regulators , said that “ the cops were not on the beat . ”
Senator Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
Excuse me Senator , but you ’re one of the cops .
The regulators are enforcing the laws that you and your colleagues in congress write , using the funds that you approve as part of the budget .
Where were you when banking laws were systematically stripped so that the sub - prime market was created ?
Now you want to make us believe that you are riding in on your white horse by holding hearings about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Then in the same interview , you said that Senator Schumer has asked you to hold hearings on what happened at IndyMac .
After a letter Senator Schumer sent to regulators caused a run on the bank , which side will you have Senator Schumer sit on , the committee or witness side ?
It ’s time that you and your colleagues stopped grandstanding and accusing others and accept your role in the current economic mess .
You created the laws , or lack or laws and regulation that led to this sub - prime mess .
You have also sat in the senate all these years .
You have been a Senator since 1980 and before that and a Representative for six years .
Your tenure in the Senate is marked by failed energy policies and laws .
You came to the senate during the last gas crisis and yet have done nothing concrete to keep us from moving to 70 % imported oil today .
Senator Dodd , I have no doubt that you are a good man and dedicated to your country .
But , now is the time for people in positions of power , such as yourself , to step up and admit that you have failed the American people and fix it .
Stop blaming others and focus the resources of our great nation on healing its wounds .
Until congress recognizes their role in creating our current economic mess we are doomed to repeat it again and again .
Just one more thought – Senator McCain and Senator Obama are part of problems in the senate .
If they fail in their presidential bid , they will be right back to do more damage .
What do you think either can do as president or senator under the current political bottleneck of partisan politics .
The congressional approval rating is in single digits .
It ’s no wonder why .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Bush administration has decided to break with previous policy by sending one of its most senior diplomats to engage Iran 's top nuclear official , the White House announced Wednesday .
The move could dramatically alter the three - decade stand - off between the U.S. and Iran .
Some western nations and Israel suspect Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons and want Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran says it wants to develop nuclear power to produce electricity .
Undersecretary of State William Burns will accompany a European Union delegation during a meeting with Saeed Jalili , Iran 's top nuclear official , in Switzerland on Saturday , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
The delegation meeting with the Iranians will be led by the European Union 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana .
The delegates will discuss an incentives program meant to encourage the Islamic republic to drop its nuclear enrichment program , Perino said .
Watch Amanpour report on the U.S. decision to send Burns »
The U.S. decision to attend the talks is not " linked in any way " to Iran 's missile tests last week , a senior administration official told CNN .
The official said the meeting " had been pending before " the tests occurred .
See why the U.S. is worried about Iran 's missiles »
But State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters Wednesday that the president and his national security team decided only recently to send Burns to the meeting .
Perino said the " one time " participation of the United States in the meeting is meant to show the United States and other permanent members of the United Nation 's Security Council are united in the " long standing principle that Iran -- in order to take advantage of the incentives package that was quite generous -- has to halt its nuclear enrichment . "
Watch why the White House is sending an envoy »
A group dubbed the " P5 + 1 , " which consists of representatives from the permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States , Britain , France , China , and Russia -- and Germany , has been negotiating over Iran 's controversial nuclear program .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice " believes it 's a smart step to take .
There is no change in the substance but it sends a strong signal , " McCormack said .
" It sends a strong signal to our P5+1 partners .
It sends a strong signal to the world .
It sends a strong signal to the Iranian government that the United States is committed to diplomacy , to finding a diplomatic solution to this issue . "
McCormack said Burns will be under strict orders to listen to what Iran has to say but not engage in one - on - one discussions with the Iranian negotiator .
Burns will also hammer home the point that any direct talks between the United States and Iran will occur only after Iran suspends its enrichment program , McCormick said .
" Iran needs to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing related activities .
Should they take that single step , the United States and its partners in the P5+1 will meet with the Iranian delegation any time , any place , anywhere to talk about a variety ... of subjects , but certainly our focus will be on the Iranian nuclear program , " McCormack said .
McCormack brushed aside criticism that the United States is giving up too much to Iran .
" Is this a new tactic ?
Yes .
Does it send a signal ?
Yes .
Is the substance [ of the U.S. position ] any different ?
No , " McCormack said .
Presidential candidate Sen. John McCain , who has said he would n't negotiate face - to - face with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad without conditions , said Wednesday he had " no problem ... whatsoever " with sending Burns to Saturday 's meeting with Jalili .
" We have many negotiations with many countries ... throughout the world , " McCain told reporters in Nebraska , noting the U.S. ambassador to Iraq previously met with an Iranian ambassador in Iraq .
However , McCain repeated that he would n't meet Ahmadinejad unconditionally , noting the U.S. considers Iran a sponsor of terrorism .
" To sit down without any preconditions with a state sponsor of terror would be a mistake , " McCain said .
CNN 's Charley Keyes , Zain Verjee and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report .

DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) -
While all eyes are on the heavyweight Democratic bout in Iowa between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , a revamped John Edwards is looking to steal the presidential campaign ’s first big prize .
Edwards , the former North Carolina senator , has eased off his attacks on rivals , dusted off the populist rhetoric of his 2004 race and primed his campaign for the sort of late charge that carried him to a strong second - place finish in Iowa four years ago .
He trails his big - name rivals in most state polls but is close enough for the race to be considered a three - way toss - up in Iowa , which on January 3 kicks off the state - by - state battle to choose candidates for the November 2008 election .
Edwards probably needs a win or a strong second to stay in the race .
Either would dramatically reshape a Democratic contest dominated for months by the showdown between Clinton , a New York senator , and Obama , an Illinois senator .
“ When the caucus - goers in Iowa rise up , there is going to be a wave across America that absolutely nobody can stop , ” Edwards said at a recent rally in Des Moines .
Edwards had been the most aggressive of the leading Democrats during the summer and fall , going after Clinton when she refused to forgo donations from lobbyists and questioning Obama ’s ability to fight special interests .
But he has eased up on his criticism as the battle between Clinton and Obama heats up , hoping perhaps to benefit by standing aside while his two rivals slice each other up .
He has returned instead to the populist themes that drove his 2004 presidential campaign , promising to fight for everyday Americans and take on the corporate interests he says have Washington by the throat .
‘ TAKE THIS DEMOCRACY BACK ’
“ When they give up their power is when we take their power away from them , ” he said of corporate interests , condemning “ big drug companies , big oil companies and big insurance companies . ”
“ We have to take this democracy back . ”
Edwards also touts his electability , citing a CNN poll showing he would fare the best of any Democrat against a Republican in the general election and reminding voters of his roots in the Republican - leaning rural South .
“ I ’m the candidate on our side who grew up in small - town rural America , ” he told reporters .
“ Democratic presidential candidates have to be able to compete in those places to be successful . ”
Polls show Edwards ’ supports are among the most dedicated in the presidential race .
“ He ’s for the middle class and trying to take back some of the power for the people , ” said Virginia Bowen , 69 , a retired computer support technician .
“ I believe he believes what he says .
I do n’t think he ’s saying it just to get elected . ”
Sister Jeanie Hagedorn , a Catholic nun from Des Moines , said she was still undecided but was drawn to Edwards for his sympathy for everyday people .
“ Edwards ’s appeal is that he is the voice of the people , ” she said .
“ The middle class and the poor are getting left behind and until we address that , we ’re in trouble . ”
Even with an Iowa win , Edwards would face a long campaign fight in other states that he would wage with far less money than either Clinton or Obama .
But he enters the Iowa battle with several advantages , including a long history in the state spanning his second - place finish in 2004 , visits as the Democratic vice presidential candidate and continued campaigning in the past three years .
“ He has worked the state hard for six years and he has considerable political talents , ” said Gordon Fischer , a former state Democratic Party chairman and now an Obama supporter .
Edwards also has strong union help and heavy support in rural areas , an advantage under caucus rules that give some rural precincts nearly as much clout as more populated ones .
Edwards has frequently campaigned in the rural areas of the state and stresses his rural upbringing in North Carolina .
Obama has responded in the past few weeks with his own bus tours to build rural strength .
“ The message of fighting for change cuts across ideological and partisan political lines so I think I can carry that message any place in America , ” Edwards said .

When the three robbers in the car ( Grumpy , Chuckles , and Bozo / The Joker ) enter the bank , Grumpy fires a shot in the air .
Watch closely when Grumpy grabs a male teller saying " Let 's go pal , I 'm making a withdrawal here . "
In the background , Chuckles grabs the police officer standing near the entrance , drags him to a counter , and hits him in the back , which causes the cop to collapse .
Apparently one hit to the back is n't enough , because just before the manager shoots Chuckles , the hit on the back is repeated .

Subject : Supporting one 's opinion with sustained fully automatic weapons fire .
I had recent occasion to view your Presentation Announcement on care and feeding of automatic weapons during lecture hall .
I found it most amusing .
I would very much like to see and / or contribute future material .
We have similar problems here at Berkeley , though it has been difficult to wean our students away from more the more mundane assortment of Browning Hi-Power 's , Beretta 92SBF 's and Sig - Sauer P226's .
The 9 mm clique is pretty strong here , and the young grad students fairly parsimonious .
They tend to balk at the idea of spending enough money on ammo to make full auto firefights practical .
Lately , they 've taken to sniping at each other from the Campanile tower and engaging in loose hit - and - run guerrilla tactics during finals .
This is obviously not the American Way and needs to be changed .
While I 've been able to slowly wean them into more progressive arms ( such as the Beretta 93 R and an occasional mini-uzi ) , I still can't seem to get past the supply problem .
My questions are : " Do you buy your ammo in bulk , or do appointed individuals do shifts on a progressive reloader ? "
" Does the school pay for this ? "
Thank you .

When we reported about the leak of a BuckCherry track last week , and specifically the band 's response to it , we hinted that this could be a covert form of self - promotion .
Indeed , after a few days of research we found out that the track was n't leaked by pirates , but by Josh Klemme , the manager of the band .
When BuckCherry found out that their latest single had leaked on BitTorrent , they did n’t try to cover this up , or take the file down .
No , instead , they issued a press release ( update : the press release has been removed , Google cache ) , where they stated : “ Honestly , we hate it when this s*** happens , because we want our FANS to have any new songs first . ”
This is strange to say the least .
Not only because their label , Atlantic Records , is known to release ( and spam ) tracks for free on BitTorrent sites , but also because the press release was more about promoting the band than the actual leak .
Without any hard evidence , we suggested that this leak may have been set up to get some free promotion and publicity , which BuckCherry seems to need .
Out of curiosity , we decided to follow this up , to see if this was indeed the case .
With some help of a user in the community , we tracked down some of the initial seeders of the torrent .
A BitTorrent site insider was kind enough to help us out , because BitTorrent is not supposed to be “ abused ” like this , and confirmed that the IP of one of the early seeders did indeed belong to the person who uploaded the torrent file .
It turns out that the uploader , a New York resident , had only uploaded one torrent , the BuckCherry track .
When we entered the IP - address into the Wiki- scanner , we found out that the person in question had edited the BuckCherry wikipedia entry , and added the name of the band manager to another page .
This confirmed our suspicions , but it was not quite enough , since it could be an overly obsessed fan ( if they have fans ) .
So , we decided to send the band manager , Josh Klemme – who happens to live in New York – an email to ask for his opinion on our findings .
Klemme , replied to our email within a few hours , and surprisingly enough his IP - address was the same as the uploader .
Epic fail ….
Unfortunately Klemme only replied once , and ignored all further requests to comment on this issue .
However , the press release , sent out by Atlantic Records and BuckCherry , seems to be a promotional stunt .
It could be that the manager acted on his own , and that the band and the record label were not not in on this , but that ’s less plausible .
Klemme has been caught with his pants down , and he will probably think twice before he tries to pull off a stunt like this again .
A song does n’t leak by itself and pirates do n’t have some sort of superhuman ability to get their hands on pre-release material .
No , most leaked movies , TV - shows and albums come from the inside so blaming pirates is useless .
Of course , it ’s great that BuckCherry can get some free promotion for the band using BitTorrent , and we encourage everyone to promote their band or movie via this great system too .
But would n’t it be more constructive if bands embraced the technology and admitted it , instead of playing the injured party and giving the protocol a bad image , just to boost their own ?
There ’s a great opportunity here , do n’t waste it .

But would n't it be just dandy if that black box would draw a nice hot bath , too ?
Actually , domestic woodstove water heating is nothing new . . . many cookstoves had water - tank attachments more than a century ago .
The advent of the " airtight " woodburner and pressurized water systems has left most of those old batch - heating techniques by the wayside , though , and new methods based on closed circulation have been developed .
Modern Woodstove Water Heating
The majority of water - warming attachments employ heat exchangers that are fitted inside the firebox or the chimney of the appliance .
The best commercial examples of this approach work very well indeed .
If the stove is run most of the day , they can supply a whole family 's hot water .
For safety 's sake , however , these devices are usually made from stainless steel ( an expensive commodity ) and must be pressure - tested to insure that they are able to withstand the very high temperatures they may encounter inside the heating system .
As a consequence , quality internal heat exchangers carry pretty hefty price tags .
Homemade internal devices , on the other hand , have developed a nasty reputation for scalding steam explosions .
Furthermore , extracting heat from either the firebox or the chimney of a woodstove can have unfortunate side effects : Pulling Btu directly from the fire ( with a firebox exchanger ) can reduce combustion efficiency . . . and if the products of incomplete combustion are cooled below the temperature at which they condense ( by either a firebox or a chimney heat exchanger ) , heavy creosote accumulation may occur .
There is doubtless no need to mention that the combination of a chimney fire and an internal , water - filled heat exchanger can spell disaster .

Sensible Design
Recognizing the fact that there is no uncompensated noon repast , we adopted a conservative approach to designing our own water - heating attachment for a woodstove .
Rather than chance placing an exchanger inside the heater or stack , we attached one to the outside of the firebox .
By taking this tack , we avoided making any major modifications to the heater , which maintains Underwriters ' Laboratory certification .
What 's more , a couple of safety criteria that we 've already mentioned are met :
The temperatures encountered outside the heater 's skin wo n't boil water ( as long as that liquid 's kept circulating ) , and the heat used to warm the water is that which would have been radiated by the heater anyway , so no extra heat is being removed from the firebox .
Our water - heating attachment consists simply of about 50 feet of 1/4 " copper tubing coiled into a plaster of paris - filled panel .
The gypsum - based material helps distribute heat evenly to the coils and allows the exchanger to be in direct contact with the stove body without chancing overheating .
( We 'd like to thank Ed Walkinstik for this suggestion . )
The assembly bolts to the side of the heater and is plumbed into a salvaged 42 - gallon water heater ( we used one with a burned - out element but a sound tank ) in much the same fashion as would be a solar preheater .
If you have not already seen The Dark Knight , then you should read this post at a later time as to avoid spoilers after the jump .
Otherwise , follow the jump for a game theoretic discussion derived from the movie that has already broken two box office records for both best midnight opening and top first day revenue .
I personally enjoyed the movie immensely , but that discussion does not follow .
So , officially , consider this a spoiler alert for what follows .
I am sure there were plenty of other individuals who immediately conceptualized parts of the movie in game theoretic terms as one ’s mind is prone to do after sufficient indoctrination ; however , after discussing the scenario with Julie for a bit , it seemed to be appropriate blog material and worth formalizing .
Without further introduction ( as I am assuming you have already seen the movie ) , we can begin :
The Story
The Joker ’s final act as criminal mastermind and agent of nihilism ( or , seemingly , to show Gotham city that we are all Homo Economicus when the structure of the game forces us to be ) involves two ferries filled with people .
The first ferry is filled with normal , law abiding citizens while the second ferry is filled with the population of Gotham Prison .
The Joker , doing so without prior knowledge of the passengers and city officials , wired the ships with powerful explosives such that their explosion would destroy the entire ship and everyone aboard .
No single individual is allowed to escape .
Each ship is given a detonator for the other ferry .
The use of the detonator saves the ship while killing everyone aboard the opposing ship .
Thus , if any member of Ship A pushes the detonator , then Ship B is destroyed and all of Ship A is saved .
Additionally , if either ship fails to use the detonator to destroy its opponent , then both ships will be destroyed by the Joker .
Assuming that the actors must make their decision simultaneously , this would lead to the following game :
Solving this game is pretty straightforward and ( detonation , detonation ) becomes the dominant strategy as , at best , cooperation is weakly dominated .
Thus , homo economicus and politicus have a very clear strategy to , without fail , destroy their opponents , and in so doing , both will ships will be destroyed .
However , in Gotham City , this does not happen – nor would it necessarily happen in a laboratory experiment either as a few more complications are introduced into the game .
First , the game appears to be pseudo - sequential or , perhaps , a series of simultaneous game with a finite end .
The Joker gives both ferries 30 minutes in which they can detonate the other side .
Even with this complication , the outcome should be the same and both actors ought to choose detonation at the first node ( that is , t =1 or when the first move is available ) .
Using backwards deduction , both players recognize that their opponent will choose to detonate in the final iteration even if there are some gains to short - term cooperation .
This effect cascades backwards to the initial decision node and mutual detonation occurs to prevent receiving the sucker ’s payout of cooperating while the opponent defects .
Decision Rules
Beyond this , it appears that the decision making process for both ships is different .
In the ship containing prisoners , the decision to detonate becomes decentralized and any one actor willing to grab the detonator could do so .
While the armed guards gives the opposite impression of clear authoritarianism , Decentralization becomes apparent as the time moves on .
Thus , decentralized decision making should lead to the optimal play as any single individual among the 500 or more sub-actors should have a preference for survival .
On the civilian ship , the decision mechanism becomes a simple majority vote .
When the votes are aggregated , the decision to detonate the other ferry is chosen at a rate of almost 3 to 1 .
Yet , there is no executive to carry out the decision and the majority will does not prevail as no single sub-actor is willing to push the button .
This psychological separation between deference of active responsibility ( voting to kill others ) versus carrying out the task , has been illuminated in some experimental settings as shown in the video Julie blogged about previously .
The civilians act rationally as long as they , individually , are not too involved in carrying out a potentially morally reprehensible act .
Morality ?
Perhaps social norms mattered for the actors in the game ?
In the second game , we can assume that there are some social benefits from being a moral agent ; however , being moral is not as beneficial as being alive .
Since survival trumps morality , we get the second game :
As Yev Kirpichevsky notes in his comment , the pure strategy equilibria are {cooperate - detonate} and {detonate - cooperate} with a Mixed Nash Equilibrium of playing cooperation and detonation with a probability of .5 for both players with this specification ( this would change depending on how we parametrize the value for being moral and the value for surviving ) .
Perhaps , then , we saw the cooperate , cooperate cell ( with probability .25 ) in the movie and if we watched the movie infinite more times , we would see a nice distribution where cooperate - cooperate occurs 25 % of the time , both ships defect 25 % of the time , and only one ship explodes 50 % of the time .
I plan on seeing the movie again , and I will let you know if the outcome of this scene changes .
However , this is not the full specification of the game , let ’s assume that the parameters allow for morality to trump survival :
The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is to never detonate as cooperation is always more beneficial than destroying the other ship .
While both specifications may be able to explain the movie , I think there might be a fourth game that explains the game the best .
The Joker Misspecified his Game ?
While not the moral of the story that Batman wants the Joker or Gotham City to learn ( he tells the audience and the Joker that people are not all evil – there is some good in Gotham ) , adding an additional parameter to the game can easily induce a cooperation solution .
If the people aboard both ships believe that the cost of dying is probabilistic , then they would cooperate as long as the benefit to cooperating trumped both the probabilistic chance of punishment and the likelihood that the other ship decides to detonate .
Thus , each ship has to calculate the value for morality ( m ) minus the cost of punishment P( c ) and the cost of the other ship defecting P ( dx ) ( d ) where x is the other actor .
The cost of opponent defection and punishment are the same ( the value of survival ) , so the equation reduces to :
U( Ship A ) = M – ( Pc + P ( dB ) ) * ( S ) U( Ship B ) = M – ( Pc + P ( dA ) ) * ( S )
Each equation must still be greater than the value of Survival Minus the Cost of morality such that for Ship A ( or B with appropriate substitution ) :
S – M < M – ( Pc + P ( dB ) ) *
S
If M = S , then the joint probability of punishment and opponent detonation must be less than 1 for cooperation to be preferred , else defection dominates .
As M and S vary in relation to each then , the threshold for the joint probabilities to make a preference in strategy changes .
Note , if the value for M is zero for the observed actor and survival is infinitesimal greater than 0 , detonation dominates .
Likewise , if we build in opponent morality into the probability of opponent detonation , and opponent morality is zero , then the cost of morality becomes too high .
Obviously , the game becomes increasingly complicated as parameters are made endogenous .
The actors must determine a subjective probability of the game being false : that is , the probability of punishment is not 1 .
The probability of punishment could go down from 100 % if the passengers believe that the Joker is lying about the deadline , if they think there is a chance of technological failure , that their detonator may indeed destroy their own ship ( adding a hidden cost to detonation ) , or if they live in a world with Batman .
I would venture forth the assumption that the probability of punishment is inversely proportional to the probability that Batman exists with some modification based on his likelihood of failing to save people — but that is just me .
There are a few other situations in this movie that are prone to game theoretic applications and I have not exhausted the ways in which this game could be modeled .
However , I think this calls for a new villian in the third movie of the trilogy : The Game Theorist .
Much like the riddler , but deadlier and requiring Batman to use mathematics to fight crime .

No object in space is more mysterious — and more psychologically menacing — than a black hole .
Once known as a frozen star , a black hole is formed when a massive star burns out and collapses upon itself , ultimately producing gravitational energy so powerful that not even light can escape from it .
Although physicists can infer the existence of black holes in space , they cannot directly observe them .
Yet making mini black holes may be possible when the world ’s largest particle accelerator — the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) — goes online outside Geneva , Switzerland .
At the heart of the new machine is a phenomenal 17 - mile circular tunnel where particles will smash together at nearly the speed of light , producing temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the core of the sun .
Physicists will observe the collisions not only for clues to fundamental constituents of matter , hidden dimensions , and the elusive Higgs boson — the hypothetical particle that gives matter its heft — but also for tiny black holes winking in and out of existence .
But a couple of Jeremiahs would halt the fireworks before they begin .
A lawsuit filed in U.S. district court in Honolulu seeks to halt the opening of the accelerator , which is funded in part by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation .
A similar suit was filed in 2000 against the Brookhaven National Laboratory to prevent the operation of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , an accelerator that started up that year .
The charge , then as now , is that microscopic black holes produced at the collider might coalesce and engulf the earth , ending all life as we know it .
LHC scientists have publicly dismissed the lawsuit as bunkum while quietly double - checking their math just to be sure .
DISCOVER asked Brown University physicist Greg Landsberg , who is involved in experiments at the LHC , if we should lose any sleep over the matter .
First off , how might microscopic black holes be produced at the LHC ?
When too much matter is put into too small a space , it collapses under its own gravity and forms a black hole .
That ’s what is happening when astronomical black holes are formed .
Now , the LHC does n’t really create much matter , but it does put a lot of energy in a very small volume , and Einstein showed that for a moving particle , the energy , not the mass , governs gravitational attraction .
You might create black holes at the LHC when two particles pass very close to each other , if the gravitational interaction between them is strong enough .
But this is possible only in certain models that predict the existence of extra dimensions .
What is the connection between extra dimensions and black holes ?
Black hole production requires a strong gravitational attraction .
But gravity is much weaker than other forces , such as electromagnetism .
One way of remedying this problem is to assume the existence of extra dimensions in space accessible to the carrier of gravitational force — called the graviton — but not accessible to other particles , such as quarks , electrons , and photons .
If this is the case , gravity may be fundamentally strong but still appear weak to us , as the gravitons spend most of their time in the extra space and rarely cross into our world .
Imagine a very long and thin straw .
If you are observing it from far away , you do n’t really resolve the fact that the straw has the second curled - up dimension , its circumference .
The straw appears to you as a line — that is , one - dimensional .
However , if you approach the straw at a distance comparable to its radius , you would start resolving its second dimension and see that it is truly two - dimensional .
Pretty much the same way , when two particles are close to one another , they start feeling gravity from extra dimensions and thus feel the true , undiluted gravitational pull .
That ’s basically the framework in which it turns out that black hole production at the LHC is a possibility .
But one should understand that this is just one model .
Whether it ’s true or not is anybody ’s guess .
How would microscopic black holes be observed ?
They would emit light that is much , much hotter than , say , light coming from the stars or sun , because their temperature is many orders of magnitude greater .
They would emit high - energy gamma rays , and they could emit all sorts of species of particles , such as electrons and muons , that we could detect .
Can we be sure that a black hole created at the LHC would n’t expand and swallow the earth ?
I think the honest answer to this question is yes .
The black holes that would be produced at the LHC must also be produced by the hundreds every day due to energetic cosmic rays bombarding our earth .
When cosmic rays smash into particles of earth material , it ’s the same type of collision that happens in the LHC .
So the very fact that we exist here on earth to talk about these things tells us that even if black holes are produced , pretty much everything is very safe .
Either black holes are not produced at all , or they decay very , very quickly due to Hawking radiation or an equivalent mechanism .
What exactly is Hawking radiation ?
Stephen Hawking showed in the early 1970s that black holes are not completely black .
They have a slight tint of gray , if you will .
That means black holes do not just suck everything in — or accrete , as they call it scientifically — but in fact they must radiate some energy out .
This process is known as Hawking radiation .
The intensity of Hawking radiation is determined by the temperature of the black hole .
The higher it is , the more intense the radiation is , just like a hot bar of metal emits much more heat than a cold one .
Now it turns out that the temperature of the black hole is inversely proportional to its mass .
The more massive a black hole , the cooler it is .
Thus small black holes are very hot and radiate a lot , while large , astronomical black holes are extremely cold and barely radiate at all .
The black holes found in the universe are so cold that it takes forever for them to evaporate , many orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe .
By contrast , black holes at the LHC would live only a fraction of a second before they radiate their mass away .
This is not long enough for them to accrete anything before they disappear in a blast of radiation .
These black holes would evaporate almost instantaneously , without moving by more than the size of the atomic nucleus .
Is it possible to quantify the chance of something catastrophic occurring at the LHC ?
The probability is never equal to zero in quantum mechanics , but you do n’t worry about it if the probability is very small .
There is some probability that all the air molecules in your room will suddenly cross over and end up on one half of the room and you wo n’t be able to breathe .
But we are talking about risk management here , and I think people should be worried about probabilities that are large .
If black holes are detected at the LHC , what would it mean for physics ?
Above all , it would probably help us build a quantum theory of gravity , the one force that has n’t really been explained by quantum mechanics .
We have very little understanding of what the quantum theory of gravity looks like , and producing these black holes at the LHC would probably be as close as you could get to approaching the answer to this question .
July 27 , 2008 --
From the first day it appeared online , Climate and Capitalism ’s masthead has carried the slogan “ Ecosocialism or Barbarism : there is no third way . ”
We ’ve been quite clear that ecosocialism is not a new theory or brand of socialism — it is socialism with Marx ’s important insights on ecology restored , socialism committed to the fight against ecological destruction .
But why do we say that the alternative to ecosocialism is barbarism ?
Marxists have used the word “ barbarism ” in various ways , but most often to describe actions or social conditions that are grossly inhumane , brutal , and violent .
It is not a word we use lightly , because it implies not just bad behaviour but violations of the most important norms of human solidarity and civilised life . [ 1 ]
The slogan “ Socialism or Barbarism ” originated with the great German revolutionary socialist leader Rosa Luxemburg , who repeatedly raised it during World War I .
It was a profound concept , one that has become ever more relevant as the years have passed .
Rosa Luxemburg spent her entire adult life organising and educating the working class to fight for socialism .
She was convinced that if socialism did n’t triumph , capitalism would become ever more barbaric , wiping out centuries of gains in civilisation .
In a major 1915 antiwar polemic , she referred to Friedrich Engels ’ view that society must advance to socialism or revert to barbarism and then asked , “ What does a ‘ reversion to barbarism ’ mean at the present stage of European civilisation ? ”
She gave two related answers .
In the long run , she said , a continuation of capitalism would lead to the literal collapse of civilised society and the coming of a new Dark Age , similar to Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire : “ The collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome , depopulation , desolation , degeneration — a great cemetery . ” ( The Junius Pamphlet ) [ 2 ]
By saying this , Rosa Luxemburg was reminding the revolutionary left that socialism is not inevitable , that if the socialist movement failed , capitalism might destroy modern civilisation , leaving behind a much poorer and much harsher world .
That was n’t a new concept – it has been part of Marxist thought from its very beginning .
In 1848 , in The Communist Manifesto , Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote :
“ The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles … that each time ended , either in the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes . ”
In Luxemburg ’s words : “ Humanity is facing the alternative : Dissolution and downfall in capitalist anarchy , or regeneration through the social revolution . ”
( A Call to the Workers of the World )
Capitalism ’s two faces
But Luxemburg , again following the example of Marx and Engels , also used the term “ barbarism ” another way , to contrast capitalism ’s loudly proclaimed noble ideals with its actual practice of torture , starvation , murder and war .
Marx many times described the two - sided nature of capitalist “ progress ” .
In 1853 , writing about British rule in India , he described the “ profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilisation [ that ] lies unveiled before our eyes , turning from its home , where it assumes respectable forms , to the colonies , where it goes naked . ”
Capitalist progress , he said , resembled a “ hideous , pagan idol , who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain . ”
( The Future Results of British Rule in India )
Similarly , in a speech to radical workers in London in 1856 , he said :
“ On the one hand , there have started into life industrial and scientific forces , which no epoch of the former human history had ever suspected .
On the other hand , there exist symptoms of decay , far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the Roman Empire . ”
( Speech at the Anniversary of the People ’s Paper )
Immense improvements to the human condition have been made under capitalism — in health , culture , philosophy , literature , music and more .
But capitalism has also led to starvation , destitution , mass violence , torture and even genocide — all on an unprecedented scale .
As capitalism has expanded and aged , the barbarous side of its nature has come ever more to the fore .
Bourgeois society , which came to power promising equality , democracy and human rights , has never had any compunction about throwing those ideals overboard to expand and protect its wealth and profits .
That ’s the view of barbarism that Rosa Luxemburg was primarily concerned about during World War I .
She wrote :
“ Shamed , dishonoured , wading in blood and dripping in filth , this capitalist society stands .
Not as we usually see it , playing the roles of peace and righteousness , of order , of philosophy , of ethics — as a roaring beast , as an orgy of anarchy , as pestilential breath , devastating culture and humanity — so it appears in all its hideous nakedness …
“ A look around us at this moment shows what the regression of bourgeois society into barbarism means .
This world war is a regression into barbarism . ”
( The Junius Pamphlet )
For Luxemburg , barbarism was n’t a future possibility .
It was the present reality of imperialism , a reality that was destined to get much worse if socialism failed to stop it .
Tragically , she was proven correct .
The defeat of the German revolutions of 1917 to 1923 , coupled with the isolation and degeneration of the Russian Revolution , opened the way to a century of genocide and constant war .
In 1933 , Leon Trotsky described the rise of fascism as “ capitalist society … puking up undigested barbarism ” .
( What is National Socialism ? )
Later he wrote : “ The delay of the socialist revolution engenders the indubitable phenomena of barbarism — chronic unemployment , pauperization of the petty bourgeoisie , fascism , finally wars of extermination which do not open up any new road . ”
( In Defense of Marxism )
More than 250 million people , most of them civilians , were killed in the wars of extermination and mass atrocities of the 20th Century .
This century continues that record : in less than eight years over three million people have died in wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Third World , and at least 700,000 have died in “ natural ” disasters .
As Luxemburg and Trotsky warned , barbarism is already upon us .
Only mass action can stop barbarism from advancing , and only socialism can definitively defeat it .
Their call to action is even more important today , when capitalism has added massive ecological destruction , primarily affecting the poor , to the wars and other horrors of the 20th century .
21st century barbarism
That view has been expressed repeatedly and forcefully by Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez .
Speaking in Vienna in May 2006 , he referred explicitly to Luxemburg ’s words :
“ The choice before humanity is socialism or barbarism . …
When Rosa Luxemburg made this statement , she was speaking of a relatively distant future .
But now the situation of the world is so bad that the threat to the human race is not in the future , but now . ” [ 3 ]
A few months earlier , in Caracas , he argued that capitalism ’s destruction of the environment gives particular urgency to the fight against barbarism today :
“ I was remembering Karl Marx and Rosa Luxemburg and the phrase that each one of them , in their particular time and context put forward ; the dilemma ‘ socialism or barbarism . ’ …
“ I believe it is time that we take up with courage and clarity a political , social , collective and ideological offensive across the world — a real offensive that permits us to move progressively , over the next years , the next decades , leaving behind the perverse , destructive , destroyer , capitalist model and go forward in constructing the socialist model to avoid barbarism and beyond that the annihilation of life on this planet .
“ I believe this idea has a strong connection with reality .
I do n’t think we have much time .
Fidel Castro said in one of his speeches I read not so long ago , “ tomorrow could be too late , let ’s do now what we need to do . ”
I do n’t believe that this is an exaggeration .
The environment is suffering damage that could be irreversible — global warming , the greenhouse effect , the melting of the polar ice caps , the rising sea level , hurricanes — with terrible social occurrences that will shake life on this planet . ” [ 4 ]
Chavez and the revolutionary Bolivarian movement in Venezuela have proudly raised the banner of ``21st Century Socialism '' to describe their goals .
As these comments show , they are also raising a warning flag , that the alternative to socialism is 21st century barbarism — the barbarism of the previous century amplified and intensified by ecological crisis .
Climate change and ‘ barbarisation ’
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has been studying and reporting on climate change for two decades .
Recently the vice - chair of the IPCC , Professor Mohan Munasinghe , gave a lecture at Cambridge University that described “ a dystopic possible future world in which social problems are made much worse by the environmental consequences of rising greenhouse gas emissions . ”
He said : “ Climate change is , or could be , the additional factor which will exacerbate the existing problems of poverty , environmental degradation , social polarisation and terrorism and it could lead to a very chaotic situation . ”
“ Barbarisation ” , Munasinghe said , is already underway .
We face “ a situation where the rich live in enclaves , protected , and the poor live outside in unsustainable conditions . ” [ 5 ]
A common criticism of the IPCC is that its reports are too conservative , that it understates how fast climate change is occurring and how disastrous the effects may be .
So when the vice - chair of the IPCC says that “ barbarisation ” is already happening , no one should suggest that it ’s an exaggeration .
The present reality of barbarism
The idea of 21st century barbarism may seem farfetched .
Even with food and fuel inflation , growing unemployment and housing crises , many working people in the advanced capitalist countries still enjoy a considerable degree of comfort and security .
But outside the protected enclaves of the global north , the reality of “ barbarisation ” is all too evident .
2.5 billion people , nearly half of the world ’s population , survive on less than two dollars a day .
Over 850 million people are chronically undernourished and three times that many frequently go hungry .
Every hour of every day , 180 children die of hunger and 1200 die of preventable diseases .
Over half a million women die every year from complications of pregnancy and childbirth .
99 % of them are in the global south .
Over a billion people live in vast urban slums , without sanitation , sufficient living space , or durable housing .
1.3 billion people have no safe water .
3 million die of water - related diseases every year .
The United Nations Human Development Report 2007 - 2008 warns that unmitigated climate change will lock the world ’s poorest countries and their poorest citizens in a downward spiral , leaving hundreds of millions facing malnutrition , water scarcity , ecological threats and a loss of livelihoods . [ 6 ]
In UNDP Administrator Kemal Dervi ’s words : “ Ultimately , climate change is a threat to humanity as a whole .
But it is the poor , a constituency with no responsibility for the ecological debt we are running up , who face the immediate and most severe human costs . ” [ 7 ]
Among the 21st century threats identified by the Human Development Report :
The breakdown of agricultural systems as a result of increased exposure to drought , rising temperatures , and more erratic rainfall , leaving up to 600 million more people facing malnutrition .
An additional 1.8 billion people facing water stress by 2080 , with large areas of South Asia and northern China facing a grave ecological crisis as a result of glacial retreat and changed rainfall patterns .
Displacement through flooding and tropical storm activity of up to 332 million people in coastal and low - lying areas .
Over 70 million Bangladeshis , 22 million Vietnamese , and six million Egyptians could be affected by global warming - related flooding .
Expanding health risks , including up to 400 million more people facing the risk of malaria .
To these we can add the certainty that at least 100 million people will be added to the ranks of the permanently hungry this year as a result of food price inflation .
In the UN report , former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu echoes Munasinghe ’s prediction of protected enclaves for the rich within a world of ecological destruction :
“ While the citizens of the rich world are protected from harm , the poor , the vulnerable and the hungry are exposed to the harsh reality of climate change in their everyday lives … .
We are drifting into a world of ‘ adaptation apartheid ’ . ”
As capitalism continues with business as usual , climate change is fast expanding the gap between rich and poor between and within nations , and imposing unparalleled suffering on those least able to protect themselves .
That is the reality of 21st century barbarism .
No society that permits that to happen can be called civilized .
No social order that causes it to happen deserves to survive .

Digital imaging records visual information via a sensor placed at the focal plane of a camera 's optics to measure the light gathered during an exposure .
The sensor is constructed as an array of pixels , each of which is tasked to gather the light arriving within a small patch of sensor area .
The efficiency with which the sensor and its pixels gather light , and the accuracy to which it determines the amount gathered by each pixel , are crucial for the quality of the recorded image .
The incoming light is the signal the photographer wishes the camera to transcribe faithfully ; inaccuracies in the recording process constitute noise , and distort the scene being photographed .
In order to extract the best performance from digital imaging , it is helpful to have an understanding of the various contributions to image noise , how various design choices in digital cameras affect this noise , how choices in photographic exposure can help mitigate noise , and how to ameliorate the visual effect of noise post - capture .
This article addresses the following topics :
Some technical terms used throughout ( with links to Wikipedia topics where available ) :
Sources of Noise
There are several characteristic sources of digital image noise :
Photon shot noise : Light is made up of discrete bundles of energy called photons -- the more intense the light , the higher the number of photons per second that illuminate the scene .
The stream of photons will have an average flux ( number per second ) that arrive at a given area of the sensor ; also , there will be fluctuations around that average .
The statistical laws which govern these fluctuations are called Poisson statistics and are rather universal , encountered in diverse circumstances .
For details and a variety of examples , see this Wikipedia article .
The fluctuations in photon counts is visible in images as noise -- Poisson noise , also called photon shot noise ; an example is shown in Fig.
1 . The term " shot noise " arises from an analogy of the discrete photons that make up a stream of light , to the tiny pellets that compose the stream of buckshot fired from a shotgun ( in particular , " shot " does not mean " photographic image " ) .
Fig.1 - Photon shot noise in an image of the sky from a Canon 1D3 ( in the green channel ) .
In the histogram at right , the horizontal coordinate is the raw level ( raw units are sometimes called analog - to - digital units ADU or data numbers DN ) , the vertical axis plots the number of pixels in the sample having that raw level .
The photon noise was isolated by taking the difference of two successive images ; the raw values for any one pixel then differ only by the fluctuations in the photon count due to Poisson statistics ( apart from a much smaller contribution from read noise ) .
The noise histogram is essentially a Gaussian distribution -- a standard " bell curve " .
The standard deviation of this bell curve is the width of the bell .
Fluctuations in photon counts from pixel to pixel are completely uncorrelated ; in terms of its spatial variation , photon shot noise is white noise ( in other words , it has equal strength at all spatial frequencies ) ; this means that it has a uniform salt - and - pepper appearance with no structure or pattern .
An important characteristic of fluctuations obeying Poisson statistics is that their standard deviation -- the typical fluctuation away from the average in the typical count -- is equal to the square root of the average count itself .
That is , if 10000 photons are collected on average , the typical fluctuation away from this average number of photons will be about 100 -- the counts will typically range from about 9900 to 10100 .
If instead on average 100 photons are collected , the variation from count to count will be +/- 10 .
Thus , as the signal grows , the photon shot noise also grows , but more slowly ; and the signal - to - noise ratio increases as the square root of the number of photons collected .
The higher the illumination , the less apparent the shot noise ; the lower the illumination , the more apparent it is .
Sensor read noise : Photons collected by the sensels ( the photosensitive part of a pixel ) stimulate the emission of electrons , one for each captured photon .
After the exposure , the accumulated photo- electrons are converted to a voltage in proportion to their number ; this voltage is then amplified by an amount proportional to the ISO gain set in the camera , and digitized in an analog - to - digital converter ( ADC ) .
The digital numbers representing the photon counts for all the pixels constitute the RAW data for the image ( raw units are sometimes called analog - to - digital units ADU , or data numbers DN ) .
We 'll call this digital number the raw value of the pixel .
In an ideal world , the digital number recorded in the raw data would be directly proportional to the photon count .
The constant of proportionality between the number of photons and the corresponding raw value is conventionally and somewhat inaptly called the gain of the sensor ( it is not really a gain , rather it is a conversion factor between photo - electron counts and raw values ) .
Since each doubling of ISO doubles the raw value for a given exposure , the gain is inversely proportional to ISO -- doubling the ISO cuts the gain in half , because the same number of photons captured are converted to a raw value twice as big when the ISO is doubled .
In the real world , the raw level does not precisely reflect the photon count .
Each electronic circuit component in the signal processing chain -- from sensel readout , to ISO gain , to digitization -- suffers voltage fluctuations that contribute to a deviation of the raw value from the ideal value proportional to the photon count .
The fluctuations in the raw value due to the signal processing electronics constitute the read noise of the sensor .
Fig.2 - Read noise of a 1D3 at ISO 800 .
The histogram of the noise is approximately gaussian .
The average value of 1024 is due to an offset Canon applies to raw data ( see page 2 ) .
The read noise can be isolated by taking a " black frame " image , an exposure with the lens cap on and the highest available shutter speed ; there are thus no photons captured , and only the electronic noise from reading the sensor remains .
Pattern noise :
In terms of its spatial variation , read noise is not quite white .
Upon closer inspection , there are one - dimensional patterns in the fluctuations in Figure 2 .
Because the human eye is adapted to perceive patterns , this pattern or banding noise can be visually more apparent than white noise , even if it comprises a smaller contribution to the overall noise .
Pattern noise is more problematic in older models such as the Canon 20D ; see figure 3 .
Fig.3 - Pattern noise in a 20 D at ISO 800 ( 1000x800 pixel crop ) .
Fixed pattern noise can be removed .
By making a template from the average
of 16 identical blackframes and subtracting it from the image most of the fixed pattern noise is removed .
The result may be seen by mousing over the image .
The residual variable component of pattern noise consists in this example largely of horizontal banding noise .
Pattern noise can have both a fixed component that does not vary from image to image ; as well as a variable component that , while not random from pixel to pixel , is not the same from image to image .
Figure 3 shows the read noise of a 20 D at ISO 800 ( a 1/1000sec exposure with the lens cap on , with a levels adjustment made for visualization purposes ) .
There is both horizontal and vertical banding present .
A template for fixed pattern noise was created by averaging sixteen identical blackframes ; this has the effect of averaging out any variable , fluctuating component of read noise , leaving mostly the fixed component .
The effect of subtracting the fixed pattern noise template from the read noise may be seen by mousing over the image in figure 3 .
Vertical banding largely disappears in this example , leaving some variable banding noise in the horizontal direction , as well as a homogeneous ( white ) component of read noise ; the width of the read noise histogram decreases by about 20 % .
This gives an indication of how visually disruptive pattern noise can be -- even though the fixed pattern noise is only about 20 % of the overall noise , it is quite apparent because our perception is adapted to picking out patterns , finding edges , etc .
Thermal noise : Thermal agitation of electrons in a sensel can liberate a few electrons ; these thermal electrons are indistinguishable from the electrons freed by photon ( light ) absorption , and thus cause a distortion of the photon count represented by the raw data .
Thermal electrons are freed at a relatively constant rate per unit time , thus thermal noise increases with exposure time .
Figure 4 gives a plot of the raw value standard deviation of a 20D blackframe ( in a 1000x1000 crop from the lower left corner ) , as a function of exposure time .
Fig.4 - Thermal noise in 20D blackframes at ISO 400 .
The knee in the data at exposure time 15sec is due to the max pixel raw level reaching 4095
( the maximum possible value on this camera ) , indicating that the rise in standard deviation is largely due to a few outlyers in the distribution .
The noise level rises as a function of exposure time , with the slope decreasing above an exposure time of about 15sec in this particular sample .
The cause of this change in behavior is that the rise in the standard deviation is largely due to a few " hot " pixels out on the tail of the distribution ; when the raw values of these pixels reach 4095 ( the maximum possible value for this camera ) , their contribution to the standard deviation saturates , and only the other pixels contribute to a ( slower ) rise in the standard deviation .
In crops from the same image used to generate the above plot , but chosen to avoid such " hot " pixels , the standard deviation rises much more slowly .
To show the growth in number of these outlying " hot " pixels , Figure 5 plots in white the pixels whose values are four or more standard deviations above the mean ( in a quadrant of the crop used to generate Figure 4 ) for two different exposure times .
Fig.5 - Hot pixels are the main contributors to thermal noise .
Shown in white are the pixels whose values are four or more
standard deviations above the mean .
On the left , exposure time is 15sec ; on the right , 30sec .
Another thermal contribution to image degradation is amplifier glow , which is caused by infrared radiation ( heat ) emitted by the readout amplifier
Fig.6 - Amplifier glow ( lower right ) in a 612 sec exposure of a Canon 20D .
For exposures of less than a second or so , read noise is relatively constant and thermal noise constitutes a negligible contribution to overall image noise .
It will not be considered further in our discussion .
Pixel response non-uniformity ( PRNU ) : Not all pixels in a sensor have exactly the same efficiency in capturing and counting photons ; even if there were no read noise , photon noise , etc , there would still be a variation in the raw counts from this non-uniformity in pixel response , or PRNU .
Figure 7 plots PRNU " noise " as a function of exposure .
The graph was obtained by measuring separately the combined photon shot noise and read noise , and appropriately subtracting these from the total noise in a series of exposures ; this residual noise is what is plotted in Figure 7 .
A more complete explanation of the measurement of PRNU may be found on page 2 .
Fig.7 - Noise due to pixel response non-uniformity of a Canon 20 D at ISO 100 , as a function of raw value .
Mouse over to compare
to the magnitude of combined read noise and photon shot noise .
Fluctuations in the response from pixel to pixel are about 0.6 % .
PRNU " noise " grows in proportion to the exposure level -- different pixels record differing percentages of the photons incident upon them , and so the contribution to the standard deviation of raw values from PRNU rises in direct proportion to the exposure level .
On the other hand , photon shot noise grows as the square root of exposure ; and read noise is independent of exposure level .
Thus PRNU is most important at the highest exposure levels , as one sees from the mouseover in Figure 7 .
For instance , PRNU is equal to combined shot and read noise at raw value of about 2500 on my 20D ( roughly the top 2/3 EV of highlights ) at ISO 100 .
At lower exposure levels , photon noise is the dominant contribution until one gets into deep shadows where read noise becomes important .
Art Center Pasadena student Jake Loniak has taken everything that is cool about exoskeletons and motorcycles and crammed it into this Yamaha - branded Deus Ex Machina concept motorcycle .
The vehicle is powered by ultra-capacitors and doped nano - phoshpate batteries ( similar to the ones currently used in hybrid cars ) and it is controlled using 36 pneumatic muscles with two linear actuators set along a spine consisting of seven artificial vertebrae .
Even the helmet is pneumatically attached .

( NewsTarget ) Supplements like Coenzyme Q10 , amino acids , even a daily multiple vitamin can provide your body with natural health benefits .
So why would the pharmaceutical companies have a problem with this ?
Think about it .
If nutritional supplements worked for even a small portion of the people currently bound to their prescription medications for heart disease , arthritis , diabetes and other degenerative diseases , the drug companies would stand to lose a lot of money !
That 's why they spend tons of money trying to discredit anything that may even hint of helping you .
Americans more than ever before realize the importance of vitamins , minerals and other nutrients in not only preventing disease , but also in promoting good health .
For example , nonprescription guaifenesin works well to clear phlegm from the chest .
Guaifenesin has also been used to manage symptoms of fibromyalgia .
The aging baby boomer generation is becoming skeptical about drugs and turning more to supplements .
According to the Alliance of Dietary / Food Supplement Association , calcium , glucosamine , coenzyme Q 10 , and women 's multi-vitamins are some of the supplements most preferred and purchased .
This makes sense since women are most at risk of developing osteoporosis and their physicians will likely prescribe hormone replacement therapy .
However , reports indicate multiple side effects to these types of treatment .
Women are therefore looking at nutritional supplements as an alternative , such as calcium magnesium supplements or glucosamine .
Stress , according to current medical research , depletes our bodies ' level of vital nutrients .
With air pollution , junk foods and the high level of stress most Americans function under , nutritional supplements should be part of everyone 's daily routine .
Today , more than ever , augmenting your diets with dietary supplements makes good sense .
But more than that , you also need to be open to the idea that these vitamins and minerals may help you escape the ravages of some of the diseases that many of us as we age fall prey to .
That being said , it 's important to do some homework and choose the right supplements for you in the proper dosages .

I ’ve been reading Leonard Mlodinow ’s The Drunkard ’s Walk : How Randomness Rules our Lives .
The book covers the Monty Hall problem , Bayes ’s Theorem , availability bias , the illusion of control and so forth .
If these are unfamiliar , look no further for an entertaining account .
On the other hand , I ca n’t say that I learned much I did n’t already know .
Nevertheless , I still enjoyed reading the book – it ’s well written and filled with interesting nuggets ( Did you know that the great mathematician Paul Erdos refused to believe that you should switch doors ? ) .
If you teach probability theory or intro stats you will find lots of good examples to brighten up your lectures .
One problem did intrigue me .
Suppose that a family has two children .
What is the probability that both are girls ?
Ok , easy .
Probability of a girl is one half , probabilities are independent thus probability of two girls is 1/2*1/2=1/4 .
Now what is the probability of having two girls if at least one of the children is a girl ?
A little bit harder .
Temptation is to say that if one is a girl the probability of the other being a girl is 1/2 so the answer is 1 / 2 .
That ’s wrong because you are not told which of the two children is a girl and that makes a difference .
Better approach is to note that without any additional information there are four possibilities of equal likelihood for the sex of two children ( B , B ) , ( G , B ) , ( B , G ) , ( G , G ) .
If we know that at least one is a girl we can remove ( B , B ) so three equally likely possibilities , ( G , B ) , ( B , G ) , ( G , G ) , remain and of these 1 has two girls so the answer is 1/3 .
Ok , now here is the stumper .
What is the probability of a family having two girls if one of the children is a girl named Florida ?
At first it seems impossible that knowing the name should make a difference .
Surely , the answer is 1/3 just as before ?
After all , every child has a name .
But knowing the name does make a difference .
Here ’s a hint , Florida is a rare name .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices rose to over $ 127 a barrel on Friday as a drop in the dollar drew in investors seeking to hedge against the weaker greenback .
U.S. crude settled up 73 cents at $ 127.35 a barrel after trading as high as $ 128.30 .
London Brent gained 89 cents to settle at $ 127.78 a barrel .
Oil hit an all - time high of $ 135.09 a barrel last week , driven by rising flows of cash from investors and concerns supplies will struggle to match demand longer term , before demand concerns sent prices lower .
“ Our view is that this bull run is not over , ” said Mike Wittner of SG .
“ It ’s going to continue to be volatile ... there ’s further upside . ”
Prices fell in early trade on Friday , hitting a session low of less than $ 125 a barrel , amid concerns that increased surveillance of oil markets by U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) could shake some speculators out of the market .
Support for oil stemmed from the dollar falling against the euro as some investors sold the U.S. currency after a string of recent gains .
Investors have used oil and other commodities as a hedge against the weaker dollar and inflation as the housing crisis and high fuel prices batter the U.S. economy .
Demand in consuming nations like the United States and Britain has already showed signs of faltering under the weight of rising fuel costs , and some analysts are concerned demand in some Asian countries could be hit if governments cut subsidies .
The subsidies have cost governments millions , prompting Taiwan , Indonesia and Sri Lanka to raise domestic fuel prices and India to consider it .

AP ’s Problem Is Not What It Thinks It Is
By David Swanson
There ’s been a lot of public discussion of late of the Associated Press ’s Washington Bureau Chief Ron Fournier ’s changes in style rules .
Out with “ just the facts , ” in with opinion and perspective .
Or so the story goes .
The changes that are afoot at the AP appear to be part of a broader trend , influenced – in part – by the internet , the medium itself and the competition from bloggers .
Of the two biggest problems I see in American journalism , this trend could fix one of them while not necessarily having any immediate impact , pro or con , on the other .
The problem that may not be impacted directly by the sort of shift in style underway at AP is the problem of too little serious investigative reporting being done and being published .
There are not enough serious reporters , they are not well enough funded , and their work is not printed , aired , and broadcast .
That problem wo n’t be fixed by a change in style , and could be worsened if the change in style is misinterpreted as somehow fixing the problem .
In the long - run , however , the change in style could result in a different awareness by readers that would create a serious demand for more research and investigation .
The other problem is addressed – albeit unintentionally and imperfectly – by the trend toward personalized journalism .
This is the problem of pretended “ objectivity . ”
What stories are covered , how they are covered , what counts as a fact , who counts as qualified to comment , which comments are included , how everything is presented : these are all matters of individual taste and judgement , of bias , of “ opinion ” , even in the most straightforward just - the - facts report .
There is no such thing as “ objectivity . ”
But there is a widespread belief in it among readers and among reporters themselves , and the result is usually widespread public acceptance of certain opinions and points of view as unquestionable , god - given , and beyond dissent .
When totalitarian state media outlets make this sort of claim , people tend not to fall for it .
But when capitalist media outlets themselves fall for it , their readers do as well .
Now , the change underway at the Associated Press is probably quite shallow .
AP editors and reporters no doubt continue to believe in the old distinction between “ objectivity ” and “ opinion ” as well as the partisan pretense that every “ issue ” has two and only two “ positions ” .
They ’ve just decided to add some “ opinion ” into their “ objective ” articles .
They see this as allowing them to do some things that I agree are important , such as reporting that a president has lied .
But the fact that a president has lied is not actually any less a fact than the fact that it ’s expected to rain on Tuesday or the fact that the Redskins played poor defense on Sunday .
That reporting such a fact is seen as adding opinion to a story is simply an indication that what has always counted as “ objectivity ” has actually been a set of biases slanted very heavily and strictly in favor of those in power .
The AP ( and other wire services and newspapers ) can , however , be part of a process of positive change in American reporting without having any idea what they are part of .
If American journalism drops the nameless from - on - high article in favor of the personalized report from someone with a name and identity , readers ( and viewers ) may become more questioning and aware , less lazy and accepting .
And once it becomes clear to readers that they are getting their news from people they fundamentally disagree with , readers ( and viewers ) may insist on other sources of news .
This is happening even where individuals are now permitted to wear two hats , that of “ opinion ” columnist and that of “ objective ” reporter .
Readers may eventually even insist on more substantive investigative reporting .
That would truly bring about what Fournier calls “ accountability journalism . ”
So , the change may be shallow at first .
And we should remember that even if the “ objectivity ” pretense is eradicated there will always remain 1,001 other ways to be dishonest .
But it is creative new online journalism that is driving the changes we ’re seeing , and if those changes lead us finally to give serious support to independent journalism , we will then see deep and meaningful change in our public communications .
This originally appeared on MWC NEWS
Corey Williams comes home from work after midnight , tired usually , and sometimes thinking about the joy he used to feel " knocking people over . "
As a powerful defensive end , he certainly did n't mind the violence of football , but what he craved even more was the attention that violence brought — the " oooh ! " of the crowd when he made a brutal stop .
He equated that sound with winning , and after he left football and Lamar High School , the sound disappeared from his life .
Williams 's plan afterward was to live as he had played , to understand that " you 've got to work hard if you want to win . "
He had intended to go to college and do the hard work with his brain , but all he can say now is that he had " the champagne bottle tilted up after high school and started to see time slip by . "
Four years have passed since high school , and Williams has this job now washing cranes from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. , and also this other job , from 4 p.m. to midnight , cutting sheet metal on the assembly line at an " engineered filtration products " plant .
Then he comes home , usually in the old Buick he shares with his mother , to the apartment he shares with her , in an area along far west Bissonnet where liquor stores are not hard to find , nor payday loan outfits , nor a bail bondsman .
Williams knows a lot of people around here who never went to college and some whom he believes to be " criminals . "
As for himself , he has " always tried to live as honest as possible , " he says — " no felony convictions at least . "
" I'm a winner , " says Williams , and this was still his point of view late one evening last March when , stepping out of the car , all 220 solid pounds of him , he heard someone in the parking lot say , " man , there 's a guy back in that alley over there . "
Info citizen involvement
Williams , in his usual late - night foul mood , thought to himself , " Do n't no one want to come home to that . "
_____________________
The usual schemes in beat number 19G40 involve burglary , robbery , aggravated assault , but there had been a few more rapes than usual in the previous six months , and police believed one man to be responsible for five of them .
Typically , the man would scale a balcony or enter through a bedroom window , waking his victim by pouncing on top of her , punching her in the face .
Three of the rapes had taken place in Corey Williams 's apartment complex , Summerstone , including perhaps the most terrifying , in which a woman was dragged behind a building with a knife to her throat .
The man involved was clearly " not a real nice fellow , " as Lieutenant Mike Waterwall said , and police had increased patrols in the area and had distributed composite sketches of him .
" Beware " flyers had been posted on every Summerstone door ; the residents had held a meeting in the clubhouse .
" I mean , everyone was looking for this guy , " Waterwall said , but he kept coming back .
" He could n't control himself , obviously . "
Among the many who lived in fear was Corey Williams 's own mother , Alvanna .
Corey Williams himself admits he " just kind of brushed it off " and even teased his mother for being afraid .
As a large male , he thought he knew at least two things in this world .
One was , " the dude 's not going to rape me — that 's for damn sure , " and the other was , no one was ever going to lay hands on his mother .
These thoughts were far from his mind , however , that night in the parking lot .
Williams simply knew that " it 's not normal for a motherfucker to be standing in an alley at one in the morning , " and he responded to the situation by unbuttoning his shirt .
The man who alerted him to the situation would not return phone calls for this account , but he was a visitor to the complex named Derrick Johnson whose children were being babysat there .
Williams says he reached into the trunk of his car and pulled out a big , wooden stick .
One of Williams 's co-workers was there , too — Jonathan Robinson , who had come home with Williams to drink a few beers .
His phone number has since been disconnected , but he had no stake in this matter , and Williams said Robinson hung back as the three of them made their way into that dark alley .
At the back of the alley , just at the corner of the building where the balconies rise up , they met an unusually tall figure , cloaked entirely in black .
When Johnson posed the obvious question — " what the fuck are you doing here ? " — the figure answered by silently producing a cell phone , as though to say , just making a call .
Johnson , at this point , reached out to grab the dark presence by the collar of his shirt , just as Williams snatched him up on the other side — as though to say , Williams explains now , " prepare to get fucked - up . "
The sinister figure dissolved then into a very frightened human being .
" I ain't doing nothing ! " he blurted .
" I ain't doing nothing ! "
Then what the fuck was he doing , Williams asked again .
And this time , the man answered that he had simply been cutting through on his way to the store — taking a short - cut through a property that was entirely surrounded by a nine - foot fence .
Why , then , was he dressed in black , Williams wanted to know .
" And the son - of - a - bitch said , ' I just got out of the Navy . ' "
He seemed , Williams recalls , nearly hysterical , and no one had said a word about rape when the intruder suggested , " if anything , y'all could be the rapist . "
Williams and Johnson abandoned their interrogation then .
They began " not exactly dragging but kind of pushing him " to the front of the complex .
Along the way , they asked someone they met to call the police , and then , at the front , Williams sat the prisoner down on a curb to wait .
Johnson had departed to retrieve his children when the prisoner began to complain , " Man , ants be biting my ass . "
Corey Williams was tired and " aggravated , " and you have to wonder if he was looking for a challenge when he allowed the prisoner to go sit on a staircase about 25 feet away .
As though preparing for a race , Williams leaned down then to tie his shoes , and remembers that it was just then that his prisoner " took off . "
" I 'm gonna catch this son - of - a - bitch , " Williams thought to himself , and off he went just like he used to do , chasing after a man who was trying to escape him , a man in black this time who was fleeing as though for his life .
They raced down narrow walkways , hemmed by boxwoods and air - ­conditioners .
People heard the noise and came out to their balconies to watch .
When the man in black hit the parking lot , he faked left and right , " like he did n't know where to go , " but , of course , Williams had seen that move before and gained a few steps by following him directly left .
At the end of the parking lot was a four - foot fence , and over that , the man leaped , with Williams jumping right behind .
If the man in black had then been able to scale the nine - foot fence , it is hard to say where he would be now and what he might have done .
But the board broke in his hand , and it was then that Williams hit him and brought him down .
" And then I went to work on him , " Williams said , and he had only just begun when four or five of his neighbors joined in to help — people he'd never seen before , men who knew even less than he the history of the man on the ground .
For several moments , they silently kicked and stomped the intruder , and then sirens filled the air , and " it was like some sort of martial arts shit , " ­Williams remembers .
Everyone vanished but him .
" Who beat you up ? " the officer wanted to know .
The man in black seemed happy to see the police , and getting to his feet , righteously pointed a finger at Williams .
The police were not especially sympathetic , though , and digging into his clothes and into his past , they began to discover who he was — that the intruder had been nobly named Marcus Anthony Duffy - Thompson , was 21 years old , that just like Williams , he shared an apartment miles away with his mother , and even worked with her in a grocery store nearby .
On his person , the police found no gun nor knife but only the saddest tool of all in the rapist 's trade : a tube in his pocket of K - Y Jelly .
Duffy - Thompson was later identified by victims in three cases , and their testimony was supported by a DNA match .
" It did turn out to be him , no doubt about it , " said Lieutenant Waterwall .
" We 're confident it 's him . "
Had he not been detained by Williams and others , " we 'd have DNA data , " Waterwall said , " but we would n't know where it came from .
So these guys were pivotal . "
In the 228th district court , Duffy - Thompson has been charged with one count of sexual assault and two counts of burglary with intent to commit a felony .
He remains in jail now under three $ 100,000 bonds and may well spend his life in prison .
As for those who captured him , the police staged a small press conference about a month ago , which transformed Williams into a blip on the local news .
People began congratulating him again for another great tackle , and Williams began seeing the difference again " between the limelight and being behind the scenes . "
In any case , he has something other than football to think about now on the assembly line , and " I 'm not going to lie , " he said .
He wants the limelight back .

Is n’t this small house just amazing ?
Nicely built and the bedroom above the entering room is astonishing .
The house was created by Jay Shafer and it seems like a good place to take a rest for a couple of hours .
We do n’t know for sure whether it ’s the smallest one in the world or not , but for sure this house deserves to be listed as one of the smallest in the world as , besides of its size , it ’s also practical .
About two seconds after
Google Trends For
Websites came out ,
people
started
noticing
that one company ’s websites oddly had no data available — Google ’s own .
Google will tell you all about the traffic to competitors
like Yahoo and Microsoft but gives away nothing about itself .
The same
is true for the newly - released
Google Ad Planner
tool .
It ’s not
right , despite Google ’s weak excuse of not wanting to provide " financial
guidance " about itself via the tool .
Google either needs to post its own information pronto or
allow any company to opt out .
The First Rule Of Google Trends Is You Do n’t Talk About Google Trends
Why do searches for traffic data about
google.com , youtube.com , blogger.com , and other Google properties reveal
nothing ?
The official statement , from Google :
We have a policy of not providing interim financial guidance , and have
decided not to release Google numbers in accordance with that policy .
We are
always open to reconsidering decisions we ’ve made , but at this point , for
these financial guidance reasons , we do not share Google numbers in the
Trends for Websites tool .
First of all , Google ’s policy has been to avoid giving financial guidance
period , not just " interim " guidance .
To go back to the original founders ’
IPO letter :
Although we may discuss long term trends in our business , we do not plan
to give earnings guidance in the traditional sense .
Financial Guidance Excuses
So let ’s skip this " interim " guidance nonsense .
Yes , every quarter Google
does officially release some information .
But even between quarters , there ’s
no end of Google announcements or interviews that have stats or figures that
could be seen as " guidance " about the company .
For example , Eric Schmidt
commented
recently that a stock
split is unlikely but does n’t rule it out .
Is n’t that guidance ?
It ’s not like Google hands out traffic figures on a regular basis anyway .
Here ’s the press
release for its last quarterly filing .
Now how much traffic did
Google.com get compared to the previous quarter or the same time the year
before ?
The release does n’t say .
Can we conclude that traffic figures are n’t
financial guidance period ?
Because if they were , I should be seeing them
here .
I can understand concerns Google might have about traffic figures being
misinterpreted by financial analysts to mean something about the company ’s
future prospects .
Goodness knows folks jumped all over comScore’s
paid search clicks
figure when that was only partial data that meant nothing ( and then
blamed comScore
for their own bad analysis — and
some continue assuming those figures alone mean anything ) .
Still , there are plenty of other sources for traffic data .
These will get
interpreted regardless of what Google puts out there .
And that leads to
another point .
By withholding its own traffic estimates , Google is making it
harder for anyone trying to interpret figures by looking at a " basket " of
reports .
As a result , some might paint a better or worse picture of how
Google is doing because they lack figures from an important new tool to have
in the mix , Google ’s own .
Lastly , while I ca n’t get traffic data from Google Trends , I
can still find the
number of people searching for Google .
That rise will be seen by some as a
proxy for traffic figures .
So why not just give me the traffic figures
themselves ?
Pick your point , the financial guidance argument just feels like a
convenient excuse .
Let ’s see Google reconsider this right now and change its
mind .
Allow Opting - Out & Myth Of Private Traffic Data
With the release of Google Trends For Websites , there ’s been talk that Google is
somehow handing out " confidential " information about websites and
should thus allow for opting - out of reporting .
My response
to that on Sphinn was :
Confidential ?
Please .
You were getting it from places like Alexa , Compete
and Quantcast already .
And if you were paying big bucks , you were getting it
from Hitwise , comScore and NetRatings .
Data ’s been out there for years , in
various degrees of accuracy — but to say it is confidential is
overreaching .
This data IS out there already , not just from Google but from a variety
of other tools as I named .
Saying that what happens on your web site is " private " is like
saying that someone standing on a public street and watching the people who
go in and out of a store and logging what they bought is violating the store ’s
privacy .
The store is out in public view — the data is easily seen and
logged .
OK , side note here .
I ’ve long written about how
ISPs are a bigger
issue to me with privacy than search engines , in how they merrily see
EVERYTHING we do on the web and some secretly sell that data to web
metrics companies ( secretly , because they certainly do n’t tell their
customers this is happening , nor do the web metrics companies tell you the
ISPs that they harvest from ) .
There are private things that happen within your website , stuff that no
one can really learn without your active help .
But much data ceased being " private " years ago due to the ISP harvesting along
with toolbar tracking .
Hence , yelling that Google should n’t release
such information is trying to push the genie back into the bottle .
Similarly , the idea that people should be able to opt - out largely does n’t
make much sense .
None of the other tools allow for opting - out of them .
Google could add an opt - out , but it would just mean the data was out there
in a variety of ways — especially through paid web metrics tools .
Still , I ’m totally behind the idea that Google should provide opt - out as
long as it continues to effectively opt - out itself .
That ’s just not fair .
If
Google stays out , then it should give any site the ability to do the same
without the
absurd requirement that the sites completely opt - out of being listed in
Google at all .
Related Webmaster Issues
In preparing this follow - up article , I asked more about the underlying
data that Google uses , especially whether the Google Toolbar was involved .
Google said it could n’t discuss its " secret sauce , " which I found
disappointing .
But as my
Google Ad Planner
Launches , Offers Site Demographic Profiles post explains , I think the
Google Toolbar is involved .
Also spotted today via Sphinn ,
Google Trends For Website results
are now starting to show up in Google searches for particular domains .
Of course , looking at a search for
searchengineland.com , I see that Quantcast and Alexa reports for our
site are also there .
So why should Google stay out ?
Maybe they should n’t .
But since Google already blocks regular Google Trends data from being
listed , this might be an oversight .
A nice change might be a OneBox / Smart
Answer - style result at the top of the results that link out to ratings from
a variety of providers , including Google Trends .
Opt - In Data Sharing
In contrast to opt - out , it might be nice if Google went the opposite way .
Allow for
verified traffic metrics , like Quantcast
does .
Over there , you can choose to carry Quantcast code on your web site .
Do that , and Quantcast will adjust your figures based on your actual
traffic , rather than guesses .
And some good news : according to the Google Ad
Planner
help files , it ’s something being considered :
In the future , we may consider ways to improve the accuracy of Google Ad
Planner data by allowing owners to contribute additional data from their
sites .
OK , I know there are about six sites out on the web that still do n’t yet
have some type of Google tracking code already on their sites ( AdSense , Google
Analytics , Google Website Optimizer , FeedBurner … the ways that Google
tracks goes on and on ) .
So the idea that we start handing Google even more
data is n’t going to go over well with everyone .
Aaron
Wall notes again how the data Google already has enables them to do many
things — and I ’m with him on lots of it ( see also my
Google : Master Of
Closing The Loop ? post ) .
But consider this .
Personally , I do n’t want to stick 1,001 different
tracking codes on my site for Quantcast , Google , FeedBurner , and so on .
C’mon , Google — take the lead to start an open tracking system .
Anyone can
place tracking code that anyone else can use and tap into .
Get all the
metrics companies together and agree on some much needed standards .
Oh , and
shove it on your own sites so we know what ’s going on there just like you
know what goes on with us .
Now that would be transparency .
Atlantic City Convention Center Plans Largest Solar Roof in U.S .
June 18th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
Giving a new meaning to the term “ sun roof ” , Atlantic City ’s Convention Center will install solar photovoltaic ( PV ) modules on 290,000 square feet of roof space , saving a projected $ 4.4 million over 20 years , according to the New Jersey Star - Ledger .
In a groundbreaking economic arrangement , Pepco Energy Services , a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings , will pay to have the solar panels installed , and the Convention Center will then buy back the electricity from Pepco .
The installation will provide a quarter of the energy consumed by the convention center .
The Solar Energy Industry Association ( SEIA ) says the installation will be the largest in the U.S. on one roof .
“ Jeffrey Vasser , executive director of the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority , said the group began planning a solar project a few years ago when Gov. Jon S. Corzine pushed for greater use of sun and wind power in New Jersey .
‘ We have a great building to do this on , and we wanted to be the first kid on the block to get in on it , ’ Vasser said .
This helps a young industry grow into a mature one , helps reduce our dependence on oil , and produces electricity that does not increase carbon emissions into the air , ’ he said of the multi million - dollar project . ”
State Governors , take note what a little forward - thinking leadership can accomplish .
And think about the vast acreage across the U.S. devoted to industrial - size roofs that could be deployed to save businesses millions of dollars on energy while lessening our dependence on foreign oil .
Oh yeah , and helping the environment .

A teacher was shot to death in northern Afghanistan after he gave a speech condemning suicide bombings , it was revealed today .
Abdul Hadi claimed the attacks were un-Islamic and un-Afghan during a speech yesterday in the Archi district of Kunduz province .
He spoke at a gathering of about 700 people , including the Kunduz governor , and was on his way home when he was killed , Khair Mohammad Subat said .

Kunduz police chief General Mohammad Ayub Salangi said police were investigating and that no arrests have been made so far .
In January , Education Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar said the number of students and teachers killed in Taliban attacks spiked in the past year in a campaign to close schools and force teenage boys to join the Islamic militia .
According to UNICEF , there were 236 school - related attacks last year .
In central Logar province , meanwhile , education department director Kamaluddin Zadran said three girls schools have been set ablaze in the past three weeks .
Girls were barred from schools under the Taliban regime .
After the Taliban fell in 2001 , girls were allowed to return to attend , but many conservative and uneducated Afghans still forbid their girls from going .
Arsonists regularly attack girls schools .
Last year , gunmen killed two students walking outside a girls school in Logar .
Education Ministry statistics indicate only 35 per cent of students enrolled are girls .
University of Antwerp makes 4000EUR NVIDIA supercomputer Posted on Thursday , May 29 2008 @ 18:21:34 CEST by Thomas De Maesschalck
Update -
This original post is from 2008 and it's amazing how far we have come .
The 4000EUR NVIDIA supercomputer would n't even make it on the list of budget gaming computers now .
What was once $ 3900 to buy can now be purchased for less than $ 400 .
That being said , NVIDIA has still maintained its lead as the top manufacturer of GPUs .
Looking forward to seeing what mid tier systems look like in 5 - 10 years " .
Researchers at the University of Antwerp in Belgium have created a new supercomputer with standard gaming hardware .
The system uses four NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GX2 graphics cards , it costs less than 4000EUR to build and thanks to NVIDIA 's CUDA technology it delivers roughly the same performance as a supercomputer cluster consisting of hundreds of PCs !
This new system is used by the ASTRA research group , part of the Vision Lab of the University of Antwerp , to develop new computational methods for tomography .
The guys explain the eight NVIDIA GPUs deliver the same performance for their work as more than 300 Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz processors .
On a normal desktop PC their tomography tasks would take several weeks but on this NVIDIA - based " supercomputer " it only takes a couple of hours .
The NVIDIA graphics cards do the job very efficiently and consume a lot less power than a real supercomputer cluster .
The research group ASTRA , part of the Vision Lab of the University of Antwerp , focuses on the development of new computational methods for tomography .
Tomography is a technique used in medical scanners to create three - dimensional images of the internal organs of patients , based on a large number of X - ray photos that are acquired over a range of angles .
ASTRA develops new reconstruction techniques that lead to better reconstruction quality than classical methods .
Although our reconstruction techniques are very powerful , they have an important drawback : they are quite slow .
As the 3D images that we normally deal with can be rather large ( typically 1024x1024x1024 volume elements , or more ) , advanced reconstruction methods can sometimes take weeks of computation time on a normal PC .
Here 's a look at the specifications of the FASTRA desktop superPC .
The main reason why they configured an AMD system is because they could n't find a motherboard for the Intel platform that could fit four GeForce 9800 GX2 graphics cards .
Another interesting note is that this system does n't need SLI , their application uses the NVIDIA CUDA programming model which makes all eight GPUs work in parallel .
The researchers say they do n't need SLI during a reconstruction as every graphics card communicates directly with the CPU , no inter-GPU communication is needed .
AMD Phenom 9850 processor +
Scythe Infinity CPU cooler 4x MSI 9800GX2 graphics card 4 x 2GB Corsair Twinx DDR2 PC6400 memory MSI K9A2 Platinum motherboard Samsung Spinpoint F1 750GB HDD ThermalTake Toughpower 1500W Modular PSU Lian-Li PC - P80 Armorsuit case Windows XP 64 - bit
A quick note for our American readers , a system with similar specifications would cost you around $ 3,900 at Newegg .
Most computer hardware costs a lot more in Europe than in the U.S .
The biggest problem of the system is that these four dual - GPU graphics cards are cramped together and generate quite a lot of heat .
The FASTRA uses aircooling and with the sidepanel removed the GPUs run at 55 degrees Celsius in idle , 86 degrees Celsius under full load and 100 degrees Celsius under full load with the shaders 20 % overclocked .
They have to run the system with the left side panel removed as the graphics cards would otherwise overheat but they 're looking for a solution for their heat problem .
The medical researchers ran some benchmarks and found that in some cases their 4000EUR desktop superPC outperforms CalcUA , a 256 - node supercomputer with dual AMD Opteron 250 2.4GHz chips that cost the University of Antwerp 3.5 million euro in March 2005 :
You can read more about the FASTRA GPU SuperPC project over here .
The site contains lots of background information , info on the hardware they used , more photos and benchmarks .
More videos that explain what the project is all about can be found at YouTube .
In the video below Dr. Joost Batenburg takes you to the ASTRA - lab where he shows what tomographical reconstructions are and what the role of FASTRA is :
Basically the ASTRA researchers have created a very affordable computer system that can perform their tomography work very efficiently .
For specific applications that can be massively parallelized GPUs are much faster than CPUs , for the tomography work the NVIDIA - based FASTRA system outperforms a real supercomputer that 's much more expensive , takes up more room and uses a lot more power .
The Vision Lab is now planning to build a cluster of such systems , which will allow for real - time reconstruction of large 3D volumes .
In the future we 'll see many more applications that take advantage of the computational power of GPUs to significantly speed up specific tasks .
Later this summer NVIDIA will unveil new software that will make HD video transcoding much faster and the firm will also roll out a software update that will add AGEIA PhysX support to all GeForce 8/9 and GeForce GTX 200 series graphics cards .
Another application that benefits greatly from GPUs is Folding@Home , ATI GPUs are already supported for quite a while and NVIDIA GPUs will follow soon .
Adobe is also playing with GPU acceleration for Photoshop but the firm says this is just an experimental feature that may not be present in the next version of Photoshop .

get 4 gpu kits and a radiator like in a motor cycle and a fan , bam done .
now if you guys could get a solar system by solarcity or the likes to power the entire thing , now that would be the shit .
I live in south florida in the united states and my home is powered by solar and i have a electric car that is also charged by my solar array .
I pay zero for my home electricity and i pay zero for gasoline .
bam I save 500 to 700 a month and i get money back from sending some back to the grid , not to mention i get get big write offs come tax time .
down side it cost me 20,000 dollars up front , but i allready paid it off due to the massive savings it has done for me .
all in all a 20,000 dollar loan is realy small compaird to what you spend on electricity and gas yearly , and just think .
elec and gas is a never ending bill and I just shut it completely down forever .
So some time in the future I 'm going to get one of those electric sports cars , now talk about zoom zoom .

Take a few of those millions of dollars saved and get some decent cooling for the GPUs and you will pick up ~ 15 % additional clockspeed easily .
Save the money and dont use Lian - Li cases , as sexy as they may be .
Function over form for science .
Distributed Computing should also be considered as many gamers run multi GPU systems that sit idle for long periods of time .
I myself have several multi-GPU systems so it would be nice to have something to crunch while Im at work and comps sit idle .

Each communicates directly with the CPU ?
Would n't that make the computation slower than if they were communicating only amongst each other ?

In my opinion this computer fits the definition of a super computer as much as a Thinking Machine 's Connection Machine .
It was designed with state of the art hardware to solve problems faster or that could n’t be solved with conventional hardware .
You could argue what conventional is but there are n’t many motherboards out there that can handle four graphics cards and how many people are going to try to build a system with four graphics cards .
Just because they used off the self parts and graphics cards that originally intended for gamers do n’t discredit the ingenuity and creativity of the system designers .
Well ...

This is not a supercomputer - what a misuse of the word , in order to mislead .
It 's just that they need to do 3D calculations for this tomography , so GPUs are going to be the best thing to use .
It 's just a niche application , using appropriate tools .

From google define : supercomputer
a supercomputer :
Refers to those computing systems ( hardware , systems software , and applications software ) that provide close to the best currently achievable sustained performance on demanding computational problems .
Computer with enormous processing capacity and built with several multiprocessors .
a large , expensive and fast computer , usually arranged so that it can perform the same operation on all the items in a vector at once ; useful for intensive number - crunching programs such as weather forecasting or high - quality graphics , but not usually effective for general parallel programs .
" Conventional " supercomputers serve a nice of problems just as well .
Admittedly , this niche is broader than for GPU computing , but even GPU's are capable of dealing with an increasingly broad range of problems ( check out gpgpu.org ) .
The boundary is at least getting more and more vague .

Hmm , they do n't say what calculations they are doing and why they are better than our existing 3D workstations .
We do n't wait days to do our existing 3D mapping , it is done in minutes .
In addition to that , there is already a company selling a 3D product that uses the GPU to do 3D calculations on CT data .
That company is called 3 mensio , in the Netherlands .
It uses one GFX card though .

Yes they do .
Check the longer version of the movie on the website .
They develop algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge in the reconstruction , which is not exploited by traditional algorithms .
Although this results in much longer computation times , it dramatically reduces the amount of X - ray images needed to compute a reconstruction .

16 or 8 displays
by Anonymous on Wednesday , June 11 2008 @ 10:17:40 CEST
What about hooking this thing up to 16 displays that surround the gamer , so the gamer does n't need to use any controller to see what 's happening around him at any angle ?
But what I really wanted to know is how many gigaflops can you get out of those cards ?
And maybe you guys can talk to the people of flight gear , which is an open source flight simulator .
Try to simulate a flight at the speed of sound , or maybe even the speed of light ?
( http://www.flightgear.org/)
Hmm try to get linux to run on this thing ...

its got 800 SP in that thing and it gives the 9800 an run for its money
the nvidia 280 would allso be intresting to see if it could prove to be better
but its like can 4 of them above cards do more work then 4 ( 8 ) of the 9800 GX2 cards do be intresting as i have had no folding results yet

I sure hope you 've upgraded to GT200 gpus by now .
4 x GTX280 will give you twice the power you got with your GX2's .
Other then that , ignore the ignorance of others .
The world needs people like yourself to push the demands on manufactures , or they would n't be any advancements .
I 'm sure your contribution to CUDA will benefit more the just your own research in the long run .
People just do n't realize that without these type of projects , there would n't be need for advancements as no developer would bother creating software that can't be benefited from .

we have a perfect case for this .
we built it and designed for a biotech genomic applications , but looks like we can offer it as value for GPU applications as well .
We solve the heat problem ... no problem !
Its actually a NAS .. we 2x6 1 Gbit ports switches built right inside the case .
.. and its very very COOL ( opposite of heat )
website under development , but feel free to visit .
the case is designed to be portable and transportable .
we can build it with 8 expansion slots and have a factory cranking these guys out for the next 4 - 5 years for one of our clients !

EXPOSURE
Formaldehyde Fumes Linked To Particleboard
Concentrations in trailers were up to 11 times higher than in typical homes
The high levels of formaldehyde found in the indoor air of trailers used for Hurricane Katrina evacuees came primarily from processed wood products such as particleboard and plywood , federal scientists say .
Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory examined four trailers and detected formaldehyde at levels four to 11 times higher than those typically found in U.S. homes .
They also found elevated levels of two other volatile organic compounds , phenol and 2,2,4 - trimethyl - 1,3 - pentanediol diisobutyrate , but not at concentrations high enough to pose health hazards .
" Even with a limited sample of trailers , this study affirms what would be expected , that construction materials that emit high concentrations of formaldehyde , when part of a relatively small structure that has poor ventilation , have the potential to produce elevated levels of formaldehyde in the indoor air , " says Michael A. McGeehin , director of the Division of Environmental Hazards & Health Effects at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention .
" This suggests that efforts to design and build emergency housing units may be able to greatly improve indoor air quality by using different construction materials and ensuring that ventilation systems let in fresh air . "

Q From David Hughes in the UK : Recently I came across an Internet site where a writer claimed that the word girl used to mean any young person whether male or female , and that today the word youth means any young person of either sex .
Both assertions came as news to me .
Do you know whether there is any truth in them ?
A For about two hundred years after it arrived in the language in the thirteenth century girl was indeed a general term for any young person .
If a writer wanted to make clear the sex of the person , he had to add a qualifier : knave girl for a boy , and gay girl for a young woman .
But by the sixteenth century the word had shifted to our modern sense .
Youth is rather more complicated .
In one sense , it can be used for young persons of either sex , usually when we are thinking of young people as a group or in the abstract .
We can , for example , speak of youth culture , a youth club , or a youth hostel .
In all these cases , there is no distinction of sex .
The same applies when the word appears as an abstract noun for the state of being young , as in “ in the days of her youth ” , “ in his youth he was a fine footballer ” .
On the other hand , when the word refers to individuals it almost always means young men : “ the youths were arrested in the shopping centre ” or “ They caught a youth in a nearby park ” .
But these tend to be formal usages , as the examples show .
The panic at the Fed , the SEC , and the Treasury department continues .
In an emergency action the SEC Curbs Shorting of GSE Stocks , Considers Limits for Wider Market .
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced an emergency action aimed at reducing short - selling aimed at Wall Street brokerage firms , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and will immediately begin considering new rules to extend new requirements to the rest of the market .
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that
the SEC would institute an emergency order requiring any traders to pre-borrow stock before shorting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the embattled government - sponsored entities that own more than half the nation 's mortgages .
Ackman Shorts Fannie , Freddie
Hedge fund manager William Ackman , who is betting against shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , criticized any government plan to buy equity in the existing mortgage - finance companies and said shareholders should be wiped out .
" We 've not yet heard Secretary Paulson 's plan but it would be a grave error for the government to invest in the equity of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as they are currently capitalized , " Ackman , 42 , said in a telephone interview from his New York office .
Ackman said he had discussions last week with the Treasury , Federal Reserve and Senate Finance Committee about his plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which guarantee or own almost half the $ 12 trillion in U.S. home loans outstanding .
Under Ackman 's plan , Fannie Mae 's senior unsecured debt would be reduced by 10 percent and the junior debt would be completely eliminated , adding $ 86 billion in equity capital to the company .
" The good news is that Fannie Mae has all the capital that it needs , " Ackman said .
" It just has the capital in the wrong form with too much debt and not enough equity . "
Ackman 's Plan To Save Fannie and Freddie
Ackman , who runs the New York - based Pershing Square Capital Management , has a short position in both the junior debt and the equity of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and is critical of the federal plans to backstop the two companies if needed .
In a CNBC interview , Ackman laid out a plan he claims will reduce leverage at the two government sponsored enterprises .
[ Mish note :
Two videos are present in this link and there is additional discussion about the plan in the Bloomberg link above ]
Ackman has no position in the senior debt of the two mortgage lenders .
With his short position , Ackman stands to benefit if the value of the Fannie and Freddie Mac stock and junior debt deteriorates .
" Investors made a bet , " Ackman said .
" They received dividends , and so on ... they allowed the institutions to become too levered , they chose these directors ....
The subordinated debt holders received an excess yield .
This is not the senior debt of Fannie Mae - there is a relatively small amount of it outstanding .... We believe the subordinated debt holders should get warrants . "
Shorting Curbs Can't Help
Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha fans appear to be experiencing veritable paroxysms of ecstasy , with the news that a movie title for theatrical release is in the works .
It will of course feature the usual cast , but will take a Shamballa or SAC style twist , in that the story is said to take place in a parallel universe to that of the main series .
With the prominence given to Nanoha and Fate in these illustrations , it is also no leap of faith to think they will be at the head of the cast , as ever .
There is some ambiguous talk from a seiyuu ( Kana Ueda ) about this being the final launch in the franchise , but this would appear to contradict the announced parallel story ( unless she was speaking purely from a commercial perspective ) , as well as the prominently displayed “ The Movie 1st ” in the magazine , which might be taken as a none too subtle hint of a movie series …
Or perhaps just signifies that it is the first movie ?
Time will tell .
The scans , of an as yet unreleased issue of Megami magazine , surfaced on 2ch .
Illegal Aliens in Brussels Taking to the Cranes
Illegal immigrants in Belgium have found a new form of protest in their efforts to secure a residence permit .
For the past week they have been occupying giant construction cranes in Brussels .
But Belgian officials say they will not negotiate -- and like so many issues in Belgium , this one is also split down linguistic lines .
A couple of bogus prime sieves have shown up in the blogorama lately .
After reading a very interesting paper about the authentic prime sieve algorithm , I became kind - of hooked on implementing it .
The paper is great but the examples are all in Haskell , and I can’t really understand that too well .
However I did manage to figure out the basic point .
The “ wrong ” prime sieve implementations all operate by accumulating a list of known primes , and then testing candidates by seeing whether they ’re divisible by any of them .
If not , then the candidate must be prime .
It ’s only necessary to test from 2 through sqrt( candidate ) of course .
Well maybe not “ of course ” but that ’s the way it is anyway .
Thus the time bound on that approach is O(n sqrt ( n ) ) , sort - of , since prime numbers are pretty uniformly distributed along the natural number line .
( Note : the preceding claim about prime distribution is incorrect , but as the algorithm does n’t take density of primes into account the time bound ( in terms of numbers tested , not number of primes generated ) is about right I think .
Thanks Cybil ! )
The “ right ” prime sieve is different ( duhh ) .
What it does is keep track of the composite numbers implied by each known prime .
In other words , once ( in the degenerate initial case ) you decide that 2 is prime , you know that all multiples of 2 ( starting with 4 ) must not be prime .
As you work upwards through candidates , you know a candidate is prime if it is smaller than the smallest composite number you know about so far .
This approach is the “ right ” approach because , if you do the “ what ’s the smallest composite ? ” part properly , you end up with an O( n log n ) algorithm and that ’s a lot better than the wrong way .
The way to do the “ what ’s the smallest composite ” test is to keep the composite lists ( that is , one list per known prime ) in a priority queue .
In this case , it ’s possible to cheat a little with adding primes to the queue because it ’s going to be the case that the first composite implied by a new known prime is always a bigger number than any other known composite .
That ’s probably provable but I do n’t feel like doing that now .
Implementing the priority queue in a language like Erlang or Clojure ( well one could cheat in Clojure but I did n’t want to ) requires that it be done with some sort of functional data structure .
In Java ( and I did do a Java version but it ’s ugly and boring ) you can use an array list to store a “ heap ” for the queue , and inserts are super easy because you just drop your new composite stream in the next available slot of an ArrayList .
In the trendy functional languages , however , you ca n’t do that .
What I came up with ( probably after several billion other people did ) was to use a functional ( immutable ) tree structure that I could rebuild when doing an “ add ” operation .
The trick is to consider what ’s going on with the ArrayList cheater approach .
If you ’re dropping something into the next available slot at the end of the heap , well what does that look like if you visualize the heap as a tree ?
You can work your way up the tree by repeatedly dividing that slot index by 2 until you get to the root .
Each time , you know that if the remainder is an odd number you ’re moving up a right link , and if it ’s an even number you ’re moving up a lefft link .
Thus by looking at the binary representation of the heap slot index ( backwards ) , you have a little “ path ” descriptor that ’ll guide you straight from the top of the heap down to the next empty slot .
So in Erlang I represent the priority queue as a tuple with the current queue size , and the heap .
The heap is also a tuple , containing the top node and the left and right children – recursively , also tuples .
Each node is a tuple containing the prime number , the current known composite , and a counter to generate the next composite .
- module ( pq ) .
- export ( [ add / 2 , primes / 1 ] ) . % Primes np ( Prime ) -> { Prime , Prime * Prime} . next ( { Prime , M} ) -> { Prime , Prime + M}. cur({_Prime , V} ) -> V .
The queue utilities :
% The priority queue newQ ( ) -> empty . leaf ( P ) -> { P , nil , nil} . sz( empty ) -> 0 ; sz( {Sz , _T} ) ->
Sz. %
Find where to put a new prime ( end of the queue ) path ( N ) -> path ( N , [ ] ) . path ( 1 , L ) -> L ; path( N , L ) -> path ( N bsr 1 , [ N band 1 | L ] ) . %
Add a newly - discovered prime add ( empty , Prime ) -> { 1 , leaf ( np ( Prime ) ) } ; add ( {Sz , T} , Prime ) ->
{ Sz + 1 , add( T , Prime , path ( Sz + 1 ) ) }. % ... follow the path to the nil !
add ( nil , Prime , [ ] ) -> leaf ( np ( Prime ) ) ; add ( {P , L , R} , Prime , [ 0 | Path ] ) -> { P , add(L , Prime , Path ) , R} ; add ( {P , L , R} , Prime , [ 1 | Path ] ) -> { P , L , add(R , Prime , Path ) }. val ( empty ) -> nothing ; val ( {P , _L , _R} ) -> cur( P ) ; val ( {_Sz , { P , _L , _R}} ) -> cur ( P ) .
Now there are two things to do when cranking through candidate primes .
If your candidate is in fact a prime , you need to add it to the queue ( in the form of one of those tuples ) .
If it ’s not a prime , you ’ve “ used up ” the minimum known composite number so you need to get a new one .
Well it turns out that of course your primes will sometimes generate overlapping composite numbers – both 2 and 3 will give you 12 , for example .
Thus when you need to “ bump ” the prime queue up to the next useful value , you need to keep working until the new minimum composite number is bigger than the one you just threw away .
To “ bump ” the queue , then , we ’ll roll to the next composite provided by the prime at the top of the queue .
But now of course the heap may not be a heap , so we need to “ fix ” it .
The “ bump - fix ” needs to repeat until we ’ve got a good new minimum .
Thus , the “ bump ” code :
% Gen next composite number from topmost prime , adjust heap bump ( { Sz , T} , N ) -> { Sz , bumpt ( T , N ) }. bumpt( {P , L , R} = T , V ) -> case cur( P ) of Vp when Vp =< V -> bumpt ( fix ( {next ( P ) , L , R} ) , V ) ; _ ->
T end .
% adjust heap by swapping primes down until it's a heap again fix ( {_P , nil , nil} = T ) -> T ; fix ( {P , { Pl , nil , nil} , nil} = T ) -> case { cur ( P ) , cur ( Pl ) } of {V , Vl} when V < Vl -> T ; _ ->
{ Pl , {P , nil , nil} , nil} end ; fix ( {P , { Pl , Ll , Rl} = L , { Pr , Lr , Rr} = R} = T ) -> case { cur ( P ) , cur ( Pl ) , cur ( Pr ) } of {V , Vl , Vr} when V < Vl , V < Vr -> T ; {_V , Vl , Vr} when Vl < Vr -> { Pl , fix ( {P , Ll , Rl} ) , R} ; _ ->
{ Pr , L , fix ( {P , Lr , Rr} ) } end .
The main “ primes ” routine ( which just counts primes up to some limit ) is therefore :
primes ( Max ) -> primes ( newQ ( ) , 2 , Max ) .
primes ( Q , N , Max ) when N >= Max -> sz ( Q ) ; primes ( Q , N , Max ) -> primes ( case val ( Q ) of N -> bump( Q , N ) ; _ -> add ( Q , N ) end , N + 1 , Max ) .
I did this up in Scheme , and it was kind - of messy and gross .
Of course I do n’t really know much Scheme , but the hurdle was the representation of the prime tuples and stuff like that .
It took a lot of ugly little “ ( caddr foo ) ” functions .
Then I moved on to Clojure .
Clojure is a neat -o Lisp dialect that runs on the Java VM .
Here I ’m not really exploting any Java stuff .
I did however exploit some of the useful built - in “ lazy ” features :
( def countprimes ( fn [ Max ] ( let [ ; The representation of " composites from prime P " is a ; Clojure lazy sequence , made by mapping a function to ; multiply the prime by each of a lazy sequence , counting ; up from the prime .
countFrom ( fn [ Start ] ( iterate #(+ 1 %) Start ) ) composites ( fn [ Prime ] ( iterate #(+ Prime %) (* Prime Prime ) ) ) ;
Tools for manipulating the queue newQ # ^{: size 0} [ nil nil nil ] szQ ( fn [ Q ] ( get ^Q : size ) ) curMin ( fn [ [ Top Left Right ] ] ( if ( nil ? Top ) nil ( first Top ) ) ) ;
Add a newly - discovered prime to the queue .
This entails making ; a new " composites " sequence and dropping into a new leaf node ; at the end of the queue .
add Prime ( let [ ; Binary representation of N , backwards path ( fn [ N ] ( reduce #( list * % 2 %1 ) ( ) ( for [n ( iterate #( quot % 2 ) N ) : while (> n 1 ) ] ( rem n 2 ) ) ) ) ;
Follow the path to the leaf addr ( fn addr [ Np [ Top Left Right ] [ LR & Rest ] ] ( if ( nil ? LR ) [ Np nil nil ] ( if ( == 0 LR ) [ Top ( addr Np Left Rest ) Right ] [ Top Left ( addr Np Right Rest ) ] ) ) ) ] ( fn [ Prime Q ] ( let [ newSz (+ 1 ( szQ Q ) ) ] ( with - meta ( addr ( composites Prime ) Q ( path newSz ) ) { :size newSz} ) ) ) ) ;
Get a new minimum composite , after detecting a non-prime bumpUp ( let [ ; Make sure the heap really is a heap .
Note that there 'll ; never be a node with nil on the left and non-nil on the ; right .
fix ( fn fix [ [ Top Left Right : as Qfixed ] ] ( let [ [ LTop LLeft LRight ] Left [ RTop RLeft RRight ] Right ] ( if ( and ( nil ? LTop ) ( nil ? RTop ) ) Qfixed ( if ( nil ? RTop ) ( if ( <= ( first Top ) ( first LTop ) ) Qfixed [ LTop ( fix [ Top LLeft LRight ] ) Right ] ) ( if ( and ( <= ( first Top ) ( first LTop ) ) ( <= ( first Top ) ( first RTop ) ) ) Qfixed ( if ( <= ( first LTop ) ( first RTop ) ) [ LTop ( fix [ Top LLeft LRight ] ) Right ] [ RTop Left ( fix [ Top RLeft RRight ] ) ] ) ) ) ) ) ) ] ( fn [ Comp Q ] ( let [ sz ( szQ Q ) ] ( with - meta ( loop [ [ Top Left Right : as Qbumped ] Q ] ( if (< Comp ( first Top ) ) Qbumped ( recur ( fix [ ( rest Top ) Left Right ] ) ) ) ) { :size sz} ) ) ) ) ;
It 's either a new prime , or it is n't .
tryNumber ( fn [ Q Candidate ] ( let [ min ( curMin Q ) ] ( if ( nil ? min ) ( add Prime Candidate Q ) ( if (< Candidate min ) ( add Prime Candidate Q ) ( bumpUp Candidate Q ) ) ) ) ) ] ( get ^( reduce tryNumber newQ ( range 2 Max ) ) : size ) ) ) )
Because Clojure supports some " decomposition " forms that make it easy to chop arguments up ( though not quite as easy as in Erlang ) , it 's somewhat neater and less noisy than my amateur Scheme version .
Also in Clojure I can carry the queue size around as a meta property of the queue heap , though there 's some weirdness about that which I do n't completely understand .
( Note - I cleaned up the Clojure source a little bit just now , and added some comments . )
The Erlang version is faster than the Clojure version , if anybody cares .
I strongly suspect that both are much faster than the " check for prime factors " wrong sieve implementations .
Note that in these the operations are all adds , compares , and multiplies - there are no divisions or square roots to compute .
Update :
Thanks , qebab , for the hint , and I 've now gotten rid of the useless multiplications in the composite iterations .
During a medical procedure some time back , my wife ’s doctor told her to stay hydrated and recommended she drink Gatorade or Smartwater .
( Or is it “ Smart water ” ?
Even Glaceau , now a subsidiary of Coca - Cola , ca n’t seem to decide . )
We know from its advertising campaign exactly how Gatorade was invented , and there ’s plenty of evidence to suggest that it actually works .
We also know that the early formulations were so horrible that they made people throw up — i.e. when you stick enough electrolytes in water to make a serious difference , and you do n’t balance it out with something else , the resulting concoction makes people vomit .
Why ?
Well , because it ’s basically salt water .
Smartwater claims to have electrolytes in it .
I ’m sure it has some electrolytes in it , but the question is are there enough to make a medical difference ?
I have serious doubts and can find no evidence to support any claims for Smartwater being any superior to tap water or other bottled waters except for claims by nutcases and obvious shills .
Searching the web for answers is no use .
Almost no - one who cares about bottled water seems to have two brain cells to rub together .
Someone will ask a question on Yahoo Answers or some similar website about the product and get replies from people who have n’t even bothered to read the label ( no , it ’s not probably distilled , it is totally frackingly obviously distilled because it says so on the label ) or joke about how it ’s overpriced on the basis that all bottled water is overpriced .
Yeah dude , I get that , but what do you think the profit margin on soda is ?
Well , it ’s not like I ’ve ever found a useful response to any kind of question on a website like that .
I did find an interesting blog entry on the topic .
Although purportedly about Smartwater , the entry only gets to its alleged subject in the second - last paragraph , being mainly a swipe at bottled waters in general .
When it does criticize Smartwater it seems to lump it in the same category as Gatorade and argues that it ’s overkill for ordinary people .
It did quote a chemist from UCSB ( but Dr. Laverman appeared to be talking about Gatorade , not Smartwater ) , whom I am attempting to contact .
I ’ll update this entry if I receive any more information .
Anyway , I leave you with two bits of information that might be relevant :
Smartwater has some amount of Calcium Chloride , Magnesium Chloride , and Potassium Bicarbonate in it .
First of all , if you dissolve a bunch of this stuff in water , calcium will react with carbonate and precipitate out , and the extra CO2 will make the water fizzy .
There ’s obviously not enough of these salts in Smartwater to have that effect .
Second , you might wonder what this stuff tastes like .
Well , according to Wikipedia , calcium chloride tastes extremely salty , magnesium chloride tastes bitter , and potassium bicarbonate tastes slightly alkaline .
( Other equilibrium products , such as potassium chloride , are also salty . )
Smart water is n’t salty , despite using even saltier salts than Gatorade uses from which we might conclude that it ’s not going to have enough electrolytes to make a difference .
Second , Glaceau ’s other products are all highly dubious .
E.g. its “ Vitamin Water ” is sweetened with “ crystalline fructose ” which sounds really cool , right ?
“ Crystals ” are obviously healthy .
Of course “ crystalline fructose ” is what you get by dehydrating high fructose corn syrup .
If these guys were trying to make a genuinely healthy drink , they sure did n’t try very hard .
So , based on circumstantial evidence at least , Smartwater is a confidence trick .
It ’s certainly not much worse in this respect than any bottled water , but it ’s pretty sad that some doctors seem to have fallen for it .
Post Script
I contacted Glaceau directly and received the following information from Glaceau customer relations :
we add a unique and purposeful combination of electrolytes to smartwater® .
one liter of smartwater® contains 10mg of potassium , 10mg of calcium , and 15 mg of magnesium .
By contrast , Gatorade contains 440 mg of sodium and 120 mg of potassium per litre .
Evian contains 78 mg of calcium , 24mg of magnesium , and 4mg of sodium , but makes no claims about electrolytes .
Indeed , from what I can tell , smartwater contains less in the way of electrolytes than most typical mineral or spring waters you might buy , and probably less than your tap water .
The gristle spells out the word " Allah " in Arabic Diners have been flocking to a restaurant in northern Nigeria to see pieces of meat which the owner says are inscribed with the name of Allah .
What looks like the Arabic word for God and the name of the prophet Muhammad were discovered in pieces of beef by a diner in Birnin Kebbi .
He was about to eat it , when he suddenly noticed the words in the gristle , the restaurant owner said .
A search of the kitchen 's meat revealed three more pieces which bore the names .
The meat was boiled and then fried before being served , owner Kabiru Haliru told newspaper Weekly Trust .
" When the writings were discovered there were some Islamic scholars who come and eat here and they all commented that it was a sign to show that Islam is the only true religion for mankind , " he said .
The restaurant has kept the pieces of meat for visitors to see .
Thousands of people have already gone to the restaurant to see them since they were discovered last week .
A vet told the newspaper the words " defied scientific explanation " .
" Supposing only one piece of meat was found then it would be suspicious , but given the circumstances there is no explanation , " Dr Yakubu Dominic said .

Di Chica Mala
Ho lavorato in tante aziende in questi anni e ho constatato che ovunque , come funghetti velenosi , nascono relazioni tra colleghi , alcune si tramutano in vere e proprie storie d’amore altre restano circoscritte nella categoria “ una botta e via ” .
Mi è capitato di assistere a vere e proprie tragedie che hanno compromesso la carriera di sventurate ragazze le quali , come dice l’autrice del libro qui di fianco , fanno del loro clitoride un vero e proprio “ bottone dell ’ amore ” , o meglio si innamorano sistematicamente di tutti quelli che hanno la fortuna di infilarsi nei loro slip ; la coseguenza è l’inveitabile “ sputtanamento aziendale ” susseguito poi da esaurimento nervoso o crisi di pazzia con scenate in open space .
Per contro ci sono quelle che invece sfruttano il sesso come forma di ricatto per sponsorizzare , alle spalle dello sventurato di turno , la loro scalata ai vertici aziendali ( vedi meegnotting ) .
Una mia ex capa ( stronza e cinica come poche ) aveva distrutto il matrimonio e la famiglia nientepopodimeno che del presidente della nostra società , ed era riuscita ad avere l’ufficio a fianco di quello della di lui moglie e socia in affari , oltretutto più grande e con posizione migliore ( senza aggiungere che prima si trom * * va uno dei figli ) .
Anche dove sto ora ci sono colleghe e colleghi che si frequentano più o meno assiduamente .
Sono spettatrice di pianti , litigate , scene di gelosia del tutto fuori luogo in ambito lavorativo , nonchè di continue visite esptemporanee nel corso della giornata da parte dell ' ” amato bene ” , che ovviamente non produce ma non fa produrre nemmeno la fanciulla in questione .
Ma ci sono anche ragazze che vivono l’esperienza sesso / ufficio in maniera molto sportiva : qualche anno fa due receptionist della mia vecchia azienda si dividevano equamente , nel vero senso della parola , le attenzioni sessuali di un prodigo consulente , da brave sorelline facevano una sera a testa per poi durante il giorno scambiarsi impressioni , dritte e consigli per spremere al meglio quella sex - machine del bellone miracolato .
Fu poi , dopo qualche mese esposto al pubblico ludibrio perchè ebbe un incontro con un altra collega con la quale esibì una rovinosa cilecca ! ( vi fu massima divulgazione della notizia ) .
C’è stata gente che si è seriamente fidanzata con un collega , chi lo ha sposato , ma la mia personale statistica rileva un altissimo tasso di rotture se non separazioni o divorzi .
Ma torniamo all ’oggetto del post , o meglio la gestione del sesso occasionale con potenziali colleghi consenzienti ; Nel manualetto della Dubberley ci sono una serie di consigli che vale la pena seguire qualora si volesse seguire la strada della “ caccia grossa ” al lavoro :
Oggi le donne passano più tempo che mai in ufficio , quindi non c’è da stupirsi che un terzo si accoppi proprio li .
Avete una scusa per per parlare con la vostra potenziale conquista , ci sono alcuni terreni di conversazione comune ( anche fosse solo l’odio per il capo ) e potreste finire a socializzare insieme dopo il lavoro… un ’opportunità da non perdere .
Ma prima di saltare addosso a Mario del marketing , verificate le politiche aziendali sul sesso in vigore nella vostra azienda .
Certe società non lo approvano , soprattutto se la donna se la fa con il boss .
E se voi siete il capo e avete una voglia matta di una notte di sesso folle con qualcuno che vi è gerarchicamente inferiore , sappiate che potreste essere accusate di molestie sessuali .
Partendo dal presupposto che vi sia permesso farlo ( o che volete avere un assaggio di proibito ) , è abbastanza facile ottenere una scopata con uno con cui lavorate .
Andate alle feste aziendali , dopo il lavoro fermatevi al bar e concedetevi un pò di moine davanti alla fotocopiatrice .
Presto scoprirete se il ragazzo sta al gioco .
Altrimenti tiratevi indietro .
E’ meglio che non si ritrovi con una maniaca in ufficio .
Se fate sesso con un collega , è fondamentale che scegliate un partner discreto .
E’ preferibile non passare dal piano delle vendite e sentire i colleghi che imitano i rumori che emettete quando venite .
Ed è meglio non farsi la reputazione della zoccola aziendale .
Il sesso è bello ma danneggiare la propria fama professionale per via di quel che vi accade tra le cosce è miope .
E’ anche particolarmente importante assicurarsi che il prescelto sappia cosa volete prima di cominciare .
E’ molto meno imbarazzante essere sincere sul fatto che volete solo sesso occasionale che gestire un collega innamorato .
Poche cose sono peggiori di dover affrontare qualcuno che vi fa gli occhi dolci ogni giorno , quando a voi and ava bene solo una notte di passione .
The popular mix sharing site Muxtape has been taken offline so that administrators can " sort out a problem with the RIAA , " according to a note that appears on the site .
" For the past several months , we have communicated concerns to Muxtape on behalf of our members , " said an RIAA spokesman via email ( 6:28 pm EST update ) .
" Muxtape has not yet obtained authorization from our member companies to host or stream copies of their sound recordings . "
One of our top ten favorite music websites , Muxtape 's service keeps the mixtape concept alive by allowing anyone to post a mix of up to 12 songs that can be easily shared with a simple URL .
Its interface ( screenshot below ) consists of artist and song titles presented in large fonts , with " buy " links under each song .
Muxtape fans can derivesome hope from the fact that Muxtape 's note predicts the outage will beonly " for a brief period , " but for now , mixes created on the site areunavailable and new mixes cannot be made .
In April , Muxtape founder Justin Oullette downplayed the idea that labels might be upset by the service .
" Labels big and small have told me that they 're excitedabout Muxtape as a model for discovery and ultimately selling music ,
and I think that 's extremely keen , " he told us via email .
" Cassette mixtapes were such a greatway to discover new music before the internet , and I think the lessonswe learned from that era can be carried into this one . "
However , the labels represented by the RIAA nolonger appear willing to give the site a free pass .
When users upload songs toMuxtape , they 're technically infringing on the copyright holder ' sexclusive right to make a copy of the song .
And when Muxtape streamsthe songs to other users , it 's liable for streaming royalties .
Michael Robertson 's old My.MP3.com service allowed users to stream the music they owned on CD only to themselves , and the RIAA shut that down .
Muxtape , which does not require ownership of a CD in order to upload an MP3 , and which allows users to listen to each others ' mixes , couldface a harsher reaction .
However , it 's conceivable that the RIAA has presented Muxtape with a list of stipulations with which they must comply , such as only allowing one song per artist to be uploaded or , in a extreme case , restricting all songs to 30 second samples .

Yet the most telling paradox of the city ’s water crisis is that New Delhi is not entirely lacking in water .
The problem is distribution , hampered by a feeble infrastructure and a lack of resources , concedes Arun Mathur , chief executive of the Jal Board .
The Jal Board estimates that consumers pay no more than 40 percent of the actual cost of water .
Raising the rates is unrealistic for now , as Mr. Mathur well knows .
“ It would be easier to ask people to pay up more if we can make water abundantly available , ” he said .
A proposal to privatize water supply in some neighborhoods met with stiff opposition last year and was dropped .
So the city ’s pipe network remains a punctured mess .
That means , like most everything else in this country , some people have more than enough , and others too little .
The slums built higgledy - piggledy behind Mrs. Prasher ’s neighborhood have no public pipes at all .
The Jal Board sends tankers instead .
The women here waste their days waiting for water , and its arrival sets off desperate wrestling in the streets .
Kamal Krishnan quit her job for the sake of securing her share .
Five days a week , she would clean offices in the next neighborhood .
Five nights a week , she would go home to find no water at home .
The buckets would stand empty .
Finally , her husband ordered her to quit .
And wait .
“ I want to work , but I can ’t , ” she said glumly .
“ I go mad waiting for water . ”
Elsewhere , in the central city , where the nation ’s top politicians have their official homes , the average daily water supply is three times what finally arrives even in Mrs.
Prasher ’s neighborhood .
Mrs. Prasher rations her water day to day as if New Delhi were a desert .
She uses the leftover water from the dog bowl to water the plants .
She recycles soapy water from the laundry to mop the balcony .
And even when she gets it , the quality is another question altogether .
Her well water has turned salty as it has receded over the years .
The water from the private tanker is mucky - brown .
Still , Mrs. Prasher says , she can hardly afford to reject it .
“ Beggars ca n’t be choosers , ” she said .
“ It ’s water . ”
This is the second of a multipart series on the state of the economy and how we got here .
About a decade ago , I was cross-country skiing in Aspen with another trader from Wall Street , a guy named Vince who worked at Bear Stearns .
At the time , Vince was worth perhaps a few million dollars .
Today , he 's worth about 3 or 4 hundred million .
We were as happy as blue jays as we skied through the groves of pine .
At the old Independence Homesite , the once thriving mining camp and stagecoach stop along the Roaring Fork River that became a ghost town once the fast - moving trains came to Aspen and the gold played out , Vince called out to me .
" Hey , Johnny , " he said .
" Let 's stop for a minute . "
I turned to him .
" Wanna know something ? " he asked .
" There 's gonna be a new gold rush .
It 's called swaps and derivatives . "
" What are swaps and derivatives ? " I asked .
" Never heard of 'em . "
" You will , Johnny , " Vince said .
" You will . "
We leaned against a log fallen from a roofless cabin .
" It 's a market that 's gonna be in the trillions of dollars , " he said .
" And it 's gonna be a very esoteric market .
Too hard for lawmakers and regulators to understand .
So lawmakers and regulators wo n't even try .
" It 's gonna be an unregulated and unrestricted market .
We traders are gonna have this gold rush all to ourselves .
Swaps and derivatives are also gonna be hard for auditors to value .
So auditors wo n't bother us either . "
I blinked stupidly .
" Swaps and derivatives are gonna be hard even for the senior executives at the companies we work for to understand .
So our bosses wo n't bother us .
How cool is that ? "
He smiled .
" And guess what ?
Swaps and derivatives are gonna be virtually hidden from the American public .
No class - action investor lawsuits .
No pension funds blowing up .
No stories on the front page of the Wall Street Journal .
No election year calls for reform .
Swaps and derivatives wo n't ever be a campaign issue , because no one will have ever heard of them .
At least not for a while .
I 'll give us 10 years . "
Vince poked my ribs .
" We 're gonna make a ton of money originating and underwriting this shit , and then another ton of money trading this shit .
We 're gonna be able to gamble with borrowed money and take really crazy risks .
How beautiful is that , huh ? "
I nodded .
" But the really beautiful thing is that , if we get into trouble , the American taxpayer is probably going to have to bail us out . "
He paused .
" That is n't true for stocks and bonds , of course . "
He winked .
" Stocks and bonds are fuckin ' old school . "
The late CNBC commentator Seth Tobias once told me , " Hedge funds do not lie .
They have no secrets .
Investment performance over time tells the whole tale . "
Two words resonate : lies ; secrets .
Which brings us to swaps and derivatives .
As the name would imply , derivatives are " derived from " something else .
In calculus , derivatives are measurements of how a function changes when the values of its inputs change .
Loosely speaking , that 's a pretty good definition for what happens on Wall Street , too .
When traders trade derivatives , they are n't trading on the prices of stocks , bonds , treasuries , commodities or foreign currencies — the usual stuff .
They 're trading on things related to , or derived from , " the usual stuff . "
Here 's an example from football :
When most people bet on the Super Bowl , they 're betting on the outcome of the game .
The point spread is usually figured into the bet , so that the team not favored to win is given points or equalized with the favored team .
The oddsmakers in Las Vegas calculate the spread .
But other oddsmakers are also very busy .
They come up with bets , or inputs , for any aspect of the game that ultimately yields the final score .
You can bet on which team has the most passing yardage or rushing yardage , which team has the most tackles or sacks or interceptions , which team kicks the most field goals .
You can even bet on which team wins the coin toss before the game even starts .
Same with derivatives .
On Wall Street , you can bet on anything that goes into the pricing structure of anything else that is formally traded as a registered security .
Currently , some derivatives are exchange - traded , but most are not .
Most trade in secret , in markets called dealer markets , and there are many more flavors of derivatives than Baskin - Robbins ever had ice cream flavors .
I 'll pick just one letter of the alphabet .
How about C ?
Here are just a few flavors of derivatives beginning with the letter C : calendar spreads , capital guarantees , cash - flow matches , collateralized debt obligation , commodity ticks , constant maturity swaps , constant proportion portfolio insurance , contango , contracts for difference , correlation trades , credit default swaps , credit default swap indexes , credit derivatives , credit spreads on bonds , credit spreads on options , credit spread warrants , currency futures and currency swaps .
That 's just one letter of the alphabet .
The total value of derivatives in the derivative markets beginning just with the letter C is in the many trillions of dollars .
Swaps are a type of derivative .
In a swap , two parties agree to exchange one stream of cash flow for another stream of cash flow generated by underlying assets .
Those cash flow streams are called " legs . "
These cash flows are calculated as coming from what 's called a " notional principal amount . "
The notional principal amount is usually backed by a real asset , like a bond .
( But lately , a lot of junk wants to be called bonds . )
Other words for popular bond - type investments in today 's Wall Street parlance are CMOs ( collateralized mortgage obligations ) , CDOs ( collateralized debt obligations ) and SIVs ( structured investment vehicles ) .
But it 's not always a bond or bond wannabe that backs a swap .
It could be a basket of foreign currencies .
It could be a basket of commodities .
Assets indexed to the price of oil are very popular right now , as oil is extremely volatile and hitting new highs almost every day .
The important thing about some of the underlying swap assets is that they can be exotic or opaque .
These particularly weird assets are usually thinly traded or hard to value , and sometimes they are nearly worthless , although this is often not immediately obvious .
Regardless , the underlying asset backing a swap must throw off streams of cash or cash equivalents , at least in the beginning — that 's why they 're called legs .
But legs slow down .
Sometimes they stop .
Ideally , legs work together , like the legs of a centipede .
But sometimes , the centipede goes spastic .
As the assets behind swaps are usually not exchanged between the parties , swaps can create an unfunded exposure with respect to the underlying asset or principal amount .
Parties can earn profits or losses from the price movements of the assets without ever actually having to own or control them or post a penny in collateral for the notional value of the asset .
When used properly , swaps can be used to hedge against certain risks , like big fluctuations in interest rates .
They can also be a sort of insurance against companies going bankrupt and their bonds going into default .
When used improperly , swaps can be used to irresponsibly speculate without ever having to put up any real cash and they can be used to manipulate markets in gross and ugly ways .
Here 's a particularly gross and ugly example pulled from a British Bankers Association report .
The case study cited in the report is now used at the CFA Institute to train certified financial analysts .
Here 's why I 've come to equate swaps and derivatives with lies and secrets :
" The market for credit derivatives is now so large that in many instances the dollar amount for credit derivatives outstanding for a particular bond issue is vastly greater than the actual value of the bonds outstanding .
For example , Company X may have $ 1 billion in outstanding debt and $ 10 billion in credit derivatives outstanding .
If such a company were to default , and the recovery to creditors was only 40 cents on the dollar , then the loss to the investors holding the bonds would be $ 600 million .
However , the loss to the sellers of the credit derivatives would be $ 6 billion .
" Considering this amplification effect , unethical executives could engineer the bankruptcy of their own company , and thus , arrange for their company to needlessly default on their bonds so as to collect on their credit derivatives contracts in secret , offshore accounts .
The trick to pulling this fraud off is that the bankruptcy must be sudden and unexpected , with unavoidable loss in the company 's bonds . "
Sounds a lot like Bear Stearns , does n't it ?
Since their demise , I have heard from more than one credible source that the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns was a highly sophisticated pump - and - dump scheme .
While the Bear Stearns bailout probably cost the American taxpayer something like $ 35 billion , Bear Stearns held credit default contracts carrying an outstanding value of $ 2.5 trillion .
Gulp .
Regardless of the $ 35 billion price tag , the rescue at Bear Stearns did nothing but buy time .
The rescue did nothing to protect the broader economic system .
One could even argue that the federal government 's intervention will ultimately encourage riskier , more speculative behavior on Wall Street .
Maybe even corrupt , criminal behavior .
To avoid this surety , the United States must do the following , and do it quickly :
• Consolidate the regulatory powers of the Federal Reserve Bank , the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission into one agency .
Strengthen existing laws that are vague and ambiguous , and often lead Wall Street into what Barney Frank , chair of the House Financial Services Committee , calls " moral hazards . "
• Define , regulate and restrict swaps and derivatives .
We must reconsider — and as a nation , perhaps publicly consider for the very first time — swaps and derivatives and the shadow banking system in which they trade .
• Wall Street must upgrade IT systems to reduce the backlog of " unprocessed " contracts .
The notional value of these outstanding contracts must not be allowed to exceed the notional value of the deliverable bonds or other underlying asset classes which back them .
• Investment banks such as Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , UBS , etc. , should have to disclose off - balance - sheet risks while also making those firms subject to federal audits , much like commercial banks are required to do .
• Investment banks must set aside reserves for potential losses to provide a private - sector cushion during financial panics .
The American taxpayer can no longer afford to bailout the fat cats of Wall Street .
• The originators of CMOs , CDOs , SIVs and other alternative debt must retain a portion of the loans they make , while also requiring the investment banks who securitize this debt to also retain a big portion .
It is unacceptable for bad loans to be passed on to unsuspecting buyers , like many pension plans .
• Rating agencies , like Moody's , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch must formally distance themselves from the investment banks whose products they are paid to rate .
The nice thing about George Soros , 77 years old and one of the world 's most successful investors and richest men , is that he can afford to be honest .
On April 17 , I flew to the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels to hear Soros speak .
I had no other business in Brussels .
Soros talked about how the proliferation of new and unregulated financial instruments , like swaps and derivatives , created the credit Godzilla that the world is now wrestling with .
" Worse than wrestling , " murmured the Swiss banker sitting next to me .
" More like a SmackDown vs. Raw . "
I was surprised that he knew anything about the WWE .
At the podium , Soros said , " I consider this to be the biggest financial crisis of my lifetime .
The superbubble that has been inflating for the last 25 years is finally bursting . "
Soros warned that the hyperinflating consequences of funny money , like swaps and derivatives , may last through " our lifetime , maybe the lifetimes of our children . "
Soros saw the seizing up of credit markets at about this time last year .
He bet his hedge fund on it .
Seeing something that very few other people saw or intuited , he came into his office and made a few bets .
By the end of the summer , the subprime mess was front - page news , and his last - minute bets paid off roughly $ 4 billion , a 32 percent return for his fund .
Critics generally charge that Soros has a doom - and - gloom attitude .
They further maintain Soros occasionally makes statements that are variously hysterical , reckless , apocalyptic or irrational — comments that have a nasty habit of being taken seriously and spooking financial markets around the world .
But what do critics know ?
They are n't multibillionaires like Soros , are they ?
Money talks .
Bullshit walks .
And guess what ?
It gets a federal bailout , too .

Medical researchers are homing in on a wonder drug that may significantly reduce the risk of heart disease , cancer , diabetes and many other diseases -- sunshine .
A study released today found that men who are deficient in the so - called sunshine vitamin -- vitamin D -- have more than double the normal risk of suffering a heart attack .
Just last week , another study found that low levels of vitamin D increased the risk of diabetes , and a study last month linked deficiencies to an increased risk of dying from breast cancer .
The findings join a growing body of evidence indicating that an adequate level of the vitamin , which many people can get from 20 minutes in the sun , is crucial to maintaining good health .

Not every scientist agrees that vitamin D is so crucial to well - being , and there is controversy about what should be considered an adequate level of the compound in the blood .
But sentiment is gradually shifting toward a higher intake .
“ We do n’t have a cause and effect relationship here yet ” proving that higher doses of vitamin D prevent such diseases , said biochemist Hector DeLuca of the University of Wisconsin , who was the first to demonstrate how the vitamin interacts with the endocrine system , which manages the body ’s hormonal balance .
But the links are so suggestive “ that we have to pay attention to keeping blood levels up where they will protect , ” he said .
Until the protective effect is proved , he added , “ what ’s wrong with keeping an adequate level of vitamin D in the blood in case it is ? ”
Until recently , vitamin D was viewed primarily as a protective agent against diseases of the bone , such as osteomalacia ( known as rickets in children ) and osteoporosis .
Current recommendations for the vitamin are based on preventing these disorders and call for a relatively small intake -- a minimum of 400 international units , or IUs , per day , and perhaps twice that for the elderly , who may not get outdoors as often .
Advertisement
The vitamin is produced from natural precursors in the body by exposing skin to ultraviolet B in sunlight .
Caucasian sunbathers can get 20,000 IUs in 20 minutes at noon in summer .
But any further exposure simply damages skin .
Darker - skinned people need three to five times the exposure to produce the same amount .
Sunblock interferes with production by screening out ultraviolet light .
The primary sources of vitamin D in the diet are milk , which is fortified to yield about 100 IUs per glass , and oily fishes , which have a high content .
To have an adequate intake , most people must take supplements or spend more time in the sun -- a recommendation that dermatologists generally oppose because of the risk of skin cancer .
Advertisement
Current guidelines call for blood levels of about 30 nanograms per milliliter .
By that definition , perhaps 10 % to 15 % of white people in the U.S. and 50 % of the black population is deficient in summer , with the percentages rising in winter when there is less sunlight .
Many researchers say that people should be striving for average blood levels of 50 to 60 nanograms per milliliter , at which level the bulk of the U.S. population would be considered deficient .
Most researchers in the field now take supplements of at least 1,500 IUs per day .
Most recommend taking no more than 4,000 IUs because of potential toxicity .
Experts attribute the vitamin D deficiency , in part , to modern lifestyles , which have taken people off the farm and into offices and factories .
Video games and computers have brought children indoors from the playing field , minimizing their exposure to sunlight .
Fear of cancer and increasing use of sunblock may also have contributed .

In the new analysis , Dr. Edward Giovannucci of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues studied 18,225 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow - Up Study , a subgroup of a much larger ongoing study .
The men all submitted blood samples when they enrolled in the study , mostly in 1993 to 1995 , and the samples were stored .
In 10 years of follow - up , the team identified 454 men who had a heart attack .
They carefully matched these men with about 900 other study members who did not have an attack , then measured vitamin D levels at study entry .
They reported in the current issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine that men with blood levels below 15 nanograms per milliliter had 2 1 / 2 times the risk of having an attack or dying .
When they controlled for all other possible factors , such as hypertension , obesity and high lipid levels , the risk was still twice as high as it was for the controls .
Advertisement
Men with levels between 15 and 29 nanograms per milliliter also had an increased risk .
Unfortunately , Giovannucci said , there were not enough men in the group with levels above 35 nanograms per milliliter to determine whether higher levels are more protective .
The findings are “ not out of left field , ” he said .
Many epidemiological studies have found a higher rate of heart attacks at higher latitudes , lower altitudes and in winter -- all of which correlate to decreased exposure to sunshine .
About 869,000 Americans die of heart disease each year , according to the American Heart Assn .
“ They certainly have made the link between diabetes and cardiovascular disease , ” said Dr. Mason Weiss , a cardiologist at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood , who was not involved in the study .
“ Now the research must be on what the mechanism is . ”
Advertisement
Giovannucci speculated that several mechanisms could be responsible .
Previous studies have suggested , for example , that low vitamin D levels lead to a buildup of calcium in atherosclerotic plaques on the walls of arteries , increasing the risk of heart attacks .
It could also affect blood pressure , or even have a direct effect on functioning of heart muscles , making them more susceptible to arrhythmias .
“ We obviously need to understand the mechanism better , ” he said .
“ But that requires randomized trials , which is a big undertaking . ”
Weiss joined the growing chorus of researchers calling for changes in federal guidelines to reflect the new data .

“ The next time they review the daily requirements , they should look at all these articles , ” he said .
Increasing the recommended intake of vitamin D “ could have a significant health benefit ” and would be a cost - effective change .

The sunshine vitamin
A growing body of evidence suggests that people who are deficient in vitamin D have higher risks of cancer , diabetes , autoimmune diseases and , according to the most recent study , heart attacks .
Here ’s what you need to know :

Levels
* Current recommendations call for an intake of 400 IUs , or international units , for most people , twice that for the elderly .
* Recommended blood levels are about 30 nanograms per milliliter .
* Many researchers recommend consuming 1,500 to 2,000 IUs per day and attaining blood levels of 50 to 60 nanograms per milliliter .

Sources
* Ultraviolet B in sunlight converts natural precursors in the body into vitamin D. Sunbathing at noon in summer produces 20,000 IUs in 20 minutes in Caucasians .
Additional exposure simply damages the skin .
Darker - skinned people require three to five times as much exposure to produce the same amount .
Sunblock interferes with production .
* The primary dietary source is oily fish and fortified milk , margarine and fortified cereal .
Fish has about 350 IUs per serving .
Milk contains about 100 IUs per glass , and margarine has about 60 IUs per tablespoon .

There is a terrible irony unfolding in Bosnia .
Radovan Karadzic is at last on his way to the Hague .
But the division of Bosnia that was his dream is now more likely than at any time since he became a fugitive .
I flew into Sarajevo the day after Karadzic was arrested , expecting to find a city in celebration because the architect of their four - year torment from the Serb guns , which killed 10,000 in the Sarajevo siege , was behind bars .
But , after a brief flurry of jubilation , the mood is sombre .
For people know that , after 10 years of progress which made Bosnia the world 's most successful exercise in post - conflict reconstruction , there is a real threat of Bosnia breaking up again .
But now this is happening not because of aggression from outside , but because of weariness and misjudgment of the international community which is still supposed to be guiding Bosnia to its future .
I think Washington sees the danger , but am not at all sure Brussels does .
They think Bosnia is done .
Their policy now is ' do n't rock the boat in Bosnia ' while we deal with Kosovo and Belgrade .
This is not just tactically wrong , it is strategically disastrous .
If the past 20 years have taught us anything , it is that , when it comes to trouble , Bosnia is the fulcrum of the Balkans .
Kosovo was never going to be easy , but it was short term and solvable .
Belgrade is always going to be central and often going to be difficult .
But though Serbia has exported conflict , it has not in recent years been its seat .
That , down the centuries , has always been Bosnia , where even a brief spell of wrong - headedness can quickly become the prelude to enduring tragedy .
You do not need imagination to know what happens when things go wrong in Bosnia - a memory ought to be enough .
Bosnia 's predominantly Serb entity , Republika Srpska , Karadzic 's creation , has seen the vacuum where will and policy should be .
Its premier , Milorad Dodik , is now aggressively reversing a decade of reforms .
He has set up the parallel institutions and sent delegations to Montenegro to find out how they broke away .
He has used the autonomy granted by the Dayton Agreement to undermine the Bosnia Dayton envisaged .
We do not have to speculate on his intentions , for he has said them himself .
He does not think Bosnia can survive and does not want it to .
He does not regard Republika Srpska as part of a state , but as a state in itself .
To be fair , Dodik has been firmly anti-Karadzic .
He is not that kind of Serb nationalist .
He is taking advantage of our short attention span .
His control over his mini-state is becoming more and more centralist , while its institutions are more and more subject to serious accusations of corruption .
His aim is certainly complete autonomy and , probably , ultimate secession as soon as the international community leaves or loses interest .
Which could start midway through next year with the closure of the Office of the High Representative and the end of its executive powers .
Bosnia was the crucible in which the EU 's foreign policy instruments were created .
With an EU military force still here , a EU special representative with executive powers , a huge EU aid budget and a full - scale EU police mission , the EU has more leverage in Bosnia than in any other country .
What will it say about the EU 's pretensions if we will not act effectively to stop this bust - up happening ?
Bosnia 's entry into the EU's Stabilisation and Association Agreement , while welcome , will not by itself change this dynamic , unless Brussels gives him more backing .
Chris Patten , when a European commissioner , used to say the danger was that the Balkans pretended to reform and the EU pretended to believe them .
Now some in Bosnia do not even pretend to reform , but the EU still pretends to believe them .
European conditionality used to be a lever for reform in Bosnia .
It is becoming less and less so .
On all sides , the commitment to Europe among Bosnia 's leaders takes second place to the preservation of corrupt fiefdoms .
The problem is that Dodik is the only man with a plan .
The Croats wait and see ; the Bosniaks ( Muslims ) squabble among themselves .
Their leaders , from President Haris Silajdzic down , need to start putting the public 's interest before their own .
And they need above all to start living in the present , not the past , and stop believing that because they are victims they do not need a strategy , that the international community will always ride over the hill to save them .
This is fatally to misjudge the will of the international community post Iraq and Afghanistan .
If Bosnia 's Muslims will not even coherently help themselves , they cannot expect others to do it for them .
Meanwhile , in European capitals the growing view goes like this .
We invested 13 years of hard work and huge resource in Bosnia .
Now it is stable and peaceful and we are rather tired .
Kosovo has proved it is possible to divide a country .
What matter if Bosnia becomes another Cyprus ?
We do n't want it , of course , but are not really prepared to do much to stop it happening .
This is folly of a very dangerous order .
What happens to the Muslim populations who have moved back to Republika Srpska , even to Srebrenica , if they are handed back to an exclusively Serb - dominated regime ?
What happens to Bosnia 's shining star , the multi-ethnic , markedly successful sub-entity of Brcko , hemmed in by Republika Srpska ?
Is it to be handed over , too ?
I do not believe Bosnia is likely to go back to conflict ; most of its people are just too war - weary .
But the one event that could change that calculation in favour of blood would be to return to the old Karadzic / Milosevic plan to divide Bosnia - what started it all back in 1992 .
And the consequences would not end with the Serbs .
The Croats in the south have always wanted their own space .
If Republika Srpska breaks away , they will too .
This would leave only central Bosnia as a home for its Muslims .
What does it say to the Islamic world if , having once failed to protect Bosnia 's Muslims from annihilation , we now fail to stand up for their right to live as part ( the largest part , incidentally ) of a democratic , multi-ethnic state ?
Or if we again stand idly by while they are reduced to a rump pocket of Islam in a part of Europe surrounded by hostility and enmity ?
It is always more difficult , especially in the Balkans , to defend the preservation of multi-ethnic spaces and resist the creation of mono -ethnic ones .
But to do otherwise is always folly and nearly always ends in blood .
Bosnia is going backwards again .
The EU must stop running its policy for Bosnia for the benefit of its policy for Belgrade and Kosovo .
Brussels must toughen up its conditionality , support its instruments on the ground , resist attempts to undermine the Bosnian state , insist on constitutional reform to make Bosnia more functional and tackle corruption which is becoming ever more embedded .
It should also tell Belgrade that a key condition for progress towards Europe will be to support the Bosnian state and give no succour to those who seek to undermine it .
I 'm sorry if this disturbs comfortable slumber of some capitals , especially in Europe .
But I know of no way to whisper a wake - up call and no words to describe the pain that will ensue if Europe , once again , misjudges or misunderstands what is happening in Bosnia .

Convicted ELF eco-terrorist Eric McDavid
KCRA News ( 5 - 8-08 ) reports :
A man convicted of conspiracy in an eco-terror case was sentenced Thursday to 19 years and seven months in prison , U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said .
Eric McDavid , 30 , was convicted in March of conspiring to damage or destroy property by fire and an explosive .
The suspected Earth Liberation Front member threatened to bomb Nimbus Dam and the forest service building in Placerville .
" Today 's severe punishment of nearly 20 years in federal prison should serve as a cautionary tale to those who would conspire to commit life - threatening acts in the name of their extremist views , " Scott said in a statement .

The FBI ( 6-30 - 08 ) has published an article about McDavid 's case titled " PUTTING INTEL TO WORK Against ELF and ALF Terrorists " :
In early 2006 , eco-terrorist Eric McDavid and two associates met in a secluded cabin in Dutch Flat , California to discuss making improvised explosive devices and to choose targets to bomb .
Soon after , they began casing the targeted facilities and buying supplies to make bombs .
But before they started mixing the ingredients , we swooped in and arrested them .
How did we know what McDavid was up to ?
How were we able to prevent attacks that could have caused thousands or millions of dollars in property damage and possibly harmed people ?
In a word , intelligence .
Our intelligence — which included the use of an FBI source who was actually with McDavid and his associates inside that California cabin — allowed us to piece together the entire plot ahead of time .
...[ E] co-terrorists and animal rights extremists are one of the most serious domestic terrorism threats in the U.S. today … for several good reasons :
- The sheer volume of their crimes ( over 2,000 since 1979 ) ;
- The huge economic impact ( losses of more than $ 110 million since 1979 ) ;
- The wide range of victims ( from international corporations to lumber companies to animal testing facilities to genetic research firms ) ; and
- Their increasingly violent rhetoric and tactics ( one recent communiqué sent to a California product testing company said : “ You might be able to protect your buildings , but can you protect the homes of every employee ? ” ) .
ELF and ALF are probably the names you ’re most familiar with .
The Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) and the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) are loosely - organized movements whose adherents engage in crimes like arson , fire bombings , vandalism , intimidation , assaults , stalking , etc .
No membership dues are necessary — the only way to become a “ member ” is to engage in “ direct action ” … criminal activity designed to cause economic loss or destroy the victim company ’s operations .
... So whatever happened to Eric McDavid ?
In May , he was sentenced to nearly 20 years in federal prison .

From today ’s Wall Street Journal :
Texas had some of the cheapest power rates in the country when it zapped most of the state ’s electric regulations six years ago , convinced that rollicking competition would drive prices even lower .
This summer , electricity there is some of the nation ’s priciest .
Power costs are rising in the rest of the U.S. , but everything is bigger in Texas :
On a hot day in May , wholesale prices rose briefly to more than $ 4 a kilowatt hour — about 40 times the national average .
Deregulation is was supposed to bring prices down .
What happened ?
The Journal ’s research cites the following :
– Rising fuel costs are part of the problem ( power generators use natural gas )
– Texas ’ electricity demand is the highest in the nation .
Is infrastructure was n’t designed to accommodate the freewheeling demand , so there are transmission problems
After deregulating its electricity , Texas ’ utilities companies saw several changes .
A handful of electricity retailers and small businesses collapsed .
They transferred customer accounts to bigger , more expensive retailers .
The plan that promised Texans more choices and lower rates has had the opposite effect .
Poor planning ( even Texas ’ newer , more efficient plants still use natural gas ) , a free economy that created a rash of middlemen , many of them unexperienced , and expensive daily auctions add to the mess .
Question of the day : Can electricity successfully be deregulated ?
We ’re going to face questions like these more and more as various energy industries pop up to replace oil .

Data from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2004 : drug use in the last year .
Credit : Sullivan , et al. © 2008 The Royal Society .
From chocolate and caffeine to nicotine and cocaine , many of our most addictive foods and drugs come from plant toxins .
Considering that plants originally developed these toxins to deter herbivorous predators , it ’s ironic that humans and other mammals do n’t merely tolerate the toxins , but can crave them and even develop dependencies on them .
This paradox , presented by researchers in a new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B , works both ways : supposedly , the plants should never have developed toxins that reward animals for eating them , and humans should never have developed a reward mechanism for toxic plants .
In their study , Roger Sullivan from California State University and the UC Davis School of Medicine , Edward Hagen from Washington State University , and Peter Hammerstein from Humboldt University in Berlin suggest that the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation of human drug reward might not be on the right track , and that the origins of drug addiction may be even more complicated than previously thought .
“ The greatest significance of the paper is in defining the paradox , and laying out the arguments in a manner that shows that it is a real conundrum and not a straw man argument , ” Sullivan told PhysOrg.com .
“ The paradox has deep implications for current drug reward theory because it implicitly suggests that many of the key assumptions in current drug reward theory are flawed . ”
Throughout history , plants have created their toxins by mimicking their own molecules that regulate metabolism , growth and reproduction .
When ingested by herbivores , some of these molecules can interfere with nearly every step in the animal ’s neural signaling process .
In current evolutionary interpretations of drug addiction , these toxic substances trigger the brain ’s reward center by rewiring the brain ’s natural reward circuits , and falsely indicating a fitness benefit and blocking painful feelings .
But , as Sullivan , Hagen , and Hammerstein show , this explanation makes several assumptions that contradict evidence from previous studies .
Most significantly , it assumes that humans evolved in environments without exposure to drugs , and that the brain never evolved to protect itself from plant toxins .
However , the researchers point to several other studies which show that the detoxification enzymes developed by animals ( and which originally evolved in bacteria about 3.5 billion years ago ) expanded in animals about 400 million years ago – about the same time that plants were evolving their own toxins .
In other words , animals and plants seemed to have coevolved competitive genes in response to each other , which contradicts the evolutionary interpretation .
As the researchers investigated further , they compiled other studies showing evidence that humans inherited these detox genes from their mammalian ancestors .
Interestingly , although many modern animal species can tolerate plant toxins , different species possess different detox function levels .
Even among humans from different geographic locations , these functions differ .
Often , human populations with greater numbers of toxin - metabolizing genes originate from parts of the world that contain an abundance of those plants .
For example , human populations in and near Turkey have a very high frequency of enzymes that can metabolize opiates , and the opiate poppy is native to the Turkish region .
To conclude their argument against the evolutionary interpretation , the researchers explain that ( pre-human ) animals and plants did appear to have evolved the relevant genes simultaneously .
If that ’s the case , then the brain should n’t treat drugs as if they contained a fitness benefit , giving strong support to the paradox .
“ We have been surprised by how robust the paradox is – that is , in presenting the arguments at scientific meetings for several years now , no one has been able to refute the basic argument that plant ecological models and neurobiological models of drug use are in direct conflict , ” Sullivan said .
Many more questions also remain unanswered , but they may contain clues to an explanation .
For example , there is contradictory evidence for whether commonly used drugs have become more or less potent as they ’ve been domesticated .
Also , as the researchers point out , current models explaining drug reward mechanisms do n’t differentiate between different drugs – even though the pathways taken by opiates , cannabis , or any other drug are vastly different .
Models of multiple - drug pathways might better explain drug appeal , the scientists suggest .
Based on evidence from previous studies , Sullivan , Hagen , and Hammerstein note that plant toxins may actually have some kind of benefit for animals .
For instance , because plant toxins are more harmful to some species than to others , the less affected species might actually consume levels of toxin that are tolerable to themselves but much worse for the parasites or pathogens that feed on them in order to protect themselves .
For example , earlier humans that consumed nicotine ( in much smaller amounts than today ) could have received the benefit of fewer parasitic infections .
Of course , the benefits also come with trade - offs .
“ The main implications for future research are that neurobiological theorists must consider facts emerging from plant ecology , ” Sullivan said .
“ We are also planning field studies looking for relationships between human drug use and protection from helminth parasites . ”

Here ’s a guy who figured out how to be both the luckiest and unluckiest man on the face of the earth at the same time .
One crazy afternoon in June of last year , maintenance man Degli Martinez learned he had won a $ 65 million Lotto jackpot – the largest single prize in the 30 - year history of the state Lotto game .
He then promptly lost the ticket .
That began a yearlong odyssey of hand - wringing and heartburn before Lottery officials were finally able to hand Martinez his check yesterday .
SEE THE PHOTOS : Lotto Winner Collects !
“ It was a lot of pain waiting , ” said the 55 - year - old Paraguayan immigrant at a lower Manhattan press conference .
Martinez ’s wild tale began on June 29 , 2007 , when he bought a handful of tickets at a minimart in Sunnyside .
He returned the following day and had store clerk Supriyo Bhattacharjee scan the ticket bar codes to check for winners .
Bhattacharjee found a $ 2 winner and a couple of losers and then his eyes widened with surprise .

“ He was the jackpot winner ! ” the clerk recalled yesterday .
Bhattacharjee printed a receipt , handed it to Martinez and urged him to go to the Lottery office in lower Manhattan to claim his winnings as soon as possible .
Martinez headed home but accidentally tossed the ticket in the trash .
He still had the receipt , and Lottery officials confirmed the winning ticket had been sold at the store .
But Martinez had to cool his heels for a year because , by law , whoever turned in the actual ticket would be entitled to collect , and officials had to make sure no one did so by the 365 - day deadline .
Martinez , a maintenance man at a posh Park Avenue apartment building , and wife Maria waited with bated breath .
“ I was nervous .
You never know how these things will turn out , ” Maria said .
Finally the deadline passed and Martinez was declared the winner .
He opted for a lump - sum payment that – after taxes – amounts to $ 21,176,066 .
He said he was n’t sure exactly what he was going to do with the money – except pay his daughter ’s college tuition .
And he is n’t ready to quit his job .
“ For now I ’m going back to work .
At least until I can find someone to replace me .
It ’s hard to leave a job you love , ” he said .
Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Hapeman said that about $ 70 million in prize money goes unclaimed annually .
Also collecting yesterday was 59 - year - old home health aide Linda Holley of The Bronx , who won a $ 19 million Lotto jackpot in May .
“ I thank the Lord for allowing me to win this , ” she said .

Why they have n't attacked us again .
They 're foreclosing on our safe house .
I lost my student loan for flight school .
The truck bomb is out of gas .
As about 30 countries scramble to protect their citizens from hunger by limiting food exports , the title of a front - page New York Times article calls out : " Hoarding Nations Drive Food Costs Ever Higher . "
But where does responsible government action end and hoarding begin ?
( If the Irish government had begun a little hoarding instead of exporting grain in 1845 , many deaths could have been avoided in the Irish potato famine . )
It 's not an easy question to answer , suggesting as it does that it might be a perfect time to ask how countries got into this no -win , export - or - not quandary to begin with .
Part of the answer is the longstanding premise , proposed by international lending agencies , that nations should use their farmland to grow what 's most profitable in world trade and use the proceeds to import food as needed .
For decades countries have been " encouraged " -- even by making it a condition of a needed loan -- to use prime farmland to grow luxury and non-food items from coffee to cut flowers for export , and to adopt an agricultural model dependent on imported fertilizers , pesticides , and seeds .
Surely today 's deepening crisis reveals the danger here .
The end of hunger and real food security require provisioning from domestic resources wherever possible .
This approach , combined with a solid international grain reserve to be released in response to unforeseeable setbacks , has the best chance of assuring adequate food supplies .
Could we Americans ever breathe easy if we were dependent on imported food for our very survival ?
I doubt that any people could .
Why is that " energy independence " is embraced by the left and right , but you never even hear anyone utter the phrase " food independence ? "
Analysts go on vying to tease out the varied pieces of the puzzle of today 's renewed hunger crisis :
Is it " hoarding " that 's to be blamed ?
Is it heightened speculation ?
Is it the growing Asian elite 's market - demand for grain - fed meat ?
The rising price of oil ?
The diversion of food to produce agrofuel ?
But these questions avoid asking why we have failed to end hunger even in the good times .

For years , the world 's more - than - ample supply of food -- keeping well ahead of population growth -- has left over 800 million hungry .
Because we 've not grasped the root causes , today 's prices risk pushing another one hundred million people into the ranks of the hungry .
No amount of lifting of agricultural trade barriers will address this longstanding , now intensified , crisis .
Understanding hunger begins here :
In our world where the bottom 40 percent of us have to survive on just over three percent of world income and eight in ten live in societies where inequalities are worsening , the real " hoarding " is done by those with vastly disproportional income :
Their market demand diverts 37 percent of the world 's grain and about a third of the world fish catch to livestock , and now almost a third of U.S. corn to ethanol .
How could this extreme and worsening inequality happen ?
Because of our thin concept of democracy -- that elected government plus a one - rule economy ( highest return to existing wealth ) are all we need to meet human needs .
As a result , economic and political power concentrate in such a way that policies emerge which defy the values and common - sense of most citizens .
For , where are everyday citizens who would choose to have their survival dependent on the vagaries of volatile international markets ?
Nowhere .
Thus , our hunger crisis is actually a democracy crisis .
Hunger can be eliminated only as we remove the influence of concentrated wealth over public choices and ensure the ongoing , healthy distribution of power .
The sooner we start recasting the crisis thusly , the sooner we 'll all be able to thrive .
DIGG THIS
I must admit that I think most members of Congress are economic dunces who would be lucky to pass one of my introductory courses in economics .
Time and again , we see the typical Congressman ( or woman ) making statements that boggle the mind , and so I find myself concluding that perhaps they simply are stupid and in need of education .
However , the older I become , the more I realize that the political classes really are not interested in economic education .
They have had Ron Paul giving them almost daily lessons that would rival any good content from a Harvard doctorate in the subject , but he always is seen as a fringe character .
Thus , I finally have come to realize that these are people who really could n’t care less about the economic damage that they do .
The latest frenzy about oil speculation is a good case in point .
As Robert Novak recently pointed out in the Washington Post , Congress seems to be trying to convince everyone that the fundamental price ( governed by supply and demand ) actually would be about half of what it is if it were not for those darn speculators :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , back from the Fourth of July break last week , delivered a typical harangue on Republican obstructionism and Democratic virtue that included a promise :
By week ’s end , he would show Republicans his proposal to deal with “ this speculation thing ” that he calls the root cause of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline .
It would attempt “ to end speculation on the oil markets . ”
Novak later writes :
A current embodiment can be found in Rep. Bart Stupak , a former Michigan state trooper now in his 16th year of representing his state ’s Upper Peninsula .
A centrist Democrat , he is what Speaker Sam Rayburn once referred to as a “ workhorse ” rather than a “ show horse . ”
As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee ’s oversight and investigations subcommittee , he has made “ excessive speculation in the energy markets ” his signature issue the past three years .
Stupak has introduced bills tilting at the speculative windmill with all manner of tight federal regulation over commodities markets .
Testifying last Wednesday before the House Agriculture Committee about this need , he rejected supply and demand as having pushed up oil prices .
The star witness before Stupak ’s committee two weeks earlier was Michael W. Masters , a hedge fund operator headquartered in Christiansted , Virgin Islands .
Hardly anybody had heard of him prior to his appearance before Congress beginning May 20 to sing songs Democrats wanted to hear .
He said at Stupak ’s subcommittee ’s June 23 hearing that federal regulation would drop the price of oil $ 65 to $ 70 a barrel in a month — a claim viewed as preposterous by economists I consulted .
While Masters swore that his firm does not deal in oil futures , BusinessWeek reported June 27 that he “ has a keen financial interest in lower oil prices ” because of his portfolio’s heavy stakes in airlines and autos .
Given that the airlines recently were repeating this mantra , one thinks that it could be a situation in which a falsehood is repeated enough times until people believe it .
However , most airline executives are not as stupid as members of Congress , and most members of Congress , while not exactly near the top in intelligence , nonetheless are extremely cunning characters , and I believe that this latest assault on speculation is something that needs to be more closely examined .
First , as Robert Murphy has demolished that argument , as well as other economists , the notion that traders suddenly have decided that they can make the big bucks selling oil futures back and forth like a hot potato is pretty silly .
( Granted , it is paraded as truth in the halls of Congress , which is even more proof that it is a silly idea , as good ideas generally get traction on Capitol Hill . )
Second , turning Congress loose on commodities traders is going to step on the turf of Sen. Dick Durban of Illinois , who is seen as a guardian of the Chicago Board of Trade .
However , it is that point that is relevant here .
We have to look at an alternative argument , and Fred McChesney provides it .
In the January 1998 edition of The Freeman , McChesney wrote in " High Plains Drifters : Politicians ’ Lucrative Protection Racket " that what we think we are seeing might not be the case .
We believe we are watching an orgy of economic illiteracy , and certainly what comes out of recent congressional hearings on oil prices qualifies for that category .
However , even members of Congress can see that they are strangling domestic production and refining of oil at every turn and the U.S. Government ’s " war on terror " has spooked the markets , since a huge percentage of the world ’s oil is transported through the Persian Gulf .
Furthermore , the Federal Reserve has turned loose the dogs of inflation , and with the housing and stock markets moribund , the new money is moving ( surprise , surprise ) into commodities and consumer prices .
Yet , why would Congress now be blaming the speculators ?
Yes , blaming speculators has been a favorite sport ever since the Middle Ages , but I always thought that the modern political classes believed themselves to be more intelligent and sophisticated than decision makers of yore .
McChesney points to a different reason : extortion .
Exploitative behavior need not involve stealth , as typifies theft .
Take blackmail , where Person A agrees to forbear from some perfectly legal action in exchange for payment from Person B .
For example , A may know of B ’s extramarital affair and threaten to reveal it to B ’s spouse and the rest of the world ( as A is perfectly free to do ) , but agrees not to tattle in exchange for money .
Superficially , the transaction resembles a contract , but there is a crucial difference .
Commercial contracts between A and B would leave both better off than they were before A came on the scene .
But B agrees to a blackmail deal to avoid being made worse off by A ’s intrusion .
When Bill Cosby contracts with a production company or television network , he gains ; had he acceded to the demands of his alleged daughter , he would have been paying protection money to avoid her attempts to make him worse off .
Had model Elle Macpherson agreed to the alleged demands for money in exchange for a promise not to post nude photos of her on the Internet , she likewise would have been paying to avoid being made worse off , not to gain .
So , too , with politicians .
They may well take payments to make private parties better off , such as providing tariffs or subsidies .
Occasionally , these payments cross the legal line and are actionable as bribery .
Prosecutions are few and far between .
They largely target not the true substance of the transaction — payment for special favors — but some failure to follow the prescribed legal methods of payment for the favors .
Campaign - spending laws provide the blueprint for perfectly legal bribery .
But a politician has an alternative for raising money : selling protection .
( emphasis mine )
He can agree not to do something that otherwise he says he would do , something that would reduce the wealth of the potential donor .
The most obvious burden that can be threatened is a tax , but there are any number of others that a politician can propose and then withdraw for a price .
A private citizen will be just as willing to pay for a special favor worth $ 1 million as he will to avoid a $ 1 million tax .
( This assumes constant marginal utility of wealth ; with declining marginal utility of wealth , a citizen will pay more to avoid the $ 1 million loss than for the $ 1 million gain . )
This , then , is the essence of the political protection racket .
Superficially , selling special favors and selling protection do look the same : payment is made to the politician in both cases .
But in the extortion racket , citizens are made to pay , not for special favors from Uncle Sugar , but to protect private wealth that they have earned the old - fashioned way , outside the political process .
He goes on to point out that legislators around the country have special names for bills that are designed to damage specific industries or organizations — if they actually are passed .
I say " if " because there is a way that these organizations can stop or slow down the legislative juggernaut , and that is to pay up .
McChesney writes :
One observes this sort of protection being sold routinely , at all levels of government .
Legislative extortion is commonly practiced through so - called " milker bills , " to use a term popular in California .
A bill is drafted and submitted , not because there is any legitimate need for it , but because it threatens some private person or group that predictably will pay to have the bill withdrawn .
" Juice bills " is another term for those legislative proposals intended to squeeze private interests for cash .
In Illinois , the name " fetcher bill " is apparently the more common designation for legislative proposals intended purely as shakedowns of monied interests .
Indeed , one notices that the current attempts by Congress to place blame upon the speculators via actual legislation is lacking .
Writes Novak :
The dominant figure of Stupak ’s hearing , however , was his mentor and model in paranoid politics : the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee , Rep. John Dingell , now in his 27th term in the House from the Detroit area .
Just shy of his 82nd birthday , Dingell showed that he had lost none of his legendary sarcasm and invective in questioning Republican officials .
Dingell told his cross-examination target , Walter Lukken , a former Republican Senate aide who is acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , that he was “ twiddling your thumbs ” in not regulating “ those good - hearted folks up there in New York who are running this wonderful , speculated enterprise . ”
He concluded : “ Now we find that these good - hearted folks in the futures market have figured how . . . to screw the farmers and the consumers in the city . . . on a whole new product : oil . ”
Why did Lukken , who surely knows better , not rebut that ?
For the reason that the kid kicked around in the schoolyard by a bully does not hit back : for fear of inviting more abuse .
But Harry Reid has not yet achieved Democratic agreement on a bill , and Bart Stupak ’s legislative panacea for cutting oil prices by $ 30 a barrel remains stalled in committee .
The paranoid style is hard to turn into action .
One can bet that Dick Durban is receiving lots and lots of campaign cash from the commodities futures organizations , and Dingell most likely is a beneficiary as well .
Right now , the only people making money are the traders , something that is not lost to members of Congress who would like to squeeze some of those profits for themselves .
However , this brinksmanship does have its setbacks .
First , it reduces private enterprise to little more than a campaign cash cow for money - starved legislators .
The effects on business are obvious , as it makes everyone a villain .
Second , there are times when it is hard to stop the train .
Take the October , 1987 , stock market crash , as Jennifer Itskevich points out :
In the days between October 14 and October 19 , 1987 , major indexes of market valuation in the United States dropped 30 percent or more .
On October 19 , 1987 , a date that subsequently became known as “ Black Monday , ” the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 508 points , losing 22.6 % of its total value .
The S&P 500 dropped 20.4 % , falling from 282.7 to 225.06 .
This was the greatest loss Wall Street had ever suffered on a single day .
Members of Congress soon blamed the " speculators , " or to be more specific , " program trading " in which institutions would sell large blocks of stock whenever the prices reached certain points .
They also blamed the sale of stock options and derivatives , not surprisingly , as they would fall under the " speculation " category .
However , real culprit turned out to be Congress itself , as Itskevich points out :
While structural problems within markets may have played a role in the magnitude of the market crash , they could not have caused it .
That would require some action outside the market that caused traders to dramatically lower their estimates of stock market values .
The main culprit here seems to have been legislation that passed the House Ways & Means Committee on October 15 eliminating the deductibility of interest on debt used for corporate takeovers .
Two economists from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mark Mitchell and Jeffry Netter , published a study in 1989 concluding that the anti-takeover legislation did trigger the crash .
They note that as the legislation began to move through Congress , the market reacted almost instantaneously to news of its progress .
Between Tuesday , October 13 , when the legislation was first introduced , and Friday , October 16 , when the market closed for the weekend , stock prices fell more than 10 percent — the largest 3 - day drop in almost 50 years .
In addition , those stocks that led the market downward were precisely those most affected by the legislation .
Ultimately , Congress would strip the anti-takeover provisions from its bill , and the market recovered .
Yet , while this crash was a financial disaster , nonetheless it strengthened the hand of Congress , as members were able to hold hearings , berate witnesses , blame speculators , and hold themselves out as the white knights , despite the fact that they were the real culprits .
The Best of William L. Anderson
I was reminded of this skit as I watched a ” panel of experts ” on the PBS News Hour with a couple of energy analysts talking about petroleum economics , and the cause of the current price rise .
Their reasons ( one blaming it in part on the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates ) related to their areas of expertise and knowledge in the Commodities Markets .
It is a common failing .
Experts will try and explain events or seek to control events , based on their what they know and are comfortable with discussing ( where it is light ) , rather than necessarily going to the root cause of the problem ( where the ring was dropped ) .
It is a fault both of those who select the experts to give an opinion , and the focus of those experts , and where this approach is used extensively it tends to hide the nature of the true problem from the public , in the obfuscations of those who are comfortable only when turning the question to allow answers that relate to subjects they know about .
In theory , the world still has a little more spare capacity , in Saudi Arabia .
The latest increase will raise the kingdom ’s output to 9.7 m b/d , its highest level in decades .
But it claims to be able to pump as much 11 m b/d , and further expansions to that capacity are supposed to be ready imminently .
If King Abdullah really wants to deflate the oil markets , he could try announcing an increase in output of a few million barrels a day .
In the current debate about why the price of oil is going up and what can be done about it , the current cause is often cited as being due to “ speculators who play the market out of selfish interests . ”
And in the PBS discussion there was the suggestion that traders had increased the value of oil perhaps $ 30 - $ 50 dollars over the true price .
Yet while the analysts concentrate on this “ market factor ” they ignore the underlying increase in price that has lifted the price the majority of the way to its current level .
Because they ( and many other analysts ) are more comfortable talking about stock market factors , this is where they focus their discussion and the blame for the current rise in prices .
And , because they do n’t really understand the reality of the current situation , there are comments such as that in the Economist which advises
It is hard to know why Saudi Arabia does not do so .
Actually it is not hard at all .
As has been discussed here , repeatedly , the excess oil that Saudi Arabia has for sale is heavy and sour and is not desired or usable by the market at the price that it being offered for .
But that is , in a way , a digression from my over - riding concern , which is illustrated by the example I gave at the beginning .
Those who are asked about the causes and solutions to the current and increasing gap between demand at a reasonable price and liquid fuel supply tend to give answers based on their past experience and areas of knowledge .
Thus , for example , you talk to those with a background in oil production , and they have always in the past been able to find and produce more to meet market demand , and so their answer is along the lines of “ increase drilling and exploration . ”
In the main folk tend to fall back on these answers since it is more comfortable to anticipate that this situation is a repeat of what has happened in the past , and it is more comfortable assuming that this is just another situation that will work out alright , since supply problems have been resolved in the past ( so maybe the Economist quote is relevant ) .
Unfortunately this time the problem is different .
Because as we reach peak oil , and start to look at the down - side of that mountain of production , it is the length of the plateau at the top , and the rate of collapse beyond it , that should be recognized .
This time around , the problem is sufficiently different that the solutions that have worked in the past are no longer valid .
Time to find new answers , as they say , is a ’wasting – as the scale of the problem continues to be ignored by all but a few .
But to address the consequences of the upcoming lack of oil is to recognize that the current state of business as usual cannot continue .
It is to ask and debate the questions with uncomfortable answers , and where , of most commentators were honest , we do n’t really know a lot of the answers .
I am not sure that we even know all the questions that we should be seeking to answer .
The real issues of concern relate to such questions as “ how long do we have until the situation really starts to deteriorate ? ”
Some would say that it already is , and then there is the issue of “ how rapidly will it deteriorate ? ”
There is evidence from a number of fields that where horizontal wells predominate , that the decline in production , when it comes , will exceed 10 % in such fields .
Yet we accept 4 – 4.5 % because that has been the historic number , and it gives us a more comfortable answer to questions like these , even though more and more fields are using horizontal wells and MRC technology .
And so we continue , with the MSM really skirting the issues that should be more frequently discussed , because , unlike the movies that have been made on the oil supply situation , it is , in reality unlikely to result in a happy ending , at least in the intermediate term .
It is easier and more comfortable to be out in the light , talking about the daily variations in oil prices , than it is groping in the dark trying to see what we are going to have to do to find an adequate supply of liquid fuels to meet the worlds needs – unfortunately it is in that unknown that the answers lie .
It is still a relatively lonely place – there are not that many people looking there for answers yet , in fact there are disturbingly few .

It is 30 years since scientists held their breath as they waited for news of the world 's first test tube baby .
When Louise Brown was born - so was IVF treatment .
Today , more than three million babies have been born around the world thanks to the technology which was pioneered in Britain .
Louise 's birth has been celebrated by IVF families and some of the clinical staff involved in the breakthrough .
The celebrations were held at Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridgeshire - set up by the fertility pioneers Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards - the team responsible for Louise 's birth .
Families of 30 children - one from each year since 1978 - gathered to mark the event .
Louise 's birth was one of the most remarkable medical breakthroughs of the 20th Century , and not surprisingly it generated worldwide media interest .
Media star Louise says as a child in Bristol , she got used to all the media attention .
Louise Brown now has a son of her own
She was recognised in the street and got used to some strange questions .
She said : " When I was growing up they would ask things like how do you fit in a test tube and things like that ! "
These days she rarely thinks about her iconic status as the first of more than three million IVF babies born worldwide .
" It 's quite scary to think I 'm the first of them all , but it 's also a nice feeling that perhaps if I had n't been born then all those people would n't be here , and IVF has helped so many couples . "
Louise is now a mother herself , to 18 month old Cameron , although he was conceived naturally .
Patrick Steptoe died in 1988 but Professor Edwards joined the celebrations and helped Louise cut the cake .
Professor Edwards remembers how , once the news of the pregnancy leaked out , Louise 's mother had to go into hiding .
" We were concerned that she would lose the baby , the fetus , because the press were chasing Mrs Brown all over Bristol where she lived .
" So secretly Patrick Steptoe hid the mother in his car and drove her to his mother 's house in Lincoln - the press did n't know where she was . "
Professor Edwards was worried by the media interest Louise 's mother said that once she was in Oldham hospital reporters tried a variety of methods to sneak into her room from a bomb hoax to posing as cleaners .
Once Louise was born it made front - page headlines all over the world .
Mrs Brown went on to have another daughter by IVF and is delighted that Steptoe and Edwards helped her .
" I 'm just so grateful that I 'm a mum at all because without IVF I never would have been and I would n't have my grandchildren . "
Routine Since Louise Brown 's birth IVF has become a routine procedure .
More than 30,000 women a year in Britain now undergo IVF and eleven thousand babies annually are born .
IVF was a British breakthrough , but the majority of treatment in the UK is still paid for privately and costs couples between £ 4,000 and £ 8,000 a time .
Professor Edwards is saddened that IVF is not more widely available on the NHS .
" Every couple should be allowed to have three babies on the health service because this is the greatest gift that you can give any man or woman . "

What are these ?
MTI Micro have been putting their Mobion fuel cell through it ’s paces , in testing intended to demonstrate just how much improved the technology is over current Li-Ion power packs .
A lab test version of the fuel - cell lasted 2,700 hours of continuous use , with further tests suggesting power degradation of less than 15 - percent .
To put that into context , Li-Ion batteries can lose up to 50 - percent of their capacity over two years .
That means more frequent recharge cycles and shorter usage time , or alternatively a premature replacement .
MTI Micro are quoting average cellphone user times of 3,000 included minutes per month , which adds up to 1,200 hours over a typical two - year contract .
Assuming standby was far less demanding of power , the Mobion pack would be able to run that without needing a refuel .
Of course , actual use will likely differ significantly from test conditions , but it looks as though fuel cells are finally coming of age .
Press Release :
MTI Micro Demonstrates Industry Breakthrough in Fuel Cell Life Test
ALBANY , N.Y. –( Business Wire ) – Jul. 11 , 2008 MTI MicroFuel Cells Inc. ( “ MTI Micro ” ) , the developer of Mobion ( R ) off - the - grid portable power solutions and a subsidiary of Mechanical Technology , Incorporated ( “ MTI ” ) ( NASDAQ : MKTY ) , today announced that it has achieved 2,700 hours of continuous operation with a Mobion ( R ) laboratory cell – the building block of the Company ’s Mobion ( R ) chip and systems .
In comparison , a typical cell phone plan in the U.S. , marketed to moderate to heavy users , includes 3,000 minutes per month which , over the life of a typical 2 year contract , translates to only 1,200 hours of use .
In an industry report published by the Journal of Power Sources , tests conducted on direct methanol micro fuel cells show degradation of up to 35 % after only 360 hours of operation .
In addition to the 2,700 hours of continuous run-time , our Mobion ( R ) test , which is still ongoing , successfully demonstrated a significant achievement by showing power degradation of less than 15 % – which we believe is a breakthrough for the micro fuel cell industry .
“ Our test results are a clear indication of the technical progress we have made on performance metrics including life , degradation , temperature , and humidity levels which are required to bring products to market in the consumer electronics industry .
To our knowledge , there are no other published results that match ours , ” said Jim Prueitt , Vice President of Engineering and Operations at MTI Micro .
“ With these results , we believe we continue to be a leader in the micro fuel cell industry as we work toward the commercialization of our Mobion ( R ) power sources . ”
According to Frost and Sullivan , the average power degradation in a lithium ion battery can be approximately 50 % of their charging capacity after two years .
As most cell phone users notice after a short time of ownership , the battery in their phone does not hold a charge like it did when it was new .
They must recharge their phones more and more often and be more conscious of saving power .
“ In less than a year , we have been chosen by three consumer electronic OEMs who are striving to meet the needs of consumers who want a longer lasting and more reliable power source , ” said Peng Lim , Chairman and CEO of MTI .
“ We believe these results show our technological leadership and our future ability to help OEMs meet those needs with our Mobion ( R ) technology . ”
With these latest test results , MTI Micro is also in line with targets set by the Department of Energy in a recent funding opportunity announcement which required fuel cells under 50 Watts to have a life test of at least 2000 hours .
MTI Micro ’s strategy is to provide Mobion ( R ) portable power products for use in the multi-billion dollar consumer electronics industry for applications including cell phones , digital cameras , PDAs , MP3 players and other handheld electronic devices .
The Company ’s Mobion ( R ) , 100 % methanol feed , passive DMFC technology has been demonstrated in fully - functional prototypes and concept models in three primary product directions : external cord - free rechargeable power packs , attached fuel cell power sources and embedded micro fuel cell designs .
About MTI MicroFuel Cells

Ontario legislators , anxious to trim a growing list of people waiting for an organ , are trying to rekindle the lingering debate over whether everyone should be considered a would - be organ donor unless they explicitly indicate otherwise .
It 's a concept known as presumed consent , making every eligible person in Ontario an automatic organ donor upon death unless they specifically opt out ahead of time .
Though it has yet to win much support in Canada , a pair of New Democrats are taking one more shot at making their private member 's bill the law in Ontario .
" As we speak , good organs are being burned or buried across this province because the province insists on maintaining its presumption system , " said NDP MPP Peter Kormos , who has twice introduced the legislation unsuccessfully .
He and MPP Cheri DiNovo are pushing the issue now .
This fall , the NDP will introduce the bill again , hoping to provide an urgent solution to nearly 1,700 Ontarians waiting for organs , he said .
About 4,000 Canadians are waiting for organ transplants and 140 to 250 die each year before they get it .
Still , a report commissioned by the provincial government last year found little public appetite for a presumed - consent system .
Andres Cotic , 60 , who has been waiting for a liver for three years , pleaded yesterday with Canadians to show support for the concept .
Several years ago , a colleague donated half his own liver to Cotic , but it 's now failing , he said .
" We can not let our fellow Canadians ( die ) in silence when we have all these things at our disposal , " said Cotic , an architect and urban designer .
According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal , presumed consent is practised in various forms in Europe .
Mark Nesbitt , an Ontario Health Ministry spokesperson , said there are no further discussions planned on the issue following the citizens ' panel report .
The report found they 're generally not comfortable with the concept , Nesbitt said .

Circle of Blue reports on emerging water crisis
Jul. 09 / CSRwire / - - July 9 , 2008 - Just as diminishing supplies of oil and natural gas are wrenching the economy and producing changes in lifestyles built on the principle of plenty , states and communities across the country are confronting another significant impediment to the American way of life : increased competition for scarce water .
Scientists and resource specialists say freshwater scarcity , even in unexpected places , threatens farm productivity , limits growth , increases business expenses , and drains local treasuries .
In May , for example , Brockton , Massachusetts , inaugurated a brand - new , $ 60 million reverse osmosis desalinization plant to supply a portion of its drinking water .
The Atlantic coast city , which receives four feet of rain annually , was nevertheless so short of freshwater that it was converting brackish water into water people actually could drink .
Builders in the Southeast are confronting limits to planting gardens and lawns for new houses as a result of local water restrictions prompted by a continuing drought .
The Ogallala Aquifer , the vast underground reservoir beneath the Great Plains , is steadily being depleted .
California experienced the driest spring on record this year .
And scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego forecast that within 13 years Lake Mead and Lake Powell along the Colorado River , the two largest reservoirs in the southwest United States , could become " dead pool ” mud puddles .
" The whole picture is not pretty , and I do n’t think that anyone has looked at the subject with the point of view of what 's sustainable , " said Tim Barnett , a research marine geophysicist at Scripps and co-author of the the study .
" We do n't have anybody thinking long range , at the big picture that would put the clamps on large - scale development . "
Era of Water Scarcity
" I truly believe we 're moving into an era of water scarcity throughout the United States , " said Peter Gleick , science advisor to Circle of Blue and president of the Pacific Institute , a think tank specializing in water issues based in Oakland , California .
" That by itself is going to force us to adopt more efficient management techniques . "
The U.S. Drought Monitor , a weekly online report produced by the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , shows that severe drought still grips much of the American Southeast , is spreading east from California across the Rocky Mountains , and has also settled in the Texas Panhandle and parts of Oklahoma and Colorado .
While agriculture in the Colorado Basin faces shortages , farmers to the east in the high plains - tapping the Ogallala Aquifer - have progressively seen their wells dry up .
The aquifer is the largest in the United States and sees a depletion rate of some 12 billion cubic meters a year , a quantity equivalent to 18 times the annual flow of the Colorado River .
Since pumping started in the 1940s , Ogallala water levels have dropped by more than 100 feet ( 30 meters ) in some areas .
In an interview with Circle of Blue , Kevin Dennehey , program coordinator for the Ground - Water Resources Program at the U.S. Geological Survey , said , " The problem with the aquifer is that it ’'s a limited resource .
There is not an unlimited supply , so the recharge is much less than the withdrawals . "
The prognosis for farmers , whose irrigation accounts for 94 percent of the groundwater use on the high plains , does not look optimistic .
In the future , irrigation may not be possible at all as the levels continue to drop past the well intakes of farmers .
More likely , before the pumping stops , the cost of drilling and maintaining deeper wells may exceed the value of what can be grown , severely limiting the farmland 's value .
" There is no other water available , " said Dennehey .
Receding Water in Great Lakes , Other Regions
Declining water levels affect the Great Lakes , too .
In a paper published late last year , scientists projected that over the next three decades or so , water levels in Lake Erie , which supplies drinking water to more than 11 million people , could fall three to six feet as a result of climate change .
" We 'll have more wetland and coastal habitat and shallower water , " said John Hartig , manager of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge in Michigan .
" The falling water levels also have huge implications for power plants .
Think of power plants designing their water intakes to draw water from a particular depth , at a particular distance offshore .
If you water levels drop 1 - 2 meters 40 years from now , that 's going to affect all water intakes . "
In an effort to curb draws on the Great Lakes and further protect the basin's water resources , eight states and two Canadian provinces have passed the Great Lakes compact - an agreement that is intended to prevent the exportation of Great Lakes water to other regions .
The compact now needs to be approved by the U.S. Congress before it can become law .
( Read an interview about the Compact with James M. Olson , one of America 's preeminent attorneys specializing in water - and land - use law . )
The Southeast has been hard hit as well .
Authorities in southern Florida issued water restrictions earlier this year .
In August of 2007 , city officials in Greensboro , North Carolina fined homeowners associations for watering lawns , washing sidewalks , and other violations of emergency restrictions on water use that were prompted by the region 's severe drought .
In Atlanta , where a severe drought also persists , authorities pressed residents to reduce water use , successfully .
Then leaders of the city 's Watershed Management Department , concerned about declining revenue to operate the system , asked permission to raise rates .
Officials in Fulton County , where Atlanta is located , did the same thing , praising residents for their efforts at conservation — then increasing their rates by 15 percent .
If approved by the city council , the average residential water bill in Atlanta would jump from $ 84 to $ 107 next year .
Causes : Climate Change , Population Growth , Profligate Use
Though there is disagreement in the scientific community about when the southeast drought will end , or how low water levels might get in the Great Lakes , most experts say that American water reserves are changing , and in many cases dwindling .
One reason is global warming , which is altering precipitation patterns — producing more droughts in some regions , more flooding in others , and generally making weather patterns unpredictable , thus limiting options for response to extreme conditions .
Soil erosion , leaking pipes that are expensive to fix , and an aversion to conservation also are mentioned as causes of scarcity .
Another is the country ’s growing population , expected to reach 450 million by the middle of the century , or roughly 50 percent more people than now .
The results are unmistakable , especially in California .
In June , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a statewide water emergency , the first since 1991 .
Though the winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada , which produces much of the state 's water , was higher than last season , California has had the driest spring on record .
Reservoirs are just two - thirds full .
Leaders of the state 's fast - growing communities have asked residents to curtail watering lawns and washing cars .
In northern California , the air last week was choked by smoke from some 800 forest and grass fires , the highest number on record this early in the fire season .
In 2002 , California put into effect a state law that requires developers to prove that new projects have a plan for providing at least 20 years worth of water before local water authorities can approve their projects .
For the first time , according to a report in June in the New York Times , several local governments in southern California are actually enforcing the law :
They 're requiring developers to prove where new homes will secure their water , and in some cases delaying construction permits .
But even in California , where the state 's 37 million residents live in a real - life theme ride of natural threats – droughts , fires , floods and earthquakes - there is no sense of crisis .
Not Seen as Emergency , Yet
The gravity of the situation has n't set in for most Americans .
In Atlanta , where drought dramatically lowered Lake Lanier , the region 's primary reservoir , water scarcity is generally seen as temporary , and not related to how the region has grown .
" As an observer of water in the West , as a journalist and a reader of history , I would venture that water scarcity has rarely , if ever , been a long - term limit to growth , " said Jon Christensen , a researcher at the Bill Lane Center for the Study of the North American West at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California .
" Short - term moratoria on building permits have happened in various places around the West in the past , including Las Vegas .
They are usually , in my view , shots across the bows of developers and elected officials that stimulate the search for new deals to bring water from other sources at whatever cost is necessary , so that building can continue . "
In 2003 , the General Accounting Office , an investigative arm of the U.S. Congress , published a survey that found water managers in 36 states " anticipate water shortages locally , regionally or statewide within the next ten years . "
The study has proved disturbingly prophetic , and nowhere more so than on the Colorado Plateau and the rest of the American Southwest .
The region is in the ninth year of a persistent drought that continues to leave Las Vegas worried .
On June 6 , during a congressional briefing , Gregory J. McCabe , a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey , presented a study showing that even a 1.5 - degree increase in the overall temperature of the Southwest due to climate change will decrease the Colorado River ’s flow .
That , he said , increases the likelihood that it will fall short of the amount needed to meet the annual water allocations upon which Nevada , six other states , and 25 million people rely .
The Hoover Dam , moreover , will not be able to supply nearly the same level of electric power to Las Vegas as it does today .
" You 've got a river now that is stretched totally thin , and all the water is being used , " said Barnett , of the Scripps Institution .
" There is no excess water .
You ’re getting less and less water over the decades , so it 's going to be a continuing , festering thing that will get worse , " he added .
" That 's desert .
It was never meant to have cities .
There are millions of people there , and they all have one water supply , only one : the Colorado . "
As Peter Curtiss , an engineer and head of Curtiss Engineering in Boulder , Colorado , noted , " People assume these things are going to be available .
We 've been trained ever since the windmill pumped up water from the farm .
Water , electricity and natural gas :
When you buy a house , you expect that those services will be there , and the thought of having a house without any one of those seems absurd . "
Managing the Colorado River system and other U.S. water resources in a sustainable way poses great technological , political and social challenges .
But , as the Pacific Institute 's Gleick said , " If we continue on our current path , continuing to do things the way we ’re doing them , we 're going to be much worse off in five or ten years , or in the coming decades , because the way we manage water now is inappropriate .
It 's not sustainable .
We over - pump our groundwater .
We take water from ecosystems .
We do n't think about how we grow and where we grow our population . "
Freshwater scarcity is proving to be the new risk to local economies and regional development plans across the country .
Just like the rising price of gasoline , the expanding number of home foreclosures , stagnant incomes , and several other stubborn 21st - century trends , water is imposing limits on how America grows .
" So the business - as - usual future is a bad one , ” Gleick continued .
" We know that in five years we 'll be in trouble , but it does n’t have to be that way .
If there were more education and awareness about water issues , if we started to really think about the natural limits about where humans and ecosystems have to work together to deal with water , and if we were to start to think about efficient use of water , then we could reduce the severity of the problems enormously .
I 'm just not sure we ’re going to . "

Just ask the Russians - running in an arms race can be awfully expensive .
So you 've got to hand it to the Iranians for figuring out an effective force multiplier : Digital photo editing .
See if you can guess which image of yesterday 's Iranian missile tests is real , and which one is bogus -- and was reprinted by many of the world 's most prestigious news outlets today .
Photoshopping ( or whatever tool they 're using ) is n't new to Middle East imagery - bogus photos have cropped up repeatedly from Lebanon , for instance .
But this may be the first time we 've seen evidence of it as a foreign policy tool .
NYT :
Agence France - Presse said that it obtained the image from the Web site of Sepah News , the media arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , on Wednesday .
But there was no sign of it there later in the day .
Today ,
The Associated Press distributed what appeared to be a nearly identical photo from the same source , but without the fourth missile ...
For its part , Agence France - Presse retracted its four - missile version this morning , saying that the image was “ apparently digitally altered ” by Iranian state media .
The fourth missile “ has apparently been added in digital retouch to cover a grounded missile that may have failed during the test , ” the agency said .
With the tech world focused on the launch of the second - generation iPhone and Apple 's App Store , which will allow iPhone users to download and install applications for the first time without jailbreaking their phone ( cracking it so that unauthorized apps can be installed ) , Pandora has unleashed an iPhone version of their interactive internet radio service that moves beyond what has previously been possible in the portable radio arena .
As soon as Pandora heard that Apple would be launching the App Store , its designers and engineers began working on an iPhone version of Pandora that ran on jaikbroken iPhones , then rebuilt it using Apple 's apparently excellent SDK .
Having witnessed Pandora in action on an iPhone ( screenshots below ) , we can say that it works great .
It could be the best version of Pandora yet , given that it requires neither a computer , the way the web version does , nor a paid subscription , the way previous mobile implementations of Pandora have done .
Pandora chief technology officer and former Apple employee Tom Conrad told Listening Post that Pandora 's developers have loved working with Apple 's iPhone SDK ; they say it 's even better than their web development tools .
" We 've got Pandora running on maybe 50 different cellphones right now ( on the Sprint and AT&T networks ) , and there 's no question that this implementation is the best one that we 've done , " said Conrad .
" It 's also the first version of Pandora that will be available ad - supported ( and ) free , off of the PC . "
Conrad also likes the iPhone 's big screen , keyboard ( which most phonesdo n't have ) , regular headphone jack ( aside from the 1G iPhone ' srecessed jack ) and a battery management system that 's optimized forstreaming .
The resulting Pandora App is a pleasure to use .
Navigation iseffortless , and feels nearly exactly like using the iPhone 's nativeiPod application , with album covers that slide from left to right asone song switches to the next and the same stations and 500,000 - song catalog available on Pandora via the web .
Songs stream in mono 64 Kbps MP3 ; the iPhone does n't support high - quality streaming codecs such as AACPlus , an omission Conrad calls " sort of disappointing . "
However , the Pandora App sounded fine when I heard it on a 1G iPhone connected via the Edge network .
If you hear a song you like , you can rate it thumbs up or thumbs down , view the album art or find out why Pandora chose the song for you , as with the web version .
All ratings count in your general Pandora profile for each station .
You can bookmark any currently - playing song or artist to your Pandora profile page , or if you hear something you really like , another click brings up the song for purchase in the iTunes music store .
And yes , it 's possible to create new Pandora stations from within the Pandora iPhone App .
One quibble we have with the iPhone version of Pandora , though , is that there 'sa brief pause in between the playback of each track , as it buffers .
Conrad said this is currently unavoidable , since each station iscustomized to each user on a one - to - one basis , so songs can't bepre-mixed from one to the next .
However , he said that 3G networks arefast enough to allow Pandora to cache the next song in the background .
If they add that feature , though , it would n't work on the 1G iPhone , since itcan only access the Edge cellular network .
Another minor issue is that you can't listen to Pandora stations while you checkyour calender , compose an e-mail , or do anything else with your iPhone .
If you make or takea call , Pandora will pause , which is convenient , but it would have been nicerif Apple allowed Pandora to play in the background while you did other stuff .
Conrad said Apple decided to only let iPhone Apps run whenthey 're in the foreground or when the phone is put to sleep becauseotherwise , people would leave multiple applications running in thebackground , depleting their batteries far too fast .
This seems like a necessarysafeguard , but most power users would probably prefer an option to disable it .
However , we love that it costs nothing to listen to up to a hundred orso totally customizable Pandora stations on the iPhone – the samestations that you normally access via your Pandora web account .
This isthe first free non-computer version of Pandora ; on the cellphonesmentioned above and the Sonos and Logitech Squeezebox implementations , users have beenrequired to pay $ 36 per year for Pandora access .
" The App itself will be free , listening will be free , it will besupported through audio advertising like radio has been for timeimmemorial , " said Conrad .
However , do n't expect thunderous ads for monster truckshows and other usual terrestrial radio ad staples .
" They 'll beNPR - style – ' This station brought to you by ( the sponsor ) … on theorder of six an hour , two in a row every 20 minutes . ' "
That does n't sound too bad :
Ads will only play 0.88 percent of thetime , which Conrad correctly describes as " dramatically less thanterrestrial radio " and " somewhat less than NPR . "
Besides , you can pay the $ 36 / year subscription and have all ads removed from Pandora .
Pandora 's free iPhone App is sure to become one of the most popularmusic applications and applications in general in Apple 's App Store , judging from what we 've seen so far .
It 'savailable as a free download from the App Store and within iTunes .
The following screenshots show the Pandora iPhone App in action .
Here 's the menu button :
And here 's the station list :
You can buy any song that 's playing from iTunes immediately , if the iPhone is connected via WiFi :
If you ask Pandora why it 's DJing a particular song , it 'll tell you :

What the low - end chef made …
Harry Hawk of Harry ’s at Water Taxi Beach
O this sun-blasted summer afternoon , the deserted Long Island City beach complex that ’s home to Harry ’s feels like the backyard of a fraternity house after a weekend - long binge .
Flies buzz under the flapping orange dining tent ; the bar smells of old beer .
Harry is dressed in suspenders and chef ’s clogs , and he presents the components of his seven - course bonanza all at once .
The first thing we sample is a pile of grilled asparagus , which are n’t high - quality ( the Greenmarket ’s too expensive ) and seem to have gone limp in the 100 - degree heat .
Ditto the grilled corn , which is flavored with enough cayenne to choke a horse .
Harry ’s buttermilk onion rings are excellent ( they ’re sweet , generously cut , and not too greasy ) , and I spend most of my time eating them , instead of the dry , fishy salmon burger , served on a piece of desiccated toast .
The main course — chunks of salty - sweet , char - grilled lamb cured for several hours in brown sugar , salt , and cumin — is excellent , and worth the entire $ 20 price of admission .
The strawberries with sour cream are unimpressive , and Harry ’s biscuits would be okay provided I had n’t pounded down all those onion rings .
The second dessert course is a single Klondike bar whipped milkshake style and spiked with amber Dogfish Head ale .
It tastes like a White Russian mixed with chocolate truffles .
It ’s a touch of cheap - eats genius , albeit one served in plastic Champagne flutes .
Verdict :
One star for the lamb and another for the Klondike shake .
No stars for the vegetable sides , the dry salmon burger , and the greasy venue .
( Pretty Good )
Total cost : $ 13.78

What the high - end chef made …
Chef Olivier Muller of DB Bistro Moderne
Waiting for my lunch , I sip iced tea , admiring the vintage wine bottles aligned on DB ’s wall .
Muller , dressed in a crisp , white , monogrammed uniform , brings the first course , a tarte flambée ( “ flammenkueche ” ) served on a butcher block and cut in neat squares .
It ’s a real restaurant - quality item ( light crispy crust , smoky bacon , the slight creaminess of fromage blanc ) .
It ’s so good it makes you wonder why it ’s so damned cheap .
Answer :
Tarte flambée is the pizza of the chef ’s native Alsace ; only in midtown Manhattan is this simple dish peddled as haute cuisine .
The arugula salad is professionally made , too , and so is Muller ’s Moroccan couscous , the contents of which ( couscous , braised lamb , a roast chicken leg from Fairway , and a single store - bought D’Artagnan merguez sausage ) come together nicely in a gently simmered stew tasting of harissa and mint .
Would a DB diner complain if he were served this dish ?
Nope .
How much would DB charge for it ?
According to Muller , $ 30 or $ 35 , which makes us pity the poor saps who pay full freight .
But then this is a full - fledged haute cuisine machine .
While Harry throws his ingredients onto the grill , hours of labor have gone into these dishes .
The rhubarb in the rhubarb tart has been boiled down and left to intensify overnight , and sits in a sweet , hand - rolled crust capped with warm , freshly made meringue .
Is it good ?
Yes , it is .
Is it really cheap eats ?
In the cost of ingredients only .
Verdict :
One star for the tarte flambée , one star for the lamb couscous , and one star for the rhubarb tart .
It might be cheap , but it does n’t taste that way .
( Pretty Damn Good )
Total cost : $ 17.74

I have subscribed to quite a few programming blogs , one of them being Coding Horror .
Coding Horror is written by Jeff Atwood and it's currently the top programming blog with 93 thousand feed subscribers .
Something that caught my attention on CodingHorror is that its traffic stats are publicly available .
The statistics are hosted by StatCounter.com , which keeps only the last 500 entries of any traffic activity .
I wanted to see a clearer picture of the most popular keywords people searched for and ended up in Coding Horror blog .
Thirty minutes later I had written a Perl program , which accessed the statcounter.com statistics , parsed the " Recent Keyword Activity " page , extracted the keywords , and inserted them in an SQLite database .
I always love to describe how my programs work .
I 'll make it short this time , as we are concentrating on the statistics and not on programming .
The Perl Program
The Perl program uses ( or reuses ) a few CPAN modules :
WWW :: Mechanize to access the statcounter.com website ,
HTML :: TreeBuilder to parse the keywords HTML page ,
Date :: Parse to easily convert date and time string to a UNIX timestamp ,
and finally DBI and DBD ::SQLite to access the SQLite database .
The program takes two optional arguments
- nodb not to insert the keywords in database ( just print them out )
not to insert the keywords in database ( just print them out ) number - number of pages to extract keywords from
Here is the source code of the codinghorror_kwstats.pl program :

The SQLite Database
The database has just one table called ' queries ' which contains a ' query ' , ' unix_date ' and ' human_date ' columns .
The ' unix_date ' column is used for sorting the entries chronologically , and ' human_date ' is there just so I could easily see the date .
Here is the schema of the database :
CREATE TABLE queries ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , query TEXT , unix_date INTEGER , human_date TEXT ) ; CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_query_date ON queries ( query , unix_date ) ;
As the Perl program is run periodically , it might extract the same keywords several times .
I created a UNIQUE index on ' query ' and ' unix_date ' fields , and left the job to drop the duplicate records to SQLite .
The Perl program uses the following SQL query to insert the data in database :
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO queries ( query , unix_date , human_date ) VALUES ( ? , ? , ?)
The ' OR IGNORE ' makes sure the duplicate records get silently discarded .
Simple Statistics
I have been collecting keywords since March 31 , and the database has now grown to a size of 73'336 records and 7MB ( 3MB compressed ) .
Download : catonmat.net/ftp/codinghorror-keyword-database.zip
I ran a few simple SQL queries against the data using the GUI SQLite Database Browser to find the most popular keywords .
I recommend downloading it , if you want to play around with the database .
The first query selected the 15 most popular keywords , along with their count , and percentage of all keywords .
The following SQL query did it :
SELECT count ( query ) c , ( round ( count ( query ) / ( 1.0 *( select count ( *) from queries ) ) , 3) * 100 ) || ' % ' , query FROM queries GROUP BY query ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 15
I also made a bar chart using the public Google Charts API :
This chart would look much better if it had vertical bars .
I could n't figure out how to add keywords nicely below each bar , though .
Here is how the messy query to Google Charts API looks like :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chtt=Coding%20Horror's%20Top%2015%20Keywords&cht=bhs&chd=t:100,77,12.07,10.18,9.09,8.74,8.64,8.49,7.05,6.51,5.91,5.71,5.66,5.61,5.22&chs=400x450&chxt=x,y&chxl=0:|0|2013|1:|command%20prompt%20commands|registration%20keys|cmd%20tricks|vista%20media%20center|sql%20joins|command%20prompt|you%20may%20be%20a%20victim...|codinghorror|dual%20core%20vs%20quad%20core|quad%20core%20vs%20dual%20core|cmd%20commands|command%20prompt%20tricks|system%20idle%20processes|coding%20horror|system%20idea%20process
Just to illustrate various ways to work with SQLite database , I did the same query from command line , and queried top 50 popular keywords , here they are :
$ sqlite3 ./codinghorror.db sqlite > . header ON sqlite > . explain ON sqlite > SELECT count ( query ) c , query FROM queries GROUP BY query ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 50 ; c query ----

Knowing the most popular keywords can give you some hints what topics to write about on your blog .
For example , an article named ' Windows Command Prompt Tricks ' would start bringing good traffic from search engines instantly !
I did another bunch of queries to find the most popular programming languages on Coding Horror .
I put the languages I could think of in langs .
txt file , and ran the following Perl one - liner :
$ perl - MDBI - wlne ' BEGIN { $ , = q/ / ; $ dbh = DBI -> connect(q/dbi:SQLite:codinghorror.db/ ) ; } print +( $dbh->selectrow_array ( qq / SELECT count ( query ) FROM queries WHERE query LIKE " $ _ " OR query LIKE " $_ % " OR query LIKE " % $ _ " OR query LIKE " % $ _ % " / ) ) [ 0 ] , $ _ ' langs.
txt | sort -n -r
It produced the following output :
1127 visual studio 1087 c# 407 c 287 javascript 239 java 139 asp 104 visual basic 59 php 44 ruby 42 python 26 perl 22 lisp 19 erlang 3 pascal 1 tcl 1 prolog 0 ml 0 haskell
I added ' visual studio ' to the list of programming languages , as every beginner thinks it actually is a programming language .
There were no keywords matching ' C ++ ' because most search engines think of '+ ' as an operator rather than a valid search string .
I must say that Python is the answer to life , the universe and everything , as it was searched for 42 times !
Here is the same data put on a chart :

Suicide is a big problem in South Korea .
According to the Financial Times , the compact peninsula has the highest rate of suicide in the developed world : 24.7 deaths per 100,000 people .
It ’s become such a problem that employers are sending workers to “ well - dying ” courses to prevent suicides .
During the courses , employees go through the arduous process of faking their own deaths .
Fake funeral training has become so popular that major companies like Samsung have built their own funeral training centers .
Hyundai , another large employer , regularly sends employees to “ well - dying ” training .
Via the Financial Times :
South Korean companies are sending employees on ‘ fake funeral ’ courses to help prevent suicide .
Participants sit at candlelit desks and are told to write their last will and testament .
Attendees are prompted by questions such as : “ If you died today , what would you tell your family ” ?
Many of those in the room become emotional as they read out their wills .
Before they are “ buried ” , participants are asked to pose for their funeral portrait .
Participants ( then ) enter a “ death experience room ” where they choose a coffin and put on a “ death robe . ”
Course members get into their coffins and a flower is laid on each person ’s chest .
Funeral attendants place a lid on the coffin and dirt is thrown on the casket .
Participants are left in the closed casket for five minutes and some start to cry in the darkness .
Once the lids are opened the resurrected trainees are asked how they felt .
As someone who ’s 99 % ignorant of Korean culture , this strikes me as harsh .
Is giving someone a reason not to die the same as giving them reason to live ?
Then again , it does seem to be working :
Why else would Samsung have built a permanent funeral training center ?

Thousands of lawyers , political , trade unions and social movement activists have made their way to Islamabad .
They are participating in the Long March called by the lawyers ' movement .
This is to push the Pakistan Peoples Party government to restore the top judges without any conditions .
June 11 report : The Long March started from Karachi on June 9 and arrived in Sukhar at early hours of June 10 .
Here they were joined by the participants from different groups from Baluchistan .
They arrived at Multan on June 10 in the late hours , where the deposed chief justice Iftikhar Choudary had arrived to welcome the rally .
They left for Lahore around 1 pm .
At Lahore , thousands will go to Lahore airport at 5 pm to receive the chief justice Iftikhar Choudary and other deposed judges .
The caravan will come to Lahore High Court where Iftikhar Choudary will speak to a convention of lawyers .
On June 12 , the participants of the Long March will leave for Islamabad .
The lawyer 's leadership has not yet announced the plans for Islamabad .
But it is understood that the activists will Gherao ( picket ) the parliament .
Labour Party Pakistan activists have joined the Long March from Karachi and on the way and they are joined by other LPP activists .
They will be joined by another 50 LPP activists from Lahore .
At Islamabad , the LPP is setting up camp to welcome the Long March participants .
The Long March was called after the newly elected parliament failed to restore the top judges as promised before the general elections .
The Pakistan Peoples Party had promised to restore the judges within one month of coming to power but failed to do so .
They want these judges restored through a constitutional package that include many conditions on the freedom of the judiciary .
The lawyer 's movement started on 9 March 2007 is entering its decisive phase .
The Long March has caught up the imaginations of many workers and peasants and has started to join the movement .
June 12 update from Gojranwal : At Gojranwala , a city around 70 kilometer from Lahore , it was once again a scene we had witnessed all the way from Lahore : hundreds of youth raising slogans against Musharraf .
It is 1 am and still hundreds of people on the road to welcome the Long March .
All way long it was a jubilation and slogans and a lot abuses shouted against Musharraf .
Maybe over 100,000 had waved hands to the 1000 or more vehicles in the Long March .
At one time , while I was doing an interview with KTN , a Sindhi TV channel , hundreds of youth surrounded our bus and raised popular slogans like " Go Musharraf go ! "
It was broadcast live through my telephone .
At Lahore , while we were stuck for half an hour , a comrade told us that Mian Nawaz Sharif , the former prime minister , was going to speak at a rally to welcome the Long March .
We decided to have our own rally while all the traffic was stuck .
Over 100 of us with red flags started going to the place where Nawaz Sharif was going to speak .
Many more hundreds followed us .
We were raising slogans and waving our flags .
While near the rally place , we were stopped by police , we pushed them to go further .
Next were barricades to stop people going near the platform .
I was the first one to jump the barricades despite all the efforts of police to stop us .
Then four women jumped the barricades .
The police were very rough and so were we !
Police overpowered our comrades who were unable to jump .
They asked us to go back .
We refused point blank .
The SP police threatened me of arrest , I became more vocal on this and started shouting at police .
They had to retreat .
We went ahead very close to platform , five of us : four women and myself with red flags .
We were cheered by some from the platform including Nawaz Sharif .
Others were Aitezaz Ahsan , Saad Rafique , Iqbal Haider of HRCP .
Some TV channels showed live about our encounter and a lot of press photographers were seen taking photos .
I was later called by Daily Dawn if I was manhandled , and I told the whole story .
Thousands cheered our action and showed V signs while we were returning .
At Gojranwal city center , we got of our buses and raised slogans at 1.30 am .
Here , over 5000 had gathered and we were surrounded immediately by hundreds .
We have been offered and given food and drinks all way .
A lot of rose petals showered on all the buses .
Here one commented when I opened my window :
Go and get rid of Musharraf and I am also coming to Islamabad .
June 12 update from Lahore :
We are now ready to go to Islamabad at 3 pm on 12 June .
Original schedule of 9 am departure had to be changed as the address of the Chief Justice finished at 6 am Lahore High Court .
Labour Party Pakistan set up a big camp in front of Dher Pindi , a village opposite Lahore Airport .
The village land has been taken over by the land mafia of PMLQ .
We had this campaign of land rights for the last two years .
Over 500 participated , many women .
I had a brief chat with Iftikhar Choudry CJ while he stopped at our camp of all red flags .
I explained him about the land mafia and requested to take a notice .
He was smiling and may be happy to see hundreds of peasants with red flag and supporting him .
Our Karachi comrades arrived this morning at 6 am and we had arranged their residence at Caritas .
We had to pay for the residence .
They are 40 of them travelling since 9 June from Karachi .
We have booked three flying coaches from Lahore for Islamabad leg of the Long March .
Now waiting for the mini buses to arrive .
Around 60 from LPP
Lahore will join the laywers .
June 13 update : I am on a bus roof top for two hours .
I cannot tell how many have started from Lahore for the Long March to Islamabad but everywhere there are heads and heads .
It is going beyond our expectations .
Our four vehicles are decorated with red flags and they are flying like anything .
The lawyers movement have caught up the imagination of hundreds of thousands .
It took us two hours to travel few kilometers inside Lahore and still in Lahore .
There are thousands of people on both side of the roads waving us and happy to see the thousands of people in Long March .
Slogans are against military dictator Musharraf , American imperialism , and against price hike , for restoration of top judges , and for a just society .
There are cheers and confidence on every face .
Activists from Muslim League Nawaz , Tehrik Insaaf , Jamaat - i- Islami , Labour Party , Awami Tehreek and lawyers movement are in thousands on different buses , trucks , mini buses and cars .
Islamabad is around 400 kilometers and we are still in Lahore at 7.30 pm .
I think it could take whole night to arrive in Islamabad .
We want to have a sit in at parliament .
Pakistan Peoples
Party is nowhere to be seen .
It is an all out
opposition show .
What a tragedy for PPP to bring so many in opposition within three months .
June 13 , Rawalpindi Update : I could not write as regularly on the developments of the Long March as I had wished due to the stealing of my mobile that I was using to send reports on the way .
Now I am at net cafe in Rawalpindi , as thousands are in the Long March and stuck at Liaqat Park .
I took the opportunity to write on .
We arrived in Rawalpindi from Lahore in nearly 20 hours .
So a distance of 300 kilometers was covered in 20 hours .
The reason was that many thousands of people were waiting for the Long March and they were stopping them to speak to them .
I have never seen such a sentiments against the military ruler General Musharraf as was witnessed on the route .
Every single person was angry on General Musharraf .
they wanted the judges to be restored .
At 4 am , in Gujrat , over 4000 were waiting for us and there was a public meeting at the time .
So was the case all along .
The road were not deserted but full of people where ever there was some population .
At Rawalpindi , it is see of heads all over .
After long time , ordinary Pakistanis have joined the lawyers movement .
Those who were saying where are the people , they can see today where are the people .
They are all against the military rule and for restoration of the top judges .
There are stalls every where and the participants are offered water and some time some food as well .
It is very hot and still the participant of this historic long march are fighting the heat by coming openly in the sun to raise slogans .
Around fifty women members of Labour Party Pakistan were raising slogans all the way .
they were very energetic and participating in full capacity .

Pakistan : Lawyers ' leadership calls off picket of parliament at end of Long March
By Farooq Tariq , Labour Party Pakistan
" Despite the conciliation of the lawyers ' leaders in the end of the Long March , this was one of the great events of the movements in Pakistan against the military dictatorship .
It brought hundreds of thousands in the street against militarization .
It helped developed new layers of political activists
It was a great manifestation of the working class joining hands with the middle class .
Not only those who participated will not forget it but by those as well who joined to welcome the caravan .
It has put a lot of pressure on the parliament but it could have been done decisively . "
We started our Long March from Lahore around 6 pm on June 12 , 2008 .
Four vehicles were carrying around 100 Labour Party Pakistan activists .
The destination was the capital , Islamabad , where the leaders of the lawyer ’s movement announced a picket of parliament .
This was to put pressure on the Pakistan Peoples Party Government to fulfill their promises to restore the top judges removed by President / General Pervez Musharraf .
The judges had refused to take oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order ( PCO ) after General Musharraf announced an emergency on 3 November 2007 .
Taking of oath under PCO would have legalized the Musharaf dictatorial measures .
The Pakistan Peoples Party came onto power after the general elections of 18 February .
The PPP had promised to restore the top judges within 30 days of coming into power .
However , they failed to fulfill their promise and wanted to put some conditions on the independent judiciary before they are get their job back .
' Go Musharraf , go ! '
We arrived at Islamabad on June 14 at 2 am .
It took 44 hours to cover , a distance of around 300 kilometers .
On average , we drove at a speed of 7 kilometers an hour .
This was due to the massive presence of ordinary people all the way to Islamabad .
They were reception camps and many thousands people were queuing many hours to receive the Long March and say to them a good luck .
No one had any rest but attended all the public meetings , replied to all the slogans against Musharraf regime , put stickers , spoke to people , waved hands all the time and walked some time ten kilometers along thousands .
The mood was euphoric .
They all wanted Musharraf to go .
I have never heard so much muddy language against a ruler as was used by many who saw this opportunity to express their real inner feeling .
They all were happy that at last something is going to happen .
“ Go and get Musharraf out , we are with you ” was a comment we heard very regularly .
It was an all out anti-Musharraf consciousness expressed all the way .
Imagine people queuing up in thousands even after 12 pm ...
Dirty tactics by PPP
We attended a public meeting at 4 am at Gujrat where few thousands have refused to go home until out caravan arrive and speak to them .
This is a city where he leader of Musharraf supported Pakistan Muslim League was defeated despite all his best efforts .
Here we saw for the first time the flags of Pakistan Peoples Party within the crowed that were waiting for the participants of the Long March .
The PPP leadership had advised its members not to attend this Long March .
The Peoples Lawyers Forum , a PPP front among the advocates , had announced a complete boycott of the event and many PPP leaders were making jokes of the Long March .
They were making very hurtful remarks about the Long March .
Javed Bhatti , an LPP activist , called me and told me that some private television channels are commenting about the “ low turn out ” of the Long March .
I was surprised about this dirty tactics of PPP leadership who had used some of its journalist supports to propagate this lie .
This was all contrary to the factual position .
However , the PPP activists in hundreds had defied the main leadership to become part of the lawyer ’s movement .
This was a welcoming sign and the speakers at the public rally at 4 am recognized the importance of this participation .
Mobile stolen
I had started using my mobile to write every few hours a running commentary on the long march and was posting to Labour Party Pakistan supported email list “ Socialist Pakistan News ( SPN ) ” .
However , here in Gujrat , my revolutionary tempo had a break .
I lost my mobile and so was the hard labour of at least six months to collect all the telephone numbers and emails addresses .
The leaders of Pakistan Bhatta Mazdoor Union at Gujrat offered us a cup of tea .
I had almost lost my voice because of the consistent sloganeering .
While I was using some hot water to freshen up my throat , my mobile was taken away within seconds and the sim was thrown out immediately .
It took few hours before I recovered from this great shock .
Those who had erected the reception camps offered a lot of drinks , food and biscuits on many places .
We were quite pleased with this gesture .
At Jehlum , around 6 am we had a meeting of all the comrades of LPP and discussed our strategy so far and the improvement .
It was a very good road side meeting which brought good results in shape of more active participation of all the comrades .
Rawalpindi to Islamabad in 12 hours
We entered Rawalpindi around 2 pm and saw some LPP flags welcoming the Long March .
We also saw an LPP flag waving on the main truck of the lawyer ’s leadership , a truck that would lead us to the parliament .
It was the work of Rawalpindi comrades .
Here we saw the red flags of other Left groups like the Peoples Rights Movement , Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party , Awami Jamhoori Itehad , Awami Tehreek and National Workers Party .
While the green flags of Jamaat Islami and Muslim League Nawaz were the major part of the caravan , but it was difficult to ignore the red flags as well .
Flags of Imran Khan Tehreek Insaaf were also seen all along the route .
It took us around 12 hours from Rawalpindi to Islamabad .
Alia , an activist of People Rights Movement inspired many thousands by her creative slogans and speeches .
We all were now out of our vehicles and gathered around the truck of PRM who had good arrangement of loud speakers .
All Reds were there .
A good unity action by all the left groups .
We were the last one to reach the parliament area .
The reason was that none of us had a rest or a proper hot food for the last eighteen hours .
Comrades wanted to eat something before we reach for the final destination .
Here the comrades from Rawalpindi had also joined us .
Over 100 of us started walking to the parliament from Aab Para Chouck at around 1.30 am .
It was around two kilometers .
We all had our red flags and started the final chanting of slogans .
We had heard already that over 100,000 had arrived before our main caravan to reach at the main venue .
At Rawalpindi , it was an ocean of heads .
Everywhere , there were people waving flags and chanting slogans .
As we arrived at the main area where over 100,000 had gathered already , we started moving to the front of the gathering and raised slogans .
We saw thousands of lawyers in their suite lying on the ground because of long distance they covered to come here .
Some have already erected the camps in anticipation of few days of picket .
For them , it was now or never situation .
PMLN 's role and a ' bitter end '
We came very near to the main platform and Mian Nawaz Sharif was just going to speak at the time .
He spoke well about the issue of the judges but in the end , he advised the lawyer ’s leaders to rethink about the picket of the parliament .
He in fact asked them not to go ahead for the picket and that it was OK what they have done .
We immediately realized that the leadership of lawyer ’s movement had been in discussion with PMLN and that they had not announced publicly what they will do at the end of the Long March .
The impression given by the leaders of the movement was very clear .
“ It is now or never ” .
A picket of lawyers in thousands would have spoiled the uneasy relationship of PPP and PMLN , the two main parties of the capitalists and feudal .
The PMLN is in power in Punjab and had come out of the central government when PPP had not restored the judges as promised .
However , they did not want to go very far in this regard .
The chief minister of Punjab Mian Shahbaz Sharif had already come out openly against the picket of parliament .
Resistance turned into reconciliation
Aitzaz Ahsan , president Supreme Court Bar Association announced the end of Long March while speaking to thousands .
It sparked an immediate reaction by the young lawyers who wanted go all the way .
Many wept and had tears in their eyes on this open reconciliation policy of the main leadership of the lawyer ’s movement .
The leadership had moved quickly from resistance to reconciliation .
No one agreed to the arguments of Aitzaz Ahsan that we do not have the resources for the picket .
Much more could have been gained if the leaders of the lawyer ’s movement would have stood according the predominant rebellious consciousness .
It was a gross tactical mistake to loose this opportunity to put more pressure .
It left a very bitter mood in the end and a movement divided on the issue .
A bitter end in short terms of a historic gathering .
It was a crisis of the leadership .
It may be the beginning of the more and more conciliation by the leaders of the movement .
Despite the conciliation of the lawyer ’s leaders in the end of the Long March , this was one of the great events of the movements in Pakistan against the military dictatorship .
It brought hundreds of thousands in the street against militarization .
It helped developed new layers of political activists
It was a great manifestation of the working class joining hands with the middle class .
Not only those who participated will not forget it but by those as well who joined to welcome the caravan .
It has put a lot of pressure on the parliament but it could have been done decisively .
We arrived back in Lahore on June 14 evening .
However , the comrades who had started their participation on June 9 from Sind arrived back to their homes on June 16 evening .
For them , it was a long week on the roads , as was the case for those who started their Long March from Quetta and other cities of Baluchistan .
“ The boy had been pranking around in the garden having a competition with his cousin , when they were breaking wind and lighting it .
Right behind him was a petrol can and that just flashed .

I wonder who has custody ...
SF / fantasy writer Neal Asher is the author of Gridlinked and The Skinner .
His latest book , The Line of Polity , is a complex , multilayered story about rebels in a slave world .
Neal Asher 's homepage
1. Princes in Amber by Roger Zelazny
With fantasy one often has to think of a well - loved series before narrowing the selection to a favourite book .
So it is with Zelazny .
I 've read his Princes in Amber books so often I know them almost verbatim , so much so that I am now trying to forget them so I can return to them with renewed pleasure .
The best of the line is The Guns of Avalon .
2. Waylander by David Gemmell
Gemmell 's name guarantees a satisfying story and a thumping good read .
I recommend all his heroic creations - Druss the axeman , the Jerusalem man , among others - but my favourite has to be Waylander : Clint Eastwood with a crossbow and the same ' make my day , punk ' attitude .
3. Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien
It seems fashionable at the moment to pick holes in the greats , and Lord of the Rings gets the biggest hammering because it is the progenitor of most swords / wizards / elves / dwarves fantasy .
People seem to forget that it is mimicked because it is very good , original for its time , and written with an understanding of story and language that few can match .
4. Witches Abroad by Terry Pratchett
I enjoyed his neglected SF books , like Dark Side of the Sun , and every single one of his Discworld books .
Foremost of these has to be Witches Abroad .
Who can fail to be amused by the travails of a vampire , transformed into a bat , being stunned by a piece of garlic sausage tossed out of a window , and then eaten by a dyspeptic cat ?
5. Volkhavaar by Tanith Lee
I 've been reading Tanith Lee since I was a teenager , beginning with The Birthgrave and The Storm Lord .
Only recently did I discover , to my delight , how many more of her books I 've yet to read .
This one presented the idea that the quality of worship creates the god long before Terry Pratchett 's Small Gods .
6. Stormbringer by Michael Moorcock
Moorcock 's interlinked Eternal Champion series is a constant source of enjoyment .
Of its tragic hero incarnations , my favourite is Elric of Melnibone and the best book has to be Stormbringer .
And as for that other sword , Excalibur ?
Pah !
Use it to spread your butter .
7. Chronicles of Thomas Covenant by Stephen Donaldson
These are cursed by comparison to Tolkien : there 's a dark lord , there 's a gold ring ...
However , I have to say that this series shows a greater understanding of human nature and of evil .
My favourite is The Illearth War , but read from the beginning and weep .
8. Anubis Gates by Tim Powers
This is fantasy without the usual trappings , and utterly unique for now .
What a superb book .
I think I 'll have to sit down and read it again .
9 . The Eyes of the Overworld by Jack Vance
I loved the invention in this : the strange lands , stranger peoples and a loathsome anti-hero who is just engaging enough that you want him to win through .
Vance is a master of the weird .
10 . Shiva 3000 by Jan Lars Jensen
I 'm including this for its portrayal of a weird future India , complete with lashings of colour and exuberance , a monstrous , roaming Jagannath and a battle in which spices are used as weapons ( imagine getting a face full of chilli powder ) .
Wonderful stuff .
Kucinich to investigate police surveillance of protest groups
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , who has figured prominently in recent political news for his attempts to begin impeachment hearings against President George W. Bush , today announced that the congressional subcommittee he chairs will look into reports of peace groups being surveilled by police and private investigators .
" [ M ] ost people would be upset to know that police were spying on lawful citizens and infiltrating peaceful organizations , rather than chasing down real criminals , " said Kucinich in a press release delivered to RAW STORY .
" At a minimum , such police spying is clearly a waste of taxpayer dollars and a diversion from the mission of protecting and serving the people .
" I want the subcommittee to determine how widespread these activities are and who ordered them , " the Ohio Democrat and former presidential candidate said .
Kucinich chairs the House Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The press release referred to reports that Maryland state police officers infiltrated peace and anti-death penalty groups and that private investigators working on behalf of " several large corporations " had surveilled environmental groups .
Such surveillance is apparently not limited to law enforcement and private investigators .
In January 2007 , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) released a report showing " widespread Pentagon surveillance of peace activists . "

With ongoing rising fuel prices , many solutions are being sought to reduce our dependence on foreign oil .
While it is necessary , yea , even urgent , in the long run all efforts will be negated by the one of most inefficient and wasteful consumer of fossil fuels in the world .
No , I 'm not referring to China .
I am talking about the US military .
In WWII , the US daily military fuel consumption per service member was 1.67 gallons each .
Today , the consumption is slightly over 27 gallons per service member per day .
My rusty 1993
Chevy pickup truck could drive all week on that , and still have gas left over to fill my lawn mower .
Now my truck is not fuel efficient by any means , but it has one saving virtue — it is paid off .
With my humble income I cannot afford to buy a new , fuel - efficient car .
The high monthly payments , along with the extra car insurance coverage a car loan entails , would negate any savings I 'd realize in gas mileage .
But as bad as the mileage my old truck gets , it beats the US Army 's mechanized vehicles all hollow .
The Army 's Bradley fighting vehicle gets 1 mile per gallon .
The mighty Abrams tank gets a whopping 2 miles per gallon .
But it gets worse .
It takes gasoline to fuel the transport to get gasoline to the fighting vehicles .
Napoleon once said that an Army marches on its stomach .
Little could he imagine that in the future , modern mechanized armies would be so dependent on oil .
In Iraq , alone , the US military expends an estimated 1.7 million gallons a day .
Multiple that by whatever the current price of gasoline is as of this moment , and you get a pretty good idea we are talking about a lot of money , our money , is being spent .
And that 's not counting the fuel the military uses on everyday operations and military , air , and ship maneuvers worldwide outside of Iraq .
The US military in 2004 consumed 144 million barrels of oil .
This amount almost equals the consumption of the country of Greece !
Then add the loss of fuel through accidents and mishandling , such as the 345,000 gallons of jet fuel negligently spilled this year at Fort Drum located in upstate New York .
I grimace remorsefully at spilling drops of gas while refueling my lawn mower .
The official response to this multimillion - dollar fiasco was less than penitent :
" This one just showed a big spotlight on where we were seriously lacking in our capability to add precision to our analysis and precision to our ability to track these types of losses , " said Colonel James Meyer , the Defense Energy Support Center 's director of operations .
So it took an ongoing leakage of 345,000 gallons over several years to spotlight this problem before the DESC noticed it ?
Would the DESC have noticed it any sooner if the spilled fuel had been ignited , and was observed from orbit by the Space Shuttle ?
I have my doubts .
What is bitterly ironic is our gas guzzling military is occupying one of the richest oil producing countries in the world , yet it 's presence in Iraq has succeeded it quad - tripling the cost of the very fuel it needs .
Notwithstanding the many energy solutions being promoted , we will unlikely to ever see military vehicles , aircraft , and ships go " green " or become fuel - efficient hybrids .
In terms of logistics and supply , such options would become a quartermasters and maintenance nightmare .
For military operations , fuel efficiency is often necessary sacrificed for the sake of armor , armament , and speed needed for survival in combat — thus ensuring the US military will continue to be the largest , least efficient consumer of oil .
As a result , our military 's ongoing need for oil to fulfill its ever - expanding mission to police the world will continue to make us dependent on fossil fuels and foreign oil for years to come .

The Best of Ron Shirtz
Last week Congress cut benefits to Medicare recipients and liberal pundits applauded .
Indeed , Paul Krugman said this was " Kennedy ’s Big Day " and " the first major health care victory that Democrats have won in a long time . "
Of course , Krugman and the others who applauded this " victory " did n’t say that they were cutting Medicare benefits – even though that is exactly what they were doing – instead they framed the victory as one over privatization and waste .
Here ’s the story .
Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in Medicare ’s fee for service plan or they can choose Medicare Advantage joining , for example , an HMO .
In the latter case , Medicare pays the HMO a rate per enrollee and the HMO competes to obtain enrollees by offering them a package of benefits and premiums .
Now what you will be told about Medicare Advantage is that it is more expensive than traditional Medicare .
Thus the CommonWealth Fund says :
Private Medicare Advantage ( MA ) plans were paid an
average 12.4 % more per enrollee in 2005 compared with what the same
enrollees would have cost in the traditional Medicare fee - for - service
program …
That much is true .
But why are MA programs more expensive ?
The answer , which one gets by innuendo and implication , is that Medicare Advantage programs are wasteful and the extra money is being pocketed by corporations .
The CommonWealth Fund says :
" … eliminating extra payments to private plans could save Medicare a projected $ 30 billion over five years . " ( italics added )
Paul Krugman says :
the fastest - growing type of Medicare Advantage plan , private
fee - for - service , costs taxpayers 17 percent more per beneficiary than
Medicare without the middleman .
( italics added ) .
Robert Waldmann is least careful and in a comment on Tyler ’s article on means testing says
Cowen doubts that expanding the public share of health insurance would
reduce costs .
We have a test case medicare vs medicare advantage
accounts .
They cost , on average 12 % more per patient …
Thus the message is that traditional Medicare is cheaper because it eliminates the middleman , does n’t involve private corporations , and is more efficient at lowering costs .
None of this is true .
I ’ll give you the full story in a minute but let me first point to one clue that something is amiss .
According to all of the above " enrollment in these plans has been growing rapidly " ( Krugman ) .
Now why would so many Medicare beneficiaries opt out of low - cost , efficient Medicare and into high - cost , inefficient MA plans ?
While you puzzle over the clue let ’s cover the necessary background .
Here is how the MA program pays a private provider ( quoting the CBO ) .
Private plans that want to participate in the Medicare Advantage program must submit bids indicating the per capita payment for which they are willing to provide Medicare ’s Part A ( Hospital Insurance ) and Part B ( Supplementary Medical Insurance ) benefits–and to take on the financial risk of doing so .
The government compares those bids with county level benchmarks that are determined in advance through statutory rules .
The benchmarks are the maximum payment the government will make for enrollees in private plans ; in most cases the plans ’ bids ( and the resulting payments ) are lower than the benchmarks … .
If a plan ’s bid is less than the benchmark , Medicare pays the plan its bid plus 75 percent of the amount by which the benchmark exceeds the bid .
So far you might think that Krugman et al. have a point .
If the benchmarks are set too high and Medicare pays the plan its bid plus 75 % of the amount by which the benchmark exceeds the bid then the plans could bid their costs and get extra payments .
Now , I hope that many of you are thinking , What about competition ?
Good thinking !
Indeed , if that was all there was to it , competition would push the bids below costs .
But in fact to resolve our puzzle we need not rely on competition and economic theory because here is the kicker ( quoting the CBO again , italics added ) :
If a plan ’s bid is less than the benchmark , Medicare pays the plan its bid plus 75 percent of the amount by which the benchmark exceeds the bid .
Such a plan must return that 75 percent to beneficiaries as additional benefits or as a rebate of their Part B or Part D premiums .
Now the solution to our puzzle becomes clear .
Why do beneficiaries choose MA plans ?
… because such plans provide additional benefits beyond those available within traditional Medicare , including coverage for services not covered by FFS Medicare ( for instance , dental services ) and cash rebates of premiums or reduced cost - sharing .
In fact , the CBO estimates that the vast bulk of the increased payments to private providers flow to enrollees who get better benefits and lower payments .
Indeed , in the case of HMOs enrollees benefit twice – first because the benchmarks are higher and second because , contra Krugman et al. , the HMOs actually have lower costs than traditional Medicare !
Thus the CBO writes :
In contrast , payments to HMOs averaged 10 percent above FFS costs …
On average , HMOs offered extra benefits and rebates equal to 13 percent of FFS costs ; those additional benefits and rebates reflected the difference between the benchmark ( which averaged 10 percent above FFS costs ) and the plans ’ bids ( which averaged 3 percent below FFS costs ) .
That could be written more clearly but what they are saying is that Medicare pays HMOs 10 percent more than they would pay for an enrollee in traditional Medicare but the HMOs offer the enrollee 13 percent more worth of extra benefits and rebates .
In other words , the HMOs pass on to the enrollee all of Medicare ’s " extra payments " plus some .
( Note that this is exactly what one would expect in a competitive market . )
Now , I am not saying that higher Medicare payments are a good idea .
But I dislike the fact that politicians are being lauded for fighting " wasteful privatization " when what they are really doing is cutting medical benefits for the elderly .
Israel 's beleaguered prime minister , Ehud Olmert , threw his country and the Middle East into political turmoil last night when he announced he was resigning after months of mounting pressure over corruption allegations .
Olmert said he would step down in September after his Kadima party has chosen a new leader .
The main candidates are Tzipi Livni , the foreign minister , a pragmatic centrist , and Shaul Mofaz , transport minister but a hawk on national security issues , including Iran 's nuclear ambitions and the ongoing , though faltering , negotiations with the Palestinians .
Last night 's announcement came as a surprise but hardly a shock , given the accumulating weight of comment that he could not go on in the face of a slew of police and judicial inquiries .
" I will step aside properly in an honourable and responsible way , and afterwards I will prove my innocence , " Olmert told reporters from a podium outside his Jerusalem office .
" I want to make it clear - I am proud to be a citizen of a country where the prime minister can be investigated like a regular citizen .
It is the duty of the police to investigate , and the duty of the prosecution to instruct the police .
The prime minister is not above the law . "
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , deeply pessimistic about peace since talks were relaunched at Annapolis in the US last November , are likely to be indifferent to his departure , though Olmert forged personal ties with Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president and Fatah leader .
Riad Malki , the Palestinian foreign minister , said : " It 's true that Olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process , and he spoke about this process with great attention but this process has not achieved any progress or breakthrough . "
A spokesman for Abbas said last night that the Palestinian president considered Olmert 's decision an " internal Israeli matter " , adding : " The Palestinian Authority deals with the prime minister of Israel , regardless if he is Olmert or somebody else . "
Israeli and Palestinian officials said they would continue their efforts to find a peace agreement by the end of the year , in accordance with US deadlines .
Olmert , in office for two and a half years , was also responsible for restarting talks with Syria , through Turkish mediation , but drew criticism that he did so as a diversion from his domestic difficulties .
A fourth round of indirect negotiations ended yesterday .
Olmert 's reputation was irreparably damaged by the 2006 war in Lebanon , when he was criticised by an official commission of inquiry for having mishandled Israel 's response to a cross - border raid by Hizbullah guerrillas , embroiling the country in a month - long war in which civilians were subject to missile salvoes and at the end of which there was no clear victory over the enemy .
But he was credited with having helped restore Israel 's battered deterrent capability by bombing an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria and , so many Arabs believed , assassinating a Hizbullah military leader in the heart of Damascus .
Apart from talks with the Palestinians , the biggest issue facing Olmert 's successor will be the crisis over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Mofaz , a former chief of staff and defence minister , said recently that an Israeli attack on Iran was " unavoidable " because sanctions were not working .
Israeli political analyst Dan Margalit , an old friend of Olmert , called the prime minister 's decision to step down " a sad end to a miserable career " .
Uri Dromi , another pundit , called Olmert a " lame duck " .
Olmert , the cigar - smoking lawyer and bon viveur , succeeded Ariel Sharon , who was felled by a stroke , after the former Likud leader , who founded Kadima , withdrew Israeli troops and settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2005 .
The Israeli public reacted with mounting anger and contempt to the news of Olmert 's legal problems .
Nahum Barnea , a columnist with the Yediot Aharonot newspaper , wrote on the eve of the recent EU - Mediterranean summit in France that the prime minister was finished , but was in denial : " Politicians in Israel , the leaders he will meet in Paris , prosecutors and the police all know it .
The only one who refuses to acknowledge it is Olmert . "
Primary elections for the Kadima leadership will take place in two rounds in September .
The winner will then have 28 days ( and 14 more if needed ) to form a coalition .
If he or she succeeds in doing so , the winner will complete Olmert 's term , due to end in 2010 .
If not , new elections will be held within three months - and the most likely outcome , according to current polls , would be a win for Likud rightwinger Binyamin Netanyahu .
Olmert is the subject of two criminal investigations .
One involves suspicions that he took bribes from the American businessman Morris Talansky and the other charges him with submitting duplicate claims for travel expenses in his previous posts as trade minister and mayor of Jerusalem .
She ’s lying down , and her arms are n’t quite right , but you can tell she ’s almost got it .
Just a few more years of practice and she too will be able to perform the human swastika .

If The Associated Press ' business model is n't broken now , it could be soon .
The not - for - profit* group – a co-op news organization owned by 1,500 daily newspapers nationwide – makes much of its money charging newspapers and broadcasters fees for the right to use AP content .
It 's been a happy little arrangement for the last 162 years , but what happens when many of AP 's member newspapers and broadcaster die off or dry up ?
AP could be left in a lurch .
Close to 45 percent of AP 's sales come from U.S. broadcasters and newspapers – two industries in turmoil .
Of course newspapers are more reliant upon AP now than they ever were before – especially since editorial budgets and staffs have been slashed – but it's a bit like selling drugs to late - stage cancer patients .
[ Full disclosure : I did time at AP between Nov. 2005 and Aug. 2007 .__
Also , __Wired.com pays for AP content . ]
The flip side of the equation is that web companies are picking up where the newspapers left off .
AOL , Microsoft , Yahoo and Google all generate a tremendous amount of traffic from AP stories , and web traffic equals ad revenue .
Google CEO Eric
Schmidt recently said there is a " moral imperative " to keep news businesses alive .
We 'd venture to guess there 's a financial imperative , too .
We have a crazy suggestion :
Why does n't AP give up the not - for - profit status , buy out members ' interest , and sell itself to a new co-op of internet companies , such as AOL , Yahoo , Google and Microsoft ?
Conceptually , it would be a lateral rather than a forward " Hail Mary " pass since they'd be replacing one consortium that was once the center of the news universe – newspapers – with the current publishing leaders .
The price for AP probably would be cheap – the company generated a little over $ 710 million in sales last year ; it earned a paltry $ 24 million ; and members ' equity totaled $ 89.2 million .
But from a strategic standpoint , AP could be better off if it were owned by web players rather than newspapers – and internet companies are probably much better positioned to make money off AP , the world 's largest news gathering association .
Granted , there 's little chance AP could get all 1,500 equity holders to agree to sell .
And even if they did , there 's no way of knowing what AP would look like in 25 years .
" The whole concept of the AP would have to change , " says Ed Atorino , a newspaper analyst at the Benchmark Company .
" By definition , a co-op is n't supposed to make money .
Unless somebody could pay $ 100 million to just restructure the whole thing , I can't imagine that there 's any value there . "
* We erroneously referred to AP as a non-profit in an earlier version of this story ; it 's actually a not - for - profit .

( CNN ) -- Oklahoma authorities on Monday urged the public to help solve a murder mystery , playing a dramatic segment of a frantic 911 call from a relative who reported two girls had been found dead in a ditch .
Taylor Placker , left , and Skyla Whitaker were friends who both loved animals , their families say .
The 911 tape was released six weeks after the bullet - riddled bodies of 13 - year - old Taylor Placker and 11 - year - old Skyla Whitaker were discovered along a remote country road in the town of Weleetka .
A breathless woman , identified only as a family member , can be heard on the tape .
Her voice is raw with emotion .
" Somebody killed two young girls . " she says .
" They are both down here dead .
My granddaughter and her friend . ... "
Jessica Brown , Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman , said she hoped someone would hear the tape and be inspired to identify the killer or killers .
Watch authorities play the frantic tape »
As time passes , the caller seems to grow more desperate : " Lord help me , please .
Oh God , oh God , oh God !
My babies , babies , babies ! "
See a map of Weleetka , Oklahoma »
" It breaks your heart hearing that , does n't it , " said Brown .
" We know someone knows what happened , " she added .
" Hopefully if they hear the tape they will understand what happened and come forward . "
Brown said investigators have run down about 500 leads and have eliminated 100 possible suspects but have not been able to crack the case .
Brown told reporters authorties initially had been reluctant to release the tape out of concern for the victims ' families .
But after consulting with the families , the decision was made to appeal to the public .
" Someone has to come forward , " she said .
Police are asking members of the public with more information about the case to call ( 800 ) 522-8017 .
The two girls had planned a sleepover at Taylor 's house on June 8 , the night they were killed .
They left the house about 5 p.m .
Less than 30 minutes later , Taylor 's grandfather discovered the bodies in a ditch on the side of a road , near a bridge that is a popular gathering spot in the area .
The killings have rattled the community of Weleetka , a town of about 1,000 residents 75 miles from Tulsa .
Taylor and Skyla were the only girls in their sixth - and fifth - grade classes ,
Investigators do n't have any suspects or motives , but a forensic examination of the bodies indicated that two guns had been used .
Police have said they are looking for two shooters .
There has been speculation the girls ' slayings were " thrill killings , " and police investigators have said they hope one of the shooters will turn against the other .
Several witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man on the same dirt road where the girls were shot , Brown said last month .
She said authorities believed that the man , " who did n't look like he should have been there , " was on the road before the girls were shot multiple times in the head and chest and left in a ditch .
Witnesses described the man as having a black ponytail , about 6 feet tall and 35 years old .
They said he was standing in front of a white single - cab pickup with chrome striping , possibly a Chevy or Ford model , with Oklahoma tags , Brown said in a press conference on June 13 .
" He acted a little suspiciously but we do n't know what he was doing , " said Brown , stopping short of calling him a suspect .
" We just want to talk to him .
We think he might have seen something . "
Brown said other witnesses reported hearing gunshots near the crime scene .
Taylor 's uncle , Joe Mosher , described his niece as an intelligent girl who loved animals .
" She rescued turtles on the highway and wrote her name on them and turned them loose in the country , " Mosher said Wednesday .
Mosher said Taylor was at the top of her class in public school after being homeschooled most of her life .
" She was very smart , " said Mosher , who last saw Taylor at a family reunion two weeks before her death .
Skyla 's grandmother , Claudia Farrow , described the girl as " a typical tomboy .
She lived out in the country .
She loved animals , loved to fish . "
" Every time she`d come over here in my yard , which they just lived about a hundred yards from me , all her animals would follow her over here , " Farrow told CNN last month .
" She 'd have five or six cats following her , her little dog and her goat .
I 'd get on to her daddy , I said , ' Now , do n't you let that goat eat my flowers , ' because she 'd always eat my flowers .
I will miss that .
I will miss her . "

At a news conference before a speech in Vancouver , BC , Colin Powell said that he would not rule out supporting Barack Obama .
He said that his support of John McCain is not a foregone conclusion .
He also said that although he and Obama are both black , he wo n’t be voting based on race .
“ I will vote for the individual I think that brings the best set of tools to the problems of 21st - century America and the 21st - century world regardless of party , regardless of anything else other than the most qualified candidate .
Both of them certainly have the qualifications to be the president of the United States , but both of them cannot be , ” Powell said .
Beyond race , I can understand why Powell might support Obama over McCain .
The reason has everything to do with McCain ’s desire to continue and expand upon the Bush foreign policy doctrine , which goes against the Powell doctrine that military force should only be used as a last resort .
Still it would be a shocker if Colin Powell came out and gave a formal public endorsement to Barack Obama at any point .

The story was around last summer that Powell had a few conversations which offered informal advice to Obama .
Powell has been quietly supportive of Obama as he has risen through the political ranks over the last few years , and I am sure that this story will revive the speculation about a possible Obama / Powell ticket .
I believe that is extremely unlikely , but maybe Powell could be coaxed back into public life with a role in shaping Obama ’s foreign policy .
The idea of redeeming himself for being used in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq would have to have quite a bit of appeal to a man like Colin Powell .

Viacom sues YouTube for $ 1 Billion , but then what ?
As the Viacom ’s lawsuit against YouTube and its parent company Google rolls forward , it ’s worth asking if any outcome of the suit will change the situation for Viacom .
In fact , were the impossible to happen , like a judge shutting down YouTube altogether , Viacom may be worse off .
CNET ’s coverage of the piece sites an anonymous source from Viacom who notes that “ The company basically is paying for an entire new department to watch YouTube . ”
But imagine how difficult it will be to police amateur video without YouTube or other video sharing sites around — it ’d be impossible .
That ’s because even if huge repositories of video are made illegal , web - based video wo n’t just disappear , it ’ll move .
Our favorite cute kitten videos could end up on the same foreign servers that are serving up online poker and other forms of gambling to Americans each day , despite that activity being made illegal by the last Congress .
( That was a Repubican Congress , the guys who stay out of your lives . )
Just like Sierra Leone lent its flag to pirate broadcasters in the 1960s , it may rent its servers to pirate video broadcasters of the web variety .
On the other hand , videos could move to smaller websites domestically , even individual blogs and web pages .
But the location does n’t really matter , either scenario would be bad for content creators .
Balkanizing videos and making them harder to find makes them harder to police .
Similarly , moving video from larger sites run by legitimate , domestic businesses manes take - down notices might not be honored .
It ’s possible that YouTube could function similarly as an index , just as Google does for web content .
But the Torrent Spy case suggests that even “ contributory ” copyright infringement — making the copyright - infringing material easier to find — is just as illegal as hosting it in the first place .
This means that even video search could be off the table if the principles of the DMCA are n’t upheld .
Ultimately , I just do n’t see what Viacom thinks it ’s getting out of this lawsuit , other than the obvious benefit that comes with $ 1 billion in cold hard cash .
To think this move will suddenly make the realities of web - based video go away is foolish at best .
It might be hard for some to accept , but we just ca n’t make it 2004 again .

The Top Ten Connections Between NIST and Nano - Thermites
Kevin R. Ryan , 7-02-08
“ Was the steel tested for explosives or thermite residues ? … NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel . ”
NIST Responses to FAQs , August 2006
The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) has had considerable difficulty determining a politically correct sequence of events for the unprecedented destruction of three World Trade Center ( WTC ) buildings on 9/11 ( Douglas 2006 , Ryan 2006 , Gourley 2007 ) .
But despite a number of variations in NIST ’s story , it never considered explosives or pyrotechnic materials in any of its hypotheses .
This omission is at odds with several other striking facts ; first , the requirement of the national standard for fire investigation ( NFPA 921 ) , which calls for testing related to thermite and other pyrotechnics , and second , the extensive experience NIST investigators have with explosive and thermite materials .
One of the most intriguing aspects of NIST ’s diversionary posture has been their total lack of interest in explosive or pyrotechnic features in their explanations .
Despite the substantial evidence for the use of explosives at the WTC ( Jones 2006 , Legge and Szamboti 2007 ) , and the extensive expertise in explosives among NIST investigators ( Ryan 2007 ) , explosives were never considered in the NIST WTC investigation .
Only after considerable criticism of this fact did NIST deign to add one small disclaimer to their final report on the towers , suggesting they found no evidence for explosives .
The extensive evidence that explosives were used at the WTC includes witness testimony ( MacQueen 2006 ) , overwhelming physical evidence ( Griffin 2005 , Hoffman et al 2005 , Jones and Legge et al 2008 ) and simple common sense ( Legge 2007 ) .
There is also substantial evidence that aluminothermic ( thermite ) materials were present at the WTC ( Jones 2007 ) , and the presence of such materials can explain the existence of intense fire where it would not otherwise have existed .
Additionally , despite agreement from all parties that the assumed availability of fuel allowed for the fires in any given location of each of the WTC buildings to last only twenty minutes ( NIST 2007 ) , the fires lasted much longer and produced extreme temperatures ( Jones and Farrer et al 2008 ) .
These inexplicable fires are a reminder that the WTC buildings were not simply demolished , but were demolished in a deceptive way .
That is , the buildings were brought down so as to make it look like the impact of the planes and the resulting fires might have caused their unprecedented , symmetrical destruction .
Therefore , shaped charges and other typical explosive configurations were likely used , but there was more to it than that .
Those committing the crimes needed to create fire where it would not have existed otherwise , and draw attention toward the part of the buildings where the planes impacted ( or in the case of WTC 7 , away from the building altogether ) .
This was most probably accomplished through the use of nano - thermites , which are high - tech energetic materials made by mixing ultra fine grain ( UFG ) aluminum and UFG metal oxides ; usually iron oxide , molybdenum oxide or copper oxide , although other compounds can be used ( Prakash 2005 , Rai 2005 ) .
The mixing is accomplished by adding these reactants to a liquid solution where they form what are called “ sols ” , and then adding a gelling agent that captures these tiny reactive combinations in their intimately mixed state ( LLNL 2000 ) .
The resulting “ sol - gel ” is then dried to form a porous reactive material that can be ignited in a number of ways .
The high surface area of the reactants within energetic sol - gels allows for the far higher rate of energy release than is seen in “ macro ” thermite mixtures , making nano - thermites “ high explosives ” as well as pyrotechnic materials ( Tillitson et al 1999 ) .
Sol - gel nano - thermites , are often called energetic nanocomposites , metastable intermolecular composites ( MICs ) or superthermite ( COEM 2004 , Son et al 2007 ) , and silica is often used to create the porous , structural framework ( Clapsaddle et al 2004 , Zhao et al 2004 ) .
Nano - thermites have also been made with RDX ( Pivkina et al 2004 ) , and with thermoplastic elastomers ( Diaz et al 2003 ) .
But it is important to remember that , despite the name , nano - thermites pack a much bigger punch than typical thermite materials .
It turns out that explosive , sol - gel nano - thermites were developed by US government scientists , at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories ( LLNL ) ( Tillitson et al 1998 , Gash et al 2000 , Gash et al 2002 ) .
These LLNL scientists reported that --
“ The sol - gel process is very amenable to dip - , spin- , and spray - coating technologies to coat surfaces .
We have utilized this property to dip - coat various substrates to make sol - gel Fe , O , / Al / Viton coatings .
The energetic coating dries to give a nice adherent film .
Preliminary experiments indicate that films of the hybrid material are self - propagating when ignited by thermal stimulus ”
( Gash et al 2002 ) .
The amazing correlation between floors of impact and floors of apparent failure suggests that spray - on nano - thermite materials may have been applied to the steel components of the WTC buildings , underneath the upgraded fireproofing ( Ryan 2008 ) .
This could have been done in such a way that very few people knew what was happening .
The Port Authority ’s engineering consultant Buro Happold , helping with evaluation of the fireproofing upgrades , suggested the use of “ alternative materials ” ( NIST 2005 ) .
Such alternative materials could have been spray - on nano - thermites substituted for intumescent paint or Interchar - like fireproofing primers ( NASA 2006 ) .
It seems quite possible that this kind of substitution could have been made with few people noticing .
Regardless of how thermite materials were installed in the WTC , it is strange that NIST has been so blind to any such possibility .
In fact , when reading NIST ’s reports on the WTC , and its periodic responses to FAQs from the public , one might get the idea that no one in the NIST organization had ever heard of nano - thermites before .
But the truth is , many of the scientists and organizations involved in the NIST WTC investigation were not only well aware of nano - thermites , they actually had considerable connection to , and in some cases expertise in , this exact technology .
Here are the top ten reasons why nano - thermites , and nano - thermite coatings , should have come to mind quickly for the NIST WTC investigators .
NIST was working with LLNL to test and characterize these sol - gel nano - thermites , at least as early as 1999 ( Tillitson et al 1999 ) .
Forman Williams , the lead engineer on NIST ’s advisory committee , and the most prominent engineering expert for Popular Mechanics , is an expert on the deflagration of energetic materials and the “ ignition of porous energetic materials ” ( Margolis and Williams 1996 , Telengator et al 1998 , Margolis and Williams 1999 ) .
Nano - thermites are porous energetic materials .
Additionally , Williams ’ research partner , Stephen Margolis , has presented at conferences where nano - energetics are the focus ( Gordon 1999 ) .
Some of Williams ’ other colleagues at the University of California San Diego , like David J. Benson , are also experts on nano - thermite materials ( Choi et al 2005 , Jordan et al 2007 ) .
Science Applications International ( SAIC ) is the DOD and Homeland Security contractor that supplied the largest contingent of non-governmental investigators to the NIST WTC investigation .
SAIC has extensive links to nano - thermites , developing and judging nano - thermite research proposals for the military and other military contractors , and developing and formulating nano - thermites directly ( Army 2008 , DOD 2007 ) .
SAIC ’s subsidiary Applied Ordnance Technology has done research on the ignition of nanothermites with lasers ( Howard et al 2005 ) .
In an interesting coincidence , SAIC was the firm that investigated the 1993 WTC bombing , boasting that -- “ After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , our blast analyses produced tangible results that helped identify those responsible ( SAIC 2004 ) . ”
And the coincidences with this company do n’t stop there , as SAIC was responsible for evaluating the WTC for terrorism risks in 1986 as well ( CRHC 2008 ) .
SAIC is also linked to the late 1990s security upgrades at the WTC , the Rudy Giuliani administration , and the anthrax incidents after 9/11 , through former employees Jerome Hauer and Steven Hatfill .
Arden Bement , the metallurgist and expert on fuels and materials who was nominated as director of NIST by President George W. Bush in October 2001 , was former deputy secretary of defense , former director of DARPA ’s office of materials science , and former executive at TRW .
Of course , DOD and DARPA are both leaders in the production and use of nano - thermites ( Amptiac 2002 , DOD 2005 ) .
And military and aerospace contractor TRW has had a long collaboration with NASA laboratories in the development of energetic materials that are components of advanced propellants , like nano - gelled explosive materials ( NASA 2001 ) .
TRW Aeronautics also made fireproof composites and high performance elastomer formulations , and worked with NASA to make energetic aerogels .
Additionally , Bement was a professor at Purdue and MIT .
Purdue has a thriving program for nano - thermites ( Son 2008 ) .
And interestingly , at MIT ’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology , we find Martin Z. Bazant , son of notable “ conspiracy debunker ” Zdenek P. Bazant ( MIT 2008 ) , who does research on granular flows , and the electrochemical interactions of silicon .
Zdenek P. Bazant is interested in nanocomposites as well ( Northwestern 2008 ) , and how they relate to naval warfare ( ONR 2008 ) .
MIT was represented at nano - energetics conferences as early as 1998 ( Gordon 1998 ) .
Bement was also a director at both Battelle and the Lord Corporation .
Battelle ( where the anthrax was made ) is an organization of “ experts in fundamental technologies from the five National Laboratories we manage or co-manage for the US DOE . ”
Battelle advertises their specialization in nanocomposite coatings ( Battelle 2008 ) .
The Lord Corporation also makes high - tech coatings for military applications ( Lord 2008 ) .
In 1999 , Lord Corp was working with the Army and NASA on “ advanced polymer composites , advanced metals , and multifunctional materials ” ( Army 1999 ) .
Hratch Semerjian , long - time director of NIST ’s chemical division , was promoted to acting director of NIST in November 2004 , and took over the WTC investigation until the completion of the report on the towers .
Semerjian is closely linked to former NIST employee Michael Zachariah , perhaps the world ’s most prominent expert on nano - thermites ( Zachariah 2008 ) .
In fact , Semerjian and Zachariah co-authored ten papers that focus on nano - particles made of silica , ceramics and refractory particles .
Zachariah was a major player in the Defense University Research Initiative on Nanotechnology ( DURINT ) , a groundbreaking research effort for nano - thermites .
NIST has a long - standing partnership with NASA for the development of new nano - thermites and other nano - technological materials .
In fact , Michael Zachariah coordinates this partnership ( CNMM 2008 ) .
In 2003 , two years before the NIST WTC report was issued , the University of Maryland College Park ( UMCP ) and NIST signed a memorandum of understanding to develop nano - technologies like nano - thermites ( NIST 2003 ) .
Together , NIST and UMCP have done much work on nano - thermites ( NM2 2008 ) .
NIST has their own Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology ( CNST 2008 ) .
Additionally , NIST ’s Reactive Flows Group did research on nanostructured materials and high temperature reactions in the mid-nineties ( NRFG 1996 ) .
Richard Gann , who did the final editing of the NIST WTC report , managed a project called “ Next - Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program ” , both before and after 9/11 .
Andrzej Miziolek , another of the world ’s leading experts on nano - thermites ( Amptiac 2002 ) , is the author of “ Defense Applications of Nanomaterials ” , and also worked on Richard Gann ’s fire suppression project ( Gann 2002 ) .
Gann ’s project was sponsored by DOD ’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program ( SERDP ) , an organization that sponsored a number of LLNL ’s nano - thermite projects ( Simpson 2002 , Gash et al 2003 ) .
As part of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer , NIST partners with the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head ( NSWC - IH ) on Chemical Science and Technology ( FLCTT 2008 ) .
NSWC - IH is probably the most prominent US center for nano - thermite technology ( NSWC 2008 ) .
In 1999 , Jan Puszynski , a scientist working for the DURINT program , helped NSWC - IH design a pilot plant to produce nano - size aluminum powder .
It was reported that “ At that time , this was [ the ] only reliable source of aluminum nanopowders in the United States ” ( SDSMT 2001 ) , however , private companies like Argonide and Technanogy were also known to have such capabilities .
Among an interesting group of contractors that NSWC - IH hired in 1999 were SAIC , Applied Ordnance , Battelle , Booz Allen Hamilton , Mantech , Titan , Pacific Scientific Energetic ( see below ) , and R Stresau Laboratories for “ demolition materials ” ( NSWC 2000 ) .
A tragic coincidence left William Caswell , an employee of NSWC - IH , dead on the plane said to have hit the Pentagon ( Flight 77 ) .
He had for many years worked on “ deep - black ” projects at NSWC - IH ( Leaf 2007 ) .
The presence of Pacific Scientific Energetics ( PSE ) in this list of 1999 NSWC - IH contractors is interesting because PSE was the parent company of Special Devices , Inc ( SDI ) .
SDI specializes in explosives for defense , aerospace and mining applications , and was acquired in 1998 by John Lehman , 9/11 Commissioner , member of the Project for a New American Century , and former Secretary of the Navy ( SDI 2008 ) .
Lehman divested in 2001 .
With this in mind , it is worthwhile to reiterate that nano - thermite materials were very likely used in the deceptive demolition of the WTC buildings , but most certainly played only a part in the plan .
However , other high - tech explosives were available to those who had access to nano - thermite materials at the time .
Like SDI , several other organizations with links to military , space and intelligence programs ( e.g. In - Q - Tel , Orbital Science ) have access to many types of high - tech explosives to cut high - strength bolts and produce pyrotechnic events ( Goldstein 2006 ) .
These organizations also have connections to those who could have accessed the buildings , like WTC tenant Marsh & McLennan and former NASA administrator and Securacom director , James Abrahamson .
In any case , it is important for those seeking the truth about 9/11 to consider what organizations and people had access to the technologies that were used to accomplish the deceptive demolition of the WTC buildings .
It is also important to recognize the links between those who had access to the technologies , those who had access to the buildings , and those who produced the clearly false official reports .
To that end we should note that NIST had considerable connections to nano - thermites , both before and during the WTC investigation .
It is therefore inexplicable why NIST did not consider such materials as an explanation for the fires that burned on 9/11 , and long afterward at Ground Zero .
This fact would not be inexplicable , of course , if those managing the NIST investigation knew to not look , or test , for such materials .
